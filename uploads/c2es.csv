Our grid is not. - Utility Dive,"Robert Walton, Katherine Hamilton, Ethan Howland, Isaac Brown",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/thermal-batteries-electricity-markets/804966/,"Thermal batteries can lower costs and strengthen the grid Today’s grid is strained by aging infrastructure, long generation queues and inflexible loads from data centers and industry.

With fair rules, thermal batteries can help stabilize the grid, lower system costs and strengthen America’s manufacturing base and AI infrastructure.","Katherine Hamilton is the interim executive director and Isaac Brown is the incoming executive director of the Thermal Battery Alliance.

America’s electric grid wasn’t designed for what’s coming. Projections show electricity demand growing at an unprecedented pace, driven especially by surging data center and artificial intelligence loads — data center demand alone could more than double over the next decade.

This puts our energy system at an inflection point. Without key reforms at the state and federal level, brownouts and grid strain could become more common, impacting everything from homes to factories.

But with the right policies, new, flexible technologies like thermal batteries could help us meet this moment, making energy more affordable and reliable for everyone on the grid.

Right now, most industrial users draw electricity as they need it, creating spikes in demand that stress aging infrastructure. It’s a one-way system in which factories consume power and the grid struggles to keep up. In the residential sector, home batteries have already changed that equation, storing electricity during off-peak hours and using that energy when demand is high. Thermal energy storage brings that same flexibility to industry.

Imagine a typical stretch of the Midwest, where data centers are adding new loads the size of entire cities. Nearby, a large food processing factory is exploring traditional options to electrify, which typically draw electricity at all hours, regardless of grid conditions. Instead, it installs thermal batteries that charge flexibly when electricity is cheap and deliver reliable, cost-effective industrial heat.

The result: lower operating costs, expanded factory operations and no contribution to grid peaks. By charging only when demand is low, the plant makes better use of existing grid infrastructure and helps grid operators manage growing load volatility. It’s a win-win: We can power American manufacturing and improve grid reliability.

But to unlock these benefits at scale, we need to modernize the rules of the road for U.S. electricity markets.

Thermal batteries can lower costs and strengthen the grid

Today’s grid is strained by aging infrastructure, long generation queues and inflexible loads from data centers and industry. Electricity demand is expected to grow more than 2% annually over the next decade, and data centers alone could consume 6% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028, up from about 4% in 2023, according to the Department of Energy.

Thermal batteries offer a paradigm shift: they charge quickly and flexibly, consuming electricity only about one-third of the time while delivering dispatchable, 24/7 industrial heat. By drawing power when it is cheapest and least valuable to the grid and storing it for very long durations, they cut costs and stabilize supply.

For manufacturers, thermal batteries are a drop-in solution that unlock abundant, low-cost energy, boosting competitiveness and securing long-term energy supply.

For grid operators, they electrify large industrial heating loads without raising demand peaks, making better use of existing infrastructure and avoiding costly new transmission or generation buildout.

The result? A more efficient and resilient system with lower energy bills for everyone.

Modernizing legacy electricity rules

U.S. electricity markets were built around static loads. A few common-sense updates would unlock the benefits of flexible technologies, cut costs and strengthen the grid.

Electricity market access

Traditional batteries can buy power at wholesale rates, but thermal batteries that sell heat to industry cannot.

Instead, they pay retail rates that ignore time and location, precluding thermal batteries from economically charging when it’s valuable to the grid. This leaves U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage, shutting them out from accessing the gigawatts of cheap power that are at their doorstep.

State regulators can fix this by approving tariff structures that pass through wholesale electricity costs, while Congress can clarify that purchase of electric energy for thermal or electric energy resale qualifies as a wholesale transaction under the Federal Power Act.

Grid fees and interconnection rules

Transmission and distribution rules and fees are too often designed around outdated assumptions and inflexible loads. These fees are often fixed or poorly differentiated, ignoring the unique ability of thermal batteries to charge when the grid has excess capacity.

For thermal batteries to make better use of existing infrastructure and lower costs across the system, these charges should reflect actual system costs caused by new projects.

Grid congestion already costs Americans more than $20 billion per year in higher wholesale power prices. Flexible technologies like thermal storage could help reduce these costs by using existing infrastructure more efficiently.

When thermal batteries compete, ratepayers and U.S. industry win

Thermal batteries are being deployed today. Unfortunately, outdated electricity market rules in some places can hold them back, resulting in inefficient markets and higher costs for everyone.

A bold but achievable electricity market reform agenda that exposes thermal batteries to real-time market signals would help the U.S. realize the full value of this homegrown innovation.

With fair rules, thermal batteries can help stabilize the grid, lower system costs and strengthen America’s manufacturing base and AI infrastructure. Doing so would unleash some of the most powerful tools available to our grid while driving down energy costs for industry and households alike.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/BTGpijEDQ66bbILKYLCa-My1t6JNLk6Aq9zt2jWRADw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9kYXRhX2NlbnRlcl9zdG9jay5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-15 14:00:14.406809

It is not tax, legal, financial, or accounting advice.

For telehealth entrepreneurs, behavioral health clinicians, and other busy professionals, the end of 2025 presents a timely opportunity to explore potential tax credits. Although I am not an accountant, I reviewed IRS resources and widely recognized legal and financial summaries to help you consider which credits to discuss with your accountant or tax attorney. Because tax credits reduce tax owed dollar-for-dollar, even a brief planning conversation could materially change your 2025 tax picture.

This article highlights several categories of credits you may want to explore with qualified tax counsel before December 31, 2025.

What Tax Credits Mean for Clinicians and Practice Owners

Tax credits differ from deductions: credits reduce taxes owed directly, while deductions reduce taxable income. Many business credits fall under the General Business Credit rules (IRS Form 3800), meaning eligibility, documentation, and timing interact in complex ways.

For telehealth practices, counseling groups, and small professional corporations, credits often relate to:

Hiring

Retirement-plan adoption

Technology investment

Innovation or software development

Clean-energy and infrastructure upgrades

Key Business Tax Credits to Explore in 2025

Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)

The Work Opportunity Tax Credit is available for employees who begin work on or before December 31, 2025. Employers hiring individuals from certain IRS-designated “target groups” (for example, qualifying veterans, SNAP recipients, or long-term unemployment recipients) may be eligible for a credit of up to 40% of first-year wages for individuals who work 400 hours or more.

IRS resources:

The credit is claimed on Form 8881 and is separate from deductions for employer contributions.

Employer-Provided Childcare and Related Credits

Beginning in 2026, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act adjusts several employer-related childcare incentives. Although most enhancements take effect in future years, practice owners considering on-site or contracted childcare services may want to discuss with their advisors whether beginning planning or vendor relationships in 2025 could position them for future credits.

This type of benefit may also support staff recruitment and retention in telehealth practices.

Research and Development (R&D) Credit

Clinicians or practices investing in telehealth-specific software, workflow automation, or digital clinical-decision tools may qualify for the federal R&D credit. Certain qualifying small businesses can apply the credit to payroll taxes, subject to IRS limits.

Powers, D.C, Megawatt Daily",,,,,https://www.enr.com/articles/62219-power-sector-debates-new-federal-rules-for-data-center-large-load-links-to-grid,"But they caution that while tech firms would pay, more capital-intensive manufacturing customers with large loads may not be able to absorb high interconnection costs up front.
It is ""fundamental to ensuring the U.S. can reliably power data centers, AI innovation and advanced manufacturing,” the trade group said, claiming the current patchwork of state rules governing large load interconnections add uncertainty and delay to investments.
“This approach preserves a standardized accelerated federal pathway for data centers facing state-level delays, without penalizing new manufacturing projects locating in states that actively support industrial growth.""
The Federal Power Act is designed to protect customers from excessive rates and charges, they noted.
“If states do not allow these new large loads to take flexible end-use service or delay building power plants to meet the demand of the interconnected large loads, all of this effort could be for naught,"" said R Street Institute.","Given marching orders by a Trump administration cabinet department as key to artificial intelligence sector growth, independent agency Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) now is pushing to absorb nearly 200 diverse power sector comments to finalize by next April 30 a rule that would extend FERC's role in how data centers and other large power loads over 20 MW will connect to transmission grids—a long-held state regulatory arena.

The controversial mandate, which U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright directed FERC to develop and implement, comes as AI hyperscalers want expedited data center power connections while states and utilities worry about grid overload, reliability and ratepayer cost hikes and want more time for added impact analysis.

“While many FERC rulemakings take years to finalize —especially those dealing with contentious or complicated jurisdictional issues—the agency has about six months to take final action on the ... proposal,” says R Street Institute, a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank focused on public policy issues.

But U.S. data centers drove a 22% increase in electricity demand in 2025, set to triple by 2030, making them one of the largest sources of load growth, studies say.. With the power demand surge—the highest in two decades—also driven by rapid growth of large industrial energy users, “it has become necessary to standardize interconnection procedures and agreements for such loads,"" the Energy Dept. said.

Insufficient power supply also is leading to a decline in government and business investment in long-term assets that ""means lower economic growth in the long run"" for rich countries as well as developing ones, said Bloomberg Economics in a new study.

The FERC rule, proposed in late October, is set to address issues such as how to get needed infrastructure online quickly and how power will be paid for. While the Federal Power Act gives states jurisdiction over retail load grid connections regardless of size, the federal view is that linking a large load, which can extend to 300 MW for a data center, to the U.S. transmission system “falls squarely within” FERC jurisdiction under law even though the agency has not historically exercised it.

The proposal aims not to challenge state authority over local power distribution and generation siting, but commenters and others point to gray areas—and Wright has said new federal jurisdiction is in the public interest—claiming that administration priorities for American AI dominance over China and revitalized domestic manufacturing require an unprecedented amount of power and substantial investment in interstate transmission.

FERC uses a 100% participant funding model that would require large load customers to pay the full cost of grid network upgrades to expedite projects, according to a proposal analyis by think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies' Energy Security and Climate Change Program. It said U.S. data centers drove a 22% power demand hike in 2025, set to triple by 2030, making them one of the largest sources of load growth.

""This policy marks a sharp departure from the traditional socialized model, in which transmission upgrades are treated as shared infrastructure and recovered through regional transmission rates,"" authors say. But they caution that while tech firms would pay, more capital-intensive manufacturing customers with large loads may not be able to absorb high interconnection costs up front.

Respondent Pros and Cons

Among the commenters, the Data Center Coalition, which represents major tech firm and other owners and operators of the facilities, said the rulemaking will directly affect sector ability to plan, invest and interconnect critical digital infrastructure in a timely, predictable and cost-effective manner. It is ""fundamental to ensuring the U.S. can reliably power data centers, AI innovation and advanced manufacturing,” the trade group said, claiming the current patchwork of state rules governing large load interconnections add uncertainty and delay to investments.

The Steel Manufacturers Association is concerned about the required 100% transmission upgrade payment. “While data centers may be able to absorb these costs without rendering their projects uneconomic, new electric arc furnace steel mills almost certainly cannot,” the group said, proposing instead that new loads remain under state authority. “This approach preserves a standardized accelerated federal pathway for data centers facing state-level delays, without penalizing new manufacturing projects locating in states that actively support industrial growth.""

A coalition of industrial energy customers urged FERC to guard the ""cost-causation principle,"" which assigns costs to those who cause the costs, while beneficiaries are assigned costs according to their use or benefit. Issues include demand for new generation and transmission infrastructure without time to plan, permit and build resources. “The power sector must now grapple with the implications of speed-to-market as a cost driver and planning constraint ... without undermining reliability, affordability or access for any sector,” the groups said. The Federal Power Act is designed to protect customers from excessive rates and charges, they noted.

The National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, which represents ratepayers, termed FERC's proposed new jurisdiction an “unprecedented expansion” into the supply market, without enough detail. Reliable and affordable service must be “loadstars” that guide FERC as it considers reforms.

American Transmission Co., a Wisconsin for-profit transmission company, noted that many new AI data centers represent gigawatts of load and are electrically equivalent in size to adding a substantial city to the current grid. This “new breed” of data centers often have extreme operating variability and need to ramp load up and down by hundreds of megawatts on a second-to-second basis. “This is equivalent to turning Wisconsin’s capital city of Madison on and off, repeatedly,” the firm said, requiring specialty power electronic devices at mega-scale to safely integrate the variable load.

FERC’s 2011 Order 1000 requiring competitive bidding for transmission projects adds 18 to 24 months to new construction completion. “This was an inconvenience in the past, but it is a catastrophe in the race for AI dominance,” American Transmission said. The delays are incompatible with timelines to bring new data centers online, it noted, adding that the federal NEPA environmental review process also needs substantial changes to expedite projects.

Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, said it seeks a 100-MW minimum threshold for large load customers to pay for use of the transmission system to avoid shifting costs to large customers not meant to be captured by the federal reforms. Interconnection service for large load retail end-use customers is regulated by states under existing regulations, and FERC must recognize that those customers use local distribution service, the group said.

Also it said transmission reliability studies must be conducted if existing power plants would be used to serve large loads, since removal of generation off the grid ""to serve a new large load raises significant reliability and affordability concerns,” the institute said. FERC ""must grapple with this reality"" and consider other steps to ensure that ""necessary incremental generation resources are available to address any resource adequacy.”

A group of southern U.S.-based environmental advocacy group said FERC could have jurisdiction over some aspects of large load connections, which would set a nationwide floor of protection against sudden cost shifts while states retain full authority to regulate retail customers. But they urged the commission to resolve ""many conflicting interests from all sectors of the industry,"" in the new approach, rather than ""rush to meet an unreasonable deadline for final action.“

MISO, the large multi-state Midwest transmission operator, said pursuing a federal one-size-fits-all approach could not only risk delaying the addition of large loads but also frustrate the discovery of new and innovative solutions “Best practices need time to be discovered and tested,” it said.

Microsoft told FERC that timely access to electric power has been and continues to be the biggest iindustry-wide obstacle to U.S. deployment of advanced computing technology. The tech giant builds, owns and operates more than 400 data centers in North America and other regions, and said it is in discussions with national, state and local stakeholders to support responsible growth.

Studying load and generation together has potential to speed up the interconnection process and reduce the scale and cost of grid system upgrades, the company explained. The rulemaking can aid collaboration among state and federal regulators to develop a nondiscriminatory framework for large load connection with user transparency, efficiencies, lower costs and enhanced regulatory certainty, Microsoft said.

“If states do not allow these new large loads to take flexible end-use service or delay building power plants to meet the demand of the interconnected large loads, all of this effort could be for naught,"" said R Street Institute. ""FERC has limited time to gather a record to craft and support any action, raising the prospect that detractors could argue [in lawsuits] that the final action is legally infirm.""

AI Regulation Issues Ahead

Even before the FERC large load rule completes, a 230-member environmental group coalition wants Congress to enact a data center moratorium to enable more study of risks in power and water supply, among other issues.

“The sudden explosion of the Big Data industry represents an existential threat for communities ill-equipped to handle the massive environmental and economic hardships these data centers inflict,” Wenonah Hunter, executive director of Food & Water Watch and other group officials told Congress in a Dec. 8 letter. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, instead urged groups to ""call for an ... energy plan that allows for the construction of renewables.” House Democrats Greg Landsman of Ohio and Don Beyer of Virginia on Dec. 9 introduced more narrow legislation to require FERC recommendations to avoid residential energy rate hikes in areas with data centers.

Also industry participants and observers are watching how FERC will rule in a dispute between utilities and independent power producers over major grid operator PJM Interconnection's approach for colocating large loads at power plants. The agency posted last week that a decision is on its Dec. 18 open meeting agenda. PJM has urged the agency to hold that action in light of the pending large-load rule, but one energy research group speculates that the meeting listing ""suggests a positive outcome for nuclear and gas plant owners hoping to contract with data centers behind-the-meter and avoid paying full grid charges,” said a Dec. 12 report in Utility Dive.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/12/14/DATACENTER-AMAZONDCs-colocated-SusquehannaNuke.jpg?height=635&t=1765735354&width=1200,N,,2025-12-15 14:00:20.050885

AI data center proposals have continued to surge across Indiana and utilities have sought to capitalize off the proposals by introducing new gas plant projects or delaying coal plant closures to power these data centers, thereby raising energy costs for customers. Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) estimates that Big Tech’s data centers could more than double the need for power in its service territory, and by 2030, just a handful of I&M’s service area could use more electricity than all 6.8 million Hoosiers use in their homes combined.

Organizations signing the letter include Faith in Place, Earth Charter Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council, Indiana Environmental Clean Energy J40, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, League of Conservation Voters, Public Citizen, and the Sierra Club.

Megan Anderson, Senior Campaign Representative, Sierra Club:

“As Big Tech continues to introduce energy-hungry AI data centers in our communities, we need their leadership to course correct to make good on their climate commitments by using their dollars to build renewable energy and infrastructure that makes our electric grid more efficient and resilient. Plans to build out more fossil fuel power for these AI data centers not only betrays their own company values, but puts Hoosiers in the position to foot the bill. Our local leaders and Big Tech leaders need to be loud and clear: Hoosier families and small businesses shouldn’t be forced to subsidize the energy needs of Big Tech through higher energy bills and Big Tech shouldn’t be increasing pollution in Indiana communities.”

Shannon Anderson, Director of Advocacy, Earth Charter Indiana:

“Meeting the existential threat of climate with significant action was already going to be the fight of our lives. The rapid, unchecked development of hyper-scale data centers powered largely by natural gas obliterates our hopes of achieving near net zero emissions by mid century, a commitment these companies and several of our Hoosier cities have made to our children. It’s not just wrong, it’s cruel to abandon our kids this way.”

Sam Carpenter, Executive Director, Hoosier Environmental Council:

“Hoosier Environmental Council calls on the tech industry to focus on sustainability, affordable electric bills for Hoosiers, and transparency as they seek sites for AI data centers.

From the beginning, the Bracewells understood that for their firm to succeed they must maintain a relentless focus on professional excellence. As they dreamed of building a larger firm, they also understood that the firm’s roots must be deeply embedded in a culture emphasizing personal relationships and teamwork. Finally, based on J. S. Bracewell’s great success as a statewide and community leader before the war, the Bracewells believed that a commitment to public and community service should be a key component of their firm. More than seventy years later, this commitment to professional excellence, to personal relationships and teamwork, and to public and community service remain the cornerstones of our partnership.

Born in the Courtroom. Our reputation for professional excellence began in the courtroom. J. S. Bracewell was well known as a fierce and relentless litigator, and the post-war era saw the firm assume and extend that reputation. From that beginning, our reputation for professional excellence grew from insurance defense to labor, tax, condemnation and business litigation. In the 1960s and early 1970s, as the growing Texas economy began to attract business enterprises from all over the world, as well as financing from money center banks, our litigation practice evolved to the representation of stakeholders in large-scale commercial disputes.

Development of our Business Practice. As the energy and financial services sectors grew dramatically in Texas in the 1970s, the firm’s reputation for professional excellence attracted clients focused on transactional and commercial matters. This inspired firm leaders to significantly expand the firm’s transactional practice, and in the mid-1970s the firm began adding like-minded partners focused on corporate transactions and bank finance. Our firm’s reputation in the courtroom was soon matched by our growing reputation for handling major M&A transactions and financings.",https://natlawreview.com/themes/custom/nlr_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-15 14:00:40.433215

It’s been a rocky comeback for the electric-vehicle maker, whose shares have more than doubled since they hit a low in early April amid a wider market meltdown sparked by President Donald Trump’s tariff offensive. The stock was trading as high as $481.37 in early trading in New York. If the gains hold through the end of regular session, the stock will close at a new all-time high. Its last closing record was $479.86 on Dec. 17 last year.

“Investors would do well to remember that while having a robust underlying business still has a role to play, that’s not the main driving force,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Tesla shares are trading as much on sentiment as they are on fundamentals, and the core business is playing second fiddle to the AI story that underpins the trillion-dollar valuation.”

Tesla’s third-quarter results, released in October, disappointed investors as rising costs undermined a record quarter for vehicle sales. That surge in sales was driven by consumers rushing in to buy electric cars before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired at the end of September.

Those record sales masked a more challenging outlook for the EV maker. Tesla’s fundamentals have weakened rapidly this year, with sales struggling globally, profit estimates sinking and regulatory scrutiny rising.

Analysts now expect sales to slow significantly in subsequent periods. Industry leaders have echoed this prediction: Ford CEO Jim Farley said that EVs will plunge from about 10% to about 5% of the US market as Trump’s policies favor gas-powered cars. Famed investor Michael Burry, meanwhile, criticized the stock for being “overvalued” in a Substack post earlier this month.

Elon Musk’s political antics earlier this year had sparked fears that his interest in running the carmaker may be waning, and the company’s attempt to stoke sales by offering cheaper models of its popular vehicles were met with skepticism. Such concerns, paired with Trump’s tariffs and Musk’s public break from the president, weighed on the stock, which by April was down as much as 50% from the December high.

Since then, Tesla shares have staged a spectacular turnaround, marking yet another example of Musk’s ability to drive investor sentiment. In a move some view as visionary and others consider a distraction from the core business, Musk aspires to reorient his electric-vehicle maker as a robotics and AI powerhouse.

The pivot came just as AI fervor took over the market, pushing stocks spanning old-hat tech giant Alphabet Inc. and dark horse Oracle Corp. to new highs. Those who believe in Musk’s promises to change the world will have another opportunity to bet on his genius as SpaceX intends to go public next year.

For now, traders are buying what Musk is selling and growing bullish on Tesla’s AI efforts. In November, Tesla investors signaled their faith in Musk’s vision, wishing for him to remain in the driving seat when they approved a trillion-dollar pay package for the CEO.

The company has also received several upgrades and price target boosts based on its potential to dominate the automation space. Tesla’s street high price target sits at $600, after Wedbush’s Dan Ives increased it from $500 on Sept. 26, saying the company may be a “game changer” in AI.

“Tesla remains a retail investors’ darling and, in my view, an example of irrational exuberance in an already overheated equity market,” said Irene Tunkel, chief US equity strategist at BCA Research. “To my mind, Tesla is in bubble territory.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/15/PDTN/87777424007-teslabg-xzj-2-ygutcnhfhdjlr-3-dbgmqtza.jpg?crop=3999,2250,x0,y208&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-15 14:00:44.872291

Troy Balderson’s Reliable Power Act, a bill that would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to conduct a top to bottom review of all regulations that may impinge on the reliable operation of the nation’s bulk-power system.

Introduced by the Ohio Republican in May, the bill now has 20 co-sponsors, all of them members of the House Republican conference.

The bill was advanced out of committee in June and has been awaiting consideration by the full House since then.

On Monday House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., announced the chamber would finally take up the measure this week along with two other energy-related measures.

The first of these, H.R. 4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, sponsored by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., would streamline the environmental review process for energy projects and dramatically trim their permitting timelines.

The other measure, H.R. 3632, the Power Plant Reliability Act, introduced by Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., would expand utilities’ ability to contest the proposed closures of power plants “if closure could impact electric reliability and affordability.”

Balderson’s bill directs the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, otherwise known as NERC, to conduct annual long-term assessments of the reliability of electric power in the bulk-power system.

It also establishes a process for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, known as FERC, to review federal regulations before they are finalized if the electric reliability organization finds that the system is at risk of not having sufficient electric generation to maintain reliability.

If the electric reliability organization finds that the system does not have sufficient generation to maintain reliability, it must notify FERC that the bulk-power system is in a state of generation inadequacy.

FERC must then notify the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and any other appropriate federal agencies of the generation inadequacy.

Upon receiving the notice, the federal agency must provide proposed regulations that affect any generation resource in the bulk-power system to FERC for review and comment.

If applicable, FERC must provide recommendations to modify the regulations.

Federal agencies may not finalize such a regulation until FERC finds that it will not be likely to have a significant negative impact on the ability of the bulk-power system to supply sufficient electric energy necessary to maintain an adequate level of reliability.

Speaking before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in June, Balderson said the panel’s decision to advance his bill marked a “major step toward strengthening the reliability of our electric grid and ensuring long-term accountability from regulatory agencies in Washington.”

This growth rate is almost double the average for the wider global economy.

The IEA's World Energy Employment 2025 report tracks employment trends and skilled labour shortages across the sector.

The report is the fourth edition in the IEA’s series and analyses the evolution of skilled labour requirements since the inaugural report in 2022.

Its data is compiled from the Energy Employment Survey which gathers insights from more than 700 energy companies, trade unions and educational bodies.

The analysis reveals the energy sector has added more than 1.6 million skilled trade positions since 2015.

Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, says: “Energy has been one of the strongest and most consistent engines of job creation in the global economy during a period marked by significant uncertainties.

“But this momentum cannot be taken for granted. The world’s ability to build the energy infrastructure it needs depends on having enough skilled workers in place.

“Governments, industry and training institutions must come together to close the labour and skills gap. Left unaddressed, these shortages could slow progress raise costs and weaken energy security.”

Electrification and changing employment patterns

The electricity sector has experienced a significant expansion, adding 3.9 million jobs since 2020.

This accounts for nearly three quarters of all new employment in the energy industry.

For the first time, the electricity sector, which includes generation, transmission, distribution and storage, is now the largest energy employer, surpassing fuel supply.

This global move towards electrification is reshaping the nature of employment.

The report highlights continued growth in vehicle manufacturing employment caused by a rise of almost 800,000 jobs related to electric vehicles (EVs) in 2024.

In China for example, the IEA found that nearly 40% of all vehicle manufacturing roles are now associated with EVs and their batteries.

This expansion is accommodated by workers retraining and transitioning into new roles, as well as the creation of new positions in areas such as battery manufacturing and electric equipment installation.

Supply and demand for a skilled workforce

The World Energy Employment report indicates that hiring bottlenecks present a critical challenge, with more than half of the firms and unions surveyed reporting them.

Shortages are particularly pronounced in applied technical roles, which constitute more than half of the energy workforce.

The roles in shortest supply include electricians, pipefitters, electrical power-line workers and engineers.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/4c4c3652297eebed86b10487464185ef:d7db8134f59cff28d28853df63b33417/wee.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 13:59:43.587758

After graduating from high school, I took a gap year to serve as the state president for Washington FFA.
After my graduation on Dec. 18, I’m moving to Washington, D.C., to pursue a career in agricultural policy and communications.
If it weren’t for Texas A&M, I don’t think I’d be taking this step in my career.
No matter where I end up, I’ll always be thankful for my time at Texas A&M and the mark this place has left on my heart.","The word “home” means different things to everyone. For some, it’s the house they grew up in or a person who shaped their fondest memories. For others, it’s more of a feeling than a person or place.

Cole Baerlocher ’26 has called several places home. For the first 20 years of his life, it was Colfax, Washington. In a few weeks, home will become Washington, D.C.

But for the past three years, home has been College Station.

Baerlocher talked with us about his upbringing in agriculture, serving as the National FFA president, moving over 2,000 miles away from his hometown to become an Aggie and what’s next for him in Washington, D.C.

Most importantly, he discussed how the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences has been his home away from home and how it changed the trajectory of his life.

Tell us about yourself.

I grew up in a small rural community in Washington and was involved with my grandparents’ wheat and cattle operation from a young age. I have fond memories of riding combines and checking cows with my grandpa – I think that’s where my love for agriculture began.

After graduating from high school, I took a gap year to serve as the state president for Washington FFA. Following that year of service, I ran for national FFA office and was selected as president. Those experiences really shaped me as a person and allowed me to give back to others.

Why did you choose to attend Texas A&M University?

During my year as a national officer, I took a three-day trip to College Station and immediately fell in love with Texas A&M. On the flight back to the National FFA headquarters in Indianapolis, I remember feeling sad, like I was leaving a home.

I knew I wanted to be an Aggie, so I applied and was accepted into the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communications. Coming to Texas A&M was the best decision I ever made, and it has impacted the trajectory of my life in so many ways.

How did your time as a national officer help your transition to Texas A&M?

I had the opportunity to connect with people from all walks of life as a national officer. At the beginning of my year of service, I set a goal for myself: be the kind of person who can build relationships with anyone and meet them exactly where they’re at.

It didn’t take long to realize that’s what it means to be an Aggie, too. Community has always been important to me, and the community at Texas A&M is unlike any other.

Aggies make sure nobody is left behind; that’s why we have traditions like Muster, Silver Taps and Bonfire Memorial. That’s why my professors and peers in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences know me by name and make time to have genuine conversations.

The qualities I wanted to emulate as a national officer are the same qualities I met with when I came to Texas A&M; that’s how I knew I was in the right place.

What was your involvement like on campus?

I got involved at Texas A&M right away. I was so excited to be a student here and didn’t want to take any opportunity for granted.

For me, that was getting involved with Aggie ACHIEVEMates, joining a student government committee, serving as a Muster host and being a Fish Camp counselor. I had several student worker jobs throughout college, including working with Texas A&M AgriLife Marketing and Communications and the Board of Regents. I participated in all the Aggie traditions and tried to treasure every second spent on campus.

What makes the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences unique?

The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences has truly become a family for me. Not a day goes by that I don’t run into a friend from the College on campus and have a meaningful conversation with them.

We have the greatest faculty, staff and students in the world, and I love how there’s such an emphasis on excellence. My classes and activities have prepared me to excel when I step into the workforce. The academic rigor and thriving community at Texas A&M are unmatched, and I’m so grateful to be part of it.

What advice would you give incoming students?

My best advice is to put yourself out there: go out for that organization, apply for that club and make friends with people you don’t think you have anything in common with. That’s where the most learning and growing will take place. You’ll get accepted to some opportunities and rejected from others, but it’s important to be just as grateful for both. The “noes” have shaped me just as much as the “yeses.”

What’s next for you?

After my graduation on Dec. 18, I’m moving to Washington, D.C., to pursue a career in agricultural policy and communications. I was fortunate to participate in the Agricultural and Natural Resources Policy Internship Program, which laid the foundation for my love of policy and appreciation for the culture in Washington, D.C.

Overall, every experience I’ve had during college has prepared me for this transition. If it weren’t for Texas A&M, I don’t think I’d be taking this step in my career. I love knowing I’ll have a network of fellow Aggies cheering me on, even after I move away from College Station. That alone is a testament to the culture of caring we have here.

No matter where I end up, I’ll always be thankful for my time at Texas A&M and the mark this place has left on my heart.",https://media.agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2025/12/20251211_Cole_Baerlocher_HH-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 14:00:49.768148

Mexico once again has fallen short on its treaty commitment to share Rio Grande water with the United States.
IBWC data from the Rio Grande now feeds into the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Clean Rivers Program.
This part of the Rio Grande below the Amistad Reservoir, known as segment 2304, exceeds Texas standards for bacteria.
Cann referenced the Lower Rio Grande Water Quality Initiative as one example of the agency’s efforts to improve water management.","Nuevo Laredo was dumping millions of gallons of sewage a day into the Rio Grande. The U.S. and Mexico worked together to find a solution.

NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico — Silvia Fernández Gallardo Boone leaned over a stream of water rushing through a concrete chute at the city’s wastewater treatment plant.

“Smell it!” she said, beaming.

Odorless, treated wastewater flowed into the Coyote Arroyo, or creek, then the Rio Grande. Mere months earlier, more than 12 million gallons of raw sewage were leaking every day into the river and groundwater in Nuevo Laredo. After repairs to the treatment plant, to Fernández Gallardo’s delight, the flow of untreated wastewater has been significantly reduced.

“Being on the border, we really live our lives on both sides of the river,” Fernández Gallardo said, looking out at the treatment plant. “We all have a stake in taking care of the river.”

When Carmen Lilia Canturosas was elected mayor of Nuevo Laredo in 2021, deferred maintenance had debilitated the plant. To make matters worse, broken sewer lines were leaking wastewater onto city streets. Canturosas, re-elected in 2024, threw her support behind overhauling Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater and sewer system.

Fernández Gallardo, an architect by training, was appointed general manager of the Potable Water and Sanitation Commission (Comisión de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado), known by its Spanish acronym COMAPA. In 2023, COMAPA broke ground on an $80 million project, backed by U.S. and Mexican institutions, to repair the failing wastewater treatment plant and damaged sewer lines. The North American Development Bank (NADBank) issued the largest grant for wastewater improvements in its 30-year history.

Shared waterways like the Rio Grande have been sites of cooperation between the two countries, but also points of contention. Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater overhaul is the latest bet that the U.S. and Mexico can work together to improve water quality and the environment.

But the project is reaching fruition as tensions mount between the U.S. and Mexico under the second Trump presidency. Mexico once again has fallen short on its treaty commitment to share Rio Grande water with the United States. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariff demands have cast a shadow over trade hubs like Laredo-Nuevo Laredo.

Far from the policy disputes of Washington, D.C., officials like Fernández Gallardo are still counting on binational collaboration to yield tangible benefits for local residents.

“Rehabilitating the Rio Bravo doesn’t just mean improving local environmental conditions,” she wrote in a statement to Inside Climate News, using the Mexican name for the river. “It also represents an opportunity to move toward shared water security between Mexico and the United States.”

Monitoring water quality

The day before Fernández Gallardo toured the plant, Martin Castro and Tom Vaughan were on the other side of the border, knee deep in the Rio Grande. Four Border Patrol officers peered out from an outcropping above the river and asked what they were doing.

Castro, watershed science director at the Rio Grande International Study Center, and Vaughan, a center co-founder and emeritus biology professor at Texas A&M International University in Laredo, calmly explained that they were taking water quality samples. A few minutes later, the officers left.

The pair were collecting samples to contribute to an extensive database on the river’s water quality, as they do every month.

On that late October day, Border Patrol and National Guard troops far outnumbered fishermen and other recreational visitors to the Rio Grande. It’s not only the law enforcement presence that makes environmental protection on the Rio Grande unique.

As an international river, the Rio Grande was initially excluded from the Texas Clean Rivers Program. The collaborative effort monitors and protects the state’s water resources. Vaughan was among those who advocated in the 1990s for the Rio Grande to be included.

The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), a federal agency that enforces the border and water agreements, eventually took over water quality monitoring on the river. IBWC data from the Rio Grande now feeds into the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Clean Rivers Program.

For more than 1,200 miles, the Rio Grande snakes between Texas and Mexico, crossing remote deserts and urban areas before reaching its delta at the Gulf of Mexico. IBWC partners with organizations like the Rio Grande study center to collect water samples at 119 stations. Monitoring at eight stations in El Paso was suspended in 2023 because of border security installations. IBWC spokesperson Frank Fisher said sampling has been re-established at all but three sites.

Castro and Vaughan collected samples to send to a certified laboratory. They record other measurements themselves, such as turbidity using a Secchi disk.

“Upriver, I would swim in it,” Vaughan said, referring to the Rio Grande upstream of the bend in the river that wraps around Laredo. “If I was really thirsty, I might drink it.”

But he explained that sewage downstream of the city makes the water unsafe for swimming or other contact recreation. This part of the Rio Grande below the Amistad Reservoir, known as segment 2304, exceeds Texas standards for bacteria.

In this stretch of the river, the highest readings for E. coli, the indicator for bacteria, are downstream of Laredo and the wastewater discharges from Nuevo Laredo, according to IBWC’s 2024 Rio Grande summary report. At the Pipeline Crossing and El Cenizo sites, E. coli readings were 240,000 parts per 100 milliliters. That is nearly 2,000 times the state’s water quality standard of 126 parts.

The IBWC report warns of “serious health risks” and that the water is unsuitable for recreational activities or consumption. The report attributes the high bacteria levels to wastewater infrastructure allowing sewage to enter the river.

IBWC’s Fisher said bacteria levels are elevated in other parts of the river including in the urban areas of El Paso/Ciudad Juárez, Del Rio/Ciudad Acuña, Eagle Pass/Piedras Negras, and in Hidalgo County.

“TCEQ is committed to advancing collaboration among federal, state, and binational partners to improve water quality and resilience in the border region,” said Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesperson Victoria Cann.

Cann referenced the Lower Rio Grande Water Quality Initiative as one example of the agency’s efforts to improve water management. The initiative aims to “restore, protect and improve” water quality on the Lower Rio Grande downstream of Falcon Reservoir. The group recently completed an 18-month binational salinity study, according to Cann.

Cleaning up the Rio Grande

It’s one thing to collect data on the river’s water quality. It’s another to act on that data. For decades, the U.S. and Mexico have debated how to improve the environment and sanitation along their nearly 2,000-mile border.

The 1944 water treaty between the two countries entrusted border sanitation issues to the IBWC. As new problems cropped up — like sewage flowing downhill from Mexico into the U.S. — new agreements, known as minutes, were added to the treaty. In 1989, the U.S. and Mexico partnered to build a wastewater treatment plant in Nuevo Laredo.

After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was adopted in 1994, Nuevo Laredo and other border cities grew rapidly. Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater treatment plant opened in 1996. Binational wastewater treatment plants were also built in Tijuana, Baja California and Nogales, Arizona.

In a side agreement to NAFTA, the two countries created the NADBank, a binational development bank to fund infrastructure on the border.

Nuevo Laredo’s population has almost doubled since 1994, to nearly half a million people. Laredo, with about 260,000 people, is now the busiest land port for international trade in the United States.

But ongoing maintenance of wastewater infrastructure became a sticking point. By the time NAFTA was renegotiated in 2020 — and renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — border wastewater treatment plants were in urgent need of repairs. Sewage flowing from Tijuana into Southern California became an international dispute.

Colorado State University emeritus political scientist Stephen Mumme, an expert on U.S.-Mexico relations, partially attributes maintenance problems to the “constant churn” in Mexican politics, in which local administrations change every three years.

Mexican cities also struggle to finance long-term infrastructure projects and collect monthly bills from ratepayers. Sanitation competes with other urgent public works in border cities buckling under rapid growth.

“The capacity to engage in the type of financing and planning that is often taken for granted in American cities is not yet fully realized in Mexican cities, even in border cities,” Mumme said.

Jesús Frausto Ortega, coordinator of the water management graduate program at Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Monterrey, Mexico, said that previous efforts to stop the flow of sewage in Nuevo Laredo were like paving over a pothole.

“You could fix one part, but there was no holistic solution,” said Frausto Ortega, who previously worked in Nuevo Laredo.

He said Mexican cities often lack political will to invest in sanitation infrastructure.

“Traditionally, officials don’t invest in projects that are underground,” he said. “[That’s because] the public doesn’t see the project and we don’t have reliable accountability mechanisms.”

COMAPA’s Fernández Gallardo said she heard this sentiment from other public officials.

“Why would you want to invest in sewer lines?” she remembers them asking. “That’s like burying money.”

Binational investment

Fernández Gallardo and Canturosas, the mayor, persisted. They found support among U.S. officials, including then U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar and then IBWC Commissioner Maria-Elena Giner. NADBank provided an initial $650,000 grant to develop plans for the wastewater treatment plant and collapsed sewer lines.

Support started to pour in. NADBank committed $22 million from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Border Environment Infrastructure Fund. Mexican agencies, including COMAPA, committed another $53 million. The IBWC pitched in $2 million, and a commercial loan of $6 million rounded out the budget.

IBWC’s Fisher said the agency’s contribution came “as part of a long-standing practice to share the cost of extraordinary maintenance.” He said the funds were used to purchase six aerators needed for the biological process at the plant.

NADBank Managing Director John Beckham said that the significant commitments from both countries set the effort apart.

“Those are unique features of this project that are replicable,” he said. “We’re proud of it. We think it’s something that can help us in other parts of the river.”

Fernández Gallardo estimated in late October that the wastewater treatment plant’s rehabilitation was 80% complete. She said that sewage was still being discharged at 10 locations in the city, down from 27.

“You’re investing in a public good,” she said. “These are projects that you don’t see, but you feel the difference in the city.”

Fernández Gallardo acknowledged that COMAPA must prevent deferred maintenance from once again hobbling the plant. She said that going forward, 4% of funds from water bills will be designated for maintenance.

Beckham added: “[We have to] ensure that these plants can be maintained over time … To avoid cycles of every 25 years where we have to lay out $80 million.”

Martin Castro of the Rio Grande International Study Center said the upgrades are a “meaningful milestone.”

“They underscore how urgently the river needs sustained infrastructure investment,” he said. “Continued investment and binational cooperation are essential to protect water quality for both communities.”

Changing political, environmental climate

While Nuevo Laredo is making strides, extreme drought and climate change are testing the fragile balance on the binational river. The Rio Grande provides drinking water for over 6 million people in the United States and Mexico. Farmers from Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico rely on it to irrigate their crops.

But experts warn that current water consumption levels cannot be sustained. The Amistad Reservoir, upstream of Laredo, hit historic lows during July 2024. Climate change will further reduce the river’s flow.

A November 2025 study led by the World Wildlife Fund found that 52% of water consumption in the Rio Grande Basin is unsustainable, causing depletion of reservoirs, aquifers and river flows. American Rivers named the Lower Rio Grande the fifth most endangered river in the United States this year.

The Rio Grande is the only source of water for Nuevo Laredo and Laredo. But sometimes the river drops so low that the pumps at the water treatment plant struggle to draw in water, Fernández Gallardo said. She touted COMAPA’s purple pipe program, which diverts treated wastewater for outdoor irrigation and industrial use, but said more must be done to conserve and re-use water.

“Without the river, we don’t have the two Laredos,” she said.

Fernández Gallardo said she would like Nuevo Laredo to directly re-use treated wastewater for domestic supply, known as direct potable reuse.

“Treated wastewater is the only water resource whose supply will always go up as the population increases,” she wrote in a statement. “[Direct reuse] would redefine the future of water on the border.”

Another Rio Grande city, El Paso, is rolling out this technology. But Fernández Gallardo knows the municipal administration’s time to execute projects is running out.

Escalating tensions between the United States and Mexico are felt locally. While Mexico increased Rio Grande water deliveries to the United States in the past year, the Trump administration has threatened Mexico with additional tariffs and even sanctions if the nation does not deliver more to Texas. Meanwhile, Mexican officials have attributed the shortfall to the ongoing drought.

The Trump administration quickly replaced several of the U.S. officials essential to the Nuevo Laredo project, including Salazar, the ambassador, and Giner, the well-liked IBWC commissioner.

The Trump administration is also moving forward with plans for a border wall through Laredo, which local organizations, including the Rio Grande International Study Center, oppose.

Water quality woes on the Rio Grande have attracted little national attention. But EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has pressured Mexico to stop the sewage flows from Tijuana. The EPA has struck agreements with Mexico to accelerate the timeline to repair the Tijuana treatment plant.

A State Department spokesperson said that the U.S. and Mexico have “launched a new era of cooperation characterized by swift and decisive actions.”

“No other bilateral relationship has a greater effect on the daily lives of the American people and President Trump and his cabinet are committed to improving the welfare, health, and prosperity of our border communities,” the spokesperson said.

The EPA also funds NADBank’s grants for wastewater infrastructure on the border. Congress has not passed a full federal budget for 2026. Nonetheless, the spending bills for environment and natural resource agencies that passed through committee maintained support for the EPA’s border wastewater programs. The Senate bill would appropriate $36 million and the House bill $45 million for border wastewater projects, comparable to recent years.

CSU’s Mumme said that the Trump administration’s increasing hostility toward Mexico could backfire.

“Trump is used to bullying his way. But that only goes so far,” he said. “Mexico does have leverage.”

Mumme said the history of cooperation shows that the U.S. and Mexico can achieve common goals, on issues from wastewater to water scarcity.

“There’s no substitute to cooperating and finding mutually beneficial solutions,” he said.

If we want to stem the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the critical mineral supply chain, we must be smart and strategic about it.","As President Trump returned from his trip to Asia in October, he boasted that his bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping was a “spectacular success.” The reality is, he has little to show for it. After months of recklessly escalating tensions with Communist China, by far the world’s largest supplier of rare earth minerals, Trump’s “art of the deal” only served to clean up messes he created and did virtually nothing to curb China’s influence on the critical mineral supply chain.

We need a new strategy.

Critical minerals, including the especially important rare earth minerals, are essential to modern life. They’re used in everything from smartphones to computers to cars. They are also essential to our national security and are key components in advanced weapons systems, aircrafts and missiles.

In my home state of Nevada, we have enough lithium deposits to power the world with electric batteries for all kinds of vehicles, from semi-trucks to ambulances. Albemarle’s Silver Peak facility in Nevada is currently the only lithium mine in the country. I have worked with presidents of both parties, including Trump, to ensure we are supporting the good-paying jobs and the hardworking families who depend on that mine.

Despite the abundance of some critical minerals in the U.S., we largely rely on China for our supply, as does the rest of the world. China currently owns 60 percent of the world’s production of rare earth minerals and 90 percent of processing capacity. China has repeatedly weaponized its near-monopoly on this technology against other countries, most recently against the United States.

It’s my mission to ensure we’re doing everything in our power to confront this generational economic challenge China poses. Unfortunately, instead of investing in American innovation, creating jobs, and encouraging our allies to decrease global reliance on China, Trump has chosen to impose blanket tariffs on our trading partners and cut key funding to support domestic critical mineral operations.

Trump’s so-called “reciprocal tariffs” have caused confusion among our allies that have robust critical mineral production — nations like South Korea, Australia and Canada — undermining our ability to work together to undercut the strength of China’s critical mineral supply chains. Strategic, targeted tariffs on our adversaries can be good for businesses and for our national security, but this is the opposite of that; it’s chaotic and isolating.

Trump’s blanket tariffs even have a loophole that allow hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian critical minerals like palladium to enter the U.S. without paying a single dollar in tariffs. A strategy that rewards our adversaries and punishes our allies makes no sense.

At the same time, the president has rolled back key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that incentivize investing in domestic critical minerals. When congressional Republicans and Trump passed their billionaire tax giveaway bill, they significantly weakened a key tax cut for Americans who produce critical minerals in the U.S. The administration has also unilaterally revoked funds for American companies that are building our critical mineral supply chain — and creating jobs — in the U.S.

These strategies are misguided at best and irreparably damaging to our global competitiveness at worst. Instead, we should be focused on shoring up the critical mineral supply chain right here in the U.S., and that means investing in both America’s critical minerals and those of our allies so we can better confront China’s economic threat. I’m working on legislation in the Senate to do just that.

My bipartisan bill with Sens. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the Rare Earth Magnet Security Act, would not only strengthen our domestic supply chain, and therefore our national security, but also support good-paying American jobs. The Mountain Pass mine, which is 15 miles outside Primm, Nevada, employs about 600 Nevadans to mine and process over 15 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals. However, China controls 90 percent of the world’s manufacturing of these materials into rare earth magnets, which we need for our national defense and other essentials. This legislation would create a tax credit for American companies that process these rare earth minerals and manufacture the magnets instead of sending them to China.

The second bipartisan bill I’m working on with Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) would establish a Critical Minerals Security Alliance with America’s global trading partners. The Restoring American Mineral Security Act would exempt nations who are members of this alliance from tariffs on critical minerals and on essential products made from them in return for them imposing tough tariffs on Chinese minerals. That way, we are leveraging our collective market power to ensure subsidized, dirty minerals from China aren’t flooding the world market and undermining American firms. Additionally, this bill would direct future tariff revenue from critical mineral imports into a fund to support member countries’ critical mineral projects.

If we want to stem the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the critical mineral supply chain, we must be smart and strategic about it. We can’t dive headfirst into trade wars, alienate key allies, or take away incentives that strengthen domestic production. We must instead take swift action to protect our own national security, invest in American innovation and jobs, and boost domestic critical mineral production. Passing my legislation will aid in that effort, and now is the time to act. China can afford for us to wait; we can’t.

Today, Jenner & Block’s bipartisan Congressional Investigations practice, in partnership with the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), released the 2025 edition of When Congress Comes Calling, the gold-standard handbook for the congressional oversight community. This is the first update to the handbook since 2017.

Since the last edition, Congress’s expanded use of congressional oversight authority, its more aggressive oversight of private parties, and the increased media attention surrounding these investigations have drastically reshaped the impact that congressional hearings and investigations can have on the parties being investigated.

In this latest update of When Congress Comes Calling, Jenner’s team provides analyses of recent legal developments and the evolution of investigative practices marking modern congressional investigations. The update also includes key insights from guest editors comprising Democratic and Republican experts across Washington who have held high-level positions across the legislative and executive branches.

Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH), Chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary said, “You can’t get to the bottom of any of these investigations unless you have staff who are willing to do the work… we got staff who are now on the other side [of the table], the counsel who make the process work, the folks at Jenner & Block and all of you, all of these good folks…when you bring in the witnesses, you can’t really make the whole process function unless those witnesses have good counsel like we have here…Thank you for the difference you make for the country, for the Constitution, for the Bill of Rights, for the liberties we enjoy as Americans who live in the greatest country ever, thank you for what you do.”

Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology said, “Actually, a majority of the House has served here for less than five years and a lot of members don’t even know what regular order is, so the work that you’re doing…is very important…Because when the House works in its regular order, the work of the people gets done more effectively.”

Ashley Callen, co-chair of the Congressional Investigations Practice at Jenner & Block said, “It was an honor to partner with POGO to update When Congress Comes Calling, and share our bipartisan expertise on how evolving legal and political landscapes are shaping congressional investigations. This edition of When Congress Comes Calling will serve as a go-to guide for congressional investigators for years to come, and we’d like to thank the Project on Government Oversight for entrusting us with the responsibility of updating this seminal publication.”

Tim Stretton, director of the Congressional Oversight Initiative at POGO said, “Thanks to Jenner & Block’s contributions to this publication, future generations of congressional investigators will be well prepared to carry on their essential work. This update honors and revitalizes the expertise of Mort Rosenberg, the original author of When Congress Comes Calling, and ensures that his vision of a robust first branch continues into today’s world. We are grateful for Jenner & Block’s work and look forward to sharing this edition with lawmakers and their staff who are dedicated to conducting rigorous oversight. This updated edition will support POGO’s Congressional Oversight Initiative in training and educating congressional staff about their oversight powers and how to use those powers effectively for years to come.”

Why can’t we do it for our clean energy power plants, which are going to be economic engines — even more so, potentially, than the casinos?”","Tribal nations looking to build clean energy projects are exploring new funding pathways after the Trump administration’s cuts to clean energy grants like Solar for All, which earmarked more than $500 million for solar development on tribal lands.

The Tribal Renewable Energy Coalition, an organization of 14 tribes which received a grant for more than $135 million in now-cancelled Solar for All funding, is continuing to use the solar project plans it developed but will seek funding sources like loans and philanthropy, Indigenized Energy CEO Cody Two Bears said during a November press call.

“I think that’s the positive side of what we get out of Solar for All, is we had over a year to plan this out, and now we have some things teed up for tribes to go after and start to leverage some of these dollars,” Two Bears said. “And I think that’s the plan for what we’re going to do moving forward.”

After the Trump administration took office and began to cancel grants associated with the Inflation Reduction Act, “the large utility scale projects that we were working on suddenly became a lot more difficult to finance,” said Chéri Smith, CEO of the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy. “And yet, there are still opportunities there.”

Earlier this year, the alliance launched a suite of project finance and planning tools called the Weaver Platform, and is helping tribes “to use that tool to build their capital stacks,” at the same time that they’re “engaging with networks of investors of all flavors to try and take projects and fund them with private dollars instead of public,” Smith said.

The Trump administration’s grant clawback has rescinded a great deal of federal funding for clean energy from tribes, Smith said, noting that the alliance’s grant-writing team got $484 million in grants awarded to 46 tribes in 2024.

That was “really exciting,” she said, “and the [Indigenous Power & Light Fund] was going to bridge the gap between those dollars and what the full project cost was. Well, 85% to 90% of that has been clawed back.”

Our goal is really simple, that we won’t let any tribal project die on our watch because funding was frozen.

“There is money and there is appetite in the capital markets, but that money comes with a lot of maybe misconceptions or misunderstanding about how tribes work,” she said. “As developers and practitioners, it’s really our job to help demystify that for these markets, so that they feel comfortable investing their money.”

But the appetite for investment exists, Pratte said, as a lot of land in the Great Plains and further west “is under tribal control and tribal authority. So these markets would be remiss if they weren’t looking at how to develop on these lands, and we have to demystify it. We have to make it comfortable.”

“There are so many blank canvases, essentially, from a developer’s point of view in Indian country,” said Todd Halvorsen, head of energy finance and structuring for the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy. “The perceived credit risk that’s out there in the finance community is not a real concern, and we should be able to rally enough good folk together to be able to pull the capital required to get these systems built to provide the reliable power, get those projects cash flowing.”

The Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy and the Solar Energy Industries Association in October launched a curriculum for clean energy developers and service providers called Pathways To Trust, which “addresses common knowledge gaps that often undermine cross-cultural collaboration and equips participants with practical tools to build mutually beneficial partnerships,” SEIA said in a release.

However, one cultural disconnect between tribes and outside developers — the specifics of law and regulations on tribal land — is also an opportunity for tribes to shape their energy future, said Claudio Clini, a policy analyst with the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, during the November call.

“We’ve been talking to tribes about this idea of replacing federal rollbacks of environmental protections and other things like that with tribal laws and regulations where applicable,” Clini said. “And in this way, we can work towards a self-determined future where tribes are exercising the full strength of their regulatory abilities and jurisdiction.”

Pulling projects back together

The $220 million Tribal Energy Resilience and Sovereignty project, which aims to build a network of nested microgrids in northern California to benefit several tribes, lost an $88 million award through the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience Innovations Program after it was cancelled by the Trump administration.

The microgrids would be backed up by battery and solar to create more reliability for the tribes they serve, who sometimes lose power for up to 20 days in a row, said Halvorsen.

We know the demand for energy is only going to continue in the coming years. Our hunger and appetite for energy is not going away. And in terms of tribal communities, we have to be players in this world.

The Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy has been working to help replace the lost federal funding with partnerships, philanthropy and other sources.

“It took about six months to go from hyper-depressed meetings where the vibe was just down, to slowly getting to, ‘Maybe we can do this, maybe we can get this back together,’” said Halvorsen, whose team is coordinating the capital raise and financial structuring for the project. “We’re out there talking with the vast majority of impact investors in the space, and building community — not just among industry in terms of supply chain and development talents, but with the financial communities, whether it be public or private.”

Though tribal nations are working to salvage many of the projects that were in progress, the disruption of suddenly losing funding is significant. Pratte said it has been “truly devastating for many of our communities” to not only lose the project itself but the jobs associated with it.

“It has this ripple effect — the hotels, the construction community, the utilities, all of these things, all of a sudden have the wind knocked out of them,” she said.

“The shift in administration, and policy, has certainly had a profound impact on the tribes,” Smith said. While multiple coalitions are suing the Trump administration over the cancellation of Solar for All funding, the alliance is choosing not to litigate the issue and instead help tribes “preserve the value of the work that they’ve already completed,” she said.

However, Clini said in November that the alliance is continuing to work with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to secure a waiver for tribes for the $5 million commercial readiness deposit required for projects to remain in an interconnection queue. The alliance has made the case to FERC that interconnection requests for tribal projects are not made speculatively, and that this deposit is impossible for the majority of tribes to make.

And even before President Donald Trump won reelection and began to rescind IRA funding, the alliance anticipated the potential for this and launched a program called Solar for All TRIBES, “an initiative to try and ensure that the six tribal consortia that received awards don’t lose momentum because of political shifts,” said Smith.

“We’re doing triage on a daily basis with the stalled projects, the stranded engineering work, and we see ourselves as here to protect that progress,” she said. “Our goal is really simple, that we won’t let any tribal project die on our watch because funding was frozen.”

The benefits of alternatives

Halvorsen said he was leery of the potential for issues with Solar for All grants before any of the funding was rescinded.

“I saw a number of flaws and was already thinking, how do we do something better? What’s going to be the replacement program for this?” he said. “I was already worried about unfriendly administration challenges and how some of the funding could get frozen or clawed back.”

He was particularly concerned about the requirement that every Solar for All project had to guarantee a 20% savings on electricity bills for a given end user — a requirement that he says made less sense for projects on tribal land.

Scale is huge in making these projects all pencil, because there’s so many intermediary costs with getting any deployment done in renewables.

Head of energy finance and structuring for the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy

“Those calculations can be hard enough to pull together to begin with, so there’s a lot of room for challenges,” he said. “And why is 20% savings the most critical thing when there’s all these communities at the end of power lines that don’t have reliable power?”

Halvorsen said he’s seen a mentality shift from grant-funded projects to third-party financed projects, with tribes “retaining ownership from the get go” and being able to leverage the IRA’s direct pay mechanism — which allows tax-exempt tribal nations to still benefit from the legislation’s tax credits — as an underwriting mechanism for “bringing in construction and term financing.”

With many of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits expiring soon as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and tribes being tax-exempt entities, “structuring these things in a way that makes sense for all parties, along with tribal ownership, is really crucial,” Pratte said.

After the passage of the OBBBA, “I think one of the things that we’re beholden to is figuring out where we find that capital, where we continue the good work, because we know the demand for energy is only going to continue in the coming years,” Pratte said. “Our hunger and appetite for energy is not going away. And in terms of tribal communities, we have to be players in this world.”

One of the alliance’s goals is to take “all the good, the bad and the ugly lessons” from the residential and commercial solar industries and apply those on tribal land to “develop, finance, construct and operate projects with tribal developers and tribal asset owners as the core of the projects from the get go,” Halvorsen said.

“The more similar projects you can get per dollar spent, the more efficient the overall program becomes,” he said. “Scale is huge in making these projects all pencil, because there’s so many intermediary costs with getting any deployment done in renewables — whether it’s a single residential project, a hundred residential projects, an 100-kW project or 100-megawatt project.”

As tribal nations have accepted the formalized cancellation of Solar for All and other federal sources of clean energy funding, they’ve been able to pivot to new thinking about how to finance these projects, Halvorsen said.

“Indian country has an aversion to debt, so it’s been the focus that if there’s free money coming from the federal government, let’s go there before we’re thinking about taking on any sort of liability through debt financing,” he said. “But now more increasingly we’re hearing, oh, yeah, we’re doing that in our casino. Why can’t we do it for our clean energy power plants, which are going to be economic engines — even more so, potentially, than the casinos?”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/FCdN9BU0-PM09tnDfF1Z5jki8wMSvHBojO-ksIvl_oE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTU4ODk0MzIxXzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-15 13:01:23.190479

With 2025 rapidly coming to a close, we thought this might be the perfect opportunity to look back at the year that was in Texas energy, as well as a lookahead to what 2026 may hold.

Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: I know it’s a thing at year’s end to create top 10 lists. Alas, we don’t have time for 10, so let’s go with three – working up from No. 3 to No. 1.

What do you consider to be the third-biggest energy story for Texas in 2025?

Matt Smith: Oh gosh, I think in the top three, it’s got to be natural gas production and oil production hitting a record.

So with oil, we’re kind of pushing towards nearly 14 million barrels per day here for oil. To put that in context, Saudi Arabia is producing closer to 10 and they’re the second-largest producer. So oil production is going gangbusters and the interesting thing is it has continued to rise. People are expecting it to level off. And it just hasn’t happened yet, but we may see that next year.

We’ve also seen natural gas production hitting a record as well. And so the interesting thing is that even though we may see oil production starting to drop later next year, just because oil prices remain in check, natural gas looks like it’s just going to continue to chug on pushing to record levels.

What about exports?

Exports have hit a record for LNG. So we’ve seen new LNG terminals such as Plaquemines just pushing out a lot of LNG. There’s also the demand for it, right? I think about 70% of it is going to Europe because Europe’s trying to pivot away from Russia.

But on the oil side of things, we haven’t hit a record actually. So Europe has been pulling back a little bit, but we’ve had increasing competition into Europe. But one reason, actually, it’s been lower to Asia is because of tariffs. And so China’s purchasing has basically all but dropped off there.

You know, in any other year that might have been your No. 1, but let’s let’s now shift from No. 3 to No. 2. What’s your second-biggest energy story?

I think we’ve got to go with Texas power, and there’s a few bits here.

So the main one is really just the expectations of AI and data centers there. They’re going to be the largest component driving energy demand growth in Texas in the coming years here.

And you know what? It’s not just that. We’re going be seeing cryptocurrency mining, we’re going see hotter weather, a growing population. And so this is all why ERCOT, the state’s power grid operator, is predicting energy demand in Texas could well get close to doubling by 2030 there. So that’s ripping.

Just one last point on the power side of things, too: Solar is expected to surpass coal-fired power generation on annual basis this year. So it’s looking to account for 14% of power generation in the generation mix there just because it has absolutely ramped up like crazy this year and has overtaken coal.

Another huge story. How do you top those two? What’s your No. 1 pick when it comes to your top energy story for Texas this year?

Well, I think this is kind of timely, and it’s almost like a Christmas present, right? It’s the fact that prices at the pump are getting close to five-year lows here.

So for Texas, we’ve seen prices breaking below $2.50 a gallon there – so multi-year low. And so that gives some money back into our pockets here to be able to have a bit of fun around Christmastime. So I think that’s the winner for this year.

Yeah, this coming at a time when a lot of concerns are growing regarding affordability more broadly, getting to see those prices at the pump going down is a little bit of a bonus there. And obviously a lot of attention focused on what this might mean politically as we go into an election year.

Speaking of 2026, Captain, want to go out on a limb and make any predictions? What’s the next year looking like when it comes to Texas energy?

You nearly stole my thunder there because you were talking about politics.

I think the low prices of the pump are going to be that thing because we’ve got the midterm elections coming up at the end of next year. President Trump is laser-focused on keeping prices at the pump down, not just to give his base some money back into their pockets, but he’s also using it as a lever to try and keep inflation down. So I think we’re going to see even lower prices next year for prices at the pump.

Even lower prices. I don’t know how you can continue to produce as prices continue to fall.

I know, but we’re seeing it come through. Prices are now in the in the 50s for WTI, that U.S. benchmark, and yet oil production continues to chug along. So, higher supply means that the prices should remain in check.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20250423_Monahans_MM045-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 13:01:44.011299

A host of U.S. manufacturing expansions are underway, supported by federal and state incentives to bolster domestic production and create local jobs.

Just last week, officials in Alabama, Kentucky and Colorado touted investments from manufacturers in the battery materials, farm equipment, beverage and electronics industries.

Here are more details about those projects.

Coca-Cola bottling partner to invest $475M in Colorado site

Utah-based Swire Coca-Cola, USA plans to build a 620,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a local chamber of commerce announced Dec. 11.

The facility will produce more than 230 beverage options across more than 60 brands, including soft drinks, waters, teas, juices and sports beverages, according to a news release. It is expected to double Swire Coca-Cola’s local workforce with the creation of 170 jobs, “provide its employees with a modern working environment, meet rising customer demand and advance its sustainability goals.”

“Colorado Springs has been a great partner for our existing distribution facility where we employ 170 people,” Bryan Sink, SVP of supply chain at Swire Coca-Cola, said in a statement. “The city offers a highly skilled workforce and a strong sense of community — all of which make it an ideal location for this strategic investment.”

Officials said the project will support about 1,190 construction and installation jobs, generating an estimated $103 million for workers and families in El Paso County. Swire Coca-Cola is pursuing LEED Gold certification for its facility.

The company plans to break ground on the project next year and consolidate its existing operations into the new facility. It will replace a 90-year-old production plant in Denver, according to the release. Currently, Swire Coca-Cola employs 1,300 people in Colorado.

Foxconn to build first US manufacturing facility in Kentucky

Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Co. will invest $173 million to build its first U.S. manufacturing facility in Louisville, Kentucky, creating 180 jobs, Mayor Craig Greenberg announced Dec. 9.

The 350,000-square-foot “factory of the future” will be outfitted with artificial intelligence and robotics in all phases of consumer electronics production, from design and assembly to logistics, according to a news release. It is part of Foxconn’s “Made in America” initiative, aimed at strengthening the country’s supply chains.

“Foxconn helped pioneer the world’s most advanced production systems, from smartphones to computing devices,” Foxconn CEO Ben Liaw said in a statement. “Now we’re bringing that same precision and innovation to the United States.”

The project received preliminary approval for an investment incentive valued at up to $3.4 million by the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority. The agency also approved up to $600,000 in tax incentives.

Operations are expected to begin in the third quarter of 2026.

Anthro Energy to bring $142M battery materials factory to Kentucky

Alameda, California-based Anthro Energy plans to establish a battery materials manufacturing facility in Louisville, Kentucky, Mayor Craig Greenberg announced Dec. 12.

The 25-GWh factory will be capable of making 12,000 metric tons per year of Anthro’s proprietary injectable phase change electrolyte, a material used for lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles, defense and consumer electronics, according to a news release. The investment is expected to create 110 factory jobs and support 390 construction jobs.

“By onshoring critical battery-supply-chain infrastructure, we’re strengthening both our national security and our industrial base,” Anthro Chief Technology Officer Joe Papp said in a statement. “We look forward to contributing to Kentucky’s leadership in the advanced battery economy.”

Anthro received a $24.9 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy earlier this year to establish the “first large-scale, U.S.-owned and operated advanced electrolyte manufacturing facility.” It also received $18.4 million in investment tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Bad Boy Mowers selects Alabama for tractor plant

Batesville, Arkansas-based Bad Boy Mowers will spend $10.5 million to establish a tractor assembly plant in Monroeville, Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey announced Dec. 10.

The plant will be located at a former Vanity Fair lingerie distribution center, where work is underway to transform the site, according to a news release. It is expected to have a capacity of about 9,000 tractors per year, once completed, and bring 50 jobs to the area.

“Monroeville is truly excited about Bad Boy’s decision to locate here and begin production in the very near future,” Mike Colquett, executive director of the Monroeville/Monroe County Economic Development Authority, said in a statement.

The final tenet, capacitated industrial policy-making, forms the foundation of upgrading the practice of industrial policy-making.
Instead, the key to unlocking the gains of industrial policy lies in upgrading the practice of industrial policy-making itself.","As poverty rates have fallen in Asia and elsewhere, Africa accounts for two thirds of the world’s extreme poor although it is home to only 16% of the world’s population. That industrialization is yet to happen in Africa is a major part of the explanation. Though various models—from the 18th-century industrializers to the broad convergence achieved by today’s successful late developers—industrialization has provided a proven pathway to economic transformation and increasing levels of income. It is not any different for Africa: the continent’s route out of poverty lies in achieving sustainable industrialization.

While traditionally associated with manufacturing, contemporary industrialization, however, encompasses a broader concept founded on sustainable productivity growth driven by technological change and innovation. This is in consideration of the compounded interrelationship between the primary sectors—agriculture and natural resources—and services and manufacturing. Hence, the “return of industrial policy” is a nod to this complexity amplified by a changing geopolitical and geoeconomic global order, rapid technological advancements, and a climate emergency. A universal question, then, is not whether to pursue industrial policy, but how.

Drawing upon a 2023 white paper published by the Firoz Laji Institute for Africa at the London School of Economics, The Art of Upgrading Industrial Policymaking Itself, which provides the framework for ongoing country case study research, we outline what the “how” means for African countries. To the extent that there is no single model or “golden policy template” leading to industrialization, what matters is the approach and process, including “experimenting and learning” to craft appropriate interventions by a committed developmental state. This first requires an understanding of the “big five” industrialization issues of today: policy consensus, green industrialization, supply chain security and resiliency, shifting industrialization paradigms, and widening policy space. But most importantly, it requires that industrial policy-making in Africa is itself upgraded to be more adaptive, collaborative, and consultative, while bringing together government, anchor investors, and development partners into a grand bargain for social and environmentally sustainable industrialization.

The Big Five Issues of Industrial Policy-making

First, for industrial policy to succeed, it needs to attract a sufficient level of buy-in or policy consensus. This concerns the political economy of industrial policy and how it is governed. It can entail building a collective strategic vision for industrialization, striking careful bargains with elites, and aligning economic incentives to ensure that the industrial policy—whatever it is—has a deep and sustained commitment to it at the highest levels of government, but also beyond the executive and through the business community to other constituencies and individuals within societies. Challenges to the current model of development in African countries are the distributional struggles and the emergence of stark inequalities. The mining and resource sectors have created islands of wealth, but few jobs. This has left increasing numbers of Africans to resort to the informal sector, and particularly informal and insecure services sector work. As Mazzucato and Rodrik (2023) have noted, welfare orientation is a critical aspect of achieving policy consensus.

Second, with global temperatures already exceeding the Paris Agreement 1.5°C target in 2024, neither a degrowth strategy nor a “grow now and clean later” approach is a viable option for late industrializers. The path is clear, and it is green industrialization. However, as Lebdioui (2024) argues in Survival of the Greenest, what remains less clear is how to balance economic prosperity with the decarbonization agenda. Africa’s historic contributions to CO2 emissions are negligible, but are likely to rise as the continent develops. The challenge is to ensure the emergence of a competitive industrial sector while transitioning to cleaner energy and production methods. This should involve developing Africa’s underutilized renewable energy sources, reducing process emissions in production, and increasing resource efficiency. Green industrialization may also create opportunities as the world transitions to new technologies and patterns of consumption. For Africa, this could include leapfrogging into new and cleaner technologies, encouraging “green mineral” value chains, harnessing green hydrogen, and developing the continent’s sizable but underutilized renewable energy resources. Achieving these goals requires delicate balancing without compromising the just development aspirations of African countries.

Third, the security and resilience of global value chains in the contemporary global landscape are under threat of geoeconomic fragmentation and costly trade diversion. In today’s uncertain geopolitical climate, where “friends” and “enemies” are equally considered targets of protectionism, the risks associated with global supply chains are being recalculated. Instead of getting trampled under foreign giants, African countries must consider how national industrial policies can traverse and circumvent such risks.

Fourth, shifting industrialization paradigms must be taken into account by African countries. The three biggest emerging changes to the current industrial paradigm are the rise of digital production methods, the growth of platform production models, and continuing changes to the geographic distribution of production.

Digitalization is increasing the skills and technology intensity of manufacturing, undermining its traditional developmental role in absorbing large numbers of workers from the countryside. Digitalization also creates opportunities that could be seized, including new possibilities for late industrializers like African countries to leapfrog into new ways of producing, including the increased role of digital services in manufacturing, many of which can be outsourced.

The two other factors that define industrial paradigms include the organizational model of production, currently characterized by network production and platform production, and the geographic scope of industrialization, currently dominated by value chains at regional as well as global levels. These developments come with opportunities and challenges that African countries must factor into the design and implementation of industrial policy. For instance, regional or global value chain systems entail specializing in specific tasks but require efficient transport, information and communication technology, and energy infrastructure as the price of entry.

Finally, the “return of industrial policy” brought with it widened policy space. The expansion of the acceptability of industrial policy measures is an opportunity for African countries as late industrializers. While this opens the door to more adventurous industrial policies, it calls for a rethinking of the multilateral rules-based system to respond to this changed reality.

Tenets of Sustainable Industrial Policy

Industrial policy can be a powerful tool for Africa’s development, but without the certainty of any specific model to follow, it requires the art of upgrading industrial policy-making itself to be more nimble in a changing world. The following five tenets outline the foundations of a more sustainable, active, and intentional industrial policy-making process.

The first tenet, adaptive industrial policy-making, positions experimentation and learning at the centre of economic transformation. It appreciates that industrialization must occur in a new, unsettled era of challenges and opportunities, including “greening” industrialization, the reprioritization of supply chain security, and shifting industrialization paradigms. Rather than “perfecting” industrial policy design, an adaptive approach prioritizes systematic implementation through dedicated “policy-testing” zones or “sandboxes,” such as Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and pilot industrial parks. However, the process does not stop here. A complementary policy learning ecosystem allows for a rigorous assessment of outcomes and policy refinement. Doing so allows governments to build capacity by delivering results and to focus more on implementation (which is generally appreciated to be a greater challenge in many African countries) instead of getting caught up in perfecting policy design.

Secondly, upgrading the practice of industrial policy-making requires a consultative approach for developing iterative dialogue channels to leverage synergies between stakeholders in the public, private, and third sectors, both local and international. What Peter Evans (1995) calls embedded autonomy is the outcome of an approach that preserves the ability of a state to protect its autonomy from capture by competing interests. The key is to leverage stakeholder relationships to understand how industrial paradigms are shifting and where opportunities can be created.

The third tenet, partnering for industrial policy-making, builds network capital that enhances the credibility of the industrialization agenda and garners a crowd-in effect of investment opportunities. However, gathering investments is not enough; the destination of the investment matters. For instance, most investment flows in Africa are concentrated in primary extractive activities, such as mining and energy. While partners can help shift this dynamic toward a mutually beneficial relationship, the onus is on African policy-makers to negotiate and realign partners’ interests toward supporting their own sustainable industrialization agenda.

Partnerships between international and domestic agents are not limited to investments, but are central to a transboundary industrial policy-making approach, the fourth tenet. We live in an interconnected world where the consequences of an event in one part of the world—geopolitical rivalries, supply chain disruptions, ecological catastrophes, and viruses—are felt in another. Some of the opportunities for African industrialization are also transboundary, including the potential to create scale economies and tap into rapid market growth through African regional integration. But the influence of individual African countries and their technical capacities in transboundary issues can be limited.

To use the language of the African Union’s Agenda 2063, African countries must “speak with one voice and act collectively to promote our common interests and positions in the international arena.” By pooling their resources and influence, African countries can better ensure that their interests are heard and accounted for in global issues. The African Continental Free Trade Area can be a powerful resource not just for integrating African economies, but for establishing commonalities on tricky issues being negotiated in multilateral fora.

What all four tenets have in common is the demand for building greater capacity to shape industrial policy-making that is adaptive, consultative, partner-based, and transboundary. The final tenet, capacitated industrial policy-making, forms the foundation of upgrading the practice of industrial policy-making. It refers to the need for effective and well-resourced public institutions for policy development and implementation. Such capacity provides governments with agency to steer the national industrialization agenda, building upon local expertise and knowledge. Well-capacitated institutions facilitate the effective brokering of different interests not only to ensure implementation remains on track, but also to navigate regional and international partnerships to achieve mutually beneficial transboundary goals.

Conclusion

The framework we have outlined provides a basis for putting industrial policy-making practice on a sustainable, adaptive, and experiment-based trajectory. We recognize that the framework assumes a rigorous and deliberate decision-making process across the design, implementation, and monitoring of industrial policies. In practice, however, policy-making is often reactive, rather than adaptive. Nonetheless, navigating today’s complexity to achieve sustainable economic transformation and overcome pervasive poverty requires more than tinkering with industrial policy instruments. Instead, the key to unlocking the gains of industrial policy lies in upgrading the practice of industrial policy-making itself. While no “golden template” exists, our framework serves as a starting point for a universal approach for rethinking the design, implementation, and monitoring of industrial strategies. With capacitated industrial policy-making as a foundation, the process must be adaptive, consultative, and transboundary to address the challenges of a sustainable future.",https://www.iisd.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2025-12/office-paperwork-team-meeting.jpg?itok=LdAaD0ur,N,,2025-12-15 13:59:58.442579

Developments in charging infrastructure, energy integration, and digital connectivity float amid a constant current of changing regulatory frameworks, market dynamics, and competitive pressures. This Insight examines the current outlook for the US EV market, ongoing changes to federal and state regulatory policy, critical infrastructure and cybersecurity challenges, and the broader trajectory of the industry going forward.

Market Trends and Projections

Since 2020, EV sales have surged from just over 500,000 to 1.6 million in 2024. As 2025 draws to a close, the US EV market has remained on a strong upward trend, with a projected 2.25 million sales projected by year’s end. While this past October saw sales dip following the expiration of federal tax credits, quarterly growth remains robust, with Q3 2025 sales up 40% year-over-year. Analysts expect this slowdown to be temporary, with long-term demand being supported by resilient consumer interest and innovation.

Retail forecasts also reflect this optimism. EVs are expected to account for 9.1% of total vehicle sales in 2025, with projections indicating it could rise to 11.8% in 2026 and 26% by 2030. This growth is largely driven by expanding model availability, improved battery technology, and increasing public awareness. Despite policy and infrastructure hurdles, the market outlook remains positive, signaling a steady shift toward electrification in the years to come.

Federal and State Policy Dynamics

Despite favorable market conditions, regulatory and policy developments are exerting increasing pressure on the EV sector’s future. In addition to the expiration of Individual Retirement Account tax credits that reduced consumer incentives, updates to the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program have introduced stricter requirements around community engagement and cybersecurity. These changes reflect a shift toward more localized and accountable infrastructure planning, while adding complexity for developers and manufacturers.

The US administration has also recently initiated a rollback of federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards by proposing to revert to the 2022 baseline, which would require only minimal annual efficiency increases. While this shift may ease compliance burdens in the near term, it also creates uncertainty for manufacturers planning future vehicle lineups. Companies will likely be faced with complex strategic decisions as international and more stringent US regulatory pathways diverge.

State-level actions are influencing market dynamics as well. California’s authority to set stricter emissions standards was revoked earlier this year, and federal waivers originally issued by the Environmental Protection Agency for zero-emission truck mandates have been rescinded. While these rollbacks may slow progress for medium- and heavy-duty electrification, California and 10 other supporting states have filed suit in federal court in California challenging those recissions.

Evolving trade policies have added another layer of challenge. Tariffs on key components such as semiconductors and industrial machinery are prompting a reevaluation of automotive supply chains, pushing manufacturers to invest in regional production hubs to avoid dependence on importing.

Infrastructure and Cybersecurity Challenges

Charging infrastructure remains a critical barrier to widespread EV adoption. Although there are currently over 76,000 public station locations and 228,000 charging ports across the United States, access is still uneven, especially in rural areas. Permitting delays, interconnection issues, and high installation costs continue to slow progress. To support the projected 33 million EVs on the road by 2030, the United States will need to scale up to 2.2 million public charging ports, which will require coordinated investment and significant policy support.

High-capacity chargers can place significant strain on local utilities, with some expected to require energy loads comparable to large outdoor sports stadiums by 2030. Utilities are also being forced to navigate complex pricing models that can deter investment.

Meanwhile, the lack of unified cybersecurity standards leaves EV infrastructure vulnerable to digital threats. While the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued guidance, comprehensive regulations are still in development.

Strategic Outlook

As the EV ecosystem matures, stakeholders face emerging market opportunities. Vehicle-to-grid technology introduces significant potential for market access and monetization. Bidirectional charging enables EV owners and fleet operators to participate in energy markets, creating new revenue streams through load management and grid services. For fleets, aggregated energy capacity offers particularly strong prospects for capturing value previously inaccessible.

However, these opportunities come with legal and operational considerations. These include compliance with market participation rules, whether retail or wholesale, and the need for robust energy services management between operators, owners, and charge point operators. Currently, no comprehensive regulation governs cybersecurity requirements for the full EV infrastructure, although frameworks such as NIST guidance and procurement language from the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation provide some initial direction. Proactive engagement with evolving standards and contractual provisions will be critical to securing competitive advantage in the EV industry.",https://www.morganlewis.com/-/media/images/tiles/transportation/158987992_automotive-report-2025_largetile.jpg?rev=4483a57ee98e41888216a4d37cf0ae79&hash=09B6B70D6750559C843D25B95BBED71F,N,,2025-12-15 12:04:12.912716

DALLAS, TEXAS (December 15, 2025) – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced over $351 million in funding for the city of Fort Worth, Texas. The funds include an approved loan of $347 million from the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program and selection of Fort Worth to receive $4,817,344 million from the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling (SWIFR) grant program.

Fort Worth’s WIFIA loan will be used to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment and support beneficial water reuse. A newly designed and built water reclamation facility will meet the needs of a growing population while treating wastewater to be reused for industrial and irrigation purposes. The SWIFR grant will help launch the Reuse Program and Recycling Enhancement Project to collect appliances, building materials, furniture, and electronics for reuse at drop-off locations.

“Fort Worth’s growth has made it a premier destination in Texas for families and businesses, and has created a greater need for clean water infrastructure and materials management services,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “Funding from EPA can help this great city increase capacity to meet those needs and continue the historic pace of growth.”

“Fort Worth is committed to making smart, future-focused investments that keep our city strong and affordable for the families and businesses who call it home,” said Mayor Mattie Parker. “The EPA’s WIFIA loan for the Mary’s Creek Water Reclamation Facility allows us to stretch every dollar by securing low interest rates and flexible repayment terms. The solid waste grant helps us expand the reuse and recycling services our community relies on. Together, these investments are a major win for our wastewater and solid waste ratepayers and reinforce our commitment to delivering high-quality, cost-effective services as Fort Worth continues to grow.”

The WIFIA program aims to accelerate investment in the nation’s water infrastructure by providing long-term, low-cost supplemental credit assistance for regionally and nationally significant projects. Through its flexible financing features and competitive interest rates, WIFIA helps communities save money. By pairing the WIFIA program’s federal funding with state, local, and private investment, EPA accelerates water infrastructure investment worth billions of dollars.

The WIFIA program’s rolling selection process allows a wide variety of borrowers from across the country to access WIFIA financing. For example, in the last round of funding, the WIFIA program selected two private entities and five small communities to submit loan applications. To date, EPA’s WIFIA program has announced $22 billion to help finance over 140 projects across the country. These projects are creating over 160,000 jobs across the country.

EPA’s SWIFR program provides grants to improve post-consumer materials management and infrastructure; support improvements to local post-consumer materials management and recycling programs; and assist local waste management authorities in making improvements to local waste management systems.

The majority of respondents are optimistic about long-term careers in renewables, but a significant portion considered exiting the industry in the last year.

The “2025 Salary & Sentiments Report” was build on responses from more than 500 professionals and captures how shifting market conditions are influencing both talent expectations and employer decision-making during a year described in the foreword as a “moment of recalibration,” shaped by policy uncertainty, slower capital deployment and lengthened development timelines.

“Transparency isn’t a nice-to-have anymore — it’s essential,” said Mindy Prefling, partner at root/edge. “Professionals want clarity about their value, their opportunities, and the future of the industry. Employers want the insight to make smarter, more sustainable hiring decisions. This report reflects what we hear every day from both sides, and partnering with WRISE allows us to deliver that data at scale.”

Key findings from the 2025 Salary & Sentiments Report:

Long-term confidence remains high. 67% of respondents report feeling optimistic about long-term careers in renewables, with only 6% identifying as pessimistic.

Market uncertainty is influencing mobility. While 68% intend to remain in the sector, 39% considered leaving the industry within the past year, reflecting concerns around tax credit proposals and long-term stability.

Compensation growth continues but has moderated. Median salaries across most levels remain stable, and 84% of professionals receive a bonus, typically tied to company or individual performance.

Gender gaps persist in development planning. Women are significantly less likely to have a formal development plan despite reporting similar levels of career confidence.

Professionals want meaningful progression. Many require double-digit salary increases to consider a move, and most rate structured development plans as important to their long-term goals.

“The data shows a sector full of committed, capable people, but also one that needs clarity to navigate the next chapter,” added Prefling. “We hope this report helps employers build stronger teams and helps professionals make informed decisions in a rapidly changing landscape.”

Doseke Akporiaye, executive director at WRISE, commented on the launch of the report: “I am excited by this partnership with root/edge and to share this important report. In the 20 years since WRISE was founded, the state of women in the industry has changed dramatically, but we still have work to do. Working with root/edge on this report is a strategic first step towards data leadership for women in the industry. We hope our members and sponsors will continue to support these efforts to tell the story of women’s experiences through data.”",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hardhat-construction-worker.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 12:03:13.234950

Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
A rush on solar Cutting said solar installation companies in his region quickly booked up after President Donald Trump signed the bill into law in July.","On their small farm in Wahoo, Nebraska, Rhonda McClure and her husband toss a few pumpkins over the fence to a flock of ewes. They sell market lambs and wool, some of which Rhonda uses as a fiber artist, along with garden produce and compost.

She said they’ve always tried to use sustainable practices on their farm, including rotational grazing, geothermal energy and most recently — solar.

“The solar just fits in with trying to be as independent and careful of the environment as we can,” McClure said.

For the McClures, harnessing energy from the sun allows them to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and keep their energy costs down over the long run.

A solar array they added in 2021 to help power their well and home reduced their summer energy bills from several hundred dollars per month to as low as $4, McClure said.

They added a solar battery this spring to release energy at night and act as a back-up during regional power outages.

“It’s provided a good deal of security for us to know that if we’re off grid for a while, if something happens, we can get by,” McClure said. “We have water and heat and the essential services here, for us and our livestock.”

Now they’re wrapping up another solar project, largely to provide air conditioning for a new outbuilding used to store and process wool, teach classes and host large groups of people.

McClure said they likely would have waited to install it next spring. But they bumped up the timeline when they found out the Residential Clean Energy Credit was rapidly expiring. Congress voted this summer to eliminate it at the end of 2025 through the One Big Beautiful Bill.

An incentive for home solar

The federal tax credit covers 30% of overall project costs for home solar, along with wind, geothermal, fuel cells and battery storage.

Some version of a residential solar tax credit has been around for decades with short-term extensions becoming the norm since President George W. Bush. But the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden kicked the deadline to 2032 for the full credit, followed by a rate phase down.

The Biden administration said the tax credit and two dozen others in the Inflation Reduction Act would “save families money on their energy bills and accelerate the deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, clean buildings, and clean manufacturing.”

Over 752,000 households claimed the Residential Clean Energy Credit on their 2023 taxes. Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit made solar more affordable for homeowners by lowering the upfront costs and shortening the amount of time before they recoup their initial investment, said Paul Cutting.

Cutting helps homeowners identify opportunities to improve their energy efficiency and pay for them as an energy auditor with Clean Energy Districts of Iowa. The affiliation includes 15 county-level organizations across eastern Iowa and one in Wisconsin.

The cost of installing solar depends largely on the size of the home, along with its location and overall electricity usage, Cutting said. The national average is $23,500, according to the nonprofit Center for Sustainable Energy, but some industry experts say some residential solar projects can exceed $40,000.

“The solar tax credit being funded at the full 30% makes it pretty enticing for a homeowner to move forward with that,” Cutting said.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill cut the tax credit deadline off at the end of the year instead of its original phase out starting in 2032. Homeowners working with contractors must have their systems installed and invoices paid by Dec. 31 to qualify.

A rush on solar

Cutting said solar installation companies in his region quickly booked up after President Donald Trump signed the bill into law in July.

That was the experience of StraightUp Solar, a company that designs and installs solar systems for homes, businesses, nonprofits and government agencies in Missouri and Illinois.

“We sold out in September, and many other solar companies were selling out in July, which means their entire build schedule was full for 2025 because people wanted to get in before the tax credit expired at the end of the year,” said Eric Schneider, director of business development for StraightUp Solar.

The company’s third quarter of 2025 was the second busiest for inquiries, said Schneider. The biggest spike was in 2022 when homeowners expected an earlier tax credit to sunset before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.

“We call it the ‘solar coaster’ in the industry because demand fluctuates up and down,” Schneider said. “Some of it's policy driven; some of it's interest rate driven.”

More utilities are also shifting to “time-of-use” or “time-of-day” pricing, which sets higher electricity rates during peak hours, typically late afternoon and evening on weekdays.

A homeowner with solar panels and a battery back-up can draw from their stored energy – rather than the grid – during peak hours to save money, Schneider said.

These customers are also insulated from future energy rate hikes, said Corey Ziemann, solar program coordinator for the Midwest Renewable Energy Association.

“If you're buying solar, you're essentially buying all the energy you're going to use from that system all at once. You're locking in that rate so you won't be subject to the increases that are coming,” Ziemann said.

The loss of the federal tax credit will likely stretch out the payback period for homeowners, Ziemann said. But another way to help make home solar more affordable is through “group buy” programs, which bring individuals from a community together to purchase in bulk.

The Midwest Renewable Energy Association’s Grow Solar team has facilitated more than 70 group buy programs in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Missouri.

3M in 2023 agreed to pay $10.3 billion to settle lawsuits from hundreds of public water systems contaminated by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.

Allentown stands to get more than $2.6 million from the Minnesota-based industrial giant.

That money represents just two of 10 expected payments for Allentown, according to a memo from Mayor Matt Tuerk’s office to City Council.

Annual payments are scheduled to continue through 2033, the memo states.

And DuPont, now known as Chemours/Corteva, will pay the city almost a half-million as part of a similar settlement.

Council this month introduced a measure to accept the money. Members are likely to pass that bill at their next meeting Wednesday.

New treatment facility in the works

The funding is earmarked to help pay for a $20 million facility to treat water from Crystal Spring, one of Allentown’s four major water sources, according to Tuerk’s memo.

Sampling results from the spring exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s strict limits for PFAS in drinking water — four parts per trillion.

One part per trillion is equivalent to one drop of water in 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

The Lehigh County Authority said its tests found 3.1-4.6 parts per trillion of perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) in Allentown’s water, as well as up to 3.1 parts per trillion of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA).

The same forever chemicals — and three others — were detected in drinking water in the LCA’s Central Lehigh Division, according to the authority.

The Lehigh County Authority’s draft five-year capital plan for 2026-30 says the organization’s “next step is to design and construct a treatment facility for Crystal Spring.”

The project should be done by the end of 2027, according to the draft plan.

In the other, an executive assistant asserted she’d been harassed by Stone and former division head Christopher Hilton while the three of them prepared to defend Paxton in his 2023 impeachment trial in the Texas Senate. The lawsuit included an email from Webster that said he had been threatened by Stone to the point that he was considering security for his family based on comments Stone made.

In their lawsuit, Stone and Hilton said Webster retaliated against them by feeding the email to the assistant to use in hers. Webster did this, they allege, because they launched a corruption investigation into him through a public records request to the AG’s office. Separately, Stone and Hilton made a complaint to the state bar the same week also accusing Webster of using taxpayer money to fund his legal fees in a federal criminal bribery investigation into Paxton and tampering with witnesses in Paxton’s impeachment trial. Neither Paxton nor Webster was charged in the criminal probe.

Weisbart Springer’s legal work isn’t disclosed in either of the cases’ court filings. Its connection to the Stone-Webster feud is revealed through a pay invoice that showed a paralegal reviewed complaints in the cases. Otherwise, it’s impossible to decipher what the firm did for most of the 50 hours it billed.

Some references are general, broadly revealing preparation and discussions with counsel. One says partner Julie Springer gave “advice regarding litigation.” Another says Springer reviewed an opinion from Paxton’s Open Records Division “to understand same and” before the rest of the entry is redacted.

The invoices are titled “Attorney General/Investigation.”

In all, the firm billed the state $25,824 for two months of work ending in late August.

Transparency

The contract’s instruction to help develop policies “could mean anything so therefore it means nothing at all,” said Joseph Larsen, board member of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, who noted that it’s impossible to tell from the engagement what the firm was hired to do.

Larsen, of Gregor Wynne Arney, is one of three lawyers who specialize in Texas government ethics and transparency who said they are struck by the lack of specificity in the contract, which called for the firm’s attorneys to bill $525 per hour. That hourly rate is on the low end of outside contracts from Paxton’s office. Some pay up to $3,780 in contingency for taking on and beating major pharmaceutical and technology companies.

In addition to not responding to requests for comment, Paxton’s office declined to provide a copy of its policy on contracting with outside law firms citing confidential internal communications between agency attorneys.

“Policies are not normally attorney-client privileged,” Larsen said. “They’re super public.”

The contract “would be better from a policy standpoint if it were more specific,” said James Hemphill, an open government lawyer with Graves Dougherty Hearon & Moody.

Springer, who signed the contract on behalf of the firm, has ties to Paxton going back for more than a decade: In 2014, she served on his transition team when he was first elected attorney general after contributing $5,000 to his campaign.

In addition to Springer, Geoff Weisbart, another partner, performed legal services as part of the contract. The attorneys were assisted by Jan Blair, a paralegal who billed $225 an hour.

On Aug. 27, Blair spent a half hour to “research and review litigation pleadings” to prepare materials for Springer’s review—though Springer never billed for the review of those materials. The case isn’t specified.

It was the final entry from the firm before the contract ended a few days later on Aug. 31.

“It feels weird that the statement invoice of what was being paid for is vastly different than what was put on the description of legal services,” said Andrew Cates, an ethics attorney in Texas. “Somebody should answer for why those are so different.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/a5df7fc/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F89%2F1d5ea5744eed811798b67158f622%2Fgettyimages-460704473.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 13:01:53.805779

Following several years of robust growth fueled by the global shift toward electrification and increasing demand for transmission solutions, additional cooling systems manufacturing capacity has become essential. To secure the future of operations, the company is acquiring the industrial property Björnen 12, which will serve as the central hub for continued investment and development in Landskrona.

The new facility enables Hitachi Energy to consolidate its current production and office spaces under one roof, which is expected to enhance efficiency and innovation. The total investment for the acquisition, adaptation, and development of the facility amounts to approx. SEK 700 million (approx. $77 million USD). Owning and adapting the facility provides cost-effectiveness and flexibility, enabling continued expansion in line with the business’ growth.

The three current addresses in Landskrona – Faktorigatan, Axeltofta, and Sliperigatan – have been expanded over time and have now reached their expansion limits.

The electrification mandate will only worsen the state’s punishing housing crisis, said Michael Fazio, executive director of the New York State Builders Association.
The Climate Act mandated that by 2035 the state should have nine gigawatts of offshore wind.
The Department of the Interior is “halting future offshore wind lease sales,” Secretary Doug Burgum announced in July.
The state needs to meet the Climate Act deadlines unless the Legislature amends the law, state Supreme Court Justice Julian Schreibman ruled in October.","New York’s sweeping 2019 Climate Act set strict mandates for shifting away from fossil fuels to more “clean energy” sources. But with progress stagnating and consumers bearing more costs, it’s increasingly harder to ignore the gap between policy ambition and the state’s ability to deliver.

The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act established into law a series of priority requirements:

Greenhouse gas emissions in the state need to be reduced 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050 relative to 1990 levels.

The state’s electric system should use 70% renewable power by 2030, and be 100% clean energy in 2040.

The “beauty and the beast” of the Climate Act is that while it sets strict mandates, it does not lay out how to meet them, said Vincent M. Nolette, who maintains a tracker of the state’s progress on climate action for Columbia Law School.

A year after the legislation passed, the state formed the Climate Action Council, whose 22 members included energy sector experts, state officials and other stakeholders who were tasked with mapping out a plan on how to meet the law’s directives.

But some say the state never fully considered the cost of implementing the law or what it would take to meet the decarbonization requirements.

“There was no fiscal (analysis) and there was no statement of how effective this will be, it was just like we have a crisis,” said Ron Epstein, a former executive deputy commissioner at the state Department of Transportation.

Epstein agreed climate change is a “crisis,” but he said the plan was never studied for its financial effects on New Yorkers.

“To be determined” is what’s listed under the “fiscal implications” section of the law on the New York Senate’s website.

National Grid customers pay an extra 9.5% on their electric bills to fund components of the law, according to a recent state Department of Public Service report. But more than $8 billion in transmission projects to connect renewable energy development to the grid has yet to be added to New Yorkers’ electric bills.

There have been areas of success toward meeting clean energy and emission reduction requirements, but overall the state is far behind. The Department of Public Service’s report also found the renewable energy requirement won’t be met until at least 2033, three years after the law requires.

New York’s grid is also dirtier today than it was when the law passed. That can be largely attributed to former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s decision to close Indian Point, a nuclear power plant in Westchester County.

Even though certain sectors like electricity and large industry have seen emissions declines, there’s only been about a 9% decrease in carbon dioxide emissions relative to 1990 levels, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

All-electric buildings

Buildings make up 31% of the state’s fossil fuel emissions, more than any other sector. The Legislature passed a law requiring new homes be built without fossil fuel appliances starting next year and, in 2029, it will apply to all new buildings.

But when those rules will go into effect remains unclear because the state abruptly agreed to pause implementation of the policy until a legal challenge brought by home builders and labor unions is resolved. Attorneys for the state had been defending the mandates in legal disputes until Hochul publicly said she was open to delaying the electric building requirements, which critics contend will drive up construction costs and contribute to the housing shortage.

Fossil fuel opponents counter electrified homes will not only be better for the environment but also cheaper in the long run. The policy is critical to moving the state off natural gas for home heating. Instead, electric homes utilize heat pumps, which extract warmth from cool outside air. More than 22,000 heat pumps were installed in homes and businesses across the state last year.

The electrification mandate will only worsen the state’s punishing housing crisis, said Michael Fazio, executive director of the New York State Builders Association. It will cost around $5,000 more to build an average-sized home in Albany County that is in compliance with the new rules, according to data from a state study and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Those homes would have lower energy bills, but it will take around 11 years for those savings to catch up with the additional construction costs.

A group of 19 Assembly Democrats signed onto a petition calling for the rules to be delayed “pending thorough reassessment of grid reliability, cost impacts and risk mitigation.”

Assemblyman William Conrad III, who drafted the petition, said he’s worried about grid reliability as large electric users like AI data centers and Micron’s chip fab plants expand in western New York.

Solar on every roof

The Climate Act requires the installation of six gigawatts of rooftop and small-scale solar by the end of this year, enough to power roughly 1 million homes. The state reached that goal a year early and is anticipating more than 10 gigawatts being online by the end of the decade.

Incentives, funded in part by fees on New Yorkers’ utility bills, cover a large share of the cost to install solar on rooftops. Low- to middle-income New Yorkers can get more assistance to cover the upfront cost of rooftop solar. Growth may slow as a federal tax credit covering up to 30% of a system’s cost is scheduled to end this year as a result of the Republican-led Big Beautiful Bill Act.

New York is a national leader in community solar projects, with three times more installed than any other state. The arrays take up less than 100 acres, with nearby homes and businesses getting the biggest share of the electricity produced. Larger solar projects are sited at the state level, limiting the role local governments and residents have in their construction.

Matthew Antonio, director of National Grid’s transmission control center, said the proliferation of small-scale solar projects “has made our hot days a little bit easier to manage.”

The same progress hasn’t been made in building up large-scale wind and solar power projects.

New York is 19th in wind and solar energy capacity, despite seeing above-average growth over the last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

New York has 20 times the population of South Dakota but produces about the same amount of wind and solar power.

Cost can be a huge factor.

Because other states are usually sunnier and windier than New York, more renewable energy can be produced at the same upfront cost, thus lowering the eventual amount paid by residents.

Build it offshore

New York’s Atlantic Ocean shoreline makes the state an optimal place to build up offshore wind. The slow rollout of those resources is indicative of the unending setbacks to the Climate Act. Wind blows much faster over the ocean’s surface than over land, meaning those facilities more often produce at maximum capacity.

The Climate Act mandated that by 2035 the state should have nine gigawatts of offshore wind. About 1% of that goal is in service.

When former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed the mandates into law, he concurrently announced two offshore wind projects off the coast of Long Island. When completed, Empire Wind One and Sunrise Wind are expected to provide nearly two gigawatts of electricity. Cuomo promised they would be in place by 2024, but they’re both delayed three years.

In May, Hochul fought a federal halt on the Empire Wind One project, allowing it to continue construction. Offshore wind development relies on federal approval because it’s built in federal waters.

It may be a challenge for New York to make further progress on the offshore wind mandate as President Donald J. Trump’s administration has questioned the ability of those projects to provide energy versus the costs associated with fossil fuels.

The Department of the Interior is “halting future offshore wind lease sales,” Secretary Doug Burgum announced in July.

Burgum said he’s also examining more than 3.5 million acres offshore that were designated as pre-approved wind development zones under President Joe Biden’s administration.

The industry was suffering before Trump took office. In 2024, developers canceled another offshore project near Long Island, citing inflation, high interest rates and supply chain issues. After a decade of declining prices thanks to low interest rates, the cost of offshore wind projects increased 40% to 60% between 2020 and 2024, the consulting firm McKinsey reported last year.

Yet to launch

Implementing a cap-and-invest program where large manufacturing and fossil fuel power plants pay to emit greenhouse gases is a core component of achieving the 2019 law’s mandates. About 30% of payments are then given back to New Yorkers in rebates.

The rest goes toward investments to “support the transition to a less carbon-intensive economy,” according to the Department of Environmental Conservation.

Hochul directed state agencies in early 2023 to develop the program to “create a cleaner, greener future while helping New Yorkers with the costs of the transition.”

The rules were completed by state agency staff early this year but never released, Politico reported.

Without guaranteed revenue from cap-and-invest, the Climate Act is an “unfunded mandate,” Donohue said.

And for Hochul, the risk of implementing the measures under the timeline set in the law is too likely to increase living costs for New Yorkers.

Low-income New Yorkers would see a small savings from the program, while costs would rise for middle-income residents, according to state research on cap-and-invest.

But the state’s cap-and-invest study doesn’t “include estimates of the program’s full fiscal and economic impacts,” wrote the Citizens Budget Commission, a New York-based nonpartisan think tank.

“It’s going to make businesses less likely to do business here, or to create jobs or to expand here,” state Senate Minority Leader Robert G. Ortt said.

Delaying implementation may be out of Hochul’s control. The state needs to meet the Climate Act deadlines unless the Legislature amends the law, state Supreme Court Justice Julian Schreibman ruled in October.

Schreibman gave the state Department of Environmental Conservation until February to release its rules to bring down carbon emissions.

Hochul signaled the state will appeal the ruling while she works with the Legislature to amend the Climate Law and push back the mandates.

‘Guinea pig’

By 2035, all newly purchased passenger vehicles in the state are required to be electric. And the state’s roughly 45,000 school buses need to be zero-emission by the same deadline.

About 10% of new car purchases in New York are electric. That’s about half the rate of California.

So far, New York has 229 electric school buses in operation, with about 800 more on the way, according to the Electric School Bus Initiative. Purchasing enough buses for the mandate will cost more than $9 billion, according to the Empire Center, an Albany-based research organization. Incentive programs will cover 10% of that added cost, the center said.

Almost half of school districts told the state Education Department they need to make significant upgrades to their local electric system to support electric bus charging. Electric buses are up to two-and-a-half times more expensive than fossil fuel alternatives, the Education Department reported last year.

Electrifying the state’s school bus fleet would have the greenhouse gas reduction effect of taking 180,000 cars off the road, according to state estimates. Exposure to diesel exhaust, which the vast majority of school buses emit, leads to asthma and respiratory illnesses, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“Why are we making our school districts and local property taxpayers be the guinea pig for this social experiment,” state Assemblyman Philip A. Palmesano said of the school bus mandate.",https://www.adirondackexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screen-Shot-2025-12-15-at-9.19.17-AM.png,N,,2025-12-15 11:02:29.825179

6.2 Approach to risk management summary Risk management for DRIVE35 is systematic and embedded in programme delivery.","1. Executive summary

The DRIVE35 (Driving Research and Investment in Vehicle Electrification) Business Case seeks final approval to launch a £2 billion programme over 5 years from the financial year 2025 to 2026 to the financial year 2029 to 2030. It seeks to transform the UK’s zero emission vehicle (ZEV) manufacturing and supply chain. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) delivers this programme through formal grant funding agreements (GFAs) with the Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) and Innovate UK (IUK).

Following approval of the DRIVE35 Business Case, a further £500 million was allocated to support ZEV research and development (R&D) as part of the Industrial Strategy and Advanced Manufacturing Sector Plan. This funding is considered part of the DRIVE35 Programme, bringing the total Capital Departmental Expenditure Level (CDEL) funding allocated to DRIVE35 to £2.5 billion.

DRIVE35 is structured around 3 coherent and modular pillars, each designed to funnel innovation into the others:

innovation pillar: seeks to distribute R&D grants to develop strategically important zero-emission vehicle technologies, bringing new systems and prototypes to technology readiness

scale-up pillar: aims to distribute R&D grants to fast-track near-commercial pilots for zero-emission vehicle technologies, enabling manufacturing and market readiness

transformation pillar: looks to distribute capital grants to drive the industrialisation of an electrified automotive sector in the UK, from vehicle plants to their supply chains

1.1 Programme objectives

The DRIVE35 programme objectives are to:

substantially increase inward investments into the UK automotive sector

secure and create high-quality jobs in the UK automotive industry

deliver significant emission reductions, meeting the government’s climate obligations

strengthen supply chain resilience, anchoring future vehicle assembly

help achieve the required battery manufacturing capacity

enable a decade of R&D investment in UK automotive

DRIVE35 will provide a simpler, faster, and more effective government offer to investors, building on the track record from previous APC and Automotive Transformation Fund (ATF) programmes and competitions. The delivery model is a consortium arrangement between APC, IUK, and DBT, ensuring value for money, operational efficiency and continuity in delivery, building upon industry confidence and ensuring a smooth transition to the new programme.

As outlined in the Business Case, DRIVE35 requires £2.04 billion in capital and R&D funding, alongside required resource funding. The programme has robust governance, risk management, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements in place. Total funding, as announced in the Industrial Strategy, is £2.5 billion through to 2035, however this document summarises the programme’s original full Business Case.

2. Strategic case

DRIVE35 is designed to secure the UK’s position as a global leader in ZEV manufacturing and supply chains. The programme addresses the need for the UK automotive sector to strengthen its competitiveness amid rapid technological change, global competition, and ambitious climate targets.

This is an essential part of the actions that government will deploy to increase the volume of vehicles made in the UK to over 1.3 million cars and commercial vehicles by 2035, as set out in the UK’s Industrial Strategy.

DRIVE35 fundamentally reviews, streamlines and consolidates previous support into 3 coherent pillars:

innovation pillar

scale-up pillar

transformation pillar

This maximises impact and bridges the gap between innovation and industrialisation. DRIVE35 aims to:

increase inward investment

create and secure high-quality jobs

deliver significant emission reductions

strengthen supply chain resilience

support long-term R&D investment

2.1 Strategic alignment

DRIVE35 aligns with government missions to:

kickstart economic growth, by supporting jobs and productivity growth

make Britain a clean energy superpower, by accelerating ZEVs and battery manufacturing

DRIVE35 is integral to the UK’s Industrial Strategy, helping to drive increased electric vehicle (EV) supply chain manufacturing, anchor future vehicle assembly and battery manufacturing in the UK, and ensuring the UK remains at the forefront of automotive innovation, electrification and sustainability.

Investment under DRIVE35 will help achieve our ambitions to nearly double the annual business investment in the UK advanced manufacturing from £21 billion to £39 billion in 2035, driving growth across our economy. ​DRIVE35 will help achieve the Industrial Strategy ambition to increase the volume of vehicles made in the UK to over 1.3 million cars by 2035.

DRIVE35 will work alongside the National Wealth Fund (NWF), who have a mandate to invest £27.8 billion in sectors aligned to the Industrial Strategy, including automotive. Together, DRIVE35 and the NWF represent a complementary and multi-layered offer to investors, combining grants and other policy instruments from the government with a suite of financial products, to increase support across the EV supply chain.

3. Economic case

The economic rationale for DRIVE35 is based on correcting market failures such as:

high entry cost

technology lock-in

co-ordination failures

the need for greater R&D investment

The programme was appraised against a range of options, with the preferred approach being a backloaded funding profile that aligns support with industry demand and minimises underspend.

DRIVE35 is forecast to:

leverage £6.6 billion in private investment

support over 50,000 jobs

cut up to 10.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂e) in the UK

The programme is expected to deliver a Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) of 4.8, representing high value for money. Additional benefits include enhanced battery manufacturing capacity, reduced dependence on overseas supply chains, and regional economic growth.

3.1 Summary of the analysis of different options

The DRIVE35 Business Case considered a range of options for government intervention in the UK automotive sector, including:

‘do nothing’

extending existing programmes

several configurations of the new DRIVE35 programme

Each option was assessed for its ability to address market failures, deliver value for money, and achieve strategic objectives.

3.2 Shortlist of options

The final shortlist included:

Option 1: only committed spend to 2025 (baseline – do nothing)

Option 3b: DRIVE35 programme with backloaded funding (preferred)

Option 3c: DRIVE35 programme with a flat funding profile

Option 4c: DRIVE35 with a flat profile, extending the £2.04 billion capital and R&D budgets to 2035

3.3 Type of economic appraisal used

The department used social cost-benefit analysis to appraise the options. This approach quantified both the costs and the monetised benefits of each option, including employment and R&D spillovers to assess overall value for money.

3.4 Costs, benefits, and risks of shortlisted options

All shortlisted options assumed a total nominal cost of £2.04 billion (capital and R&D).

The preferred option (3b, backloaded DRIVE35) had a discounted net present social value (NPSV) of £6.1 billion and a BCR of 4.8, representing very high value for money. Other options had slightly lower BCRs and NPSVs but followed similar spending profiles.

Risks included the potential for underspend if funding was not aligned with industry demand, and the risk that insufficient intervention would lead to loss of competitiveness, jobs, and investment in the UK sector.

3.5 Rationale for the choice of preferred option

Option 3b (DRIVE35 with backloaded funding) was chosen because it:

best aligns funding with forecast industry demand

minimises the risk of underspend

maximises the opportunity for programme benefits to be realised

It also scored highest against critical success factors such as:

strategic fit

ability to address market failures

value for money

deliverability

4. Commercial case

The commercial case for DRIVE35 looked at the options available to deliver the programme from maintaining the existing model, in-housing, or through to outsourcing.

The 5 options that were considered are:

Option A: consortium with DBT: IUK and APC reappointed to work alongside DBT

Option B: consortium with DBT: new delivery partners

Option C: fully outsource to IUK and APC

Option D: fully outsource to new delivery partners

Option E: un-house delivery using DBT resource

Each option (A to E) was assessed against the criteria that were developed in alignment with the recommendations from the Cabinet Office’s Sourcing Playbook, and ranked as high, medium, or low alignment.

The options were assessed against:

value for money

operational efficiency and mobilisation

proven success and experience

technical and sector expertise

industry confidence and familiarity

separation of key functions

Option A, which maintained existing arrangements, scored highest and was identified as the preferred delivery model. This option ensures operational efficiency, continuity, technical expertise, and strong industry relationships which IUK and APC are uniquely positioned to leverage. This is complemented by policy direction from the DBT Automotive Unit, alongside grant management expertise and oversight from the DBT Grant Delivery Directorate.

The preferred approach offers strong value for money, operational efficiency, and proven delivery capability. This is because:

as a non-profit organisation, APC operates on a not-for-profit basis – this ensures cost-effectiveness compared to commercial alternatives, which would likely incur higher costs

operationally, the existing arrangement enables immediate mobilisation, building on established structures, teams, and roles already in place – this continuity avoids the delays and disruption that would result from onboarding new delivery partners and provides familiarity for applicants and stakeholders

the current delivery consortium has a decade-long track record of success, having supported over 58,000 jobs and delivered significant carbon dioxide (CO₂) savings – working with government, this delivery consortium has leveraged over £6 billion in private investment, demonstrating its effectiveness in catalysing industry engagement

this delivery model ensured a clear separation of responsibilities between APC, IUK, and DBT.

From a legal and procurement perspective, this arrangement is structured as a grant funding agreement (GFA), not a contract for services, and is therefore not subject to public procurement regulations.

The commercial case also addresses how the delivery model will be implemented, and considers:

payment mechanisms

contract management

intellectual property

diversity and inclusion

sustainability

transformation of undertakings, protection of employment (TUPE)

modern slavery

The case notes that there will likely be ad hoc delivery requirements that are only anticipated to arise when required or at specific points in the programme lifecycle.

These could include:

professional services

research

monitoring and evaluation services

Such services will be procured as and when required through standard competitive tendering processes in line with the applicable procurement regulations and DBT commercial policy.

5. Finance case

As per the original Business Case, the financial plan for DRIVE35 requests £2.04 billion in CDEL funding over 5 years, plus required Resource Departmental Expenditure Limits (RDEL) funding. Of the total CDEL allocation, 75% is allocated to capital grants (transformation), and 25% to R&D grants (innovation and scale-up).

The spending profile is designed to flexibly respond to forecast industry demand. It reflects the appetite across both the UK and global markets, as demonstrated through previous APC and ATF legacy competitions.

R&D funding will be delivered through GFA with APC and IUK, with robust financial controls, risk management, and assurance processes in place. Capital funding is delivered directly from DBT. The plan is designed to be flexible and responsive to market conditions, with regular reviews and adjustments as needed.

5.1 Financial assumptions

The financial assumptions for DRIVE35 set out how funding will be managed, classified, and controlled throughout the programme. Transformation grants will use CDEL funding, while innovation grants and tech scale-ups will use R&D CDEL funding, each disbursed under the relevant spending powers.

Each sub-programme will run several funding competitions, with application windows to help manage resources and budget. The plan assumes the programme ends in 2030, with grant payments subject to HM Treasury (HMT) approval.

6. Management case

6.1 Programme structure and governance

DRIVE35 is part of the Government Major Project Portfolio (GMPP). The delivery of DRIVE35 is organised around 3 main pillars:

innovation pillar

scale-up pillar

transformation pillar

These are managed concurrently under the oversight of a central Programme Governance Board, the DRIVE35 Strategic Board. The DBT Automotive Unit leads the programme, supported by the Grant Delivery Team, sector analysis, and external delivery partners, namely the APC and IUK.

The governance structure is multi-layered. At the top is the DRIVE35 Strategic Board, which is chaired by the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO). This board is supported by a Monitoring and Evaluation Governance Board and 2 sub-programme Delivery Boards.

Delivery consortia for each funding stream are also established, ensuring that operational and strategic oversight is maintained throughout the programme’s lifecycle. Escalation routes are defined, allowing issues to be raised from project level up to ministerial level as required.

The programme’s success is dependent on several factors. These include timely approval and budget confirmation from HMT, effective collaboration with delivery partners, alignment with other government programmes and regulatory frameworks, and the availability of skilled staff and resources within both DBT and its partners.

6.2 Approach to risk management summary

Risk management for DRIVE35 is systematic and embedded in programme delivery. All risks, assumptions, issues, and dependencies are recorded in a central risks, actions, issues and decisions (RAID) log, which is reviewed monthly for each programme in meetings with delivery partners.

Risks are assessed using DBT’s 5-point scale for probability and impact and are categorised by proximity. Ownership of risks is assigned to the most appropriate delivery partner or DBT function, and escalation routes are in place for risks that fall outside of tolerance to ensure appropriate actions are taken and mitigations applied.

6.3 Evaluation plan summary

The DRIVE35 M&E plan sets out a clear framework for systematically measuring the progress of DRIVE35. It is designed to produce evidence on the effectiveness of the programme’s delivery, and the extent to which the programme is on track to deliver its intended outcomes and value for money.

The DRIVE35 M&E plan is expected to deliver:

a comprehensive evaluation framework, setting out the future process and impact evaluations

a baseline exercise, aiming to collect data on the automotive sector prior to the launch of DRIVE35

a process evaluation of each DRIVE35 pillar, alongside an overarching synthesis of findings

an impact evaluation of each DRIVE35 pillar, alongside an overarching synthesis of findings – these will include a Value for Money (VfM) evaluation",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-12-15 12:02:38.002654

But that's all reportedly about to go out the window. This week, EU officials, under immense pressure from the auto industry, are expected to unveil a new set of standards that take the gas-car ban off the table. Is this a moment of relief for the car business, or a chance to double down on 20th-century technology while rivals from China only get faster and better?

25%: What Happens If The EU Backs Off The Gas-Car Ban

EU regulators have sought to end internal-combustion new cars on the continent as part of an ambitious effort to fight climate change. But automakers have long complained that switching to battery-powered and software-driven cars before buyers were “ready” would effectively destroy the continent’s most important manufacturing sector.

No country beat this drum louder than Germany, home to Europe’s largest auto industry, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz last week called the move a win: “We need to correct the conditions in Europe as quickly as possible so that this industry in Europe has a future,” he said at a press briefing.

But what kind of future? Europe’s problem is that China’s automakers aren’t just beating down its door, but have already moved into some of the rooms and invited their friends. Chinese brands—typically with EVs and hybrids—are stealing sales from local automakers, and increasingly setting up European factories as well.

So one expert who spoke to Bloomberg asked: if a change in regulations allows European automakers to double down on ICE, what guarantee exists that they’ll have the technology to compete with China?

While the breathing room might be welcome for an industry that accounts for about €1 trillion ($1.2 trillion) of economic output, it also harbors risks. Too much flexibility threatens to slow development and increase the technology gap with Tesla Inc. and Chinese rivals such as BYD Co. That could result in the EU becoming a bastion for yesterday’s technology and doing little to bolster the sector’s flagging competitiveness.

“What’s happening now is a wake up call for the industry,” said Jos Delbeke, professor at the European University Institute in Florence and a former senior EU climate official. “Some flexibility may be needed for all good reasons, but it should be temporary; otherwise we will risk missing the climate targets and losing the technology race.”

There are some upsides to the EU’s change of plans, Bloomberg reports. Incentives will be expanded, especially for small cars made in the region. And the automakers could be on the hook for a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions for their fleets from 2035 onward—still a steep and ambitious target.

But if automakers got regulators to blink once, they may be able to do it again. And that’s bad news for the climate, for technological competitiveness, and ultimately for jobs as well.

50%: America’s Looser Fuel Economy Rules Probably Won’t Save Us Money

Gas Prices

When it comes to going back to gasoline, America has looked at the rest of the world and said, “Hold my beer.” Not only has the Trump administration axed EV tax credits and Biden-era rules driving a more electric market, it recently announced a cut to fuel economy standards—ostensibly, to make new cars cheaper.

But an Automotive News analysis shows that even if new car prices go down by a whopping $900 or so, as the White House has predicted, whatever savings drivers get will be erased by paying more at the pump:

But if the proposal becomes official, companies will ditch fuel-saving technologies and consumers will pay at least $187 more over the lifetime of the vehicle, even with the expected price savings upfront, according to an appendix to NHTSA’s proposal.

The net cost of passenger car and light truck ownership will increase by between $187 and $506 over the vehicle lifetime, driven by a total increase in fuel costs of $1,112 to $1,431 for the 2031 model year, NHTSA said.

When asked about the net losses for individual consumers, a NHTSA spokesperson, Sean Rushton, said the agency’s analysis “does not factor in how the Trump Administration has already saved the American people millions at the pump by unleashing domestic oil production to record highs” and that the Biden administration “jacked up car prices with their illegal EV mandate and anti-energy agenda.”

The NHTSA calculus assumes fuel prices will “generally remain around” $3 to $3.20 per gallon through 2050. It also figures prices will dip below $3 per gallon in 2028.

The Trump administration has blamed the strain of fuel economy regulations and the push to EVs for soaring new-car prices. But as that Automotive News story notes, even federal regulators can’t completely back up that idea. That story is worth a read in full.

75%: BYD Is Moving On Up, Because It Has To

Fangchengbao Bao 5

Chinese automaker BYD has proven this year that it’s going to be a force to be reckoned with in the auto industry for a long time. But even it’s got some growing pains. Its sales are slowing down, primarily at home in China, where competition is fierce and the market is cooling off after years of unprecedented growth.

So if you can’t win on volume, you win on profit margins. That’s why BYD is betting big on its two new upmarket brands: Denza and Fangchengbao. The former is a kind of high-performance Porsche competitor (not to be confused with BYD’s Yangwang, which is doing similar stuff) and the other is an off-road-focused luxury competitor to Land Rover. Here’s more from Nikkei Asia:

The off-road-oriented Fangchengbao began delivering vehicles to customers in November 2023 and plans to expand its lineup to include a sedan in 2026. BYD positions it as an unconventional brand, appealing to a niche not covered by the company's mass-market autos like the Ocean and Dynasty series.

The Bao series of plug-in hybrid off-road vehicles tout high performance even on rough terrain. The Tai series, designed for both off-road and urban driving, debuted this year.

The Tai 7 is a plug-in hybrid, like the Bao 5, and comparable in size. The model has less power and acceleration than the Bao 5, and its exterior design is simple and geared toward city driving. But its price starts at 179,800 yuan ($25,500), 60,000 yuan cheaper than the Bao 5.

The Tai 7 sold about 20,000 units in October, helping lift Fangchengbao's sales that month to 31,052 vehicles, a roughly 400% year-on-year increase. The Tai 7 became Fangchengbao's biggest hit to date.

""We currently have a six- to eight-week waiting period for delivery, so we're going to increase production capacity to meet demand,"" Xiong Tianbo, Fangchengbao's general manager, told Chinese media.

It may just work. BYD is a smart company when it comes to product planning, branching out into electric kei cars in Japan and plug-in hybrid estate wagons in Europe. It has a penchant for figuring out what buyers want. Now, will they bite outside of China?

Look, I wouldn't exactly kick and scream if you dropped a vintage Porsche 911 into my garage tomorrow.

But beyond that, I've been driving and testing EVs long enough that I have zero interest in buying a new gas car ever again. I'm pretty much done and happy with that. What about you? Are any of these regulatory moves enough to entice you back to a gas car, or are you staying flexible? Let us know in the comments.

Several state supreme court justices who participated in the program sat down with brief interviews with State Court Report, which we are publishing as a series.

North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs has served on the North Carolina Supreme Court since 2023. She was appointed by Gov. Roy Cooper (D), who had previously named her to the state’s Court of Appeals in 2022. Prior to serving on the bench, Riggs was a prominent civil rights lawyer focusing on voting rights. In 2024, Riggs’s election win to keep her seat on the state high court received national attention after her opponent refused to concede, despite multiple recounts confirming his loss, and tried to have legally cast votes throw out. It took six months and battles in both state and federal court for her race to be confirmed.

In her interview, Riggs spoke about the drawbacks of partisan judicial races, new challenges created by artificial intelligence (AI), and how she models the behavior she’d like to see on the bench.

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

When you were in law school, what did you expect your legal career to look like?

I applied to law school thinking I’d be an environmental lawyer. I have a degree in microbiology and a master’s degree in the history of science, and it seemed like a natural progression for someone interested in the sciences. But by the end of law school, I knew I was going to focus on civil rights.

It wasn’t until I was practicing that I realized the significance of the temperament and character and values of the judges I was appearing before — and even more significantly, what that meant for my clients and how they understood the justice system. It was like, “Oh, that is another level at which I can use this degree to do some good someday!” But I didn’t have it on my bingo card for 2022. I got married in 2021 and thought I would just keep doing the job that I enjoyed doing and enjoy my personal life. I’ve campaigned with people who knew they wanted to be a judge from very early on; I had about 80 different iterations of what I wanted to be before I finally landed there.

What advice do you wish someone had given you when you were a law student?

I wish I’d been pressed harder to clerk. I spent a lot of time in law school doing direct client work with a clinic, helping people apply for clemency to have their civil rights restored in Florida. I enjoyed that client work so much that it was all I could think about. The idea of sitting quietly and doing a lot of research and writing was not particularly appealing to me at that stage in my life. But it was an opportunity I should have availed myself of before practice sweeps you up and you’re on a steep learning curve. That quiet time will never come back.

I was lucky that my practice early on was fairly generalist. That’s also something that clerking can give you — that sense of seeing a wide range of what the practice looks like. It helps you make better decisions that are better fits for you. It’s beneficial to you have that generalist experience in clerking, that quiet time early in your career to focus on learning the doctrine and thinking about how decisions are made.

What challenges do students face today that are different from your experience?

I can’t imagine what it’s like to go through law school with AI. It would feel intimidating to get an education in a time when it seems like a lot of information is being generated that way.

Also, folks who are graduating now feel like they’re entering an uncertain job market. I graduated in 2009, on the tail end of the recession. The legal job market had crashed. It didn’t think it was going to directly impact me, although it had such domino effects that there was no one who left school then who didn’t feel the impact. Obviously, student debt was bad then, but it’s worse now.

What do you enjoy about being a state court judge?

I am at a stage in life where I like sitting quietly and reading and thinking — it feels luxurious, especially coming off a campaign. I also really enjoy trying to model the behavior I wanted to see from people on the bench when I was litigating. We frequently have attorneys before us who are arguing for the first time. I was in their shoes not all that long ago, and I was front of judges who were gruff and unkind and unnecessarily brusque, and it didn’t have to be that way. It also didn’t build my client’s confidence. So, I smile at every person who steps up to the podium, even if I do look a little bit discordant compared to my colleagues.

The first time I argued in the U.S. Supreme Court, I stood up to the podium and I was a little nervous and Justice [Elena] Kagan gave me a gentle smile. It wasn’t inappropriate, it wasn’t over the top, but it was, in that moment, incredibly meaningful to me because I saw it as a non-verbal, “I see you. You’ve worked hard to get here. Make your best argument. I’m interested to hear what you have to say.” And that made me a better advocate in the moment. It stuck with me. I had ample experience by then, and yet it was a bit of a unique experience. And then you start to think, “Wait, why is this such a unique experienced?” So, getting to sit in those rarefied spaces, I can help make that change. When it comes to the folks who come before my court — no matter what their arguments are, no matter how I ultimately rule — I have the ability to convey through my words and my actions on the bench that I’m interested in what they have to say, that I know that they’ve worked hard to get there and that their clients have put a lot of faith in them to make this argument. It is part of what I want to see more of in the legal practice, so to be able to model it is rewarding and enjoyable.

What is something people might not know about your state constitution?

In the U.S. Constitution, you have the Bill of Rights appended to the end of the Constitution, whereas ours (and this isn’t uncommon), precedes the constitution. To me that matters — structurally, visually, in all the ways. Before we talk about the three branches of government, we talk about popular sovereignty and that power is in the hands of the people. That the guiding document begins with a recognition of the rights of people of the state is a way for me to remember why I’m here and why I am doing this. It’s the lens through which everything that comes after it is filtered.

What are opinions you’ve participated in that are the most memorable to you?

The first time I felt the full import of work that I was doing was while I was still a judge on the Court of Appeals. The North Carolina legislature had unanimously passed a statute to allow victims of child sex abuse to bring claims after the expiration of the statute of limitations, in the light of the understandable delayed disclosure of many victims. It’s a very politically charged issue. Parts of the bar were very opposed to it and parts were very in favor of it. I was on a panel and wrote a bipartisan decision upholding the Safe Child Act as a constitutional exercise of the legislature’s power in recognition of the unique circumstances of the childhood victims of these egregious practices and behaviors. I got to talk about the statutes of limitations and procedural hurdles and was really proud to do that. And it was unanimously upheld by the North Carolina Supreme Court.

Then, when I was on the supreme court, I wrote a dissent in a case where Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was seeking to take his name off the ballot in the 2024 election. It was, of course, an election law case. I had represented voters in voting rights litigation for so long, and my clients would have never succeeded in convincing a court to force a board of elections to incur millions of dollars to change the ballots and election procedures on the eve of an election — which was, essentially, what Kennedy was doing. My dissent is strongly worded because I felt I had a unique voice to describe the inconsistency of what my court did in ordering all these ballots to be reprinted at the cost of county boards of elections right before the election. I wanted folks to understand what an outlier that decision was. If different people receive a different measure of justice, it matters.

What are some challenges facing state courts?

For North Carolina, in particular, two things come to mind. One is the way we elect judges. Just having lived through that, it’s hard to reconcile with what we typically think of judges, which is that they are not your typical politicians. But the campaign finance issues and the partisan nature of these races — there’s always going to be something about that that’s a little bit off for me. I didn’t make the rules, and nobody asks me for policy advice, though I’d be willing to talk to any policymaker about my experience.

Regardless of their political affiliation, I think it ought to trouble everyone that partisan elections make it really hard to inspire faith and independence in the judiciary. People just see it as politics as usual. Plus, we are living in a time, certainly in North Carolina, when norms and traditions are eroding and our jurisprudence is changing rapidly in short time. That’s just really hard to navigate.

What is your response when people say courts are too politicized?

I remind people that these are decisions that the legislature gets to make. In North Carolina, we used to have nonpartisan judicial elections. We used to do public financing of judicial elections. But I play with the hand dealt to me. That’s the best that I can do. I serve all the people of North Carolina regardless of their registration or voting histories.

Europe’s wind industry continues to drive economic growth, energy security and employment. The European Wind Energy Workforce Report, published today, sees employment in wind growing from 443,000 jobs today to over 600,000 by 2030. The report has granular data on current employment levels and vacancies, and the most sought-after profiles and the skills required in the wind industry. It highlights the importance of the right vocational training and shows Europe needs a more strategic approach to workforce planning.

Wind energy is cementing its position as a pillar of Europe’s economy. Wind is more than clean, secure and home-grown electricity. It’s a major source of high-value jobs and industrial growth. That’s the main finding of Europe’s Wind Energy Workforce Report which WindEurope published today.

Europe’s wind energy industry today supports 443,000 jobs. 211,000 of those are direct jobs, spanning from wind farm development to manufacturing, installation, operation and decommissioning. Onshore wind remains the largest employer, but offshore wind is gaining ground, now accounting for 20% of direct jobs.

Employment in wind is set to steadily increase over the remainder of the decade. By 2030 the sector will provide 607,000 jobs. This assumes that Europe installs on average 30 GW annually over 2025-2030, in line with the latest WindEurope 2030 Outlook.

Wind energy has a truly European manufacturing footprint. Nearly half of all the direct jobs in wind are in manufacturing. Europe has more than 250 factories producing wind turbines and equipment for the grid connections. Over the last two years the industry has invested more than €14bn in new or expanded factories, some of which are portrayed in our Wind Works for Europe video series.

Wind energy expansion remains below target

Employment in wind could be growing even faster. But Europe is not building enough wind energy to meet its energy security and climate targets. As it stands the EU will have 344 GW of wind energy by 2030, well short of its 425 GW target. Persistent bottlenecks to a faster expansion of wind include cumbersome permitting, the insufficient build-out of electricity grids, the slow uptake of electrification and poor national auction design.

Wind jobs growing steadily, potential skills shortage too

The European wind sector faces serious skills shortages. Europe’s Wind Energy Workforce Report identifies 235 job profiles across the wind farm lifecycle and highlights critical gaps. Most urgently, 7,000 blade technicians, 6,500 field engineers and 5,000 pre-assembly technicians are needed before 2030. Addressing these skills shortages is essential for Europe to meet its wind energy ambitions.

This will require a more strategic approach to workforce planning. WindEurope’s new report can help here. It offers real-life data to help identify priority roles at every stage of the wind supply chain. Policymakers must endeavour to scale up training programmes for key roles. They must encourage retraining workers from other sectors. They should harmonise certifications and enable EU-wide skills mobility. And they should promote diversity in technical and leadership roles to ensure a sufficiently big talent pool.

8 out of 10 critical roles where we see the largest shortage will rely on Vocational Education and Training (VET). Europe has to give more visibility to these career paths and increase their attractiveness.

What is the industry doing about it?

Europe’s wind energy workforce is getting ready to power the continent’s energy transition. With the right investment in skills and collaboration, the sector will continue to deliver jobs, innovation, and climate solutions for all Europeans.

As a first practical step, WindEurope will launch a Workforce Development Tool, enabling users to filter workforce data by country, lifecycle phase, and specific job profiles. This will help anticipate training needs, direct investment strategically, and establish new training centres where they are most needed.",https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/Workstream-analysis-cover-1200x675-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 13:01:11.583406

Bottom Line and Practical Implications for the Regulated Community EPA’s “Compliance First” policy could be a structural shift in enforcement philosophy.","Companies have long dreaded litigation filed by federal environmental regulators because such cases tended to last forever and posed financial and representational risk.

On December 5, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) internally circulated a memorandum — which has leaked to the public — that reorients civil enforcement activities around a single guiding principle: “Compliance First.” This shift, at least as outlined in the memorandum signed by Acting Assistant Administrator Craig J. Pritzlaff, signals a deliberate move away from enforcement strategies that prioritize punitive measures or expansive interpretations of regulatory authority in favor of efforts which promote achieving timely, efficient, and legally defensible compliance.

The Policy’s Core Commitments

Since the January inauguration, the Trump Administration has stated a continuing commitment toward EPA’s traditional mission of protecting human health and the environment, including emergency response efforts. (For more, see here.) In the Trump Administration’s view, however, recent years have seen EPA stray from traditional tools to achieve these ends. The new policy memo expresses a desire to achieve better cooperation with partners (including states and even industry) and to achieve compliance without distracting from other priorities like rebooting American manufacturing or restoring “dominance” in the energy space. (See “Pillar 2” here.)

The “Compliance First” memorandum centers around the question of “how can compliance be achieved in the most efficient and quickest means possible?” In EPA’s view, past enforcement postures sometimes prolonged negotiations, allowed evidence to go stale, or imposed remedies beyond statutory requirements.

Under the newly announced framework:

Compliance is the North Star: EPA wants enforcement to resolve violations quickly and bring entities into compliance, not drag out negotiations or impose broad remedies.

Legal Precision Matters: Findings and injunctive relief must reflect the “best reading” of the law with substantially less tolerance for creative interpretations. (Note, “best readings” of statutory authority square with the recent Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo – for more, see here.)

Collaboration is In: EPA is placing a greater emphasis on state coordination, open communication, and voluntary compliance tools, suggesting a more cooperative posture.

Broad Remedies Are Out: The memo rescinds 2021 guidance on expansive injunctive relief and bans supplemental environmental projects (SEPs) until further notice.

LEAPS is the New Lens: Enforcement decisions will be judged against five factors — Law, Evidence, Analysis, Programmatic impact, and Stakeholder impact. (We break further down “LEAPS” below.)

This philosophy announced in “Compliance First” essentially builds out Administrator Zeldin’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative, which frames environmental protection and economic growth as mutually reinforcing goals.

Six Pillars of the Compliance First Mandate

EPA distills the framework into six operational factors:

Compliance Assistance Toolkit. Enforcement will not be the only tool. Expect greater emphasis on proactive outreach, technical assistance, and voluntary programs like self-reporting and audits.

State Partner Coordination. Cooperative federalism is back in focus. EPA states it will act on a “clear federal interest,” coordinate closely with authorized states, and avoid duplicative actions, aiming for consistency in compliance determinations and to strengthen capacity.

Open Communication. Transparency is key. EPA commits to a “no surprises” approach, maintaining dialogue with Tribes, states, and regulated entities throughout inspections and enforcement to accelerate compliance.

Findings of Violation. Gone are the days of expansive interpretations. Findings must be “clear and unambiguous,” tailored, and based on the “best reading” of applicable law, with careful attention to canons, past practice, and live litigation. According to the memo, ambiguities will be elevated for national-level resolution to ensure consistency rather than resolved ad hoc. (Note: This approach has precedent outside of the Trump Administration; as discussed here, the Biden Administration EPA took a similar approach to “environmental justice” enforcement.)

Compliance Requirements and Injunctive Relief. Expect to see more quick and concise remedies. The memo advises that when formal enforcement is necessary, remedies must be tailored, be aimed at achieving compliance swiftly, and rest squarely within clear statutory or regulatory authority. The memo rescinds the 2021 guidance promoting broad injunctive tools and SEPs. Until further notice, SEPs are off the table.

Reasoned Decision-Making. Enter the LEAPS framework, described as a structured approach to ensure enforcement decisions are rational, transparent, and defensible.

Decoding the New Code Word: LEAPS

The memo touts the “LEAPS framework” as providing a disciplined lens for evaluating enforcement decisions. The “LEAPS” acronym breaks down as follows:

Law. Anchor every decision in the clearest, most defensible interpretation of statutory and regulatory authority.

Evidence. Build cases on unequivocal facts and “gold-standard” science; unsupported allegations erode credibility and delay compliance.

Analysis. Apply rigorous reasoning to connect evidence with legal requirements, where remedies are to be proportionate and tailored.

Programmatic Impact. Consider ripple effects across EPA programs — permitting, monitoring, and beyond — including whether the proposed enforcement would inadvertently expand regulatory scope.

Stakeholder Impact. Evaluate how actions affect states, Tribes, and regulated entities and aim to act swiftly to prevent third-party litigation from distorting policy.

Next Steps: Process Consistency and Forthcoming Tools

To reduce ambiguity across air, water, waste, and chemicals programs, EPA intends to work with the US Office of General Counsel to consolidate criteria across all media defining when violations warrant formal enforcement, informal enforcement, or field warnings, improving national consistency and public transparency. Until that guidance is issued, the memo advises case teams to follow current practices informed by the memo’s principles.

EPA also sets a national escalation pathway for legal ambiguity. According to the memo, where a facility raises a credible interpretive concern, or staff identify material ambiguity, issues must be promptly elevated to ensure nationally consistent application of federal law.

Bottom Line and Practical Implications for the Regulated Community

EPA’s “Compliance First” policy could be a structural shift in enforcement philosophy. By embedding LEAPS into decision-making and rescinding prior guidance on broad remedies, the agency is signaling an intent to focus on clear law, solid evidence, and practical solutions. For practitioners, understanding this framework might be essential to navigating enforcement in 2026 and beyond.

For regulated entities, the headline is that EPA now expresses speed and clarity as key decisional criteria. Facilities should anticipate more proactive technical assistance and “find-and-fix” encouragement. In turn, companies that come prepared with rapid corrective action plans aligned to the “best reading” of applicable requirements may see faster resolution paths and narrower injunctive terms.

Compliance strategies should be anchored firmly in text and established practice, with legal positions documented against the canons and precedents EPA highlights. Where ambiguity exists, elevating issues early — supported by technical and legal analysis — may facilitate national-level clarity and avoid local inconsistencies.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15973_4423.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:03:28.743499

Global EV sales grew in November at their slowest pace since February 2024 as demand plateaued in China and collapsed in North America following the expiration of U.S. tax credits, according to data released Friday.

Global EV registrations rose 6% to just under 2 million units in November, reaching 1.98 million vehicles, including battery-electric and plug-in hybrid models. The pace of growth slowed significantly compared with earlier in the year, reflecting increasing pressure on the global EV market.

China, the world’s largest EV market accounting for more than half of global sales, recorded a 3% year-over-year increase to more than 1.3 million vehicles, the weakest growth rate since February 2024. Reduced government subsidies late in the year are expected to weigh on consumer sentiment in the months ahead.

North America posted the sharpest decline. EV registrations fell 42% in November to just over 100,000 vehicles, following a similar drop in October after U.S. tax credits expired. Sales in the region are now down 1% so far this year, placing North America on track for its first annual decline since 2019.

Europe remained a bright spot. EV registrations climbed 36% to more than 400,000 vehicles, supported by national incentive programs. Sales in Europe are up by a third so far this year compared with the same period of 2024, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

EV registrations in the rest of the world rose 35% to almost 160,000 vehicles, reflecting continued adoption outside the major markets.

The slowdown comes as electric transport advocates continue to push for rapid adoption to curb carbon emissions, while automakers and governments reassess EV commitments amid slower-than-expected consumer uptake. Industry groups have warned that declining demand could threaten jobs and profit margins.

Policy uncertainty is adding to the pressure. In the U.S., President Donald Trump recently proposed cutting fuel economy standards finalized under the previous administration. In Europe, the European Union has delayed proposals that could weaken a planned 2035 ban on new CO2-emitting vehicles. In China, reduced subsidies are expected to further cool demand in the coming months.

With data centres driving more gas power capacity and their demand piling onto already stretched grids, many naturally worry that their rapid growth could slow or even derail the energy transition.
“Data centres generally aim for a downtime of less than five minutes per year.
Similar government-backed deployment pathways for SMR-powered data centres were evident in the UK and Canada.
“These investments will be critical to integrating new power capacity and ensuring the stability of increasingly complex grids,” says Singh.","While 2025 saw clean energy account for the bulk of new capacity additions, grids continued to lag, struggling to integrate this new supply – not rendering the energy transition moot but certainly raising concerns about the pace of change. On top of this, electricity demand is rising faster than ever, and the source of growth is no longer just homes or traditional industry.

Three key themes set the tone for the energy industry this year: data centres wreaking havoc on global power systems; tariffs doing the same to supply chains; and worsening grid bottlenecks alongside persistent efforts to flip this around.

In the past year, data centres have moved into the heart of global energy dialogue, not only reshaping the industry’s supply chains and investment decisions but also forcing the sector to rethink how power is generated, distributed and consumed.

Data centres are becoming a major driver of global electricity demand, with their consumption set to reach 945 terawatt-hours by 2030 – roughly 3% of global consumption. By that point, in the US, where data centre growth is most expansive, they are expected to use more power than all other energy-intensive industries combined – including aluminium, steel, cement and chemicals.

The power industry has therefore been trying to answer: how will we meet this demand? For one, data centres can be built within three years, but the energy systems they require often take far longer to develop. They are also extremely energy-intensive, operating 24/7 with virtually zero tolerance for outages, necessitating a load profile not all power sources can easily guarantee.

The tech and energy worlds are responding with a mix of strategies including buying from the grid, negotiating long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and co-locating data centres with power generation facilities.

Gas-fired power appeals as a solution as it “offers better grid stability than other energy sources, with the flexibility of being able to be quickly started and stopped and the reliability of constant, strong power generation,” says Pavan Vyakaranam, senior power analyst at Power Technology’s parent company, GlobalData.

In the US, he notes that gas also has a political edge: “With Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies in place, it is both more economical and, from a clearances perspective, easier to roll out gas-based projects than others like renewables.”

These circumstances have presented a new opportunity for gas producers, with 2025 seeing many utilities like Entergy Louisiana, NextEra Energy and GE Vernova revise their plans to invest in gigawatt (GW)-scale projects aimed squarely at meeting data centre demand.

With data centres driving more gas power capacity and their demand piling onto already stretched grids, many naturally worry that their rapid growth could slow or even derail the energy transition.

To this, Vyakaranam responds: “Data centres are indeed making the energy transition more complex – but not unworkable.”

In the short term, he confirms that “their large, fast-growing demand may force grids to rely more on gas and delay the retirement of some fossil capacity, especially where transmission and storage are lagging”. According to GlobalData, gas and coal together will meet more than 40% of data centre electricity demand until at least 2030.

“At the same time,” he says, “hyperscalers are among the biggest buyers of renewables and are increasingly backing energy storage, advanced grid tech and even early-stage clean energy options like fusion and next‑gen nuclear.”

While renewable energy “cannot be a sole solution for data centres without any backup power” due to its intermittent nature, the rapid growth of the energy storage market – driven in large part by hyperscalers themselves – is now making renewables just as competitive. GlobalData forecasts that renewables – currently responsible for around 30% of data centre power supply – will contribute at least half the share by 2030.

Many tech giants have turned to renewables in the form of PPAs. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta and Apple currently stand as the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy globally and have contracted almost 50GW of capacity to date.

Hyperscalers are also exploring co-location, through which developers can cut development timelines, costs and grid congestion. Google has partnered with Intersect Power and TPGRise Climate to develop co-located renewable projects, while Chevron, Engine No. 1 and GE Vernova are looking to supply 4GW of co-located gas capacity.

However, nuclear power is emerging as the most compelling co-location option due to “synergies in load profiles”, says Harminder Singh, GlobalData’s director of power research and analysis. “Data centres generally aim for a downtime of less than five minutes per year. Nuclear power plants have a flat baseload generation profile, hence are able to meet this requirement.”

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are at the centre of this shift, as their smaller size allows for easier on-site deployment, minimising risks of transmission loss. To date, around 25GW of data centre-linked SMR capacity has been announced.

In 2025, the SMR-data centre relationship moved from concept toward commercial reality. “We saw multiple deals for SMRs to power data centres, providing a financing model where high‑cost nuclear is matched with very stable, creditworthy demand,” Vyakaranam explains.

Policy support has also become more concrete, with Vyakaranam pointing to the US’ shift in federal funding and programmes “from broad R&D support to supporting commercially realistic SMR projects that can be built this decade”, making the technology more “bankable”. Similar government-backed deployment pathways for SMR-powered data centres were evident in the UK and Canada.

“Nuclear projects require relatively more time for buildout, thus won’t be favoured over gas or renewables in the near-term,” Vyakaranam notes. “However, from 2030 onwards, date centres will be increasingly powered by nuclear, then renewables, then gas.”

GlobalData forecasts that at least 3GW of additional date centre-linked SMR capacity will be commissioned in the next three years, and nuclear deployment for data centres will peak between 2031 and 2035.

Amid these discussions, many have questioned what would happen if the data centre hype turns out to be a bubble, but Vyakaranam assures: “Compute use demand is strong, so a total bust is unlikely. If companies do overbuild, they can fall back on slowing new capital expenditure, leasing excess space and repurposing sites for other energy‑intensive industries, or selling assets to infrastructure investors.

“The associated grid upgrades and clean power contracts would still support the energy transition,” he concludes. “Despite the burden they are putting on power systems now, over time, if policies and grid planning catch up, data centres are more likely to reshape the energy transition – towards more firm, low‑carbon capacity and demand flexibility – than to derail it.”

Supply chain: gas bottlenecks, renewables’ tariff hit and T&D triumphs

The challenge for gas-fired power amid the energy transition has oddly been not demand but supply. While the gas industry cheered the boost from data centres, the equipment market has struggled to keep up with their demand – “on top of the substantial volumes of new gas-fired capacity utilities planned to meet overall electricity demand growth”, Singh adds.

New gas turbine orders have surged over the past two years, something that equipment manufacturers were unprepared for having made limited investments in manufacturing capacity.

As a result, turbine deliveries for new gas plants now face delays of several years. GE Vernova and Mitsubishi, for example, both see order backlogs stretching into 2028 and 2030.

“This has hampered the development of new gas-based power, forcing developers to reassess timelines and driving up project costs,” Singh says.

Meanwhile, 2025 delivered a mixed bag for the renewables supply chain.

The solar supply chain is feeling the tension between supply and policy. Module production has grown exponentially since 2019, with key manufacturers like Jinko, Longi and Trina dramatically scaling output. What resulted was oversupply, which has consequently lowered the costs of solar projects.

This progress, however, was slightly offset this year by trade policies. In the US, GlobalData estimates that Trump’s tariffs could raise the cost of utility-scale solar projects by around 10%, driven by a 30% cost increase for modules and inverters – components the US still relies heavily on imports for.

Despite ongoing efforts to expand domestic manufacturing, in the foreseeable future, “the tariffs and new anti-dumping and countervailing duties on South East Asian cells and modules are likely to create genuine supply bottlenecks and unprecedented challenges for renewable energy deployment”, Singh warns.

The offshore wind supply chain has been hit even harder. The latest tariff hike on steel and aluminium – integral to wind turbines – has significantly driven up offshore wind project costs. For instance, Dominion Energy’s 2.6GW Coastal Virginia offshore wind farm saw its capital cost rise from $10.9bn to $11.2bn following the tariff blow.

These pressures are compounded by the Trump administration’s broader hostility towards offshore wind, which has already triggered project delays and heightened investor uncertainty.

“Forecasts are quite pessimistic in the near-term,” Singh concedes, but notes that these supply chain woes still “didn’t stop the build-out of new renewables”.

Transmission and distribution (T&D) equipment manufacturers enjoyed a far more positive year, seeing active investment flows into capacity expansion. Cable makers like Prysmian, Nexans and NKT Denmark announced investment in the millions and even billions to ramp up production, while transformer suppliers including Hitachi, Hyundai Electric, Siemens Energy and Toshiba are scaling up capacity with projects spanning multiple continents.

The T&D equipment market’s financial pulse is growing stronger, reflecting the industry’s increasing focus on improving and expanding grid infrastructure. “These investments will be critical to integrating new power capacity and ensuring the stability of increasingly complex grids,” says Singh.

Grid constraints ease with reform and storage

Even with robust T&D investments this year, power grids are still ill-equipped; interconnection queues have grown longer in 2025, unable to connect new capacity – most of which are solar and wind. As it stands, grid bottlenecks remain a major hurdle to a smoother clean energy transition.

However, grid reforms are beginning to ease some these constraints. In 2025, the US updated its regulatory rules to streamline connection processes; the UK’s energy regulator announced similar plans, accelerating almost 8GW of connection; and Brazil permitted 10GW of projects to leave interconnection queues without penalty. Transmission infrastructure expansion is also going strong, with high-voltage direct current (HVDC) projects finding favour due to lower network losses.

China is leading the way, specialising in ultra-HVDC technology and planning more than $200bn (1.41tn yuan) in investment in transmission lines by the end of the year. In Europe, subsea HVDC interconnectors such as the Viking Link and North Sea Link are transmitting electricity across hundreds of kilometres beyond national borders; this year, developers began exploring the feasibility of even longer cables spanning thousands of kilometres, connecting Canada to the UK or Australia to Singapore.

While grids scramble to keep pace, energy storage seeks to hold down the fort.

Among different technologies, batteries stand out most, with GlobalData projecting that 2025 will see annual battery capacity additions that are nearly double those of 2024 – leading to a 63% year-on-year increase in cumulative global capacity.

“Battery storage is no longer a supporting actor but a necessity to modern power systems,” Singh says. “We saw multiple applications for batteries emerge this year, from energy shifting and black start capabilities to providing ancillary services in grids and capacity support for system adequacy.”",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/12/shutterstock_2520228829.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:02:39.597115

For the Gulf Coast oil and gas industry, the mini-region around the 50-mile-long Laguna Madre is the final frontier.

A rare hypersaline lagoon that separates the Padre islands from the deep South Texas mainland, the Laguna Madre is ringed in its southern reach by the small coastal communities of Port Isabel, Laguna Heights, Laguna Vista, Long Island Village, and South Padre Island. This area has long avoided the oil refineries and gas processing plants that dominate cities farther up the Gulf like Corpus Christi, Houston, Freeport, Galveston, and Port Arthur. What little presence the oil and gas industry has had here centered on shipping product out of the Brownsville Ship Channel, which connects the eponymous city to the lagoon, and this activity mostly dried up late last century.

But all that is changing. This summer, two storage tanks for the huge new liquefied natural gas project, Rio Grande LNG, have emerged to towering heights over the state highway that links Brownsville, some 20 miles west, to the 5,000-person town of Port Isabel. The project, set to be the first of its kind in the Rio Grande Valley, will chill gas coming through pipelines—laid over the past decade amid the country’s “shale revolution”—into liquid form 1/600th the substance’s previous size. This liquefied gas will then be exported via massive tanker ships past the jetties of South Padre Island and across the world. The under-construction project has already poured concrete over nearly a thousand acres of ecologically fragile wetlands and lomas, clay dunes formed over thousands of years.

This transformative development has been aggressively touted by NextDecade, the publicly traded Houston-based company behind Rio Grande LNG, as a job creator that will be environmentally sensitive and won’t affect tourism. But locals say it threatens existing ecotourism and fishing industries, and federal regulators have agreed, pointing to the number of LNG tankers coming in and out of the ship channel.

Nearly 100 years ago, Cameron County commissioners initiated the creation of the Brownsville Ship Channel, wanting the Valley to venture into a new phase of global economic engagement by exporting the area’s plentiful citrus and cotton overseas. As decades wore on, companies like Marathon built offshore oil rigs at the Port of Brownsville and employed hundreds before closing in the late 1980s after the country’s oil bust. Union Carbide, a chemical manufacturer, met the same fate as butane prices doubled, leaving workers jobless after the plant closed.

Trade, logistics, rig-building, and shipbreaking haven’t left the port, with the various companies there employing about 3,400 people. But today’s officials in Brownsville—population 190,000—want something bigger: to bring back the oil and gas industry as part of a region-wide attempt to remake the area’s economy into a hub of international corporate investment. To help realize this vision, Rio Grande LNG is fronting the cost of dredging the channel deep enough for some of the largest tankers ever made to traverse.

Though this will be the first such facility in deep South Texas, gas export plants have spread across the Gulf Coast over the past several years. The United States has become the largest gas exporter in the world, thanks to new installations built along the coastal portions of Texas and Louisiana. And LNG firms are further expanding these facilities despite a projected oversupply of gas, some citing vague “growing Asian demand” as a reason. These expansions are also aided by the Trump administration’s attempt to geopolitically leverage gas in striking trade deals.

If NextDecade successfully builds out Rio Grande LNG to the size it’s planning, it will be one of the two largest facilities in the country by export volume.

While the project is strongly supported by officials in the Brownsville area, it’s been consistently opposed by the leaders of communities much closer to the site such as Port Isabel and South Padre Island, which will bear the brunt of pollution or industrial disaster and live off incompatible industries. “It’s not a plus for tourism. It’s not a plus for the environment. It’s not a plus for our community,” South Padre Island Councilman Joe Ricco told the Texas Observer. “It’s not a plus for residents—unless you’re maybe the pilot boat captain,” he said, referring to the tugboats that will guide incoming tankers.

LNG companies from Texas to Louisiana have pitched themselves as saviors of economically barren lands, and politicians like those in Brownsville have actively joined the PR push—often alongside considerable direct communication with, and campaign donations from, the companies. To measure the distance between this rhetoric and reality, and to essentially peer into the murky future of the Laguna Madre area, the Observer has reported out the impacts of LNG facilities in the industrialized town of Freeport and in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

What’s clear on the ground in these Gulf communities is that a second gulf exists between the companies’ rosy promises and their mixed impacts in reality. And many locals believe the projects have yielded more harm than good. As the oil and gas industry further pushes the climate toward irreversible change, LNG export plants are doing the same to the communities where they operate.

About an hour southeast of Houston, Freeport is one of several cities that make up the Brazosport area, the coastal appendage of Brazoria County. The 11,000 people who live in the city are surrounded by a seemingly never-ending stretch of petrochemical facilities—operated by Dow, BASF, and dozens of other corporations—where the smokestacks, machinery, and administration buildings all blend together. Among them are two plants run by Freeport LNG, which has been in the area for some 20 years, first as a gas importer and later as an exporter.

As the company moved toward exports about a decade ago, when the West Texas fracking boom achieved liftoff, Freeport LNG ramped up community relations all over the county, promising plentiful new jobs and billions to be spent on construction. While not as old or big as other corporate giants in this industrial town, Freeport LNG still looms large. Several buildings, including the local theater and the hospital’s intensive care unit, bear the company’s name. Since exporting its first shipment in 2019, the company has regularly sponsored local events, including Port Freeport’s Take-A-Child Fishing Tournament.

But local organizers say philanthropy doesn’t excuse the lucrative tax breaks it takes in or the pollution it spews out. “They are not interested in being good neighbors, except for doing things that will put their name on a water tower or school or something and make them look good,” Gary Witt, a retired marketing professor and chair of the Better Brazoria organization, told me in May at Sweet T’s, a downtown diner.

In the streets outside, broken glass, downed fences, and shingles were still littered from last year’s Hurricane Beryl. This part of the city was mostly lifeless, despite being next to Port Freeport and a couple miles from Freeport LNG.

Since 2015, the local school district, Brazoria County, the City of Freeport, and a neighboring city have given Freeport LNG a combined $1 billion in tax abatement deals. The City of Freeport alone is projected to forgo over $321 million in property taxes for Freeport LNG, according to an economic analysis commissioned by Better Brazoria, by the time the agreement ends in 2029. The city has opted for payments in lieu of taxes, receiving about $2 million a year from the company.

Freeport LNG says the tax handouts are well worth the project’s contributions to the local tax base. Company spokesperson Heather Browne told the Observer the corporation will pay “$2.6 billion in taxes to local Brazoria County taxing jurisdictions over the course of the company’s initial 20-year operating life,” on top of generating additional taxable economic activity. In company literature, Freeport LNG has said it employs 230 people in Brazoria County and created 9,000 construction jobs during its build-out, which took about five years. Although the company receives more tax abatements than any other entity in the county, it’s not among the top 10 largest employers in Freeport, last year’s city budget shows.

Since exports began, Census data shows median income rose and poverty rates fell in Freeport at levels exceeding state and nationwide trends. Donald Payne, an economics professor at Brazosport College, said the gas facility is one part of the explanation: “Since 2019, Freeport LNG, the Port of Freeport, and the petrochemical industry all experienced growth. Together, they created hundreds of high-wage jobs directly and many more indirectly,” Payne told the Observer in an email, though he noted that “Based on personal experience, many Freeport LNG workers appear to live outside the city.”

A short drive from downtown Freeport are Quintana, population 30, and its beaches, where Freeport LNG’s liquefaction plant looms. The facility occupies much of the island town, or what’s left of it. Some of the few people who live there now work for the company or the county beach park on the north end of the island. Most of the town’s annual revenue comes from the roughly $1 million a year Freeport LNG pays directly as part of a property tax break deal. One council member is an employee of the company.

Quintana is a major stopover for migratory birds, with at least 325 species documented there. The island’s observation tower was constructed by Freeport LNG, and some of the land that makes up bird and nature sanctuaries was donated by the company. The hum of nearby tanker ships competes constantly with birdsong.

The beaches are usually well attended in the summer—as they were when the LNG plant exploded in 2022. The explosion, which damaged the LNG facility and caused a toddler on the beach to injure his face on a rock, was caused by trapped gas that burst through a pipe and was ignited by a damaged wire. A contributing cause, a federal investigation found, was an overworked, understaffed crew. Three years before, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) had fined Freeport LNG after operators pushed gas at 917 pounds per square inch of pressure through a pipe rated for just 90 pounds, breaking the pipe and releasing 315 million feet of gas.

Two busloads of kids on a field trip were on the beach during the explosion, two locals who were present told the Observer. People were unsure what to do. Local authorities issued a voluntary evacuation notice. Those who left the island had to drive past the site of the explosion as the company contained the fire. When federal regulators held a public briefing for residents to learn about the explosion, Freeport LNG didn’t attend.

Melanie Oldham, the executive director of Better Brazoria, said the company needs to update its public emergency response plan. “How do people know how or where to evacuate? Do they try to get over this one bridge?” she asked as we drove back to Freeport from Quintana. Browne, the Freeport LNG spokesperson, told the Observer that the safety of its workforce and community is “top priority” for the company. Regarding the explosion, Browne referred to the company’s 2022 Sustainability and Community Investment report, which points to the company fixing and modifying the valves that led to the incident, hiring more employees, and retraining staff. She declined to comment on Oldham’s statement about the response plan.

Since the 2022 explosion, Freeport LNG has continued to have “emissions events,” which are unplanned releases of chemicals. The plant and its pretreatment facility have had 98 since the explosion and 134 before that, amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds of air pollution, including benzene and carbon monoxide. In all, Freeport LNG has paid around $2.6 million in fines to various federal and state agencies. Freeport LNG is now planning to add a fourth “train,” the machines that cool gas into liquid.

Local governments in the area have backed the company through more than just tax breaks. When Freeport LNG needed permission from the Department of Energy (DOE) to export gas to countries that don’t have free trade agreements with the United States, the company ghostwrote letters of support for local elected officials and organizations to submit to the federal department. Public records obtained by the Observer show that Freeport LNG’s public relations team gave a prewritten letter to Brazoria County Judge Matt Sebesta in 2021. Sebesta submitted the letter with minimal edits. Several other organizations and local elected officials also sent the same letter. Two years later, the DOE approved Freeport LNG’s request.

In downtown Freeport during my May visit, I took a walk with Manning Rollerson, who has lived in the city most of his life, growing up on the East End. He pointed out long-gone establishments from his youth, where shrimp boats used to dock, and the names of the historic buildings, empty but still standing.

We started at Freeport’s former city hall building, which was vacated last March. There was broken glass around the building, and its drive-through lanes, left over from when the building was a bank, were rotting away. As we continued walking, we saw that—save for a few offices, the Freeport City Museum, and some apartments—downtown was little more than a pass-through for people leaving the nearby port, where several industrial giants operate, including Phillips 66, Chiquita, and Freeport LNG.

“For all the money that is spent on [tax breaks], why is downtown looking like this? This is the heart of the city,” said Rollerson, who founded the Freeport Haven Project, a grassroots group advocating against pollution in Brazoria County, and has traveled all over the world advocating against LNG development and fossil fuels generally.

Rollerson said international leaders are often more receptive to his message than local officials are. “I’m gonna make it plain and simple: They don’t give a damn what we say when it comes to the industry.”

We approached the East End. Separated from downtown by Navigation Boulevard, this was a neighborhood, segregated by the city in the 1930s, where Black and brown people lived for decades. With most of those homes bought and demolished by Port Freeport, the land is being turned into storage lots as the port expands northwest toward downtown. Rollerson pointed to where his grandmother’s home had been, the park he used to go to as a kid, and the homes of family and friends. Now barren land, it will all be part of the port soon.

Rollerson is a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit alleging that the City of Freeport and Port Freeport violated the civil rights of East End property owners when it bought, some via eminent domain, and demolished homes in the neighborhood after purposefully disinvesting in the area. In 2022, the Department of Homeland Security’s Civil Rights Division agreed to review the lawsuit, but Lone Star Legal Aid, the lead attorneys in the suit, told the Observer that progress has since stalled after the Department of Government Efficiency laid off the DHS staff who were working on it.

“I don’t even see a future for nobody, based on our government,” Rollerson said. “If we don’t die from toxic poisoning, we’re gonna die from being broke and sick. When will we ever see the American dream?”

Brazoria County has rates of lung and bronchial cancer, which can be caused by particulate matter and benzene, above the national average. A little over 50,000 residents here don’t have health insurance.

As for downtown, Freeport Economic Development Corporation’s executive director Robert Johnson said most building owners are sitting on their properties in hopes that they can sell or lease them for more money in the future. He wants to avoid downtown being totally absorbed: “I would not want to see the downtown eaten up by the port, because they would just raze it,” Johnson said.

Despite his concern, Johnson said the city’s industry is a strength. The various companies here bring in a commuter population that dwarfs the number of local residents, which he said creates a spillover effect benefiting the local economy.

Port Freeport did not respond to the Observer’s questions for this story. Neither did Brazoria County or any Freeport city council member.

When driving from Texas into Louisiana on State Highway 82, after Sabine Pass LNG’s massive trains, the road runs parallel to the coast, but you don’t see any water for half an hour. Instead, you see trees, cow pastures, and gas processing structures—some operating, some abandoned—before finally reaching the coastal prairie and its brown gulf water; the town of Holly Beach, with its homes raised on pilings as high as 15 feet; and the surviving trees stripped of their foliage and gnarled from hurricanes. The few locals can watch LNG tankers from their porches pass into the Calcasieu Ship Channel, which spans from the coast all the way up to Lake Charles. In 1959, the first LNG exported from the United States left through this channel, sent to the United Kingdom as a test run for an industry that would concentrate here decades later.

At Holly Beach’s eastern edge are John Allaire and his 150-acre property. With a clear view from his mobile home’s porch, Allaire, a 69-year-old geologist who worked four decades as an environmental coordinator in the oil and gas industry, has been documenting just about everything related to Calcasieu Pass LNG, a 4-year-old, 432-acre facility owned by Virginia-based Venture Global that sits across the channel. When I met him in May, he spread maps, photos, and reports on a bench to show me the 4,700-person Cameron Parish now being surrounded by LNG facilities on every side but the coast. Starting with Sabine Pass LNG, which received the country’s first license after the Obama administration authorized LNG exports, it took just under a decade for three additional plants to emerge, with four more on the way.

He showed me a photo he took of a ship named Clean Energy in the channel with a stream of fire coming out of the plant’s flare stack. “That’s what clean energy looks like here on the Louisiana coast,” he said.

Within its first year of operating, in 2022, Allaire assessed that Calcasieu Pass LNG had violated its air permit more than 2,000 times by overemitting after accidents and equipment malfunctions. Alongside the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, a statewide environmental justice organization, Allaire found that more than half the time, in 2023, Venture Global was not reporting violations on time or at all. The state environmental regulator sent a compliance order to the company that same year, but nothing has come of it. In 2024, Allaire documented the plant flaring for 95 hours straight when it’s only permitted to do so for 60 hours annually.

Despite all this, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates LNG plant construction, green-lighted a second Venture Global facility farther into the unincorporated hamlet of Cameron last June. Four months later, the corporation successfully asked the state if it could increase its emissions at the first facility by up to 700,000 tons of greenhouse gasses and other pollutants.

Cameron Parish (named after a different Cameron than Cameron County, Texas, where Rio Grande LNG is being built) holds the distinction of having the fastest-shrinking population in Louisiana. But even with fewer locals to take jobs at the plants, Venture Global is now planning yet a third facility.

On Allaire’s side of the ship channel, Commonwealth LNG, developed by the Houston company Catarus, was set to start construction later this year. In October, Louisiana’s state court canceled the project’s construction permit; the court said state regulators did not consider how Commonwealth LNG—along with other established facilities in Cameron Parish—would affect coastal erosion and rising sea levels in Louisiana. But the state reissued the permit in mid-November. Commonwealth LNG did not respond to the Observer’s request for comment.

At its original Calcasieu Pass facility, Venture Global employs about 300 people, saying a majority of those employees come from Cameron or nearby parishes. In exchange, Cameron Parish and the state lavished the firm with billions in tax abatements.

Cameron Parish Port President Howard Romero said in 2023 that once the company starts paying property taxes, the parish would become the “Riviera of the world.” But the state renewed the first Venture plant’s tax abatements later that same year, meaning the company won’t pay property taxes—about $923 million in all—for another three years. The state also gave Venture Global a tax abatement for its second plant, letting the company off the hook for another $1.67 billion in property taxes, in a parish where the average annual income is $34,000.

On the main road into Cameron, I passed a mural that depicted a long-gone town—one that used to catch the most seafood in the country. Made in 1975, the artwork states that the town’s population was 2,510 people then. Census data says about 300 people live here now, but locals say it’s likely far fewer. There’s one gas station in town, with a food truck next door that serves po’boys and used to be a brick-and-mortar before Hurricane Laura in 2020 ripped it off its foundation. The remains of the restaurant now lie a block away in front of a church, also destroyed. Even the Catholic church won’t be rebuilding here, as insurers won’t fund this hurricane-prone place anymore. There are no hospitals or grocery stores.

The newest construction in town is the Lighthouse Bend restaurant, market, RV park, and marina, opened by Venture Global in 2024. The upscale establishment is juxtaposed against the LNG facilities just down the road from it and the storm-damaged homes, shrimp yards, and incessant dust that follows every truck. The parish and Venture Global built the marina after the latter had cut off public access to a parish-owned jetty park, which had a fishing pier and camper spaces along the ship channel (similar to Isla Blanca Park on South Padre Island). Mark Daigle, a Cameron Parish Police juror, told local media last year the project was turning Cameron into a place where displaced residents can return after hurricanes: “I truly believe [with] what we’ll be getting off LNG and everything like that, we will be able to put ourself in a place to where we can possibly help the people come back home.”

The local shrimping industry, a large part of the area’s culture, has all but disappeared since LNG arrived. Local shrimpers say they can’t catch anything when the ships pass through and drive the shrimp away. They also say constant dredging to deepen the ship channel worsens the problem; research suggests that this dredging kicks up sediment that harms sea life in a variety of ways. FERC acknowledged the same phenomenon in its final environmental impact statement on Venture Global’s second project but said that the effects could be mitigated.

Some locals say the tankers could help by coming later in the day, but companies won’t do that. Nowadays, Cameron Parish shrimpers drag nets 10 miles away in Vermillion Bay, where there is no tanker traffic. The difference between before and after the gas plants came is hundreds of thousands of dollars and pounds of shrimp.

The shrimpers who’ve stayed are now venturing into other businesses. Captain Anthony “Tad” Theriot, who quit school in 10th grade and has been shrimping ever since, spent the opening day of shrimp season at an oyster farm where he’s been working for extra income.

I met him that night on his boat, which is docked at the last shrimp house in town. He told me of life in Cameron back when there were grocery stores, a movie theater, even a skating rink. Hurricanes destroyed it all, and the LNG companies, despite their promises of prosperity, haven’t brought it back. Theriot put both his sons through college with shrimp money, but just last year, he tied up his boat for the season and had to get financial help from a local nonprofit.

“They got motherfuckers at Walmart making what I make,” Theriot said, adding that he’s ready to sell his boat and leave the industry. ”I can’t even make a living in my own house [where he would sell catches]. So what do I want to be here for?”

Another shrimper, Melissa Richard, who owns a shop in Hackberry, 30 miles north beside another LNG facility operated by a different company, echoed that she might leave the business that supported three generations of her family. “What else am I supposed to do? To me, I’ve made it to the top,” Richard told the Observer. “My dream was to have my own shrimp house. I’m living my dream, and it’s sinking.”

All this local change, according to companies like Venture Global, comes with a global benefit. The company believes that LNG reduces climate change by displacing coal plants. But, in recent years, coal has been primarily replaced by renewables like solar and wind rather than gas, even as the LNG industry continues expanding. Meanwhile, natural gas facilities, including Venture Global’s, frequently release massive quantities of methane—a powerful accelerant of climate change, the very phenomenon that intensifies the hurricanes that have ravaged this part of southwest Louisiana.

Venture Global did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Neither did Cameron Parish Police Jury President Ronald Nunez, or Police Juror Magnus McGee, whose district covers Cameron.

On the last day before I left the Louisiana coast, I met 72-year-old Sherry Peshoff, who lives near the planned location of Venture’s second LNG facility and on the same street where she was raised.

Peshoff can remember 1957’s Hurricane Audrey, which killed at least 500 people—more than live in the town of Cameron today. She remembers being inside a home with hundreds of others as it lifted off its foundation; she lost her paternal grandparents and uncle. Still, she grew up here shrimping with her siblings and dad. “He raised all four of us kids out of the Gulf,” she said. “The same gulf waters that took his family.”

From her raised porch, the existing Venture Global facility blocks most of the view, and the company is snatching up the properties that surround her. Leaving is becoming less a question of if than when. Once she’s gone, she expects the industry that helped drive her out to face a reckoning. “I have a gut feeling God has got something in store for this place. They’ve taken all the churches out. To me, that plant is causing a lot of trouble, and to me, the Lord’s going to let a big hurricane come and wipe this place out.”

Before leaving, I asked her what she’d tell residents of the Laguna Madre area in deep South Texas, which shares a waning shrimping industry and similar hurricane prone-ness.

“Cameron’s never going to be the same,” Peshoff said of her small patch of the Louisiana coast. “And you can bank on it: Your hometown’s not going to be the same neither.”

Back in Texas, Rio Grande LNG isn’t expected to export gas for another couple of years, but it’s already changing some aspects of life in Port Isabel, the coastal city where I grew up.

State Highway 48 has a new stoplight, directing trucks and heavy equipment from Rio Grande LNG’s site, piling up traffic in both directions in the morning and at quitting time. Data from the Texas Department of Transportation acquired by the Observer shows that more car accidents are happening near the site than before construction started, two years ago.

Long Island Village, a tiny golf-course community of mostly retirees, is connected to Port Isabel via a swing bridge. Dredge boats and vessels bringing material to the LNG site have regularly collided with that bridge, and one such incident snapped the cable.

In July, a shrimp boat sank in the channel, throwing two people onboard into the water. The captain was found dead a few days later. It was the first time a shrimper from the area had died on the water in years. Two local shrimpers told the Observer the boat hit a dredge pipe siphoning sediment to expand the channel for LNG. Spokespeople for the Port of Brownsville and the U.S. Coast Guard told the Observer they hadn’t heard of a dredge pipe being the cause. The Guard denied a Freedom of Information Act request, saying the investigation remains open. Great Lakes Dredging, the company expanding the channel, didn’t respond.

In town, Port Isabel residents are wondering what risks come with Rio Grande LNG being just 3 miles away. One resident, Marta Duran, lives off Port Road in what used to be Port Isabel’s Palangana neighborhood, a five-minute drive from the LNG site. At the end of her street is an abandoned oil refinery, cleared of structures and reclaimed by native flora over decades. Just a few miles away is Rio Grande LNG and, across the channel, Elon Musk’s SpaceX launch site. Duran worries one of SpaceX’s semi-frequent explosions could lead to a secondary explosion at the gas plant. (A consulting firm hired by NextDecade determined in 2017 that this was exceedingly unlikely, but that was based on smaller rockets than the ones Musk is using today.)

She’s heard local officials and NextDecade talk about the advantages LNG will bring but little else. “In my opinion, the community is not being given complete information. It’s more like advertising of benefits,” Duran said. “They are not talking about how to react in case of a catastrophe, a community emergency.”

A home health worker, Duran is a member of Vecinos para el Bienestar de la Comunidad Costera, a coalition of Port Isabel residents who were part of a lawsuit against FERC and NextDecade that got the company’s federal authorization revoked last August and forced the company to go through another environmental analysis.

But, this March, the same court that canceled the FERC approval reinstated it—and FERC then published its court-ordered environmental review and approved Rio Grande LNG. Vecinos, along with the City of Port Isabel and other groups, asked FERC for a rehearing in September, saying Rio Grande LNG’s plans to add more trains, and export more gas from them, was not being considered. But FERC never responded, effectively denying the request.

For the closest communities, Rio Grande LNG will bring carcinogens and particulate matter. FERC has said the emissions pose no “significant” threat, but federal public health agencies say any exposure is unsafe. As for explosions, NextDecade says that it has safeguards in place, but gas companies and FERC keep emergency response plans under wraps, saying release would pose a security risk.

NextDecade says there’ll be up to 5,000 construction jobs at the project’s peak and 250 permanent positions. Those are significant numbers for the Laguna Madre area, but the prospect of a carcinogen-emitting facility just a couple miles from Port Isabel’s only grocery store—and of shrimp or recreational boat traffic being halted routinely for LNG tankers—makes what I saw in Freeport and Cameron Parish seem like a telling omen.

Officials in Brownsville and Cameron County continue to strongly support Rio Grande LNG, while the communities closest to the site remain opposed. Jared Hockema, Port Isabel’s city manager, said the export plants threaten existing tourism and fishing industries and that LNG is a shortsighted economic strategy.",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSCF1051-1-scaled-3.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:03:55.412656

In 2010, Democrats implemented the Affordable Care Act – more accurately called the Unaffordable Care Act – with the promise that it would lower premiums and health care costs and allow people to keep their existing plans and doctors. Instead, it did the opposite. Since the Unaffordable Care Act took effect, premiums have increased for American workers and families by 80 percent.

To cover up for their failure and broken promises, Democrats send hundreds of billions of dollars to insurance companies to mask the high cost of the Unaffordable Care Act, keeping Americans trapped in a broken program. Democrats are focused on the 7 percent of Americans on Obamacare, while House Republicans are working to deliver better choices and premiums for ALL Americans.

This week, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to reform the health care system Democrats broke by providing better choices for workers and families, boosting competition, and increasing transparency to lower health care costs for every American. Our legislation includes provisions to:

Codify and expand Association Health Plans and CHOICE Arrangements, providing small businesses and employees more affordable health care options, and safeguard stop-loss insurance for small employers

Allocate money for Cost-Sharing Reductions (CSRs) that lower premiums in the individual market by more than 12 percent

Demand transparency from pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) with employers so small businesses can negotiate better deals and lower costs for workers

It’s time to actually help ALL Americans have better choices and lower health care premiums by working to fix the problems Democrats created with Obamacare.

H.R. ___, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, sponsored by Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, reforms our health care system by improving health care options, expanding choice for workers and families, lowering premiums for all Americans, and increasing transparency and competition in health care.

House Republicans will continue to fight to fix what Democrats broke and make health care more affordable and efficient for all Americans.

Streamlining Permitting to Boost Economic Development and Lower Energy Costs

The National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) is a federal law from 1969 that requires the assessment of potential environmental impacts before certain federal actions, including action on energy and infrastructure projects, can move forward. While originally intended to balance environmental concerns with economic development, the NEPA process has grown unreasonably and oppressively complex.

Drawn out NEPA review processes and constant legal battles significantly hinder critical energy production, infrastructure projects, forest management, and more across the country, stalling ready-to-go projects that could benefit Americans, create jobs, and lower costs.

By stalling energy production and projects, America’s permitting process is standing in the way of making sure Americans have access to reliable and affordable energy at a time when our energy demand is on the rise.

It is vital that we cut the burdensome bureaucracy and unnecessary litigation impeding energy infrastructure development and streamline permitting so America can get back to building, ensuring we have reliable access to the energy we need. Permitting reform presents a significant opportunity to foster economic growth, increased wages, and improved affordability for working families.

This week, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation that reforms NEPA to simplify and streamline the permitting process, shortening timelines for permitting approvals, preventing frivolous lawsuits, and restoring NEPA to its intended scope.

H.R. 4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, sponsored by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, reforms the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) to streamline the permitting process and agency procedures by restricting NEPA lawsuits to parties impacted by a project, putting in place reasonable filing deadlines, and restoring NEPA to its original purpose and scope.

House Republicans are working to lower energy costs and establish global energy dominance – will Democrats join us, or instead vote to bring America closer to an energy crisis?

Supporting Reliable Power for Americans

Reliable and adequate delivery of electric power – a crucial aspect of Americans’ daily life – depends on our electric power grid, which consists of a complex network of generators, transmission lines, and distribution centers, and other crucial infrastructure.

As demand for reliable electric power increases with the growth of artificial intelligence (AI), American manufacturing, and general electrification, we are also seeing premature retirements of dispatchable and baseload power plants due to overly burdensome regulations pushed by radical liberals, threatening our ability to reliably deliver power across the country.

Over the past several years, radical state and federal environmental policies have limited production and increased compliance costs of more traditional and dependable dispatchable generation resources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear, while favoring renewables like wind and solar. The problem? Wind and solar are intermittent resources and can’t reliably meet our increasing electricity demand.

At a time when we need to be expanding production and increasing development for more reliable baseload and dispatchable power, these onerous regulations continue to encourage accelerated retirements of power plants. It’s past time we stop burdensome red tape that threatens the security and reliability of our power system.

This week, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation that mandates that the North American Electric Reliability Corporation conduct annual assessments on electricity generation and grid reliability, and empowers the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to prevent any future rules that would hurt grid reliability

H.R. 3616, the Reliable Power Act, introduced by Rep. Troy Balderson, amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to assess regulations that may impact grid reliability before finalizing new rules.

House Republicans are continuing our work to keep the lights on for American workers and families, make energy affordable again, and protect our energy security.

Combatting Premature Retirements of Baseload Power Plants

Many baseload power plants are being forced to prematurely retire thanks to burdensome Democrat policies and state and federal regulations designed to replace baseload generation with intermittent wind and solar. Due to the growth of artificial intelligence data centers, domestic manufacturers, and general electrification, electricity demand is booming, placing strain on the American electric grid.

As these power plants close while power demands spike, America’s energy supply is left vulnerable, along with the millions of Americans who rely on it to keep their lights on. Additionally, the risk for rolling blackouts and brownouts increases.

Across the country, the states with the least affordable electricity are the same states with the most forceful “Green New Scam” standards. Unfortunately, as the grid spans across state lines, one state’s decision to prematurely close a power plant also impacts the reliability and affordability in neighboring states.

This week, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation that gives plants additional authority to contest their closure if it impacts the affected area’s ability to supply power and hurts electric reliability. Under Section 207 of the Federal Power Act, this important legislation would allow a Regional Transmission Organization or a state Public Utility Commission to request an order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to remain open and allocate costs until a reliable fix is implemented.

Rep. Morgan Griffith’s legislation, H.R. 3632, the Power Plant Reliability Act, addresses the premature retirements of baseload power plants by allowing states and regional operators to contest proposed closures on power plants in neighboring states if the closure could impact electric reliability and affordability.

House Republicans will continue working to keep the lights on for American families by allowing FERC to mitigate plant retirements and keep our bulk power system strong.

Vetting Unaccompanied Migrant Children and their Sponsors to Keep Communities Safe

In 2022, 20-year-old Kayla Hamilton was tragically and brutally murdered by Walter Javier Martinez. Martinez, a 17-year-old illegal migrant, was in the U.S. as an Unaccompanied Alien Child (UAC) and was released to a sponsor by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) without any background checks being completed.

Because proper background checks did not occur prior to his release, it wasn’t until later that authorities discovered Martinez – who was from El Salvador – had a criminal history and was affiliated with the MS-13 gang. He even confessed to having committed four murders and two rapes, as well as other crimes. In April, Martinez was sentenced to 70 years in prison.

Under the Biden Administration, the number of UACs crossing the border and being released into the U.S. reached all time highs: around 465,000 UACs were released to sponsors during President Biden’s time in office. Due to the surge, the previous administration relaxed safety procedures and protections, such as background checks and file reviews for children and sponsors, prioritizing placing UACs quickly versus placing them safely.

The failure to properly screen UACs and their sponsors incentivizes increased illegal border crossings, results in the trafficking and exploitation of UACs, and threatens the safety of innocent Americans like Kayla Hamilton.

Walter Javier Martinez should have never been released into our country, and Kayla Hamilton should still be here today. House Republicans are bringing legislation to ensure thorough background checks are conducted on UACs and potential sponsors before their placement, keeping Americans safe from dangerous UACs and protecting UACs from exploitation.

Rep. Russell Fry’s legislation, H.R. 4371, the Kayla Hamilton Act, requires HHS contact the consulate or embassy of a UAC’s home country to ascertain criminal history or gang affiliation for UACs aged 12 or older, requires background checks on potential UAC sponsors and adult members of their household, instructs HHS to screen for gang tattoos and place UACs with gang tattoos or ties in secure facilities, and prevents UAC placement with sponsors who are illegal immigrants.

House Republicans are working to keep dangerous criminals out of our communities and ensure American families are safe.

Correcting the Rosemont Decision and Supporting Critical Mining Projects

In May 2022, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court decision repealing an approved plan for Rosemont Copper-Mine Project. This decision upended decades of precedent by prohibiting the long-standing practice of using adjacent lands for mining support activities like rock waste disposal or processing. This faulty decision is commonly referred to as the “Rosemont decision.”

This misguided and harmful decision threatens hardrock mining and critical mineral projects across Western states rich with minerals, such as Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho, by forcing all ancillary mining operations to happen on mineral-rich lands.

These critical mineral projects are important to securing our manufacturing and energy futures, as well as decreasing our dependence on imports from foreign adversaries.

Now more than ever, we should be promoting mining operations and domestic energy production in states with rich mineral resources – not upending responsible mining projects and practices under the false guise of protecting the environment.

Rep. Mark Amodei’s legislation, H.R. 1366, the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, undoes the damaging Rosemont decision, allows mining operations to continue as they have historically under the law, and protects the communities and jobs supported by this industry.

House Republicans will continue working to secure essential mineral supply chains and responsibly harvest our abundant natural resources.

Ending Taxpayer Funding for Transgender Surgeries for Children

In May 2025, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a report highlighting serious concerns about medical interventions to transition an individual away from their biological sex, including puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries, in children and adolescents. The HHS report highlighted significant and irreversible risks, such as infertility, that result from such interventions while noting weak evidence of benefit to the child.

These dangerous and irreversible medical interventions forever alter a person’s body and come with serious risks – and this is what far-left activists are pushing on our nation’s children.

This week, House Republicans are bringing legislation to protect children from irreversible, unproven, and life-altering procedures and treatments that are not medically necessary while also promoting fiscal responsibility.

Our legislation prohibits the use of Medicaid funding for gender transition procedures such as surgeries, hormone therapies, and puberty blockers intended to alter a minor’s biological sex while maintaining funding for medically necessary treatments for conditions including early puberty, genetic disorders, and life-threatening conditions.

Medicaid’s limited resources should not be used to permanently alter the body of a minor – these taxpayer dollars should only be used for scientifically-based and medically necessary care.

H.R. 498, the Do No Harm in Medicaid Act, sponsored by Rep. Dan Crenshaw, prevents federal Medicaid funding being used for gender transition procedures that are not medically necessary for individuals under 18 years old.

House Republicans are working to ensure hardworking Americans are not forced to pay for dangerous, irreversible gender transition procedures for minors.

Protecting America’s Children From Dangerous and Irreversible Gender Transition Treatments

In recent years, some U.S. medical institutions have begun pushing health care based in radical ideology when it comes to treating children.

Taking an “affirmation only” approach, these woke, so-called health care professions instruct doctors, parents, therapists and teachers to simply begin transitioning treatments like puberty-blockers, hormones, and more extreme procedures, instead of considering other potential contributing factors like mental health conditions.

The radical and politically-motivated “gender-affirming care” agenda can have devastating, irreversible effects on children, including infertility and mutilation from sex-change surgeries. It’s dangerous and ridiculous to allow a child who can’t vote or attend an R-rated movie to decide to permanently alter his or her body. House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to protect American children from dangerous gender transition treatments.

H.R. 3492, the Protect Children’s Innocence Act, sponsored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, makes it a crime for doctors to perform genital or bodily mutilation or chemical castration sex-change procedures on minors.

House Republicans will always fight to protect our children from dangerous, politically-motived medical care that could harm them for life.

Delisting the Recovered Gray Wolf Species

Across the lower 48 states, the gray wolf species has clearly recovered from their once extremely endangered status. Recent scientific analysis has shown their population to be healthy and sustainable from a multitude of threats. As such, it is time for the species to be delisted and returned to state management.

In the Great Lakes region, which claims the largest concentration of gray wolves here in the lower 48 states, there are around 4,200 wolves, and the current population is well past delisting recovery goals. In fact, the delisting recovery goals for gray wolves “have been met since at least 1994,” according to Nathan Roberts, former wildlife biologist at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

Furthermore, the Obama, Trump, and Biden Administrations all took actions to delist the gray wolf: In 2013, the Obama Administration proposed delisting the species; in 2020, the Trump Administration published a rule removing the gray wolf as a protected species that was later vacated by a U.S. District Court; and most recently, the Biden Administration appealed the vacated Trump 2020 rule.

While the last three presidential administrations agreed that it is time to delist the gray world, activist judges and radical environmentalists continue to block the removal of the gray wolf from the endangered species list. We should be focusing on allocating resources and taxpayer dollars to species that need to recover, not keeping an already recovered species on the list.

Additionally, allowing the recovered gray wolf population to continue to grow completely protected and unchecked poses an immediate threat to livestock, farmers, pet owners, residents, and more.

Rep. Lauren Boebert’s legislation, H.R. 845, the Pet & Livestock Protection Act, would require the Secretary of the Interior to reissue regulations delisting the gray wolf from the Endangered Species List in the lower 48 states and ensure this decision is not subject to judicial review.

The American power grid in 2025 faces a set of challenges unlike any in recent memory. The United States is deploying clean energy far too slowly to meet load growth, avoid spikes in electricity prices, and combat climate change. To get within striking distance of the Paris climate goals and plan for the lowest electricity costs, we must build 70 to 125 gigawatts of clean energy per year, much higher than the record 50 gigawatts built in 2024.

Grid upgrades, too, are proceeding far too slowly. To meet growing electricity demand and integrate new clean power at lowest cost, transmission capacity must more than double within regions and increase more than four-fold between regions by 2035. But large transmission projects frequently take 7 to 15 years from initial planning to in-service operation and only 322 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines were completed in 2024—the third slowest year of new construction in the last 15 years.

Even before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) gutted federal clean energy incentives, non-cost challenges like uncertain and lengthy interconnection and siting processes, local restrictions on development, and supply chain bottlenecks led to lower levels of clean energy deployment than projected and slowed down grid upgrades. Now, clean energy and transmission face additional cost and financing barriers from Congressional rollbacks and permitting restrictions from the Trump Administration.

Past federal and state clean energy policies, including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) as well as state renewable portfolio standards, have leaned heavily on financial incentives to drive deployment and incentivize grid upgrades and expansion. These incentives successfully attracted massive investment in clean energy projects, but they largely did not grapple with non-cost challenges—like siting restrictions—to building projects.

Political challenges have made it difficult to pass, implement, and defend clean energy policies. A mismatch between public needs, government programs, and industry incentives has led to unsatisfactory outcomes and degraded public trust in the government.

Now, policymakers, industry, and the advocacy community are paying more attention to non-financial issues that can impede deployment, like siting and permitting. The abundance movement, for example, has identified two causes of America’s building problem: ineffective government programs and burdensome permitting processes. This diagnosis is incomplete. Getting to a world where we can build things quickly and make government work will require us to identify the full suite of problems, not just these convenient two.

To maximize clean energy deployment, we must address the project development barriers that slow down investment and construction. And to build more durable and effective energy policies, we must interrogate and address the political barriers that have held us back from smart policymaking and implementation that can withstand political change. Overcoming these challenges is necessary to address the climate crisis, rein in rising utility bills, and ensure that government can deliver on its energy promises to the public it serves.

In early 2025, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) set out to identify and categorize these barriers through research and interviews with experts and practitioners. Following this research, at the 2025 Climate Week NYC, FAS convened a group of researchers, advocates, industry leaders, and policymakers to solicit feedback on this framework.

The outcome of that convening allowed us to ground-truth the following report—which we intend to use as a rubric for state-level electricity policies and efforts to rethink federal energy policy. We should ask: to what extent do new policies under consideration reduce the major barriers to building clean energy and transmission while addressing the shortcomings that have made past policy less durable?

A future paper will detail the priority solutions that make progress on each of the project development barriers while improving our toolkit to overcome the political barriers that impede durable policy.

Project Development Barriers: Making it Harder to Build

Clean energy technologies are mature and cost competitive, if not least cost, across the country. Yet we are not building clean energy as fast as necessary, and in many places we are building new gas plants instead, raising costs for customers and intensifying the climate crisis. This trend is the result of several barriers that make it more difficult to build clean energy.

Interconnection

The Barrier

The interconnection process is one of the most significant constraints on clean energy deployment in the United States. At the end of 2023, nearly 2,600 gigawatts (GW) of generation and storage were queued, which is more than double the U.S. installed capacity (~1,280 GW). Today’s grid was built around a small number of large, centralized fossil fuel plants; the grid must now accommodate thousands of diverse, geographically distributed projects. Processes that were designed for a handful of large plants per year are now evaluating orders of magnitude more proposals, each with more complex grid interactions. These processes are not able to adequately handle the current grid, nor have they kept pace with development in grid planning and analysis tools. The result is a massive backlog of projects waiting to interconnect to the grid and a review system that is fundamentally misaligned with the scale and pace of the energy transition.

Developer experience confirms that interconnection challenges rank among the most decisive barriers to clean energy buildout. In the 2024 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) developer survey, respondents ranked interconnection delays and network upgrade costs higher than permitting, supply chain constraints, or workforce shortages as reasons for project cancellations or deferrals. Many projects face cost uncertainty on the order of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars as interconnection studies shift responsibility for broad system upgrades onto single developers. Interconnection costs are rising, and it is difficult for developers to predict what their interconnection bill will be at the end of the process. This unpredictability increases financing risk, reduces developer participation, and leads to large-scale attrition.

Outdated processes for evaluating and approving new projects have led to enormous project delays, averaging 4-5 years from request to commercial operation. This delay has raised prices and led some grid operators to keep old, expensive coal plants online in lieu of new capacity. Both of these trends benefit incumbent transmission and generation companies, who have significant decision-making power over the entities that control interconnection, making it difficult to update the processes. Clean energy projects also face higher interconnection costs than gas projects because they are more likely to need transmission upgrades to connect to the grid, which increases the chances of project cancellation.

These barriers have direct system-wide consequences. Only about 15 to 20 percent of projects that enter the queue ultimately reach commercial operation, meaning most of the clean energy capacity counted as “planned” will not materialize unless interconnection processes are reformed. Long queue timelines and uncertainty also make it more difficult to finance projects. The result is slower emissions reductions, delayed IRA-driven investment and job creation, and higher costs for consumers as operators extend the life of aging coal and gas resources to meet growing load.

The Past Playbook

Federal interconnection policy has largely gone through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In 2023, FERC issued Order 2023, which made significant changes intended to speed up interconnection and increase certainty for new projects. The rule (1) replaced outdated serial studies, in which operators study projects one by one as their applications come in, with cluster studies, in which operators study projects in batches, (2) required grid operators to speed up study timelines and imposed penalties for failing to meet deadlines, and (3) directed grid operators to update rules to reflect technological advancements, like grid-enhancing technologies and hybrid solar-plus-storage projects. Some grid operators have gone further than Order 2023 to improve interconnection processes, and some states have pushed grid operators for more ambitious reform. In addition to FERC rules, the federal government has also provided limited resources to grid operators to improve interconnection processes.

To date, federal efforts have largely fallen short of what’s necessary to reform interconnection processes to enable adequate buildout of clean energy, and in most places states have limited tools. For one, FERC rules rely on effective implementation from grid operators, which has been a mixed bag. Order 2023 also strayed from making more fundamental changes to the interconnection process, like fixed entry fees that provide certainty to developers or proactive modeling and transparency of information to allow projects to connect quickly in places with transmission headroom. It fully does not address the fundamental problem that rising, variable interconnection costs are killing projects. The federal government has limited resources to support grid operators through, for example, funding for increased staffing or new technology to automate studies.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must radically transform the way we connect projects to the grid to enable faster, greater deployment of clean energy, including through an expanded role for federal and state governments. Policy must shorten study timelines using automation and other new technology, enable smarter planning with proactive modeling and greater transparency for developers, increase upfront cost certainty, and reduce the amount that projects end up paying for interconnection. And in addition, the next playbook must address governance and decision-making structures that favor incumbents who benefit from a congested grid.

Siting & Permitting

The Barrier

Siting and permitting processes have become two of the most visible friction points in the clean energy buildout. While federal policy receives the most attention, most clean energy siting and permitting decisions are made at the state and local level, where zoning boards, planning commissions, county supervisors, and community members have significant influence over whether a project proceeds. In many states, local jurisdictions have adopted new ordinances that restrict or outright ban wind, solar, and transmission development. According to recent analyses, roughly one-fifth of U.S. counties now have formal restrictions on clean energy, and many more are considering them. Even in states with strong climate and clean energy targets, municipal-level land use rules can effectively halt projects that align with statewide goals.

These local barriers are often rooted in concerns about landscape change, perceived impacts on property values, agricultural land use, wildlife, or community identity. But they are also a reflection of who benefits and who bears the immediate impacts of clean energy development. Benefits like lower system-wide electricity prices, cleaner air, and national decarbonization progress tend to be distributed widely, while the visual and land-use impacts are concentrated locally. Developers may not readily have the resources to meet community needs to come to agreement on projects, and federal and state governments often do not have adequate resources to support community benefits. Misinformation and disinformation—spread by incumbent interests who stand to lose money with greater clean energy or transmission deployment—also seed opposition in communities.

Permitting requirements add an additional layer of delay and uncertainty. Most clean energy projects, particularly solar and storage projects—which make up the bulk of new planned capacity—rarely trigger major federal environmental statutes and primarily deal with state-level permitting. Developers must navigate state statutes governing clean water, conservation, and environmental impacts, which serve important purposes but are often still implemented through outdated processes (e.g., many states still require paper permits; in Arizona, digitization reduced timelines for one permit process by 91 percent) administered by understaffed agencies. Projects such as transmission lines, offshore wind facilities, pumped storage hydropower, nuclear plants, geothermal projects, and any project on federal land or receiving federal grants generally must also navigate federal permitting processes. When new projects trigger federal review, they must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and sometimes other federal permitting statutes, like the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Endangered Species Act. These reviews can take multiple years, particularly when agencies have limited staffing or when studies must coordinate across several state and federal entities and jurisdictions.

Delays from local siting and state and federal permitting translate directly into cost escalation and canceled projects. Developers report that siting challenges can add years to development schedules and millions of dollars in carrying costs before a shovel ever hits the ground. For technologies like wind and solar, where the business model depends on tight capital cost margins, extended pre-construction periods can be the difference between a viable project and one that never breaks ground. Transmission development is even more exposed: large lines can spend a decade or more navigating route identification, landowner negotiations, environmental review, and litigation. Without new transmission capacity, interconnection backlogs grow, power costs increase, and states are forced to rely on older fossil resources simply because they are already in place.

Yet, the challenge isn’t so simple. It is not simply “local opposition” or “slow permitting.” It is that the scale of clean energy land use today is fundamentally different from the past century of centralized fossil energy development. We are building more projects, in more places, at a pace that communities have not previously experienced.

The Past Playbook

Siting and permitting reforms have increasingly been part of the federal and state policy agenda. Reforms have largely focused on process changes and improving coordination across agencies, with some focus on building capacity for analysis and review in some federal agencies and states. In general, these reforms are insufficient and not widespread enough to match the urgency and scale of the U.S. energy transition.

The federal government has pursued a range of reforms over the past few years to improve the permitting process for projects that involve federal land, funding, or regulatory triggers. Key cross-agency initiatives include the Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits Program, which made the Department of Energy (DOE) the lead agency for coordinating environmental review and permitting for transmission lines, and FAST-41, which aims to align multiple agency reviews and reduce duplicative permitting processes. Agencies have taken additional steps to improve individual permitting processes. For example, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) designated solar and wind energy zones on public lands to reduce conflicts and expedite approvals, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management modernized offshore wind leasing and programmatic NEPA reviews (although the Trump Administration overhauled these reforms by halting all offshore wind leasing).

Several states have attempted to reduce delays and uncertainty by centralizing siting authority and standardizing permitting rules. For example, New York’s Office of Renewable Siting and Massachusetts’ Energy Facilities Siting Board can override local opposition for large projects, while other states provide model ordinances to guide counties on setbacks, noise, and environmental protection. DOE has also helped states: the agency provided a small amount of technical assistance to states to help local governments with planning, siting, and permitting decisions and a larger tranche of funding for transmission projects to provide benefits to local communities to help with siting and community buy-in. In some places, these reforms have improved consistency across counties and reduced the influence of NIMBY-driven delays.

This playbook, while directionally correct, has fallen short of what is necessary. Local restrictions on clean energy continue to proliferate, siting power plants and large transmission lines remains a major challenge, and many state and federal permitting processes still pose significant barriers. Existing efforts have several gaps: (1) many states have not addressed local restrictions on development, (2) process improvements, especially at the state level, have happened in a piecemeal fashion and have not extended to the full suite of state-level permitting requirements, (3) existing efforts often do not cover the full set of solutions (e.g., broken permitting for customer-owned solar is a huge impediment that keeps U.S. solar costs much higher than other countries), (4) governments and developers have insufficient tools to ensure that local communities get what they want out of projects, and (5) efforts to increase state and federal government capacity (i.e., hiring and training the right staff and increasing analytical capabilities) have fallen far short of what is needed to have a fast, effective, and responsible permitting and siting process.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must wrestle with the fundamental siting and permitting challenges and introduce new frameworks for planning, permitting, and building projects. That means upfront planning to make major decisions about tradeoffs between clean energy, water, conservation, and other goals, expanding the tools and resources necessary to ensure that local communities benefit from projects, dramatically improving government capacity to do siting and permitting well, and taking a holistic approach across federal, state, and local governments to prevent new bottlenecks from emerging.

Misaligned Incentives

The Barrier

Most clean energy and grid upgrade projects are financed by private capital and procured or built by companies, either utilities or independent power producers. The profit motives of those financiers and companies determines the solutions they invest in, within the bounds of policy requirements. Across states and regions, outdated utility regulations and market designs have created flawed incentives that have limited investment in some necessary solutions and resulted in overinvestment in others. Utilities have wielded significant political power, built by lobbying with ratepayer money, to maintain today’s incentive structure.

For example, in vertically integrated states, utilities are incentivized to prioritize capital expenditures that earn them the highest returns, within the bounds of commission approval. This incentive structure deprioritizes solutions like increasing imports of clean energy through new transmission and leveraging distributed resources like customer-owned solar.

Most commissions are often not well-equipped or willing to ensure that utilities pursue the full toolkit. In most states, utility planning is driven by the utilities, who conduct detailed analysis and provide proposals on planning and ratemaking to their commissions. Commissions have more limited capacity to conduct analysis and interrogate utility proposals.

Organized markets also have flawed incentive structures. For example, incentive structures in organized markets were generally designed around an electricity grid made up of a small number of large power plants. As a result, market rules and incentive structures provide limited to no support for distributed energy resources, which makes it harder to finance these projects. Governance structures exacerbate this issue. In some organized markets, incumbent generators have significant decision-making power in important determinants of clean energy deployment, including interconnection and transmission planning. Some organized markets have maintained rules that make it difficult to connect new power plants.

Misaligned incentives reduce the effectiveness of other policy solutions. For example, tax credits to reduce the cost of clean energy projects are most effective if utility companies have a profit incentive to build those projects instead of other generation types. The effectiveness of bulk transmission grant programs is limited by the willingness of utility companies to collaborate on projects.

The Past Playbook

Federal policy has largely ignored utility incentive structures and instead attempted to influence private-sector behavior by working within existing incentive structures (e.g., by making it easier for utility companies to use tax credits to build clean energy). Federal agencies have attempted to overcome misaligned incentives through regulations (e.g., pollution standards on power plants that require generation owners to make changes). Some efforts to change incentives structures (e.g., the Clean Electricity Payment Program included in the 2021 Build Back Better Bill) have gained momentum but failed to pass.

Many states have also used tools that operate within existing incentive structures, like renewable portfolio standards that require utilities to procure an increasing share of their electricity from clean sources. States have attempted to change incentive structures to varying extents. More than 15 states have adopted some form of performance-based ratemaking to align utility incentives with desired outcomes. However, these efforts vary in how comprehensively they have changed the dominant incentives for companies.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must reform incentives to realign private sector interests with public benefit, including affordable bills, reliability, and decarbonization. To achieve the scale, speed, and depth of transformation needed to address the challenges facing our grid, policy must address misaligned incentives for distribution utilities, generation owners, and integrated utilities in different regulatory contexts. That requires a greater focus on realigning incentive structures at the state and regional level (through organized market reform) as well as creative federal tools to directly change incentives or help states and organized markets to do so. Increasing regulator scrutiny of utilities and bolstering capacity at commissions must also play a larger role moving forward to ensure that utilities are focusing on the best solutions, not just what is most profitable. Greater use of publicly owned or publicly financed projects can also ensure investment in solutions that are underutilized by private companies.

Financing

The Barrier

The federal government has created new financial barriers for clean energy projects. OBBBA’s changes to tax incentives and increased regulatory and permitting uncertainty make clean energy projects more expensive and harder to finance. Macroeconomic changes like persistent inflation and other uncertainty, including on tariffs and interest rates, have also affected investment.

While the clean energy industry has continued to move forward (2025 investment in solar, storage, and wind is similar to 2024 levels, and the industry is benefiting from demand growth, as many projects are able to find offtakers like tech companies willing to pay higher prices), the full effects of federal policy changes are likely delayed, as the tax credits have not fully expired. Moving forward, financing may become a larger barrier. In addition, rising utility bills have opened a conversation about the cost of private finance for grid projects and whether there are alternative approaches that come with lower costs for customers.

Financing less mature clean energy technologies, like advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal, and aggregated distributed generation (i.e., virtual power plants), remains a major issue.

The Past Playbook

Financial support has played a dominant role in the federal energy policy playbook. Tax incentives, which were dramatically expanded by the IRA and pared down by OBBBA, have been central to energy policy for decades. Grant and loan programs, also dramatically expanded by the IRA, have also been a core driver of clean energy deployment, grid upgrades, and large-scale demonstrations and commercialization of advanced energy technologies. States have also used tax incentives, grant programs, and green banks to finance and incentivize clean energy and grid projects. This model has largely been successful at deploying mature technologies like wind, solar, and storage, but it has fallen short when it comes to commercializing some newer clean energy technologies. Gaps also remain in financial support for projects that struggle to get private capital.

Where Do We Go From Here?

Financing and financial support should continue to be a major pillar of clean energy policy. The next era must incorporate a broader, more diverse set of financing tools in the capital stack, including state-led public financing for more types of projects and state efforts to create demand certainty for clean energy by leveraging procurement and working with corporate buyers.

Grid Planning

The Barrier

Today, the U.S. bulk transmission system faces significant constraints that limit where new clean energy projects can be built and threaten reliability. Congestion already causes curtailment of low-cost low-carbon power, higher consumer electricity prices, and dampened investment in clean energy. Many regions with abundant clean energy resources simply do not have enough high-voltage transmission capacity to deliver that power to population centers. As a result, developers are increasingly unable to move generation projects forward even when siting, permitting, financing, and interconnection queue positions are in place.

These challenges stem in large part from fragmented and inadequate planning processes. Coordinated planning is essential to ensure that transmission is expanded in the right places and that new clean energy investments flow to areas with sufficient transmission capacity. Despite the need for coordination, the United States conducts virtually no interregional transmission planning, and regional planning has been lacking in many regions. The result is piecemeal grid planning, as transmission providers and developers focus on smaller lines which meet near-term needs and are profitable within their own footprint. Planning for these smaller lines is easier as fewer parties are involved. Where we have successfully built larger regional lines, they are the result of transmission providers conducting robust planning processes. And because no unified authority or planning framework exists to shepherd large, high-impact projects across regions, the U.S. has built essentially zero major interregional transmission lines in recent history.

Lack of coordination between transmission and generation planning also creates inefficiencies and prevents smart development. In deregulated markets (and some vertically integrated states), transmission and generation planning processes occur largely in isolation without systematic processes to align long-term clean energy expansion with major grid upgrades.

Together, these gaps make expanding the transmission system an inefficient process at best, and an unworkable process at worst, at precisely the moment when the need for additional capacity is growing most rapidly.

The Past Playbook

Policymakers have made progress in addressing transmission planning bottlenecks, but these reforms remain far short of what’s needed. FERC Order 1920 is the most significant recent step: it requires long-term, forward-looking, multi-value regional planning. It was designed to improve transparency in the planning stages and help regions identify beneficial projects earlier. Yet the rule stops at regional borders and thereby doesn’t meaningfully advance interregional planning.

A patchwork of state and regional efforts has emerged alongside federal reforms. New Mexico created a new entity called the Renewable Energy Transmission Authority to map and finance new lines. Similarly, Colorado created the Colorado Electric Transmission Authority to plan and develop transmission lines to meet power needs, unlock clean energy, and lower costs. California conducts long-term transmission planning intended to incorporate transmission needs to accommodate clean energy deployment required to meet the state’s climate goals. Federal tools like National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETCs) were designed to accelerate siting of critically important lines, and part of DOE’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) funding has helped bring utilities, states, and developers together to plan large projects. On the interregional front, DOE has conducted analysis to demonstrate where new capacity would create the greatest benefits and inform planning.

These efforts certainly make progress and will likely result in expansion of local and regional transmission capacity. The magnitude of progress will depend in large part on how transmission providers implement Order 1920—for most regions, compliance filings will be submitted this month (December 2025) or by June 2026.

However, this playbook had significant gaps and pitfalls. Lack of interregional planning is the most glaring gap, but other tools had limitations, too. GRIP had limited funding and power to solve cost allocation disputes. NIETCs did not translate into built infrastructure. In many places transmission planning will not take into account the long-term clean energy expansion required for deep decarbonization, leaving high-value opportunities—like pairing wind resources with long-distance transmission—unrealized. The result is a set of reforms that move in the right direction but still fall short.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must tackle interregional planning, while following through on Order 1920 with effective implementation. We must require transmission providers to plan decisively for futures with significant load growth and levels of clean energy deployment necessary for deep decarbonization. Future federal policy must also expand the government’s tools to bring parties to the table for smart, effective planning. In parallel, states should continue to use creative policies, like Colorado and New Mexico’s transmission authorities, to strategically plan new transmission lines to maximize benefits. And the next era must also include national, forward-looking land-use planning for clean energy deployment, in sync with transmission planning.

Supply Chains

The Barrier

Grid components, such as electrical steel and transformers, are necessary to increase grid capacity to support additional generation and load. However, grid component supply chains are still suffering from disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of domestic manufacturing capacity. The rising demand for grid components and battery technology have further stressed supply chains, drawing out lead times and increasing prices. For example, across transmission and distribution equipment, the lead time for components averaged 38 weeks in 2023, nearly double from the year prior, with costs escalating nearly 30 percent year-over-year. Bottlenecks in the supply chains from upstream suppliers to manufacturers among these components risk power system stability, the ability to deploy clean energy, and the ability to build new industrial production and technology facilities at scale.

The Past Playbook

Federal policy has increasingly focused on building secure supply chains for clean energy technologies. The IRA included tax credits, grant programs, and loan authority to build out domestic supply chains for clean energy and storage technologies. The federal government has also used demand-side pressure to bolster supply chains (e.g., through a bonus tax incentive for clean energy projects that use domestic content and Build America Buy America requirements on federal grant programs). These policies led to major investment in domestic supply chains.

This playbook was quite successful at building out domestic supply chains for some industries, but it had major gaps. For example, the IRA and BIL included no dedicated support for grid components, and the minimal support that was embedded in larger programs was insufficient. Federal demand-side programs were structured as incentives for downstream industries to use domestic content, but this design had too much uncertainty to sufficiently derisk upstream domestic supply chains.

Today’s programs have also struggled to respond quickly when conditions change. For example, the federal government had limited tools with which to respond when the utility industry faced a debilitating shortage of large power transformers or when it became clear that incentives were not large enough to drive domestic investment for some clean energy components.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must build on the same financial tools to support secure supply chains that enable clean energy deployment and grid upgrades. The playbook must include policies that more directly create demand for domestic components to provide certainty for manufacturers and derisk new investments. Future policy must also provide more flexible and dynamic tools to rapidly address supply chain shortages as they arise.

Political Barriers: Making it Harder to Pass, Implement, and Defend Policy

Clean energy advocates have focused on economic competitiveness, climate, and public health benefits as the winning messages to support and defend policies. The BIL and IRA came out of this model, and the architects of those policies hoped that the industry that benefitted from these policies would step up to defend them. While this strategy has enabled passage of significant new policies, it has failed to withstand changing political dynamics. The swift rollback of major parts of BIL and IRA is the prime example. Our ability to successfully implement and defend clean energy policies—and make further progress—has been hampered by several key political barriers. The next era of clean energy policy must address these barriers to be successful.

Energy Affordability

The Barrier

Rapidly rising utility bills have become an urgent cost-of-living issue. People pay 13 percent more for electricity in 2025 than they did in 2022, and nearly 40 percent of households sometimes have to choose between paying for food and medicine or keeping the lights on.

Rising electricity prices are a political barrier to some clean energy policies. For example, states have struggled to follow through on procurement of advanced clean energy technologies like nuclear and offshore wind as prices have risen. New York recently cancelled a planned transmission line, using affordability as a justification. Clean energy opponents are using prices to oppose climate policies, even though deployment of wind and solar has generally reduced rates. Concerns about electricity affordability make it difficult to justify major grid infrastructure investments under current regulatory and ratemaking structures, as additional spending to update the grid will lead to near-term bill increases. High prices also make it difficult to replace direct fossil fuel use in vehicles, buildings, and factories with electricity.

The Past Playbook

Federal energy policy has largely dealt with affordability in two ways.

First, the federal government has provided important but limited direct assistance to struggling households through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps households pay for energy, and the Weatherization Assistance Program, which funds energy- and cost-saving home improvements. However, these programs are significantly underfunded and oversubscribed—many households that need support do not get it.

Second, federal financial support results in long-term savings. IRA incentives for low-cost clean energy were projected to reduce generation costs, which in the long term translates to lower prices. Tax incentives and grant programs for distributed energy resources and home energy improvements save energy and costs for customers that make upgrades. However, this approach falls short in two ways: (1) it does not address the root causes of rising electricity bills, which means bills will continue to rise, and (2) the benefits are long term and do not show up on peoples’ bills on politically relevant timelines.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must provide sufficient and swift relief for customers that are on the edge of catastrophe due to rising costs, make it easier to deploy cheap, clean energy to reduce generation costs, and target the root causes of high and rising bills to unlock a sustainable utility ratemaking regime that allows for major new investments in the grid without harming regular people. The new playbook must also include more effective cross-sector tools to cut total system and household costs, including by transferring planned spending on gas infrastructure to home electrification and grid upgrades where possible.

Incumbent Interests

The Barrier

Many solutions, including adding new generation in organized markets, relying more on regional and interregional transmission, and deploying distributed and demand-side solutions, threaten the profits of incumbent interests under current market and regulatory structures. For example, utilities make money through a return on qualified capital investments in things like power plants and distribution infrastructure. Increasing bulk transmission capacity to connect the Southeast with other regions would lead to more imports of lower cost clean energy, which would reduce the utilities’ reliance on local generation. That makes it harder for the utilities to justify capital expenditures in new power plants, which is how the utilities make a profit, so new transmission poses a threat to the business model. As a result, Southeastern utilities are opposed to policies that would expand bulk transmission to better connect different regions, even though these policies would reduce costs and increase reliability. These dynamics make it politically difficult to pursue policies that expand transmission capacity.

The Past Playbook

Federal clean energy policy has largely avoided changing incumbent incentive structures or decision-making processes at the state and regional level. Instead, policymakers have used financial incentives to bring incumbents to the table and increase their investment in clean energy and grid upgrades. As a result, the misaligned incentives described above, combined with decision-making structures that reward incumbents over innovation, make it difficult to fully address the barriers to clean energy deployment and grid upgrades at the necessary scale.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of clean energy policy must address governance issues through reform of regional grid operators and public utility commissions. Strengthening the role of regulators is critical to reining in incumbent interests where they do not align with public benefit. It must also realign industry incentives (e.g., through performance-based ratemaking) where possible with affordability and decarbonization goals.

Delayed Impact

The Barrier

Another major political barrier is the lengthy time it takes to get from enactment and implementation to tangible benefits for people. Transforming major sectors of the economy is a time-intensive, multi-stage project, and climate advocates have accordingly focused on long-term goals, such as 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 or net-zero emissions by 2050. The IRA and BIL were made up primarily of multi-year (even some decadal) programs to drive major changes in the economy. As a result, the largest benefits were projected to come in the late 2020s and early 2030s, far outside the window of political memory. That mismatch makes it difficult for the public to understand the point of policies and in turn makes those policies hard to defend.

Where policies do have near-term benefits, those benefits have often been delayed by the implementation process. Successfully shifting the private sector requires precise policy and new programs, which take time to implement. Implementation of new programs can also run up against the government typically works, and that friction causes delays. Implementation delays make it difficult to connect the dots between policy and tangible improvements to peoples’ lives.

The Past Playbook

Policymakers have used three dominant approaches to overcoming this barrier. First, they tout near-term signs of economic change. For example, the Biden administration consistently cited private-sector investment in clean energy as a key metric to convince the public that the IRA and BIL were driving benefits for people. Second, they rely on the quickest economic changes to demonstrate impact. For example, the IRA and BIL drove a near-term increase in construction jobs. Real and announced job creation was the dominant message to support and defend these policies. Third, they cite projected benefits. For example, the Biden administration frequently cited the 1.5 million jobs and the $27 to $33 billion in energy cost savings that the IRA was projected to drive.

Attention to long-term impact is important for addressing long-term problems like climate change and load growth. However, politics runs on instant gratification. As of late 2024, only 39 percent of Americans had heard of the IRA. And federal energy policy failed to make a near-term dent in the issue that was most visible for people: utility bills.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of clean energy policy must tangibly and visibly benefit people in the short term. The playbook must include a better balance of policies geared toward long-term transformation of the economy and policies focused on pressing issues for regular people. That means including programs that are designed for quick implementation and real-world change.

Conclusion: What’s Next?

The power sector sits at an inflection point. The challenges facing the grid are immediate, interconnected, and solvable but only if we confront the real sources of delay and dysfunction. Accelerating clean energy deployment requires moving beyond our old playbook—dominated by financial incentives and regulations that see-saw based on the political winds—toward a new approach that addresses both project development barriers that slow investment and construction and political barriers that impede durable policymaking. Building durable, effective energy policy demands a clear-eyed assessment of the barriers that have undermined smart policymaking and implementation.

In a forthcoming publication, we will move from diagnosis to action, detailing policy solutions that can unlock faster, more reliable project development while expanding the policy toolkit needed to overcome the political barriers that have prevented durable reform. Together, these solutions aim to strengthen grid reliability, rein in rising utility bills, and put the United States back on a credible path to decarbonization. These stakes could not be higher, and the opportunity to build a more affordable, resilient, and clean energy system has never been more urgent.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1212-barrier-report.png,N,,2025-12-15 11:02:48.307643

“If we’re supposed to be the global epicenter of mobility and not automotive … why aren’t these companies here?” Le asked.
The talent is not here, and the automotive companies take all the air out of the room.”","With Michigan’s signature industry undergoing rapid transformation, from tariffs and shifting fuel economy standards to the accelerated growth of Chinese competitors, the message is clear: Michigan cannot expect to win the future of the industry solely through legacy.

On Dec. 10, MichAuto investors, partners, and government officials came together for a critical conversation on the global forces of change and innovation impacting Michigan’s automobility industry.

During the event, MichAuto released the State of Automobility report, which identifies the forces of change shaping its future, weaknesses that threaten global leadership, and strengths that reinforce it.

2025 reshaped Michigan’s automobility industry in ways few could have imagined, making it the year when the unexpected became the norm. When asked to name the most unexpected thing that occurred in 2025, Tu Le mentioned the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement getting “blown up.”

Daniel Howes described another unexpected turn Michigan faced in 2025: a strategic reversal in the automotive industry. With EV incentives being taken away, the industry has begun to pull back, drifting away from the global stage.

“When I first started covering as a beat writer at General Motors, one of the reasons I was so blown away by the opportunities was that they were everywhere,” Howes said. “Now they’ve retreated to only places where they make a profit.”

Lastly, Elizabeth Krear pointed to another unexpected turn Michigan faced in 2025: the significant rollback of emissions and Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations.

“Growing up as an engineer in the industry, we lived and breathed those policies,” she reflected on.

These policies have long provided clear targets, especially in guiding the EV transition. With their reversal, however, the industry across California, Europe, and China is now forced to rethink its strategies, shifting from policy-driven benchmarks to a landscape where customers themselves set the pace.

Although Michigan is a major player in the global automotive industry, we may not be ready to keep up with the industry’s rapidly increasing pace. Chinese companies are moving so fast that GM and Ford Motor Company have relied on China for building hybrid vehicles. China isn’t just a competitor; it’s become the global hub for auto manufacturing and exports.

“When it comes to dealing and talking with the tier ones and the OEMs, quite often it’s culture and management that needs to change, and the speed at which things happen, and decisions are made,” Le said. “Right now, a Chinese company can go from clean sheet to job one in 18 months.”

Another way to assess whether Michigan’s signature industry is ready to compete globally is to examine affordability and consumer behavior. The industry can’t rely on old consumer habits. Rising prices and shifting demand mean Michigan’s automakers must stay flexible.

“This year in 2025, we saw an uptick in SUVs and large trucks,” Krear said. “However, these are not the type of vehicles that the U.S. consumer would currently buy.”

In light of the unexpected turns Michigan faced in 2025, Krear emphasized the importance of partnerships as a critical asset heading into 2026. As technology advances, collaborations between OEMs and suppliers are becoming increasingly prominent, with Volkswagen teaming up with Rivian and LG Energy partnering with GM.

As Michigan also enters a pivotal election year, what kind of leadership and conversations will be required to drive meaningful change? Reflecting on three decades of covering issues related to talent retention and educational attainment, Howes noted that these issues have not shown significant improvement and emphasized the need for honest, nonpartisan dialogue.

“When it has gotten materially better, it hasn’t hung on to the gains,” he said. “While we live in a partisan age, partisanship is not the answer because it wasn’t the answer in Detroit.”

Closing out what to look forward to in 2026, Le also expressed his concerns about our area not being as welcoming to new companies like Waymo.

“If we’re supposed to be the global epicenter of mobility and not automotive … why aren’t these companies here?” Le asked. “Because they don’t feel welcome. The talent is not here, and the automotive companies take all the air out of the room.”",https://michauto.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ld-day-at-the-capitol-ld-photo-gallery-3-24.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:59:59.222424

The Renewable Energy Certificate Market forecasts point to sustained expansion over the next decade, underpinned by increasing renewable generation capacity, regulatory mandates, and voluntary corporate sustainability commitments.

According to Ameco Research, the global renewable energy certificate (REC) market is experiencing robust growth, with valuations and future projections in 2024 between approximately USD 15 billion and USD 28 billion, with substantial upside potential in long-term forecasts. In terms of certificates issued, the Renewable Energy Certificate Market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 20.2% from 2021 to 2028, with 2,175,813 certificates issued in 2020 and 9,298,511 certificates issued by 2028.

Renewable Energy Certificate Market Growth Forecast

• CAGR Prediction (2021-2028): The Renewable Energy Certificate market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~20.2% during 2021-2028.

• Certificates Issued in 2020: Approximately 2,175,813 MWh (or certificates) were issued globally in 2020.

• Certificates Estimated by 2028: Forecasts project that certificate issuance could reach around 9,298,511 MWh by 2028 — indicating strong expansion in renewable generation and certification activity.

What Are Renewable Energy Certificates?

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are tradable instruments representing the environmental attributes of one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from renewable resources. RECs serve as a mechanism for utilities, corporations, and other power consumers to demonstrate compliance with renewable portfolio standards (RPS) or support voluntary green energy goals.

By separating the renewable attribute from the physical electricity, RECs enable market participants to purchase the environmental value of renewable energy even when they cannot directly source clean power from the grid.

Renewable Energy Certificate Market Drivers

Several factors are contributing to the accelerating growth of the renewable energy certificate market:

Regulatory Mandates and Policy Frameworks

National and regional renewable energy targets, including RPS programs in North America and the EU's stringent climate policies, continue to drive demand for RECs as compliance instruments. These programs compel utilities and energy users to source a defined share of power from renewable sources, boosting REC issuance and trading activity.

Corporate Sustainability Initiatives

More corporations are setting net-zero and carbon-neutral goals. RECs are an essential tool for companies seeking to credibly claim renewable energy use across operations, particularly in jurisdictions where direct renewable procurement remains challenging.

Increasing Renewable Capacity

Global renewable electricity generation — led by solar and wind — continues to grow rapidly as countries expand low-carbon infrastructure. This expansion naturally supports higher REC issuance, underpinning market liquidity and trading volumes.

Market Liberalization and Technology Integration

Developments in blockchain and digital tracking technologies are improving transparency and efficiency in REC markets, reducing fraud and transaction friction.

Renewable Energy Certificate Market Regional Outlook

North America remains a significant force, driven by regulatory frameworks such as Renewable Portfolio Standards and corporate renewable procurement programs. The region's REC market has been one of the most dynamic, supported by robust renewable deployment and demand for compliance instruments.

Europe's REC market is buoyed by comprehensive climate targets and initiatives like the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which aim to increase renewable penetration and emissions reductions across member states.

Asia-Pacific is emerging as a high-growth region, propelled by rapid renewable capacity additions in China, Japan, and Australia. Policy reforms and investment in renewable infrastructure are accelerating REC market development.

Other emerging markets in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa are gaining traction, particularly where governments and utilities are adopting renewable targets and incentive schemes.

Renewable Energy Certificate Market Trends: Compliance vs. Voluntary Markets

The REC market can broadly be segmented into compliance and voluntary categories:

• Compliance RECs are driven by legal or policy mandates. Utilities and power suppliers must purchase or produce a share of renewable generation, stimulating demand for compliance certificates.

• Voluntary RECs are acquired by corporations and consumers seeking to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability beyond regulatory requirements.

Both segments are expanding, with compliance markets often offering steady base demand while voluntary markets introduce flexibility and broader participation from non-utility entities.

Challenges and Market Resilience

Despite strong growth projections, the REC market faces challenges:

• Policy and Regulatory Complexity: Differences in REC definitions, tracking systems, and cross-border recognition can complicate market participation.

• Price Volatility: REC prices can fluctuate based on supply dynamics, policy changes, and variations in compliance requirements.

• Integration with Power Markets: Aligning REC trading with energy market operations and physical generation profiles remains technically complex.

Nevertheless, ongoing policy refinement and technological innovation continue to enhance market robustness and investor confidence.

Renewable Energy Certificate Market Future Outlook

The renewable energy certificate market is positioned for sustained expansion, driven by global decarbonization efforts, the proliferation of renewable generation, and the growing integration of RECs into corporate sustainability strategies. As governments tighten clean energy mandates and companies ramp up renewable commitments, RECs will remain a pivotal component of the energy transition toolkit.

Given the breadth of growth projections — from mid-range forecasts targeting tens of billions by 2030 to long-term estimates exceeding USD 180 billion by the mid-2030s — stakeholders anticipate that REC markets will evolve into deeper, more liquid, and globally harmonized platforms supporting renewable energy growth worldwide.

As projections of U.S. electricity demand rise sharply, President Donald Trump is looking to coal – historically a dominant force in the U.S. energy economy – as a key part of the solution.

In an April 2025 executive order, for instance, Trump used emergency powers to direct the Department of Energy to order the owners of coal-fired power plants that were slated to be shut down to keep the plants running.

He also directed federal agencies to “identify coal resources on Federal lands” and ease the process for leasing and mining coal on those lands. In addition, he issued orders to exclude coal-related projects from environmental reviews, promote coal exports and potentially subsidize the production of coal as a national security resource.

But there remain limits to the president’s power to slow the declining use of coal in the U.S. And while efforts continue to overcome these limits and prop up coal, mining coal remains an ongoing danger to workers: In 2025, there have been five coal-mining deaths in West Virginia and at least two others elsewhere in the U.S.

A long legacy

Until 2015, coal-fired power plants generated more electricity than any other type of fuel in the U.S. But with the rapid expansion of a new type of hydraulic fracturing, natural gas became a cheap and stable source for power generation. The prices of solar and wind power also dropped steadily. These alternatives ultimately overcame coal in the U.S. power supply.

Before this change, coal mining defined the economy and culture of many U.S. towns – and some states and regions, such as Wyoming and Appalachia – for decades. And in many small towns, coal-related businesses, including power plants, were key employers.

Coal has both benefits and drawbacks. It provides a reliable fuel source for electricity that can be piled up on-site at power plants without needing a tank or underground facility for storage.

But it’s dirty: Thousands of coal miners developed a disease called black lung. The federal government pays for medical care for some sick miners and makes monthly payments to family members of miners who die prematurely. Burning coal also emits multiple air pollutants, prematurely killing half a million people in the United States from 1999 through 2020.

Coal is dangerous for workers, too. Some coal-mining companies have had abysmal safety records, leading to miner deaths, such as the recent drowning of a miner in a sudden flood in a West Virginia mine. Safety reforms have been implemented since the Big Branch Mine explosion in 2010, and coal miner deaths in the U.S. have since declined. But coal mining remains a hazardous job.

A champion of coal

In both of his terms, Trump has championed the revival of coal. In 2017, for example, Trump’s Department of Energy asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to pay coal and nuclear plants higher rates than the competitive market would pay, saying they were key to keeping the U.S. electricity grid running. The commission declined.

In his second term, Trump is more broadly using powers granted to the president in emergencies, and he is seeking to subsidize coal across the board – in mining, power plants and exports.

At least some of the urgency is coming from the rapid construction of data centers for artificial intelligence, which the Trump administration champions. Many individual data centers use as much power as a small or medium city. There’s enough generation capacity to power them, though only by activating power plants that are idle most of the time and that operate only during peak demand periods. Using those plants would require data centers to reduce their electricity use during those peaks – which it’s not clear they would agree to do.

So many data centers, desperate for 24/7 electricity, are relying on old coal-fired power plants – buying electricity from plants that otherwise would be shutting down.

Limits remain

Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to rapidly expand data centers and coal to power them, coal is more expensive than most other fuels for power generation, with costs still rising.

Half of U.S. coal mines have closed within the past two decades, and productivity at the remaining mines is declining due to a variety of factors, such as rising mining costs, environmental regulation and competition from cheaper sources. Coal exports have also seen declines in the midst of the tariff wars.

The U.S. Department of the Interior’s recent effort to follow Trump’s orders and lease more coal on federal lands received only one bid – at a historically low price of less than a penny per ton. But in fact, even if the government gave its coal away for free, it would still make more economic sense for utilities to build power plants that use other fuels. This is due to the high cost of running old coal plants as compared to new natural gas and renewable infrastructure.",https://cpr-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/uploads/2023/03/coal-power-plant-water.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:03:18.154211

Announced at the inaugural summit on December 12, the initiative formalizes a growing consensus among partner nations that the global economy is being reorganized by AI—and that secure access to critical minerals, semiconductor manufacturing, compute capacity, energy, and trusted digital infrastructure is now a matter of economic and national security.

The United States convened partners from Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia, with guest contributions from Taiwan, the European Union, Canada, and the OECD. Collectively, these countries anchor the semiconductor and AI supply chain, home to companies such as Sony, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Samsung, SK Hynix, Temasek, DeepMind, MGX, Rio Tinto, and ASML.

At the summit, delegates emphasized a shared objective: reducing single points of failure and overreliance on any one market for materials, components, or compute. That includes strengthening long-term offtake agreements, coordinating responses to dumping or oversupply conditions, and mobilizing co-investment to expand productive capacity across the semiconductor, energy, and mineral-processing sectors.

The initiative also underscores a geopolitical shift. The United States has asserted that economic security is now inseparable from national security, particularly as AI accelerates global competition. Partner countries echoed the view that trustworthy systems—such as secure fiber networks, hardened data centers, and protected semiconductor lines—are essential for safeguarding innovation, investment, and future growth.

Despite rising EV adoption across much of the world, particularly in Europe and China, the report highlights an overall softening in EV demand – with some consumers shifting to buy an ICE car as their next vehicle.

With EV charging infrastructure remaining one of the top concerns for potential EV buyers, this report highlights just how important the continued rollout of infrastructure will be to ensure mass EV adoption.

How close are we to mass EV adoption across the globe?

This new report from EY takes a global look at car buying intent, and finds that on a global scale, EV purchase intent has fallen – with 14% of consumers intending to buy a fully-electric car in the next 24 months, down from 24% when the survey was ran in 2024. This can partly be attributed to a number of key policy changes around the world, such as the United States’ recent removal of EV tax credits.

The report also looked, on a global scale, at what consumers perceive to be the top barriers for choosing an EV as their next car over an ICE. The number one concern was range anxiety, voiced by 29% of potential buyers. This is despite the fact that EVs entering the market have higher quoted battery ranges than ever before – over 250 miles is quickly becoming the industry standard, whilst ranges of up to 400 miles, previously the reserve of the most expensive EVs on the market, are now becoming a reality on relatively more affordable electric cars – the 492 mile Mercedes-Benz CLA being a case in point. With improvements in EV technology moving at such a rapid rate, there is a clear disconnect between the range modern EVs are actually capable of and what consumers believe they are, which needs to be addressed through stronger marketing messages.

The other key concerns mentioned were a ‘lack of charging infrastructure’ and ‘battery replacement costs’, both voiced by 28% of respondents. When it comes to charging infrastructure, the number of charge points continues to grow globally, even in countries with less favourable EV policies such as the US, so ensuring that consumers know that the infrastructure is available when they switch is a key communication to be made. When it comes to battery replacement costs, OEMs are already in the process of quelling this worry, most recently seen with BYD’s extension to its Blade battery warranty – which now covers the battery for eight years or 250,000 kilometres (155,000 miles).

Despite an uphill struggle for manufacturers to convince first-time EV buyers, the report also makes clear that once people make the switch to EV, the vast majority stick with it. Whilst only 5% of global ICE owners are considering a BEV for their next car, for current BEV owners globally, a majority 78% of them plan to stick with a BEV for their next car purchase. Therefore, getting car buyers into their first time EV is crucial to drive EV adoption in the years and decades to come.

We reached out to ChargeUK, the industry voice for the UK public charging industry, for further comment on what these statistics mean for the UK specifically, where EV adoption and charge point rollout has continued to grow at a strong rate.

Vicky Read, Chief Executive of ChargeUK, commented on the report:

“This study is light on specific data for the UK, but it does show that of all major markets ours has the lowest number of potential EV buyers reconsidering. This tallies with other studies such as PwC’s recent ‘eReadiness’ survey which found the UK’s drivers are more open to EVs than they were last year.

It is interesting to see that range anxiety and access to charging have steadily decreased as concerns for several years but picked up this year. I suspect that this may not be the case in the UK where the sector has been busy building some of the best and most widespread public charging infrastructure in the world. Though there can be a gap between reality and perception, and moving forward on education and visibility through things like official signage would be useful in the UK market.”",https://electricdrives.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ev-infrastructure-procurement.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 12:02:52.374086

,EPA,2025-12-15 13:44:52+00:00,www.nationofchange.org,Report: Proposed EPA cuts further imperil environmental protections in cash-strapped states,Not Available,,,,,https://www.nationofchange.org/2025/12/15/report-proposed-epa-cuts-further-imperil-environmental-protections-in-cash-strapped-states/,"Massive cuts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have hampered state-level regulators’ ability to rein in pollution, according to a new report.
And 31 states cut staff totals at their environmental agencies, collectively eliminating 3,725 roles in that same period.
Even more significantly, though, according to the report, many states are simply not equipped to address their challenges without a strong federal partner.
“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” she said.
Meanwhile, both houses of Congress are recommending much less severe EPA cuts.","Massive cuts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have hampered state-level regulators’ ability to rein in pollution, according to a new report. And now, with the Trump administration pushing for even deeper cuts at the agency in 2026, many states across the country may be in a dire position.

“If EPA’s capacity to do its job is further diminished, how prepared are our states to shoulder more responsibility for protecting us from these threats? Unfortunately, not well,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP), the nonprofit behind the report, said in a Wednesday press conference on the findings.

The report found that 27 state governments have cut environmental agency funding over the past 15 years, including seven states — Texas, Wyoming, Iowa, Alabama, Connecticut, South Dakota, and Mississippi — that have cut budgets by a third or more. And 31 states cut staff totals at their environmental agencies, collectively eliminating 3,725 roles in that same period.

That leaves them vulnerable to Trump administration changes at the EPA, which has already seen its budget cut 40 percent between 2010 and 2025. In 2025 alone, EPA staffers have left in droves, thanks to mass firings, layoffs, and resignations — as much as 33 percent of its total staff, according to some estimates. Meanwhile, the White House has proposed cutting the agency’s budget by 55 percent in 2026 to $4.2 billion, its lowest level of funding in four decades.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has suggested that states will be able to pick up the slack, describing a vision for the agency that involves giving “power back to states to make their own decisions.” In a March press conference announcing a major deregulation initiative — what he called “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen” — Zeldin fundamentally recast EPA’s mission, outlining a new mandate to “unleash American energy” and “revitalize the American auto industry.”

Protecting Americans from the impacts of industry pollution, he suggested, would instead fall to state agencies, which are “best positioned to work with unique communities and implement laws.”

“In too many instances and across too many administrations, EPA has retained control of implementing many laws from its perch in the nation’s capital,” he said, in an address to the Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit organization representing environmental agency leaders, later that month. “It’s this kind of common sense reform I want to partner with states to achieve.”

In its report, EIP argues that this stance ignores EPA’s statutorily defined mission to protect the health and well-being of Americans, while downplaying the crucial role it plays in outlining national standards and coordinating efforts related to complex, multi-state problems. Even more significantly, though, according to the report, many states are simply not equipped to address their challenges without a strong federal partner.

“This kind of handoff — from federal to state — can only work if the teammate receiving the baton has not been hobbled, as many state environmental agencies have been, by budget cuts,” the report’s authors write.

Twenty three states have in fact worked to increase environmental funding since 2010 — with California (364 percent increase), Colorado (111 percent increase), and Vermont (109 percent increase) leading the way. Which means future cuts to the EPA would likely have a disproportionate impact on states like Mississippi and South Dakota, which have cut agency funding by 71 percent and 61 percent, respectively.

In the Wednesday press conference convened by EIP, environmental advocates painted a broad picture of state-level regulatory dysfunction that would only be made worse by further federal cuts.

The proposed cuts are “a recipe for disaster in states like ours, where the state agency is already stretched thin,” Drew Ball, southeast campaigns director for the National Resources Defense Council of North Carolina, where environmental agency funding had already declined 32 percent since 2010, said at EIP’s news conference.

“It’s like dismantling the fire department while the house is already burning.”

States depend on a variety of EPA grants to help fund their compliance efforts, ensuring that standards under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other laws are met. The Trump administration has proposed cutting EPA “categorical grants” by approximately $1 billion, eliminating nearly all federal funding for a range of issues, from air quality management and pollution control to brownfield management and lead abatement.

That recommendation would “devastate economic development, critical infrastructure, and environmental protections across the nation,” representatives from the Environmental Council of the States wrote in an open letter to Zeldin in May.

In the Wednesday press conference, Kathryn Guerra of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, said her state of Texas already suffers from widespread regulatory noncompliance. According to its own enforcement reports, she said, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) never investigates many of the environmental complaints it receives, while its backlog of unresolved enforcement cases has grown to over 1,400.

“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” she said.

Meanwhile, both houses of Congress are recommending much less severe EPA cuts. The House Appropriations Committee has recommended cutting the agency’s budget by 23 percent in 2026, while its counterpart in the Senate has voted for just a 5 percent reduction. But the advocates convened by EIP argued that current levels of funding are already critically low.

“This report is a warning,” said Jennifer Walling, chief executive officer for the Illinois Environmental Council. “If both lines of defense, our state agencies and the U.S. EPA are weakened at the same time, pollution enforcement will falter, emergencies will happen, and public health will suffer. We cannot pretend that states are prepared to shoulder this burden alone.”",https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/15054327/2.-CorpusChristie-1024x655-1.jpg.avif,N,,2025-12-15 09:59:49.243711

After several high-water years culminating in 2019, the Mississippi River broke free of the constraints channeling it at Neptune Pass.
The water flowing through Neptune Pass is now delivering enough sediment to create sandbars in Breton Sound – helping to restore the shoreline.
What began as a small outlet at Neptune Pass has now grown to become an 850-foot-wide channel.
Over the years, conditions along Sage Creek have deteriorated due to fire, flooding, prolonged drought and other land use issues.","By working with nature, communities across the country are improving water quality and rebuilding critical habitat

Across the country, communities are discovering that some of the most effective solutions to today’s environmental challenges come from working with nature rather than against it. From the shifting deltas of coastal Louisiana to the high-desert streams of Wyoming, restoration efforts show that when we support natural processes—rather than replace or restrain them—we can rebuild vital landscapes, strengthen community resilience and create long-term environmental and economic benefits. Two recent examples from Neptune Pass, in Louisiana, and Sage Creek, in Wyoming, illustrate how following nature’s lead can spark transformative, lasting change.

As the Mississippi River flows through Louisiana and towards the Gulf of Mexico, the mud, clay, sand and silt the water carries with it is deposited into coastal wetlands. This process helps balance coastal erosion by creating new land along the shore. But increasingly frequent, climate change-driven mega-storms, along with human-made infrastructure that disrupts the river’s natural flow, have diminished its ability to build new land. As a result, a football field’s worth of the Louisiana coast now disappears into the sea every 100 minutes.

Over the last century Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of land. That is roughly the same size as the state of Delaware. The remaining land weakened by erosion is more vulnerable to damage from hurricanes and storm surges.

But at Neptune Pass, a small outlet forged by the Mississippi River 70 miles south of New Orleans, nature is showing us a path to bring back eroded coastal areas and create more resilient landscapes.

After several high-water years culminating in 2019, the Mississippi River broke free of the constraints channeling it at Neptune Pass. The water flowing through Neptune Pass is now delivering enough sediment to create sandbars in Breton Sound – helping to restore the shoreline.

Replenished coastal wetlands slow storm surge and absorb floodwaters, protecting both people and property from catastrophic damage. As sediment is deposited, vegetation takes root, which also creates habitat for fish, migrating birds and other wildlife.

What began as a small outlet at Neptune Pass has now grown to become an 850-foot-wide channel. If it were categorized as a stand-alone river, it would be the 10th largest river by volume of flowing water in North America.

In past years the Army Corps of Engineers may have responded to nature breaking free in this way by closing the pass entirely as the simplest way to protect the larger river from disruption. Instead, working in consultation with environmental groups, the Corps has recommended stabilizing the pass to keep it from expanding further, while still allowing water and sediment to flow through.

By choosing to follow nature’s lead, rather than trying to force it to fit a predetermined, human-engineered project, we have built a more sustainable, long-term strategy to protect Louisiana’s Gulf Coast.

More than 1,500 miles away in an entirely different landscape, nature is creating lasting change in the Colorado River Basin. In this case, conservationists are using human-made infrastructure to kickstart a solution that will allow nature to take over and protect local communities and wildlife habitats.

Part of the Green River system, Sage Creek in Southwest Wyoming is a critical water source for local communities and native fish. The river’s importance stretches far beyond the local region. It feeds into the Green River and ultimately into Flaming Gorge reservoir, which supplies water to Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Colorado.

Over the years, conditions along Sage Creek have deteriorated due to fire, flooding, prolonged drought and other land use issues. In an effort to improve the health of the river, Trout Unlimited is working with local landowners to find ways to restore the natural environment around Sage Creek.

Their work has included building dozens of beaver starter homes, also called Beaver Dam Analogs. Designed to mimic the dams that beavers naturally build in their habitat, these structures are porous walls of sticks, logs and leaves that slow water in one part of the stream, encouraging vegetation growth and creating wetlands. This slower-flowing water naturally filters sediment and pollutants as it runs downstream, leading to cleaner water supplies and healthier landscapes.

The wetter areas established by the dams also help protect against damage from catastrophic wildfires by generating natural firebreaks and absorbing floodwaters before they reach local communities.

Beaver dam analogs are, by nature, temporary. They’re meant to serve a purpose for a time and provide an opportunity for nature to take over and continue the natural process that has been started. If there are beaver colonies close by, the hope is that they treat the analog structures as starter homes by moving in, improving the original dams and building more structures in the area. The more dams that are built, the more their habitat improves by enabling conditions for the willow and cottonwood trees beavers depend on to survive.

By focusing on nature-based strategies, we can create safer, healthier and more resilient landscapes that will benefit us today and for generations to come.

The work on Sage Creek has delivered results. Beaver colonies have moved in and, as a result, the stream bed has risen several feet in some areas. This has improved wildlife habitat and helps ensure reliable, clean and safe water supplies for communities. It also benefits farmers and ranchers by increasing vegetation for grazing and improving the reliability of irrigation supplies.

The work being done at both Neptune Pass in Louisiana and Sage Creek shows the impact we can have when we find ways to partner with nature rather than relying solely on human-designed projects to control it. By focusing on nature-based strategies, we can create safer, healthier and more resilient landscapes that will benefit us today and for generations to come.",https://dredgewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10-7.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 10:00:28.010668

He urged attendees to continue collaborating and navigating challenges to find solutions to carbon capture and storage issues and bring their expertise before policymakers.

“Push boundaries together there in the Permian Basin,” he said.

Chuck McConnell, executive director at the University of Houston Center for Carbon Management in Energy, sees this as a pivotal moment for carbon capture and its use in enhancing oil recovery.

“The interest in EOR has never been stronger than it is today. This conference bears that out — it’s an exciting time. There will be business opportunities in West Texas and other parts of the world,” he said.

Utilizing captured CO2 to improve oil production has a business purpose as well as an environmental purpose. “Without both, you don’t have a winning proposition,” he said.

That carbon dioxide should be utilized, not buried or stored, and using it to increase oil production is the most obvious, productive solution, McConnell said.

For those concerned about the environmental footprint, he pointed out that “oil produced from CCUS-EOR is the lowest carbon intensity oil produced in the world. It will be better oil than anywhere else from an environmental standpoint. EOR will advance American security and affordability.”

For the Permian Basin, he said CCUS-EOR will help the long-term viability of the region, allowing recovery of oil that would otherwise be stranded. It will also help producers as they explore new benches, deeper benches and areas along the edges of the core.

“People are recognizing fossil fuels — oil and natural gas — are part of the future. We’re not denying it, we’re embracing it,” McConnell said. “We are not in an energy transition, we are in an energy transformation.”",,N,,2025-12-15 08:59:32.324339

By using renewable energy sources or natural gas, SECCO provides its clients with tailor-made solutions that reduce the cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh), prevent interruptions in production processes, and support a more sustainable energy management approach.

With more than nine decades of experience in the market, SECCO is a benchmark company in power supply and generation solutions. From its 45,000-square-meter industrial facility in Rosario, dedicated to manufacturing operations, the company designs and produces medium- and high-power units for both public and private sector clients. SECCO has installed more than 1,500 MW across over 160 power generation plants, operating either in isolated systems or connected to Argentina’s national interconnected grid (Sistema Argentino de Interconexión – SADI).

Its expertise spans multiple technologies and fuels, including renewable energy (solar PV and hybrid systems), developments aimed at optimising the use of natural resources, natural gas, and hydrocarbons.

On-site power generation: customised projects

On-site power generation refers to the production of electricity by an end user for its own consumption, using equipment installed at the same location where the energy is used. This practice reduces dependence on the public power grid, lowers energy costs, and increases supply efficiency, making it especially attractive for industrial and commercial sectors.

SECCO’s on-site power generation proposal is based on modular generation units fueled by natural gas or non-conventional gases, offering high efficiency and reliability. Each project is designed according to the specific needs of the client and includes equipment supply, assembly, installation, operational maintenance, and the option for direct operation by SECCO or training of the client’s internal staff.

Four key benefits of on-site power generation:

Lower electricity bills: A significant reduction in the cost per kWh compared to grid tariffs, with a direct impact on profitability. This optimisation of energy spending has a positive effect on overall operating costs.

Operational reliability: On-site generation systems provide stability and security to production processes by avoiding the risks associated with outages or voltage fluctuations in the public grid. This ensures continuity of critical operations and minimises losses caused by unplanned shutdowns.

Flexibility and scalability: Projects are sized according to each client’s demand, with the possibility of modular expansion. This feature allows companies to support industrial growth without the need to redesign their entire energy infrastructure from scratch.

Energy independence: Reduced reliance on the conventional power grid improves operational resilience and provides greater control over energy management. This is particularly relevant in areas with supply constraints or limitations on contracted capacity.

All power plants are monitored 24/7 via satellite from SECCO’s Generation Operations Center (COG). Clients have real-time access to telemetry data and receive email alerts in the event of any incident. In addition, the company maintains its own inventory of spare parts and original components to ensure immediate response.

In recent years, SECCO has implemented this system across the country for a wide range of sectors, including agriculture, agribusiness, food processing, industrial manufacturing, and services, among others.

For each client, a tailor-made solution has been developed: options range from grid-parallel power plants of up to 10 MW operating on natural gas—using generation units provided by SECCO—to fully islanded systems operating independently from the national power grid. Solutions for biogas power plants operating in parallel with the grid have also been designed.

Energy for a more sustainable future

With innovative solutions, proven experience, and projects operating nationwide, SECCO reaffirms its commitment to on-site power generation as a model that enhances competitiveness, profitability, and sustainability for its clients.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Secco-img2.png,N,,2025-12-15 12:03:46.534267

Nationally, residential electricity prices rose 10.5% between January and August of this year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). That’s more than three times the annual rate of overall inflation.

But the national average hides a lot of regional variation. While three states actually saw electricity prices drop in that nine-month period, nine states saw an increase of more than 20% — topped by Missouri at 37.4% and North Dakota at 30.3%. Another 19 states saw increases between 10% and 20%.

The chance that prices are going to level out soon is slim, even as energy affordability becomes a hot-button political issue.

U.S. electricity providers are for-profit companies that are tightly regulated by state public utility commissions. In the first nine months of this year, utilities proposed and received authorization for $34 billion in rate increases — more than double the $16 billion during the same period last year, according to Powerlines, a nonprofit that focuses on regulatory and other issues affecting the U.S. power grid.

What’s causing the rise in electricity prices?

In an interview with NerdWallet, Charles Hua, founder and executive director of Powerlines, listed some of the primary causes of electricity inflation.

1. An aging power grid

“Our poles and wires are aging. It costs a lot of money to just replace that infrastructure,” Hua says. “And some of that is just because the poles and wires in your backyard are just reaching the end of their useful life.”

At the same time, energy demand is rising thanks to the AI boom and other factors. Hua notes that there are proven ways to make our current energy grid more efficient without going on a building spree — but that’s not how utilities are incentivized.

“The thing to know about utilities is that they earn a profit only on capital expenditures and not on operational expenditures,” Hua says. “So they have a structural incentive to build a bunch of new power plants and to build a bunch of new infrastructure.”

2. More extreme weather events

“The second big factor is extreme weather events — storms, wildfires, winter cold stretches, hurricanes — that have battered our energy and grid infrastructure in many ways,” Hua says.

And it’s not just a like-for-like replacement of damaged infrastructure, he adds, but upgrading it to make it more resilient as such events grow more common. Extreme weather events have also driven up insurance and other costs for utility companies.

3. Rising fuel costs

Natural gas is the biggest single source of electricity in the U.S., accounting for about 43% of power generated in 2023. Gas prices skyrocketed after Russia invaded Ukraine, and while they fell back after that spike, they have been rising again in recent months. Hua notes that in many states, utilities can pass those increases directly onto consumers.

What does it mean for consumers?

Electricity costs are a relatively small portion of average household income — around 2% — although that percentage has been growing since 2019.

What that means in dollar terms: From 2021 to 2025, the average monthly residential electric bill rose from $121 to an estimated $156, according to the NEADA. That’s enough to throw households that are already struggling financially into further turmoil.

The Washington Post did an analysis of 2025 power disconnections in 11 states, and found a year-over-year increase in eight of them. In Pennsylvania alone, power shutoffs have risen 21% this year, with 270,000 homes losing power.

Even for consumers who can absorb the increases, sticker shock on monthly power bills is turning energy affordability into a political issue — much the way egg prices were in the 2024 presidential election.

For example, both candidates in November’s gubernatorial election in New Jersey made energy affordability a central issue in their campaigns, with Democrat Mikie Sherrill declaring “a state of emergency on energy costs” in her winning campaign.

Hua thinks that issue will grow in visibility as winter sets in, especially as an increasing percentage of Americans heat their homes with electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“I do think that in the next three months this will be just a big issue, because it’s not only substantively a big issue, but now politically it’s an issue, and so the marriage of the two will create a really unpredictable storm around utility bill costs and affordability,” Hua says.

Getting more out of the grid we have

Hua declares himself “optimistic” that increased attention on energy affordability will help push regulators to get more out of the infrastructure that’s already in place.

The grid we have is only about 40% to 50% efficient, Hua says. There are available “grid-enhancing” technologies, including increased battery storage — that Hua describes collectively as “ibuprofen for the grid” — that would boost that to 60% to 70% at a much lower cost than building equivalent new capacity.

Such measures would “make the grid more efficient and can lower prices and provide some immediate relief to the system,” Hua says. “It’s not going to solve every single challenge on the grid, but it’s going to provide some relief.”

What can you do about electricity costs?

We appreciate the leadership of Microsoft in the engineered carbon removal market and their collaboration to finalize this agreement.
According to carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) platform CDR.fyi, the deal further extends Microsoft’s lead as the largest global CDR purchaser by far, at 34.5 million tons, well ahead of the Frontier buyers group in second place at 1.8 million tons.
Phillip Goodman, Director of Carbon Removal Portfolio at Microsoft, said: “The BLRE project provides a unique opportunity for large-scale carbon removal, while driving broader decarbonization initiatives through green methanol production.","Renewable fuels producer C2X announced that it has signed a long-term agreement with Microsoft, with the tech giant committing to purchase 3.6 million tons of carbon removal units (CRUs) from a new low-carbon fuel project in Louisiana.

Founded in 2022, C2X develops and operates low carbon molecule production facilities in strategic locations to supply low carbon fuels and feedstocks to the shipping, chemical, aviation and industrial sectors. The company is majority controlled by the A.P. Moller Group with Japan’s largest integrated energy company ENEOS as a minority shareholder.

The CRUs for the new contract will be generated by C2X subsidiary Beaver Lake Renewable Energy’s planned $2.5 billion bio-methanol plant near Pineville, Louisiana. Located on the site of a former paper mill, the new project is designed to convert locally and sustainably sourced forestry residues into bio-methanol and biogenic CO2 that will be subsequently captured.

At full scale, the new bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) project will have the capacity to produce more than 500,000 metric tons of bio-methanol per year, and will capture and store approximately 1 million metric tonnes of CO2 annually.

Under the new agreement, Beaver Lake will deliver CRUs to Microsoft representing CO2 that has been removed and permanently stored in secure geologic formations in Louisiana, with all associated lifecycle emissions – including biomass sourcing, facility operations, and downstream transportation – accounted for and subtracted to ensure net carbon removal, and with the project’s CRUs to be registered and issued on an ICROA-endorsed registry, which includes verification by an independent third-party. C2X added that the project will follow sustainable biomass sourcing projects, including aligning with the principles outlined in EU RED III.

Construction on the project is anticipated to begin in the second half of 2026, with operations expected to start during 2029.

Brian Davis, CEO of C2X, said:

“The Beaver Lake project combines the benefits of bio-methanol production for customers in hard-to-abate sectors with permanent carbon removals. We appreciate the leadership of Microsoft in the engineered carbon removal market and their collaboration to finalize this agreement. We look forward to working with other companies seeking to access biogenic carbon for sequestration as we deliver this project and scale up our portfolio globally.”

The agreement marks the latest in a series of large-scale carbon removal purchases by Microsoft, forming part of the tech giant’s initiative to become carbon negative by 2030, including several BECCS-focused deals by the company this year. According to carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) platform CDR.fyi, the deal further extends Microsoft’s lead as the largest global CDR purchaser by far, at 34.5 million tons, well ahead of the Frontier buyers group in second place at 1.8 million tons.

Phillip Goodman, Director of Carbon Removal Portfolio at Microsoft, said:

“The BLRE project provides a unique opportunity for large-scale carbon removal, while driving broader decarbonization initiatives through green methanol production. We value the technical and commercial expertise of the C2X team, which has demonstrated commitment to sustainable biomass sourcing, rigorous carbon accounting, and thoughtful engagement of the project’s surrounding community.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Microsoft1.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 10:00:32.529470

The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.
Two nuclear reactors built in a similar way in Georgia went $17 billion over budget before they were fully operational in 2023.","COLUMBIA, S.C. — South Carolina’s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.

The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.

The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.

Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper’s costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.

Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.

The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) up the Broad River from Columbia.

Four executives ended up in prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.

If the $2.7 billion payment goes through, most of Santee Cooper’s debt from the nuclear debacle would be erased, utility CEO Jimmy Staton said at a recent board meeting where the proposal was unanimously approved.

“Our customers have been paying for these assets since 2017. It’s time they get some value out of that,” Staton said.

Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

President Donald Trump’s administration wants the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years.

But watchdog groups said there are too many hurdles to put this project in the win column right now.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

Also, the type of reactors proposed have seen massive cost overruns even when successfully built. Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building them.

Supervisor Ed Smyth and the Town Board is making a commitment EV use in the Town.","Huntington Town Supervisor Ed Smyth, the Huntington Town Board and the Town’s partners in EV technology are officially rolling out a new EV initiative for the Town of Huntington. The initiative includes new EV vehicles to the Town’s fleet and multiple charging stations throughout the town for community use.

“Giving environmentally sound options to drivers throughout Huntington is critically important for the entire Town and the communities we serve”, said Supervisor Ed Smyth. “We are already experiencing significant benefits to the town by introducing EV’s to our fleet and providing strategically located charging stations for Town vehicles and the community at large. Overall, this project will be a win for the Town, win for the community and a win for the environment”.

Over the past several months, the Town has been rolling out EV Stations, and the new electric vehicles that have been added to the Town fleet. Town departments utilizing new EV vehicles include those that require frequent travel throughout the day, including: Public Safety, General Services, Information Technology, and Parks and Recreation. To date, the new fleet vehicles include three Ford F150 Lighting Trucks and four Chevrolet Equinox. Fleet charging stations have also been installed at Town Hall, and the Town’s General Services Facility located at Boxer Court in Huntington to facilitate the new EV fleet. The Raymond T. Cavanagh Maintenance Facility on Pulaski Road will also have charging stations for both Town fleet and the general public.

This new environmentally dynamic and progressive project, while promoting clean, green energy, will also ease the range anxiety of EV vehicle drivers, provide charging convenience for apartment dwellers, shoppers and Parks and open space users.

The Town of Huntington was able to fast-track this EV initiative through a series of grants and rebates from multiple sources. This EV funding enabled the town to add to its existing fleet with EV trucks and SUV’s, charging stations for both municipal fleet and the general public.

Participating grant, funding, and rebate awards were as follows:

NYSERDA $250,000 – Clean Energy Community Grant

EECBG $233,500 – Energy Efficiency & Conservation Block Grant

PSEG Long Island $137,750 – Make Ready Rebates

SAM $27,500 – State and Municipal (SAM) Facilities Grants

EOSPA $62,000 – Environmental Open Space and Parks (EOSPA) Fund

A total of $668,500 in grants, funding and rebates were used to offset this project. An additional $63,000 from EOSPA made the total funding $730,500.

One significant partner in the Town’s EV program has been PSEG Long Island. By utilizing their EV Make Ready program, the Town can benefit from electric infrastructure incentives that can cover up to $65,000 per port for DC Fast Chargers and up to $6,500 per port for Level 2 Chargers. PSEG Long Island’s initiative aims to make EV charging more accessible and encourage the transition to cleaner transportation.

“Kudos to the Town of Huntington for installing public EV charging stations around the town and also replacing some of its gas-powered fleet vehicles with money and energy-saving electric vehicles,” said Paul DiBenedetto, PSEG Long Island’s Electric Vehicle Program manager. “The chargers will help to reduce range anxiety and encourage drivers to choose EVs.

An incentive for home solar The federal tax credit covers 30% of overall project costs for home solar, along with wind, geothermal, fuel cells and battery storage.
Some version of a residential solar tax credit has been around for decades with short-term extensions becoming the norm since President George W. Bush.
Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The One Big Beautiful Bill allows companies that own the solar panels to take advantage of the commercial solar tax credit, which doesn’t expire until Dec. 31, 2027.","On their small farm in Wahoo, Nebraska, Rhonda McClure and her husband toss a few pumpkins over the fence to a flock of ewes. They sell market lambs and wool, some of which Rhonda uses as a fiber artist, along with garden produce and compost.

She said they’ve always tried to use sustainable practices on their farm, including rotational grazing, geothermal energy and most recently — solar.

“The solar just fits in with trying to be as independent and careful of the environment as we can,” McClure said.

For the McClures, harnessing energy from the sun allows them to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and keep their energy costs down over the long run.

A solar array they added in 2021 to help power their well and home reduced their summer energy bills from several hundred dollars per month to as low as $4, McClure said.

They added a solar battery this spring to release energy at night and act as a back-up during regional power outages.

“It’s provided a good deal of security for us to know that if we’re off grid for a while, if something happens, we can get by,” McClure said. “We have water and heat and the essential services here, for us and our livestock.”

Now they’re wrapping up another solar project, largely to provide air conditioning for a new outbuilding used to store and process wool, teach classes and host large groups of people.

McClure said they likely would have waited to install it next spring. But they bumped up the timeline when they found out the Residential Clean Energy Credit was rapidly expiring. Congress voted this summer to eliminate it at the end of 2025 through the One Big Beautiful Bill.

An incentive for home solar

The federal tax credit covers 30% of overall project costs for home solar, along with wind, geothermal, fuel cells and battery storage.

Some version of a residential solar tax credit has been around for decades with short-term extensions becoming the norm since President George W. Bush. But the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden kicked the deadline to 2032 for the full credit, followed by a rate phase down.

The Biden administration said the tax credit and two dozen others in the Inflation Reduction Act would “save families money on their energy bills and accelerate the deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, clean buildings, and clean manufacturing.”

Over 752,000 households claimed the Residential Clean Energy Credit on their 2023 taxes. Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit made solar more affordable for homeowners by lowering the upfront costs and shortening the amount of time before they recoup their initial investment, said Paul Cutting.

Cutting helps homeowners identify opportunities to improve their energy efficiency and pay for them as an energy auditor with Clean Energy Districts of Iowa. The affiliation includes 15 county-level organizations across eastern Iowa and one in Wisconsin.

The cost of installing solar depends largely on the size of the home, along with its location and overall electricity usage, Cutting said. The national average is $23,500, according to the nonprofit Center for Sustainable Energy, but some industry experts say some residential solar projects can exceed $40,000.

“The solar tax credit being funded at the full 30% makes it pretty enticing for a homeowner to move forward with that,” Cutting said.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill cut the tax credit deadline off at the end of the year instead of its original phase out starting in 2032. Homeowners working with contractors must have their systems installed and invoices paid by Dec. 31 to qualify.

A rush on solar

Cutting said solar installation companies in his region quickly booked up after President Donald Trump signed the bill into law in July.

That was the experience of StraightUp Solar, a company that designs and installs solar systems for homes, businesses, nonprofits and government agencies in Missouri and Illinois.

“We sold out in September, and many other solar companies were selling out in July, which means their entire build schedule was full for 2025 because people wanted to get in before the tax credit expired at the end of the year,” said Eric Schneider, director of business development for StraightUp Solar.

The company’s third quarter of 2025 was the second busiest for inquiries, said Schneider. The biggest spike was in 2022 when homeowners expected an earlier tax credit to sunset before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.

“We call it the ‘solar coaster’ in the industry because demand fluctuates up and down,” Schneider said. “Some of it's policy driven; some of it's interest rate driven.”

Despite the loss of the Residential Clean Energy Credit, Schneider remains optimistic about the coming year and the future of the industry at large.

The price of solar power has fallen dramatically in the last 15 years as panels have become more efficient, increasing its appeal to homeowners concerned about rising energy bills, Schneider said.

Cutting agreed.

“I imagine there's going to be a slowdown [in 2026], but I think solar at this point probably has a lot to stand on its own.” Cutting said.

Higher electricity rates

Inflation, higher demand, natural disasters and upgrades to aging infrastructure have driven up electricity rates across the U.S. in the last five years.

And they’re expected to continue their upward trajectory, in large part due to the acceleration of artificial intelligence. Projected growth in data centers and cryptocurrency mining could increase average electricity generation costs in the U.S. 8% by 2030, with some regions seeing increases as high as 25%, according to the Open Energy Outlook Initiative.

More utilities are also shifting to “time-of-use” or “time-of-day” pricing, which sets higher electricity rates during peak hours, typically late afternoon and evening on weekdays.

A homeowner with solar panels and a battery back-up can draw from their stored energy – rather than the grid – during peak hours to save money, Schneider said.

These customers are also insulated from future energy rate hikes, said Corey Ziemann, solar program coordinator for the Midwest Renewable Energy Association.

“If you're buying solar, you're essentially buying all the energy you're going to use from that system all at once. You're locking in that rate so you won't be subject to the increases that are coming,” Ziemann said.

The loss of the federal tax credit will likely stretch out the payback period for homeowners, Ziemann said. But another way to help make home solar more affordable is through “group buy” programs, which bring individuals from a community together to purchase in bulk.

The Midwest Renewable Energy Association’s Grow Solar team has facilitated more than 70 group buy programs in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Missouri. An advisory committee made up of local stakeholders and officials review bids and vote on an installer to use.

Ziemann added that it’s cheaper for an installer to have crews working in a concentrated area.

“Typically, our group buys will be about 15%-18% below market rate, and then there can be additional discounts after that,” he said.

The association helped coordinate a group buy in eastern Iowa this fall, Ziemann said, which allowed over 30 homes and businesses in Jasper and Poweshiek counties to install solar.

Schneider with StraightUp Solar also sees potential with “Power Purchase Agreements” and lease programs, which he said his company and others have started to offer. Similar to leasing a car, Schneider said the homeowner uses the solar panels without owning them.

“You're getting all the benefits from the utility. You're getting the net metering; you're getting the low utility bill because you're getting solar energy directly to your house,” Schneider said.

The One Big Beautiful Bill allows companies that own the solar panels to take advantage of the commercial solar tax credit, which doesn’t expire until Dec. 31, 2027.

One of the downsides to leasing and power purchase agreements for homeowners are lower long-term savings compared to someone who owns their solar system and uses it for 20-30 years, Schneider said.

State carrots

Schneider and Ziemann said more state-level incentives could help accelerate the growth of residential solar.

They pointed to the Illinois Shines program as an example. Before adding solar, homeowners work with state-approved installation companies and other third parties to estimate how much electricity their panels will produce over 15 years. Each megawatt-hour of solar electricity is worth one “renewable energy credit.”

Electric utilities in Illinois buy renewable energy credits from the installation companies to comply with the state’s target of hitting 100% clean energy by 2050. In exchange, homeowners benefit from “reduced purchase prices, installation costs, lease payments, or other methods agreed upon in a contract,” according to a document from the Illinois Shines program.

Certasun, one of the approved vendors, said the Illinois Shines program can cut costs for homeowners up to 40%.

“We're looking at operating more programs in Illinois right now because they have great solar incentives,” Ziemann said.

He’s hopeful more state legislatures will consider adopting the model used in Illinois.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2d83aca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1700x893+0+191/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2Fa4%2F544c81534739b8e8e2ab6e031605%2F20251123-mcclures-solar.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 07:59:41.513374

Hulac,,,,,https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2025/12/the-republican-congress-pushes-back-slowly-on-trump/,"President Donald Trump has said he will sign the bill, an annual piece of legislation that sets Pentagon policy.
But the most consistent Republican pushback against Trump, including in ways that will likely stick, has come from within the halls of Congress.
Those changes are contained in the broader military bill expected to clear the Senate this week, following a House vote of 312-112.
“This Congress must stand up against another war in Venezuela,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California.
“The American people do not want another regime-change war.” Decrying “endless wars,” Khanna demanded Hegseth appear before Congress to testify.","Conaway, a Democrat who represents New Jersey’s Third Congressional District, and Rep. Donald Norcross (D-1st) folded language into a broader bill to force the Pentagon to turn over information about how the Trump administration could use military bases, such as Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, to hold and then deport immigrants.

“There was a bipartisan agreement that this is not an appropriate use for these military bases. They’re designed to project force overseas, to defend the homeland and to make sure that we are ready,” Conaway said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “To the extent that those operations are interfered with, we think it’s a mistake.”

The Senate is expected to pass the broader bill, with the immigration language included, this week. President Donald Trump has said he will sign the bill, an annual piece of legislation that sets Pentagon policy.

The tacked-on language fits a pattern playing out in Washington, where Republicans control both halves of Congress and the White House, of tepid but notable pushback from Capitol Hill against the president, in particular on topics of foreign affairs and military policy.

This trend arrived as Trump’s overall job approval has slipped, hitting 36% approval, according to a poll by AP-NORC published last week. On foreign policy specifically, Trump’s approval rating is 37%, the survey, conducted in early December of 1,146 adults nationwide, said.

The House voted Thursday to nullify a Trump executive order to end union rights at federal agencies, drawing support from 20 Republicans — including Reps. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), Chris Smith (R-4th) and Tom Kean Jr. (R-7th). Though the Republican-majority Senate won’t pick up that bill, a Trump-backed effort by Republicans in Indiana to redraw congressional maps to their political advantage also crumbled Thursday. “I wasn’t working on it very hard,” Trump told reporters of the Indiana setback.

But the most consistent Republican pushback against Trump, including in ways that will likely stick, has come from within the halls of Congress.

As the Trump administration ratchets up military tensions with Venezuela — the president confirmed in October that he had authorized covert CIA action in the South American country — Congress is about to scrap two legal authorizations the president could use to commence military operations.

Those changes are contained in the broader military bill expected to clear the Senate this week, following a House vote of 312-112. One of those authorizations is from 1991. The other is from 2002.

Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, highlighted that change during floor debate on the legislation, saying “very importantly, we are scrapping the old 1991 and 2002 Iraq war authorizations.”

The bill contains several other items meant to extract information from the Pentagon.

It withholds 25% of the travel budget for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth until he shares his orders approving dozens of missile strikes on boats in the Caribbean, acts critics of the Trump administration have denounced as extrajudicial killings.

It also would force the Pentagon to release video of one of those strikes, a Sept. 2 attack that killed 11 people and has drawn particular scrutiny from Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill.

The armed services committees of the House and Senate, which Republicans hold in their majority, are each investigating the Trump administration’s missile strikes on the shipping vessels.

“[The bill] reasserts some of the authority of the congressional branch, and whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, I think you ought to be happy about that,” said Washington congressman Adam Smith, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.

Looking to Europe, members of the armed services committees included sections to strengthen U.S. security aid to Ukraine and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the three Baltic nations that border Russia. They also included language to prevent the Trump administration, with its isolationist bent, from removing troops from Eastern Europe and require the Department of Defense to consult Congress before it may pull troops from Europe or South Korea.

Lawmakers within both parties, especially on the wings, applauded the end of the military authorizations, though some said Congress must move swiftly to rein in the administration’s aggression against Venezuela.

“This Congress must stand up against another war in Venezuela,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California. “The American people do not want another regime-change war.”

Decrying “endless wars,” Khanna demanded Hegseth appear before Congress to testify.

Hegseth has defended the vessel strikes as part of an effort to protect the U.S. from drug traffickers.

“Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” he added in a recent online post. In another instance, he wrote, “We have only just begun to kill narco-terrorists.”

On Dec. 3, a bipartisan group of senators filed legislation to block the U.S. military from attacking Venezuela without congressional authorization.

Congress is scheduled to recess this week before returning in January, heading home for a holiday break, leaving little time before the new year for a vote on that measure.

Previous votes this year to deny Trump war powers have failed in the Senate.

It has been difficult for committees that oversee the U.S. military to receive records they have sought.

“That has been an issue,” Conaway said in the interview. “They call themselves the most transparent administration ever. They use superlatives all the time, and very often the exact opposite is happening.”

He chuckled, dryly. “So, we’ll see. Maybe there will be some epiphany that will occur.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/12/AP25336639159297-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 07:59:23.927613

The Tar Heel State ranks fifth for total installed solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, which values the state’s solar market at $14.4 billion.
Pine Gate Renewables, a utility-scale solar and energy storage developer based in Asheville, closed its plant and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November.
Through this, North Carolina would receive $156 million towards projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.
Despite the loss of federal funding, he says, there’s still a growing demand for distributed solar energy resources.","Over the past few years, North Carolina has become one of the nation’s leading states for solar energy development and investment. Solar industry advocates are fighting to keep it that way despite cuts to renewable energy initiatives at the federal level.

At the end of 2025, the state’s solar sector finds itself facing headwinds from federal policy changes and tariffs, but seeing new growth opportunities in advances in storage technology and rising demand for distributed power sources, especially in rural areas.

The Tar Heel State ranks fifth for total installed solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, which values the state’s solar market at $14.4 billion.

Solar installations are split into three categories: residential, commercial, and utility, which refers to larger-scale projects.

Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, says much of the state’s solar capacity to date is deployed in utility-scale projects. “But over the past couple of years,” Abele added, “we’ve seen really, really strong growth in the residential solar sector.”

There were about 7,500 solar jobs in North Carolina as of the third quarter in 2025, SEIA found, putting the state at 11th in the country. These workers are employed by 253 solar companies, producing and installing enough solar technology to power about 1.1 million homes across the state.

The sector has grown since 2024, when there were about 7,356 solar jobs at 224 solar companies in the state, according to SEIA.

Over the past year, however, President Donald Trump has sought to undo initiatives related to renewable energy and the environment.

“President Trump is committed to unleashing American energy and preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam,” the White House said in July.

The “Big, Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump in July eliminated a 30% residential solar tax credit for systems installed after 2025, dramatically shortening the timeline provided by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which would have provided the 30% tax credit through 2032.

The sudden change has led to a very busy autumn for the residential side of the industry, but an uncertain future in 2026.

Abele said most solar installers across the state were fully booked up by early September because there was so much demand from new customers wanting to collect the tax credit. He said installing a residential system usually takes between eight to 12 weeks, due to procedural steps like utility interconnection and permitting.

“You’re seeing a mad dash right now to get projects moving,” Abele said, “trying to expedite the deployment of projects that are already in the pipeline and making sure those projects are completed prior to those tax credits expiring.”

At the utility-scale level, tax credits for larger projects remain available through 2027.

Chris Carmody, executive director at Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, said he tends to describe the industry as “solar plus storage,” because for larger projects, systems using solar are built with storage.

This means utilities are able to deposit the energy and dispatch it when needed — such as at night, during cloudy conditions, or when gas prices are particularly high.

“The arrival of major storage investment is something that has kept solar pretty healthy in North Carolina, despite tough trends from Washington, DC,” Carmody said.

Tax changes aren’t the only challenge facing the solar market. Tariffs on foreign goods imposed by the Trump administration have also led to higher costs for potential solar consumers.

Along with imposing tariffs on different countries that make solar panels — including China, which dominates the global market — the Trump administration also implemented a 50% tariff on imported steel.

“That affects every kind of energy, so solar, gas plants, and gas pipelines,” Carmody said. “It makes anything that requires steel as a building material much, much more expensive.”

North Carolina is already seeing the effects of these changes.

Pine Gate Renewables, a utility-scale solar and energy storage developer based in Asheville, closed its plant and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November. The company laid off more than 78% of its workforce, impacting 223 people in Buncombe County, WLOS reported.

Carmody said many other companies are cutting back their workforce in general due to uncertainty about future federal policy.

“In addition to being really sad for these employees, it’s an indicator that makes people nervous about investing in this environment,” Carmody said.

In August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency abruptly ended the Solar for All program, a Biden-era initiative awarding $7 billion in grants nationally. Through this, North Carolina would receive $156 million towards projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.

Projects using the program’s funding were set to start in fall 2025.

Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined representatives of 22 other states and the District of Columbia in an October lawsuit against the EPA. The plaintiffs claim the cancellation of the Solar for All program was illegal.

Steve Kalland, executive director of the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center, had been working on developing a contractor registration list for the program.

“We saw this as a potentially really valuable program, and we remain hopeful that things will proceed to a point where it’s allowed to move forward again,” Kalland said. “We’re doing our best to find other ways to help the citizens of North Carolina that are interested in utilizing clean energy resources.”

This includes training people who want to be involved in installation and providing support to businesses looking to use renewable technologies.

Kalland acknowledges the state’s solar industry is facing a period of change, but he remains optimistic. Despite the loss of federal funding, he says, there’s still a growing demand for distributed solar energy resources.

The center has partnered with organizations providing resources to western North Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, as well as parts of eastern North Carolina that have been affected over the years by natural disasters, leading to similar needs for energy.

“There is a lot of effort right now to try and figure out how we can keep solar as affordable as possible,” he said. “Folks still see the value in these technologies, and we’ll continue to see them move forward.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 06:57:42.223593

The price includes increasing power costs for everyone and worrying surges in emissions and pollutants, according to government, industry and academic analyses.

By 2030, industry and government projections show data centers could gobble up more than 10 percent of the nation’s power usage.

Estimates vary, but all show a dizzying rise of between 60 and 150 percent in energy consumption by 2030. On average, they project U.S. data centers will use about 430 trillion watt-hours by 2030. That is enough electricity to power nearly 16 Chicagos.

Some forecasts project it will keep growing from there.

“These things are industrial on a scale I have never seen in my life,” former Google CEO Eric Schmidt told a House committee earlier this year.

Tech companies that once pledged to use clean energy alone are fast reconsidering. They now need too much uninterrupted power, too fast. According to the International Energy Agency, the No. 1 power source to meet this need will be natural gas.

“While we remain committed to our climate moonshots, it’s become clear that achieving them is now more complex and challenging across every level,” Google states in its 2025 environmental impact report. The company says meeting its goal of eliminating all emissions by 2030 has become “very difficult.”

Data center firms have already approached the Homer City project’s natural gas provider, EQT, seeking enough fuel to power the equivalent of eight more Homer City projects around the country, EQT CEO Toby Rice said in an interview. And EQT is just one of dozens of U.S. natural gas suppliers.

“We’ll be shipping more gas than we ever thought,” said Arshad Mansoor, president and CEO of the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute. “We are even unretiring coal.”

Mansoor predicts it will all work out: He and others in the industry foresee the crushing demand leading to swift breakthroughs in clean energy innovation and deployment. That could include futuristic fusion power, they said, or more conventional technologies that capture natural gas emissions.

But some are more skeptical. The independent monitor charged with keeping tabs on the PJM power grid — which serves 65 million customers in the eastern U.S. — is warning that it can’t handle more data centers. It urged federal regulators to indefinitely block more data centers on its grid to protect existing customers.

Even in cities yearning to become the next data center hub — with unions welcoming the burst of construction jobs and elected officials offering lucrative tax packages — some apprehension remains.

“It’s going to be new to everybody,” said Steffee, of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers. “We all have to figure out how to start transitioning into this and what the ripple effects will be.”

Homer City offers a glimpse of what is coming nationwide.

In the Texas Panhandle, the company Fermi America broke ground this year on what it says will be a 5,800-acre complex of gas plants and giant nuclear reactors that would ultimately feed up to 18 million square feet of on-site data centers. It would dwarf Homer City in energy use.

Tech companies are planning data ‘campuses’ that would dwarf existing centers

In Cheyenne, Wyoming, developers are aiming to generate 10 gigawatts of electricity for on-site data centers. That’s enough energy to power every house in Wyoming 20 times over. In rural Louisiana, Meta is building a $30 billion cluster of data center buildings that will stretch nearly the length and width of Manhattan.

Such facilities will create a major climate challenge. By the mid 2030s, forecasts show the world’s data centers could drive as much carbon pollution as the New York, Chicago and Houston metro areas combined.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IP4H4CLDYFANTDLII44HKAUVZU.jpg&w=1200,N,,2025-12-15 07:59:46.979897

Glenn Youngkin vetoed more energy bills than he signed, killing legislation designed to increase rooftop solar and energy storage, strengthen utility planning requirements, and make efficiency improvements more available to low-income residents.

Now, with Abigail Spanberger set to replace Youngkin in the Governor’s Mansion and Democrats in a position of legislative strength, those bills are back.

Democrats revive clean-energy bills as Spanberger prepares to take office

Members of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR) met several times this fall to examine last year’s failed energy bills to determine which should get the commission’s endorsement this year. CEUR is comprised primarily of legislative leaders from the Senate and House committees that hear energy bills, so endorsements signal a strong likelihood of passage.

But while the bills CEUR endorsed show promise, I can’t help thinking they had better be just a starting point.

Energy affordability and making data centers pay their fair share are supposed to be the top objectives for legislators this year. That makes it interesting, and concerning, that even as CEUR went beyond the vetoed bills to endorse some small new initiatives, it didn’t propose any legislation that would either supercharge generation in Virginia or put the onus on the tech companies to solve their supply problem themselves.

We know bills like that are coming. Ann Bennett, the lead author of the Sierra Club’s comprehensive report on the state of the industry in Virginia, was, I hope, being hyperbolic when she told me she expects “a hundred” data center bills this session. Regardless, there will be a lot of them.

Many will be land use bills that don’t go to the energy committees, but others will tackle the central contradiction at the heart of Virginia’s data center buildout: our leaders want the industry to grow, but haven’t faced squarely the problem of where the energy will come from.

Getting more power on the grid (or freeing up capacity)

Some of the vetoed bills returning this year will put more energy on the grid. They won’t be enough to power the data center industry, but every bit helps. This includes one of the environmental communities’ top priorities, a bill that expands the role of rooftop solar in Virginia’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS).

A new bill permitting balcony solar also got CEUR’s endorsement. Balcony solar – two or three panels that plug into a wall outlet, reducing a resident’s need to buy power – is the buzziest new idea of the year. The systems are too small to make much of a difference in megawatt terms, but by democratizing access to solar they counter the reputation of solar as a technology for rich people and will make it possible for solar skeptics to see for themselves that solar does actually work and save money.

Another CEUR initiative is a bill similar to one Youngkin vetoed that creates a carveout in the state’s renewable portfolio standard specifically for geothermal heat pumps. Like balcony solar, geothermal heat pumps don’t put electricity onto the grid, but by freeing up power for other customers it has the same effect.

CEUR also endorsed a bill to simplify billing in the shared solar program in Appalachian Power Company’s territory, but a far more significant proposal to greatly expand shared solar in Dominion territory was deemed not ready for consideration after one of its patrons, Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said it was still in negotiation.

The SCC recently directed a change in the calculation of Dominion Energy’s minimum bill that industry advocates say should make the program workable for customers beyond the low-income residents who were the only ones formerly able to access it. As currently drafted, the bill would allow shared solar to increase up to a maximum of 6% of Dominion’s peak load. That gives this bill the potential to make a meaningful dent in Virginia’s energy shortfall – if Dominion doesn’t block it.

That assumes developers can get the community solar projects permitted at the local level.

Virginia localities are notorious for denying permits to solar projects of all sizes, a recalcitrance that has contributed to Virginia having to import fully half of the electricity consumed in the state. CEUR has now scrapped last year’s big idea of allowing solar developers to appeal local government permit denials to the SCC, after failing to persuade enough legislators to vote for it last year. All that is left of that bill is a piece that establishes a university consortium to provide research and technical assistance.

Luckily, last year’s other major solar siting bill lives on; it codifies best practices for solar projects without removing localities’ ability to deny permits even for projects that meet the high standards. New this year, however, is a requirement that localities provide a record of their decisions to the SCC, including the reason for any adverse decision.

It’s not the solution the industry and landowners need to bring predictability to the local permitting process, but it does ratchet up pressure on county boards that have a habit of denying projects without articulating a legitimate reason. And sure enough, imposing that modest amount of accountability was enough to get Joe Lerch from the Virginia Association of Counties to speak against the proposal at the CEUR meeting.

VACO seems likely to lose the fight this time around, and it should. Blocking solar development leads directly to higher electricity prices for consumers across the state. Moreover, it denies even a minimum of due process to landowners who want to install solar on their property – including farmers who need the income just to hold onto their land. For VACO to insist on counties having carte blanche to reject projects, with no responsibility to justify their decision, is arrogant and an abuse of the local prerogative.

Making the most of what’s already there

Anyone who keeps up with energy news has learned more in the past year about how the grid works than most of us ever wanted to know. There is widespread agreement that grid operator PJM has mismanaged its job, keeping new low-cost generation from interconnecting and driving up utility bills for customers across the region. Unfortunately, there is little that Virginia can do by itself to fix PJM.

But one key bit of information we can use is that utilities and the grid operator build infrastructure to meet the highest levels of demand on the hottest afternoons and coldest nights of the year, leaving much of that infrastructure sitting idle at other times. A recent study showed the grid could absorb far more data center demand than it can now if it weren’t for the 5% of the time when demand is at its highest.

The issue is framed in terms of data centers being willing to curtail operations at times of peak demand, a solution for the companies that can do it. But there is also a broader point: we don’t need as much new generation if we use what we have better.

That’s the principle behind several bills that CEUR endorsed. The most significant of these is a bill vetoed by Youngkin last year that almost doubles the targets for short-term energy storage laid out in the Virginia Clean Economy Act and adds targets for long-duration energy storage. As currently drafted, the 2026 version also adds new fire safety standards.

But CEUR did not discuss another obvious approach to increasing storage capacity on the grid: requiring data centers to have storage on-site, replacing highly-polluting diesel generators for at least the first couple of hours of a power outage and using spare battery capacity to assist the grid at other times. If Virginia is going to keep adding data centers at the current rate, this simply has to be part of the plan. We need far more storage than the CEUR bill calls for, and tech companies, not ratepayers, should bear the cost.

CEUR’s utility reform proposals would also help Virginia’s grid get the most out of what we already have. A bill to improve the integrated resource planning process (again, vetoed by Youngkin) requires utilities to consider surplus interconnection service projects to maximize existing transmission capacity.

Helping low-income residents save money

CEUR endorsed several proposals that could help residents save money on energy bills. Some, like shared solar, balcony solar, geothermal heat pumps and the distributed solar expansion bill, would benefit anyone willing to make the investment.

For low-income residents, weatherization and efficiency upgrades remain the focus. Last year the governor vetoed legislation from Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax and Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, which would have required Dominion and APCo to expand their low-income weatherization assistance to reach 30% of qualifying customers. Sickles has already reintroduced his bill as HB2. CEUR endorsed a different recommendation from staff that the two utilities be required to extend their spending on energy assistance and weatherization programs.

CEUR did not examine a related bill that has been reintroduced this year following a Youngkin veto last winter, establishing an income-qualified energy efficiency and weatherization task force to produce policy recommendations to ensure repairs and retrofits reach all eligible households.

However, CEUR endorsed a bill that will require all utilities to disclose to the SCC information about electric utility disconnections, which presumably will inform the work of the task force.

We’re going to need more

Even taken together, CEUR’s initiatives don’t fully address the biggest energy crunch Virginia has ever faced, and the rising utility bills that result. Possibly that is intentional; Democrats will continue to control the governor’s seat as well as the legislature for at least two years, giving them time to ramp up programs and see what works.

But data center development is so far outstripping supply side solutions that if legislators aren’t more aggressive this year, next year they will find themselves further behind than ever.

As more bills are filed over the coming weeks, we are likely to see plenty of bold proposals. Hopefully, legislators now understand the urgency, and will be ready to act.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/img_5535-1024x7301765794291.jpg?h=167871c3&itok=EeoYQ8ob,N,,2025-12-15 06:00:44.730291

They’re just moving further and further apart on how to actually do it.

Partisan fighting and intraparty tensions over a slate of permitting reform bills are signaling that the once bipartisan policy goal may once again stall in Congress, even as lawmakers emphasize the need for more energy infrastructure and housing to tackle the growing cost-of-living crisis.

“Polarization is part of everything, so I’m sure it has a role here at some level,” Marc Boom, a former senior adviser at the Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden administration, told NOTUS. “The best solution is going to be one that leaves everyone happy, and the path that I’m seeing doesn’t seem like that.”

A group of conservative Republican lawmakers is threatening to withhold support from a bipartisan bill that would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act, a key permitting statute. Why? It has a measure that would provide wins for renewable energy developers who want to insulate their projects from a Trump administration crackdown.

Progressive Democrats and environmentalists, meanwhile, are upset that the bill would weaken community input and environmental review on proposed projects.

The impending vote on the SPEED Act comes after lawmakers got into a fiery debate on the House floor last Thursday over a bill that would weaken the scope of reviews under the Clean Water Act. Republicans said that bill would speed up infrastructure, but most Democrats criticized it on environmental grounds.

“You will hear no argument from me about the need for permitting reform,” Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten said on the floor ahead of a vote on the bill. “We do need reform, but this bill is not what we need. It doesn’t just cut red tape, it cuts all the tape that has protected our clean water for 50 years.”

The bill passed, with a handful of moderate Democrats joining most Republicans in voting “yes.” So did a different bill that would speed up permitting for natural gas pipelines.

But both came with some mudslinging.

Republican Rep. David Taylor said his “colleagues across the aisle continue to promote the fallacy of improving permit processes comes at the expense of the environment.”

Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal called the Clean Water Act legislation “Republicans’ latest attempt to help corporate polluters dodge responsibility.”

Outside the halls of Congress, permitting reform advocates are hinging hope on the bigger picture: that both parties say they want to get something done.

“There’s a real chance that we can find a path forward on a bill that really is a win-win for everybody,” Xan Fishman, the vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s energy program, told NOTUS.

“There are a few exceptions on both sides, but it seems like they all understand the need for permitting reform, and they’re working towards permitting reform, which is always a good thing when you’ve got both parties willing to compromise a little bit,” John Szoka, the CEO of the Conservative Energy Network, told NOTUS.

Among the areas of compromise: a bill to digitize the federal permitting process passed the House unanimously this week.

But that’s only a small segment of the permitting reform debate.

This week is likely to highlight the divisions.

And despite some optimism from key lawmakers — Sen. Martin Heinrich said this week that members of Congress are “more aligned” on permitting reform than on “some of the other spaces” — the potential for a deal could fizzle out at any point.

In the upper chamber, three Democratic senators said they won’t support any permitting reform legislation that doesn’t include stronger language about protecting renewables and building transmission infrastructure.

The Office of Congressman Doug LaMalfa said the Forest Protection and Wildland Firefighter Safety Act passed the US House as part of a wider permitting reform package, the PERMIT Act, in Washington, D.C.

The office said the bill was introduced by Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale).

It said the bill is intended to keep aerial fire retardant available for wildfire response without Clean Water Act permitting delays.

Wildland Firefighter Safety and fire retardant use

The office said a 2023 federal court ruling imposed additional requirements linked to the use of aerial fire retardant by the U.S. Forest Service and other firefighting entities.

It said those restrictions risk slowing response times during wildfire incidents.

The office said the bill would clarify that a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is not required for the Forest Service to apply fire retardants from planes or helicopters to combat wildfires, if the retardants are on the current applicable Qualified Products List maintained by the Forest Service.

It said the provisions build on existing permitting exemptions for firefighting activities already in law.

Lawsuit background and permit timelines

The office said Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics sued the U.S. Forest Service in 2022 over the absence of an NPDES permit for aerially discharged fire retardant.

It said a federal court ruled in 2023 that the Forest Service must obtain an NPDES permit from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for aerial application of fire retardants.

It said the court did not grant the request for an injunction to block the Forest Service’s use of these products.

The office said Forest Service testimony to the House Natural Resources Committee in 2023 stated the agency believes an NPDES permit is not needed based on EPA guidance issued in 2003.

It said the Forest Service’s 2011 Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land Record of Decision prohibits discharge into bodies of water and buffer areas around those waters.

It said the Forest Service stated that, over the past 10 years, less than 1% of retardant drops impacted American waterways.

It said the Forest Service stated the EPA could take up to three years to issue an NPDES permit, followed by state permitting across 47 states.

Comments from LaMalfa and the Forest Service

Rep. Doug LaMalfa said: “With wildfire season now practically year-round and more destructive than ever, preventing or limiting the use of any fire retardant because someone insists on a permit first is completely backwards.

“Aerial fire retardant has been used safely for decades and is already highly regulated.

“These lawsuits don’t protect the environment; they tie firefighters’ hands while fires race through forests and towards homes. I’m glad to see the PERMIT Act passed the House with my bill included. It ensures our crews can act quickly, without being tripped up by fringe litigation or years of paperwork.”

Tom Schultz, U.S. Forest Service Chief, said: “Aerially delivered long-term fire retardant is an essential tool the Forest Service and the interagency wildfire response community use in support of ground-based firefighting resources.

“We thank Chairman LaMalfa for leading legislation to ensure retardant remains a tool in the wildland firefighting toolbox to protect homes and communities from the devastating impacts of catastrophic wildland fire.”

What this could change for incident planning

Fire Chiefs and senior officers with responsibility for wildfire operations may track this measure because it focuses on continued access to aerial fire retardant as part of interagency response planning.

Government departments and emergency and disaster response managers may review how the bill’s approach aligns with existing Clean Water Act exemptions for firefighting runoff described in the source material.

Training officers and instructors involved in wildland tactics may also monitor the outcome because the Forest Service position in the material describes long-term retardant as supporting ground-based resources by altering how wildfire burns and slowing fire spread after water evaporates.

Fire engineering consultants and risk assessors working with public agencies may pay attention to the permitting timeline claims in the material, including the stated three-year federal process and additional state permits, when considering operational continuity and contingency planning.",https://internationalfireandsafetyjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lamalfa-fire-retardant.webp,N,,2025-12-15 06:00:12.386668

And though hundreds of air quality complaints have been made, Rhode Island has continued to prioritize economic profit over the wellbeing of its people.
The combination of noxious emissions from I-95 and pollution from businesses along Allens Avenue and the Port may contribute to Rhode Island’s asthma rate for adults exceeding the national average.
Rates among Rhode Island youth have decreased in recent years but were at 6.6% compared to the national average of 6.5%.
Or will more businesses like Rhode Island Recycled Metals be allowed to emerge?","Linda Perri has seen — and smelled — a lot in the more than 40 years she has lived in Washington Park in Providence. Some days are worse than others.

“You can’t open your windows in the summer, you can’t sit outside in your yard, front or back,” Linda Perri, who is president of her neighborhood association, said in a Nov. 14 interview.

For decades, many South Providence residents have suffered from pollution caused by industrial businesses on Allens Avenue and the Port. Some recall being awoken by the pungent odor of asphalt and experiencing nausea, headaches, and fatigue. In 2022, a school was even evacuated due to smells from the Port being mistaken for a gas leak. And though hundreds of air quality complaints have been made, Rhode Island has continued to prioritize economic profit over the wellbeing of its people. The time has come for the state to put the health of its people first and hold these entities accountable.

Allens Avenue, home to asphalt plants, scrap metal dealers, oil and gas companies, and salt distributors, has been called “the most toxic and polluted stretch of roadway in Rhode Island” by the Providence Streets Coalition, a group of over 40 community organizations, local businesses, schools, associations, and individuals supporting safe and healthy streets.

The impact of this pollution on surrounding communities is severe. The combination of noxious emissions from I-95 and pollution from businesses along Allens Avenue and the Port may contribute to Rhode Island’s asthma rate for adults exceeding the national average. In 2021, 12.6% of the state’s adult population had the condition, far above the national average of 9.7%. Rates among Rhode Island youth have decreased in recent years but were at 6.6% compared to the national average of 6.5%.

“It’s a struggle. There’s so much pollution. There’s so much road debris.” Perri said. “There’s a lot of things that could be done in this neighborhood to create a healthier, more environmentally-friendly port area.”

State officials are not doing enough to prevent bad actors from hurting the environment and these communities for their own monetary benefit. Since 2009, Rhode Island Recycled Metals has conducted its operations without proper permits from the state, contaminating the Providence River and Narragansett Bay with runoff and fuel from unlicensed vessels and defying stormwater discharge permits. Even after a series of fires led to its temporary closure in 2024, attempts to bring the company into compliance continue to fail. Meanwhile, nearby communities continue to pay the price.

Over the past few years, government action has shown that the state prioritizes the interests of these industrial businesses over the wellbeing of affected communities. In 2019, Mayor Jorge Elorza applauded the industrial waterfront as a “driver of economic development.” And when asked why some businesses in the area were not being held accountable by the city for environmental violations, Elorza’s office told ecoRI News that “the City is not responsible for air emissions or coastal regulations,” passing this responsibility to the DEM and Coastal Resources Management Council.

Mayor Brett Smiley’s 2024 Comprehensive Plan has taken a step in the right direction, but further action is needed. The plan emphasizes the development of clean and sustainable industries, laying out objectives to mitigate the environmental and health impacts of pollution. It also notes that “the city may prohibit future industrial uses in the General Industrial District, M-2, that it determines go against the public interest of public health and quality of life in near-industry neighborhoods.” However, will the state actually do this when the time comes? Or will more businesses like Rhode Island Recycled Metals be allowed to emerge? Without concrete accountability measures and enforcement strategies, these goals risk becoming empty words.

It is difficult to strike a balance between economic growth and public wellbeing, but it is essential that the state do so. Without immediate government intervention, the health of thousands of Rhode Islanders will remain at risk. Left to their own devices, these industrial businesses will continue to prioritize economic growth over public health.

Many residents worry that their voices will be drowned out by lobbyists and developers, who have greater influence in determining governmental outcomes. The state should propose an environmental justice law that will give residents in these communities a prominent voice in future developments. The state must enact legislation that reflects not only the interests of industrial developers, but also the concerns of those affected most acutely. Additionally, to decrease industrial operations in specific areas, the state should rezone parts of Allens Avenue and impose stricter penalties on businesses that violate environmental regulations.

I imagine a future where children can play outdoors without worrying about inhaling harmful pollutants – a future where every Rhode Islander has access to clean, healthy air. Thousands are counting on the state to act.

So the question I ask is this: Will it continue to prioritize economic growth over people’s health, or will it finally listen to the voices of those crying out for help and deliver justice to these communities?",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80416/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/img_0637-1-1024x7681765793212.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=lGTaWd_c,N,,2025-12-15 06:00:39.300706

Tubiana, who played a key role in the negotiations around the Paris Agreement, said that pressure from the Trump administration shouldn’t prevent the European Union from pursuing its climate goals of reaching climate neutrality by 2050.

Her appeal comes as the US pushes back against some key EU climate laws - such as the EU's carbon border tax - aiming to slash greenhouse gas emissions and encourage more sustainable practices outside of the European Union.

""I haven't seen anything like this in my whole life working on climate. I've never seen such aggressiveness from the US, including the pressure on Europe,"" Tubiana told Euronews.

She also noted that 85 countries at COP30 have shown political will to phase out fossil fuels, despite the US withdrawal from the United Nations climate summit.

""We have seen a major transformation of the world economy, in particular in green technology, the rise of China's investment in renewable energy, the fact that almost all countries have a climate law now since Paris, and 88% of global emissions are covered by a commitment to be net zero by the mid-century,"" Tubiana told Euronews.

For basically the whole month of January, a series of wildfires raged across Los Angeles, killing hundreds (more on that number below). On the other side of the country, an Arctic blast brought historic snowfall and bitter cold deep into the South. Then Donald Trump took office for a second time on January 20 and immediately began to unravel the climate progress the United States had made under Joe Biden.

The rest of the year, which is on track to tie for the second hottest on record, was just as momentous, bringing all manner of climate events — some good, some bad. In a lot of ways, we’ll look back on 2025 as a critical moment, both for the environment and humanity. Here’s why.

A firestorm consumes Los Angeles

Starting on January 7, wildfires continued for weeks and burned 78 square miles across Los Angeles, driven by strong winds and fueled by extra-dry vegetation. (The conflagration had climate change’s fingerprints all over it.) The fires destroyed more than 16,000 structures and forced more than 180,000 people to evacuate. In part because the blazes were burning through extremely affluent neighborhoods, the economic damages are estimated to be between $76 billion and $131 billion. The fires were 1 of 14 billion-dollar disasters to hit the U.S. in the first half of 2025, according to the research group Climate Central. (In May, the Trump administration announced that the federal government would stop tracking billion-dollar disasters, an essential way to assess climate risks.)

Officially, the fires killed 30 people. But this year, researchers got a better idea of just how bad wildfire smoke is for public health, as it exacerbates conditions like asthma and cardiovascular disease. In August, scientists published a new estimate of the L.A. wildfire death toll that factored in fatalities caused by the resulting haze: 440, or even higher. The next month, other researchers estimated that wildfire smoke already kills 40,000 Americans each year, which could soar to 71,000 by 2050 if humanity’s carbon emissions remain high. The flames themselves, it seems, kill but a small fraction of the fire’s total victims.

Trump takes takes a hatchet to environmental regulations

Los Angeles was still burning when Donald Trump was sworn in for a second time and quickly began overhauling government agencies and axing environmental rules. The Trump administration’s deep cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, could leave communities even more vulnerable to the threat of wildfire smoke. Later in the summer, Trump signed the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill into law, which among other things tore up the only climate plan the U.S. had. That killed the tax credits that consumers were using to electrify their homes and offset the cost of EVs, and destroyed the capital that Indigenous tribes were using to develop clean energy projects. (Also see Grist’s recent coverage of the weird ways that Trump has been changing the culture and language around energy and climate change.)

Extreme flooding is here to stay

Just as climate change is making wildfires worse, it’s actually making rainfall more catastrophic, too. That dynamic played out tragically on the Fourth of July weekend, when flash flooding struck central Texas, most devastatingly in Kerr County, killing at least 135 people. Part of the problem is that generally speaking, the warmer the atmosphere gets, the more moisture it can hold and eventually dump as rain. Making matters worse, the Gulf of Mexico has been exceptionally warm of late, which sent still more moisture into the atmosphere above Texas. (The same factors were fueling gnarly storms across the central and southern U.S. in the spring.) The resulting devastation is forcing a disaster-response reckoning not just in Kerr County but in similarly vulnerable communities across the U.S. Really, the world over is struggling to cope with extreme flooding: Storms and cyclones have killed more than 1,750 people in Asia since mid-November.

Data centers emerge as a major environmental threat

In 2025, another kind of human-made environmental disaster garnered growing scrutiny: data centers. In February, we reported on Georgia joining other states in extending the life of fossil-fuel power plants (which the Trump administration has also been forcing to stay open) to meet the tech industry’s extreme demand for electricity. The AI boom is hurting consumers, too: All that extra infrastructure is driving up electricity prices for households, especially in data-center hotspot states. The industry is such an environmental mess that Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, suggested this summer that we build data centers in space instead.

Data centers are creating a water crisis, too: Nationwide in 2023, the facilities used 17 billion gallons of water directly to cool equipment, but they required more than 10 times that amount indirectly because they use so much electricity that’s generated elsewhere with steam. Accordingly, researchers at Cornell University this year found that the industry can reduce both its water and electricity footprints by building data centers where there’s abundant wind or solar energy, like West Texas.

Earth crosses an ominous planetary boundary and tipping point

This year scientists hit us with a one-two punch of bad environmental news: The crossing of the first “tipping point” and the breaching of another “planetary boundary.” A tipping point is when an Earth system suddenly and often irreversibly changes into something dramatically different, while a planetary boundary is a threshold that keeps the planet’s environments hospitable to life. Think of it like driving down a road, where the tipping point is an imminent cliff and a planetary boundary is a big sign warning of the drop.

In September, scientists announced that the seventh of nine boundaries had been crossed, this time the steady acidification of the oceans. (A quarter of humanity’s CO2 emissions have been absorbed by seawater, which creates carbonic acid.) That acidification is interfering with the ability of many organisms, like corals, mollusks, and crustaceans, to build their shells.

And speaking of corals, less than a month later, another team of researchers announced that the precipitous decline of reef ecosystems has pushed the planet to its first major tipping point. In the last 50 years, half of the world’s live coral cover has disappeared, as acidification pairs with rising ocean temperatures. All that stress causes corals to release the symbiotic algae that provide them energy, leading to coral bleaching. Even though corals are tipping, scientists are still breeding them in labs, hopefully finding varieties that can better stand the heat.

Countries cop-out at COP

You’d think that with such dire news about tipping points and planetary boundaries coming out, the world would get more ambitious about lowering its emissions. But 10 years after the Paris Agreement — which set out to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, or in an ideal world, 1.5 degrees — countries at the United Nations’ annual COP30 climate conference in November failed to come to an agreement on winding down fossil fuels. So we’re on track to get between 2.3 and 2.8 degrees of catastrophic warming by the end of this century, according to the U.N.’s own math. Every fraction of a degree means ever more severe effects of climate change — melting ice, sea level rise, extreme heat — and the further we go past 1.5 degrees, the more carbon we’ll have to remove from the atmosphere to bring temperatures back down to a safe level.

Hurricane season ends without a single US landfall

This spring, forecasters were looking at high ocean temperatures in the Atlantic — the fuel for hurricanes — and predicting an above-average season with around 10 named storms. But as the summer stretched on, the hurricanes that seemed headed for the mainland U.S. instead turned back out to sea. Hurricane season ended on November 30 without a single hurricane making landfall in the country for the first time in a decade, thanks to some atmospheric quirks above the Southeast.

The Caribbean, though, did not fare so well this year. At the end of October, Hurricane Melissa — supercharged by climate change — ravaged Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Because of extra-hot ocean waters, the storm’s maximum sustained wind speeds doubled from 70 mph to 140 mph in just 18 hours. So while it’s unusual for the U.S. to escape landfall for a whole season, tropical cyclones will only get worse from here as ocean temperatures climb: This was only the second year in recorded history to have spawned three or more Category 5 hurricanes.

Climate action has become unstoppable in many ways

Heading into 2026, it’s easy to look at all this and say, “Well, we’re borked.” Yes, the environment is buckling under the increasingly heavy burden of climate change. And yes, the Trump administration will continue its war on climate action. But unstoppable changes — the good kind — are already in motion that will help improve public health and reduce emissions, no matter what the federal government decrees.

For one, those environmental tipping points have positive counterparts that are now unfolding, thanks to local incentives and national policies elsewhere. The market share for new electric vehicles in Oslo, Norway, for instance, exploded from 13.6 percent to 95.8 percent in a decade, according to a report released in October. Solar panels have gotten so cheap that it’s now more economical to deploy renewables than to build more fossil fuel infrastructure. Accordingly, renewables are growing like crazy in the U.S. and beyond, with a new report finding that wind and solar are more than meeting the global rise in demand for electricity. Indeed, in the first half of 2025, renewables generated more electricity around the world than coal for the first time. The leaders of Africa’s growing economies, meanwhile, plotted a bold strategy this year to become a continent of climate solutions.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2149644773a.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-12-15 06:00:30.583163

With dozens of communities warming to the notion, ​“it’s an exciting time for geothermal in Colorado,” said Bryce Carter, geothermal program manager at the state energy office.
After also accounting for a bonanza of state incentives, the $14-million project will only be $2.2 million, Mendisco said.","HAYDEN, Colo. — For decades, Dallas Robinson’s family excavation company developed coal mines and power plants in the rugged, fossil-fuel-rich region of northwest Colorado. It was a good business to be in, one that helped hamlets like Hayden grow from outposts to bustling mountain towns — and kept families like Robinson’s rooted in place for generations.

“This area, with the exception of agriculture, was built on oil and gas and coal,” said Robinson, a former town councilor for Hayden.

But that era is coming to a close. Across the United States, bad economics and even worse environmental impacts are driving coal companies out of business. The 441-megawatt coal-burning power plant just outside Hayden is no exception: It’s shutting down by the end of 2028. The Twentymile mine that feeds it is expected to follow.

Coal closures can gut communities like Hayden, a town of about 2,000 people. That story has been playing out for decades, particularly in Appalachia, where coal regions with depressed economies have seen populations decline as people strike out for better opportunities elsewhere. Robinson, a friendly, gregarious guy, fears the same could happen in Hayden.

“I grew up here, so I know everyone,” he said. ​“It’s hard to see people lose their jobs and have to move away. … These are families that sweat and bled and been through the good and the bad times in small towns like this.”

Struggling American coal towns need an economic rebirth as the fossil-fuel industry fades. Hayden has a vision that, at first, doesn’t sound all that unusual. The town is developing a 58-acre business and industrial park to attract a diverse array of new employers.

The innovative part: companies that move in will get cheap energy bills at a time of surging utility costs. The town is installing tech that’s still uncommon but gaining traction — a geothermal heating-and-cooling system, which will draw energy from 1,000 feet underground.

In short, Hayden is tapping abundant renewable energy to help invigorate its economy. That’s a playbook that could serve other communities looking to rise from the coal dust.

At an all-day event hosted by geothermal drilling startup Bedrock Energy this summer, I saw the ambitious project in progress. Under a blazing sun, a Bedrock drilling rig chewed methodically into the region’s ochre dirt. Once it finished this borehole — one of about 150 — it would feed in a massive spool of black pipe to transfer heat.

Bedrock will complete the project, providing 2 megawatts of thermal energy, in phases, with roughly half the district done in 2026 and the whole job finished by 2028. Along the way, constructed buildings will be able to connect with portions of the district as they’re ready.

“We see it as a long-term bet,” Mathew Mendisco, city manager of Hayden, later told me, describing the town as full of grit and good people. Geothermal energy ​“is literally so sustainable — like, you could generate those megawatts forever. You’re never going to have to be reliant on the delivery of coal or natural gas. … You drill it on-site, the heat comes out.”

Geothermal is also the rare renewable resource that the Trump administration has embraced. In July, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, whose firm invested in geothermal developer Fervo Energy, helped convince Congress to spare key federal investment tax credits for the sector.

These incentives apply to both the deep projects for producing power as well as the more accessible, shallower installations for keeping buildings comfy. Unlike geothermal projects for power, ones for direct heating and cooling don’t depend on geography; any town can take advantage of the resource.

“We disagree on the urgency of addressing climate change, [but] this is something that Chris Wright and I agree on,” Colorado Senator John Hickenlooper (D), a trained geologist, told a packed conference-room crowd on the day of the event. ​“Geothermal energy has … unbelievable potential to, at scale, create clean energy.”

Charting a post-coal economy

The eventual closure of the Hayden Station coal plant, which has operated for more than half a century, has loomed over the town since Xcel Energy announced an early shutdown in 2021.

The power plant and the mine employ about 240 people. Property taxes from those businesses have historically provided more than half the funding for the town’s fire management and school districts — though that fraction is shrinking thanks to recent efforts to diversify Hayden’s economy, Mendisco said.

Taking into account the other businesses that serve the coal industry and its workers, according to Mendisco, the economic fallout from the closures is projected to be a whopping $319 million per year.

“Really, the highest-paying jobs, the most stable jobs, with the best benefits [and] the best retirement, are in coal and coal-fired power plants,” Robinson said.

But coal has been in decline for over 20 years, largely due to growing investment in cheap fossil gas and renewables. While the Trump administration tries to defibrillate the coal industry and force uneconomic coal plants to stay open past their planned closure dates, states including Colorado still plan to phase out fossil fuels in the coming years. Colorado’s remaining six coal plants are set to shutter by the end of the decade.

Hayden aims for its business park to help the town weather this transition. With 15 lots to be available for purchase, the development is designed to provide more than 70 jobs and help offset a portion of the tax losses from Hayden Station’s closure, according to Mendisco.

“We are not going to sit on our hands and wait for something to come save us,” Mayor Ryan Banks told me at the event.

Companies that move into the business park won’t have a gas bill. They’ll be insulated from fossil-fuel price spikes, like those that occurred in December 2022, when gas prices leapt in the West and customers’ bills skyrocketed by 75% on average from December 2021.

In the Hayden development, businesses will be charged for their energy use by the electric utility and by a geothermal municipal utility that Hayden is forming to oversee the thermal energy network. Rather than forcing customers to pay for the infrastructure upfront, the town will spread out those costs on energy bills over time — like investor-owned utilities do. Unlike a private utility, though, Hayden will take no profit. Mendisco said he expects the geothermal district to cut energy costs by roughly 40%, compared with other heating systems.

The setup will deliver such massive savings because geothermal appliances, which draw energy from the always-temperate Earth, are the most efficient space-conditioning tech you can get. They pump out the same amount of heat as a fossil-fuel-fired furnace while using just one-sixth to one-quarter of the energy.

Municipally owned geothermal districts are rare in the U.S., but the approach has legs. Pagosa Springs, Colorado, has run its geothermal network since the early 1980s, when it scrambled to combat fuel scarcity during the 1970s oil embargo. New Haven, Connecticut, recently broke ground on a geothermal project for its train station and a new public housing complex. And Ann Arbor, Michigan, has plans to build a geothermal district to help make one neighborhood carbon-neutral.

Hayden’s infrastructure investment is already attracting business owners. An industrial painting company has bought a plot, and so has a regional alcohol distributor, Mendisco said.

One couple is particularly excited to be a part of the town’s clean energy venture. Nate and Steph Yarbrough own DIY off-grid-electrical startup Explorist.Life; renewable power is in the company’s DNA. The Yarbroughs teach people how to put solar panels and batteries on camper vans, boats, and cabins to fuel their outdoor adventures, and Explorist.Life sells the necessary gear.

“When we bought that property, it was largely because of the whole geothermal concept,” Nate Yarbrough told me. ​“We thought it made a whole bunch of sense with what we do.”

Reducing reliance on hydrocarbons, he noted, is ​“a good thing for society overall.”

Geothermal tech heats up

The geothermal network that could transform Hayden’s future is mostly invisible from aboveground. Besides the drilling rig and a trench, the most prominent features I spotted were flexible tubes jutting from the earth like bunny ears.

Those ends of buried U-shaped pipes will eventually connect to a main distribution loop for businesses to hook up to. Throughout the network, pipes will ferry a nontoxic mix of water and glycol — a heat-carrying fluid that electric heat pumps can tap to keep buildings toasty in the winter and chilled in the summer.

Despite their superior efficiency, these heat pumps are far less common than the kind that pull from the ambient air, largely due to project cost. Because you have to drill to install a ground-source heat pump, the systems are typically about twice as expensive as air-source heat pumps.

But the underground infrastructure lasts 50 years or more, and the systems pay for themselves in fuel-cost savings more quickly in places that endure frostier temperatures, including Rocky Mountain municipalities like Hayden. Those long-term cost benefits were too attractive to ignore, Mendisco said.

Hayden’s project ​“is 100% replicable today,” Mendisco told attendees at the event, which included leaders of other mountain towns. Geothermal tech is ready; the money is out there, he added: ​“You can do this.”

Colorado certainly believes that — and it’s giving first-mover communities a boost.

In October, the state energy office announced $7.3 million in merit-based tax-credit awards for four geothermal projects. Vail is getting nearly $1.8 million for a network, into which the ice arena can dump heat and the library can soak it up. Colorado Springs will use its $5 million award to keep a downtown high school comfortable year-round. Steamboat Springs and a Denver neighborhood will share the rest of the funding.

At least one other northwest Colorado coal community is also getting on board with geothermal. In the prior round of state awards, the energy office granted $58,000 to the town of Craig’s Memorial Regional Health to explore a project for its medical campus.

With dozens of communities warming to the notion, ​“it’s an exciting time for geothermal in Colorado,” said Bryce Carter, geothermal program manager at the state energy office.

So far, the state has pumped $30.5 million into geothermal developments — with over $27 million going toward heating-and-cooling projects specifically — through its grant and tax-credit programs. The larger tax-credit incentive still has about $13.8 million left in its coffers.

Hayden, for its part, is also taking advantage of the federal tax credits to save up to 50% on the cost of its geothermal district. That includes a 10% bonus credit that the community qualifies for because of its coal legacy. After also accounting for a bonanza of state incentives, the $14-million project will only be $2.2 million, Mendisco said.

Hayden is likely just at the start of its geothermal journey. If all goes well with the business park, the town aims to retrofit its municipal buildings with these systems to comply with the state’s climate-pollution limits on big buildings, Mendisco said. Hayden’s community center could be the first to get a geothermal makeover starting in 2027, he added.

Robinson, despite coal’s salience in the region and his family’s legacy in its extraction, believes in Hayden’s vision: Geothermal could be a winner in a post-coal economy. In fact, he’s interested in investing in the geothermal industry and installing a system in a new house he’s building, he said.

“I’ve lived a lot of my life making a living by exploiting natural resources. I understand the value of that — as well as lessening our impact and being able to find new and better,” Robinson said. ​“This is the next step, right?”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Hayden-CO-geothermal-drilling-Bedrock-Brooke-Ashlee.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=2286049566b1d48a0829ebcddcd08847,N,,2025-12-15 06:57:51.947690

Northern Indiana Public Service Company’s 722-megawatt R.M. Schahfer plant, in the small town of Wheatfield, is supposed to close this month. So is CenterPoint Energy’s 90-megawatt F.B. Culley 2, along the Ohio River in southern Indiana.

But the utilities explained to state regulators during a December 2 biannual hearing on reliability that they are preparing for potential Trump administration orders to keep the units operating, and some fear such mandates could come any day.

Already this year, the Department of Energy has forced a coal plant in Michigan and an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania to operate past scheduled retirement dates.

The Trump administration has said coal plants need to stay open to address energy shortages. The Federal Power Act allows the government to temporarily order power plants to operate in case of such an emergency. Indiana Gov. Mike Braun (R) issued an executive order in April echoing the president’s concerns and promising to evaluate and ​“consider extending the life” of every coal plant in the state.

Community leaders say keeping Schahfer or Culley online will mean unacceptable and unnecessary health risks and costs.

Braun’s executive order notes that 9 gigawatts of coal-fired power are scheduled to retire between 2025 and 2038 in Indiana.

“Now we’re concerned about every single coal plant in the state [scheduled for] retiring,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of the Citizens Action Coalition, which represents consumers statewide. ​“Utilities are facing extreme pressure to keep coal plants open from the political powers that be.”

Coal ash intrigue

At the recent reliability hearing, NIPSCO CEO and chief operating officer Vince Parisi told regulators that he was taking steps to be ready for an emergency order to keep running Schahfer, including checking on coal supply and equipment needed to make major repairs to one of the plant’s units, which has been offline since July.

In June, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved a settlement agreement stating the Schahfer plant will close this year. Utility spokesperson Jessica Cantarelli affirmed to Canary Media that ​“absent a directive to stay open, NIPSCO is on track to retire R.M. Schahfer’s remaining two coal units by the end of 2025.”

But documents show that NIPSCO has not only prepared to run the plant longer but also sought a means to do so.

Fred Gomos, senior director of environmental policy and sustainability at NIPSCO’s parent company, NiSource, emailed the Environmental Protection Agency in early August asking for an extension on a deadline to stop dumping toxic coal ash in an unlined waste pond. Later that month, Gomos followed up with the EPA and mentioned that the company had met with Department of Energy officials about the issue.

Gomos said the coal ash extension was necessary for the company to ​“justify” capital investments to keep the plant operating. On November 25, the EPA proposed granting the extension to Schahfer and 10 other plants nationwide. Twelve plants had previously requested exceptions to a 2021 deadline to stop putting waste in unlined repositories, which often leak contaminants into groundwater; one was denied. The other requests were never granted, but their filings allowed the plants to put ash in unlined ponds through October 2028. The EPA’s recent proposal, which is open for public comment through January 7, 2026, would allow the 11 plants to dump coal ash in unlined ponds through October 2031.

Cantarelli said Schahfer’s ​“retirement has not been impacted by EPA’s proposal to extend coal ash–related compliance deadlines,” and did not respond to a question about Gomos’ email seeking the extension.

The EPA proposal noted, ​“NIPSCO has stated that RM Schahfer would operate its coal-fired boilers until 2028 if the proposed rule change was finalized.” A correction issued December 1 clarified that NIPSCO said it ​“could potentially operate coal-fired boilers until 2028.”

Three coal plants in Illinois, two in Louisiana, two in Texas, and one each in Ohio, Utah, and Wyoming would also be covered by the coal ash extension.

Earthjustice senior attorney Lisa Evans explained that while a 2020 Biden administration rule created the extension through 2028, the EPA never ruled on the plants’ requests. In her view, that makes the proposed extension to 2031 an illegal way that the Trump administration is trying to prolong the life of coal plants.

“The rule did not just give extensions to coal plants to operate unlined surface impoundments with no strings attached,” Evans said. ​“The plants had to meet specific criteria to be able to continue to operate those unlined impoundments. The Trump administration has not evaluated their compliance and whether they have adequately remediated groundwater contamination.”

Monitoring data reported by NIPSCO shows molybdenum, arsenic, and other contaminants at high levels in groundwater near the Schahfer plant’s unlined pond.

“EPA has to make sure these utilities are operating in a way that’s protective of health and the environment,” Evans said. ​“They’ve thrown that out the window for the purported reason of throwing more energy into the grid.”

Reliability race

Three times this year, the Trump administration has ordered the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan to keep running for stretches of 90 days past its planned retirement, most recently on November 18. The extension has cost ratepayers $615,000 per day, even as studies show that no energy-shortage emergency exists.

The federal National Energy Regulatory Commission has found that there is an adequate supply of electricity this winter to power the grid that covers Michigan and Indiana.

NERC’s recent reliability report found ​“limited risk” in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s grid, adding that the grid operator has procured more energy than required.

Data centers for AI are expected to steeply increase electricity demand in coming years, but experts say aging coal plants are not the way to meet that demand. The Schahfer and Culley plants, for example, are hardly well suited to provide significant reliable power.

The Culley plant is CenterPoint’s ​“smallest and most inefficient coal unit,” the company noted in a 2025 planning summary. Shane Bradford, vice president of CenterPoint’s Indiana Electric, told regulators in the December 2 hearing that the company had enough coal to continue running the plant if forced to.

“We are very concerned this unit could be the target of a [Federal Power Act] 202(c) order this month, given the very assertive stance the Trump and Braun administrations are taking on preventing any coal plant from retiring,” Inskeep said about Culley.

The Schahfer unit that has been offline since July 9 because of turbine problems will need to be ​“rebuilt” over about six months in order to keep operating, Parisi told regulators. Schahfer’s other coal unit also had outages for hundreds of hours over the summer, caused by leaks in boiler equipment, said David Saffran, NIPSCO generation business systems administrator in the operations management reporting.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/2048px-Schafer_9908.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=1f809169a5c481455cef23cfdff27f4e,N,,2025-12-15 04:57:33.549450

As India chases an ambitious target of 15 per cent EV penetration in new vehicle sales by 2030, supply chain constraints are emerging as a major roadblock. According to BYD India’s leadership, demand, charging infrastructure and regulations all matter, but the real test will be whether manufacturers can source key components reliably and at the right cost. In their view, the supply chain is the link that will decide whether the 2030 goals are met or missed.

Battery dependence and limited local capacity

The pressure is most visible on the battery side. India still depends heavily on imported batteries and critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel. These global supply chains are under pressure from rising worldwide demand and are exposed to geopolitical risks and price swings.

Current battery manufacturing capacity within India is not enough to support the projected demand from 30 to 40 million electric vehicles expected to be on Indian roads by 2030. Domestic companies like Exide and Lithium Werks are expanding their facilities, but their timelines and volumes do not yet match the aggressive growth targets being discussed by policymakers and the auto industry. Until more large-scale local plants come on stream, battery supply will remain a constraint and keep EV costs elevated.

Chips, motors and slow localisation

The stress is not limited to batteries. The flow of semiconductor chips, electric motor components and power electronics is also fragmented. A large share of these parts is imported from East Asia. Any disruption there, whether due to geopolitical tension, natural disasters or economic slowdowns, can quickly translate into production cuts in India.

The auto industry has long relied on just in time manufacturing to keep inventory costs low. That approach leaves very little buffer when shipments are delayed or diverted. For EVs, which depend on a more complex mix of electronic and electrical parts than conventional cars, this lack of cushion can halt production lines and delay deliveries.

Localisation efforts are under way but have been slower than first expected. When the FAME II scheme was launched, there was an assumption that major global battery makers and component suppliers would set up large plants in India within a few years. Instead, many have delayed full scale entry or are operating pilot facilities rather than committing to big capacities. As a result, Indian OEMs are still absorbing higher imported component costs, which they cannot always pass on to buyers without making EVs look too expensive next to petrol and diesel models.

Skills, scale and the 2030 gap

There is also a human capital gap to deal with. Building and assembling EV drivetrains needs a different skill set compared to traditional internal combustion powertrains. Factories require technicians, engineers and shop floor workers who are trained in high voltage systems, battery pack assembly and specialised electronics. Training programmes are growing, but not at the speed required if production has to scale rapidly over the next few years.

A shortage of skilled personnel can lead to quality issues and slower ramp up, which in turn damages consumer confidence if early buyers face reliability problems. That risk is taken seriously in a market where many households are still buying their first EV and want a hassle-free ownership experience.

BYD’s optimism about reaching 1,000 monthly EV sales in India shows that individual manufacturers believe they can work through these issues by improving efficiency and building scale. However, moving from those numbers to the volumes needed for 15 per cent EV penetration will require the entire ecosystem to move together. That means everyone from mining companies extracting lithium to local battery and motor manufacturers, software developers working on EV management systems and logistics providers moving parts around the country.

Right now, these pieces are not fully aligned. Until India can build a more cohesive and resilient supply chain for EV components, the 2030 targets will remain more aspirational than assured, even if buyer interest and policy support continue to grow.",https://cdn.cartoq.com/photos/cars_at_stockyard_3da0c4bbe7.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 05:59:13.517997

From an early and productive planting season to a warm May and a wet June, it felt like farmers were set up for another incredible year of record-breaking yields.

Time will tell whether statewide yields were a record, but many farmers felt the pinch of tight commodity markets, heavy disease pressure and other crop issues as the summer and fall went on. After such a strange year, what should we learn from for 2026, and what should we leave behind?

Take it with you

Here are some actions you’ll want to continue in 2026:

1. Plant early. Early planting has always been a priority for corn, but soybeans are now competing for that priority spot. Corn yield potential has a steeper drop-off as we enter mid-May. So, if soil temperature and moisture conditions are good, with a forecast trending warmer, prioritize corn ahead of soybean in 2026.

2. Establish strong herbicide programs. Herbicide programs shined in 2025, with all the rainfall putting pressure on residuals and continued weed emergence through the summer. Focus on a preemergence mixture that will perform against the weed spectrum in your fields, and examine rates closely to make sure you have sufficient active ingredient to control weeds.

3. Don’t stop scouting. Consistent crop scouting led to timely and effective pesticide application decisions in 2025. As margins become tighter, one of the most effective ways to spend money wisely is to spend time scouting before making expensive input decisions.

4. Prepare for volunteer corn. One of the most interesting end-of-season surprises in 2025 was the volunteer corn cover crop left behind from early harvest. It’s hard to say for certain whether more corn will continue to germinate in 2026, but this may be something we can’t fully leave behind in 2025. Plan for the potential of more volunteer corn in 2026 by checking herbicide traits of your hybrids and having a plan in place.

Forget it

Here are some things to leave behind in 2025:

1. Focusing on southern rust. Southern rust cannot overwinter in Iowa or anywhere in the U.S. Although this disease was a big problem in 2025, we shouldn’t make it a focus of our 2026 plans, as it takes a very special combination of weather events for southern rust to spread and establish here. In 2024 and 2025, southern rust was first found in mid-July, but it was not a major problem due to the different weather conditions.

2. Making multiple fungicide applications. Multiple fungicide applications in a season, even timely ones, are unlikely to create positive return on investment in our environment, except in the very unusual case of the 2025 growing season. With fungicide product and application upward of $30 per application for even less-expensive mixtures, each application should return at least eight to 10 bushels per acre to pay for itself. Plan for timely crop scouting and applying fungicide during the VT- to R2-growth stage based on the disease triangle (susceptible hybrid, disease presence and favorable environment) to be successful in 2026.

3. Spending money with little research. Spending money on biological products with little independent research support may be a useful on-farm endeavor when commodity prices are high, but in a time of tight margins, dollars are better invested in products with reliable returns, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and lime. If you haven’t been applying sulfur and you’re interested in trying something new, apply a sulfur product (in sulfate form) to corn in the spring at a rate of 15 to 20 pounds per acre, and leave some test strips to determine if it had a yield effect.

Ghosts of 2025

While farm fields carry the ghosts of 2025 in many cases — such as weed seed, overwintering pathogens and soil nutrient levels — there are some things we can leave behind in 2025 to start fresh in the new year.

As part of the TaiyangNews Leadership Talks, GREW Solar’s Chief Operating Officer (COO), Hardip Singh, spoke to TaiyangNews about the company’s strategic path forward at the Renewable Energy India Expo 2025 (REI 2025) in Greater Noida.

GREW exhibited its current product portfolio at the event, including the newly launched G12R module and a full-black module earlier introduced at RE+ in the US. The full-black module is designed specifically for the US market, shared Singh. Based on TOPCon cell technology, with a cell size of G12R, Singh said there is higher power output without significantly increasing module size. As a result, the new module can achieve power ratings of up to 635 W, compared to around 590 W with M10 cells.

Because the module dimensions remain largely unchanged, it is suitable not only for utility-scale projects but also for rooftop and residential installations. The higher wattage enables greater power generation from the same rooftop area.

In terms of manufacturing capacity, GREW currently operates 6.5 GW of module manufacturing capacity at its Jaipur facility. It plans to add another 4.5 GW in the near future, taking total module capacity to around 11 GW by the end of 2026. On the cell side, Grew Energy is setting up a 3 GW facility in Narmadapuram, which is planned to be expanded to 8 GW by the end of 2026. This production will be used both for internal consumption and for sales to customers.

At present, GREW is focused entirely on TOPCon technology. However, the company acknowledges the rapid pace of technological change in the solar industry. It continues to monitor future technologies such as HJT, back contact (BC) cells, and perovskites, too. Singh shared that the manufacturing equipment installed at GREW’s facilities is designed to be upgradeable, allowing a swift transition when new technologies become commercially viable and widely adopted. “So technologically we will be ready,” stressed Singh.

Regarding exports, the company stated that earlier capacity constraints limited its ability to focus on international markets. Until recently, GREW operated with around 3 GW of capacity, which was insufficient to meet the domestic demand. With expanded capacity now coming online, the company is actively pursuing exports and has already participated in RE+ in the US. Singh said that its target export markets include the US, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa.

On India’s solar manufacturing ecosystem, Grew Energy expressed appreciation for government support through policy initiatives such as ALMM, domestic manufacturing incentives, and demand-side schemes like PM-KUSUM and PM Surya Ghar. However, the company emphasized the need for long-term policy stability. As investments in cells, wafers, and ingots are highly capital-intensive, stable and predictable policies are essential to build confidence among manufacturers, lenders, and other stakeholders across the ecosystem.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-12-15%2Foqvdiklu%2FGrew-Energy-.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-12-15 05:59:52.673113

Our Commitment to North Carolina Runs Deep Our name reflects more than a brand or a location.
Blue Cross NC is here for North Carolina.","Many adults today feel as if they are navigating life alone. People feel disconnected from each other and uncertain about the institutions that should help them in their daily lives. Health care can, and should, provide clarity and comfort, yet it often adds to the strain. It is confusing, expensive, and difficult to navigate. A recent poll found that nearly a third of adults skipped or postponed care in the past year. When the system that should support people instead pushes them away, minor issues can escalate into serious problems and overall costs rise for everyone.

These challenges affect physical and mental health and place pressure on household finances. They are especially intense in North Carolina, which is one of the most expensive states for care and where nearly every county faces shortages of health care professionals.

North Carolinians need to know that someone is in their corner, ready to listen and work on their behalf to make high quality care more affordable and more accessible. What does true partnership look like? What does it mean to advocate for communities in a meaningful way?

Innovation

Several years ago, Blue Cross NC recognized that the fee-for-service model was driving costs upward and slowing progress. We became one of the leaders guiding North Carolina toward value-based care. Instead of paying simply for the number of services provided, we build payment incentives around results. This model—which depends on close partnership with providers–encourages prevention, coordination, and data informed care that reduces chronic conditions, avoidable hospitalizations, and unnecessary emergency room visits. The shift has produced major quality gains and close to $1 billion dollars in shared savings.

Our innovations don’t just transform how care is paid for. They also improve how care is delivered:

For several years, we’ve also been a leading force promoting food is medicine programs for improving health. Blue Cross NC collaborated with UNC Health to publish a first-of-its-kind clinical study evaluating the health impacts and strategies for delivering healthy food to those experiencing food insecurity. We’ve also just launched a new Health Through Food statewide initiative to reduce chronic conditions and fight the rising costs of care across North Carolina through fresh and healthy food.

We offer tools that help members understand costs and manage their health care spending, including our Cost Estimator tool and our collaboration with Sempre Health, which improves medication adherence and lowers long term costs.

Our More Than a Script program reimburses independent pharmacists who take an active role in managing chronic diseases, like hypertension and diabetes.

We are committed to improving our systems to make it easier for members to access the right care at the right time.

We’ve been pioneers in the use of predictive analytics to enhance our care management team’s ability to engage at-risk members and get them started on focused, strategic support programs that minimize or eliminate health risks early, before they lead to a crisis situation.

These examples just scratch the surface of our commitment to improving quality and affordability for people across North Carolina.

Local Connection and Collaboration

True partnership requires deep and sustained local engagement. Our work on Health Through Food and other initiatives is possible because of strong relationships with community organizations throughout the state.

Blue Cross NC has been part of North Carolina’s fabric for nearly a century. Our presence reaches far beyond our headquarters in Durham.

Most of our employees live in the communities they serve.

Our County Engagement team directly supports all 100 counties.

Our Beyond Blue Neighborhood Centers provide local support and space for community activity.

Our Extra Miles Tour took our leadership team to every county to meet with educators, providers, and local leaders and to understand community-level needs and opportunities.

We’ve forged long-lasting partnerships with universities, community colleges, and local organizations to help expand access to care in rural areas and help us support members during critical moments. Onsite care navigators in high volume hospitals have assisted more than 7,000 members since September 2024 and generated an estimated $32 million in savings through better guidance and improved recovery and discharge planning.

We also stand with North Carolinians during times of crisis, including the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. For us, partnership with communities is not an optional strategy. It is the only path to long-lasting solutions.

Flexibility to Provide Tailored Solutions

History alone does not make a true community partner. Flexibility and responsiveness matter. Blue Cross NC listens, learns, and adjusts as needs evolve.

Our relationship with the NC Chamber recently produced Carolina HealthWorks, which gives small businesses access to the rate advantages typically reserved for large employer groups. We have formed similar collaborations with the North Carolina Retail Merchants Association, the NC Home Builders Association, and the NC Bar Association.

We also work with community health organizations to address urgent public health challenges. Examples include installing Narcan distribution kiosks in high need areas and partnering with Ripe for Revival to bring nutritious food, health screenings, and education directly to residents.

Our Commitment to North Carolina Runs Deep

Our name reflects more than a brand or a location. It represents our purpose. We stand with our members and the communities we serve. We advocate for their needs. We demonstrate this commitment not just in the products we sell or through the services we provide to our customers. This commitment is visible in the thousands of volunteer hours our employees contribute each year and in our three statewide initiatives focused on youth mental health, food is medicine, and rural access to care.

It is also visible in the work of the independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina Foundation, which has invested in our communities through grants, partnerships, and initiatives.

There is more work to do, yet every step forward strengthens our state and enhances our ability to deliver better and more affordable care for our communities.

,American Energy,2025-12-15 06:05:14+00:00,Nature,Quantifying land-use metrics for solar photovoltaic projects in the western United States,"Rebecca R, Jeya Maria Jose, Vishal M, Sarah M",,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02862-5,"We introduce a replicable and efficient machine-learning-based approach for analyzing land-use associated with solar PV that differentiates between the panel array area and the full project area of solar PV facilities.
The land transformation for solar PV projects in U.S. states is, of course, influenced by the available solar resources (Fig.
Having developed our deep learning model, we start examining the land-use profile of our entire portfolio of solar PV projects.
In the end, our model performs well in terms of identifying image features that resemble empty spacing between PV panels as well as PV panels themselves.
Metrics The typical nomenclature used in existing literature quantifies land-use efficiency in terms of land area “transformation” and “occupation” metrics.","Renewable energy sources are an important conduit through which energy-related greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced, particularly photovoltaics (PV) due to the abundant and ubiquitous nature of solar energy1,2,3. Despite having only generated 3.2% (856 TWh) of global electricity generation in 2020, the PV industry has maintained high growth rates for the past decade and its cumulative capacity may reach ten terawatts by 20304,5. The growth of ground-mounted PV may experience land constraints, yet the degree to which it may be constrained has yet been confirmed due to inconsistent methodologies and a lack of comprehensive datasets. Further, ambitious solar energy development could potentially create unanticipated knock-on effects on land use on a global scale if existing land uses are displaced, highlighting the importance of optimizing co-use of land. As the world transforms its energy system toward lower carbon and renewable sources, understanding not only the benefits but also how to overcome potential drawbacks of solar PV has important implications for sustainability. Our analysis contributes a transparent and systematic method to quantify land-solar interactions and comprehensive dataset of to be scientifically accurate 719 solar power PV projects in the U.S. portion of the Western Interconnection.

The installation of solar PV projects captures free and abundant solar irradiance over large parcels of land which are neither free nor unlimited. The issue of land use has been perceived as a limitation to the large-scale growth of ground-mounted solar power, with early studies suggesting that it can compromise the overall sustainability and return on investment of solar energy systems6,7,8. A total of 32 environmental impacts have been linked to the utilization of solar energy, indicating that high growth in solar power may result in unintended consequences to various environmental impact categories9. At the same time, solar energy has been noted as having both lower and higher land use in comparison to wind and fossil fuel powered electricity using life cycle assessment (LCA), a cradle-to-grave analysis of the impacts of products and processes10,11. Land transformation (square meters per megawatt hour \((\frac{{m}^{2}}{{MWh}})\)) serves as an important baseline metric for LCA in terms of area per unit of electricity generated. The quantification of land-solar interactions can enable an understanding of how to ameliorate impacts while supporting techno-ecological synergies6,12,13,14,15,16,17; this framework to engineer solutions that benefit both solar technologies and ecological systems by design has become a major thrust of research in recent years. Transforming our perspective on systems design can ensure that solar energy is developed to align with both climate and sustainable development goals (SDGs)18.

Beyond LCA, inconsistent metrics, data, study boundaries, and methods have produced conflicting results for land-energy interactions6,19,20,21. Over short timescales (e.g., <10 years), renewable energy systems have been noted as much more land-intensive than fossil-fuel-based systems10,22,23,24. Solar power has also been noted as having lower scores in capacity-based land use efficiency (watts of installed capacity per square meter \((\frac{{W}_{c}}{{m}^{2}})\)) and generation-based land use efficiency (watts of operational capacity per square meter \((\frac{{W}_{o}}{{m}^{2}})\))11 in comparison to non-renewable alternatives with strong dependence on geographical locations25. Such results overlook the fact that renewable power can increase its cumulative electricity produced without expanding its land footprint whereas non-renewable power requires the continual development of new land for fuel extraction26. Furthermore, solar PV facilities can increase their land use efficiency by having higher packing factor—the ratio of PV array area to total site area for a facility27. Considering the implicit time factor in land-use metrics, renewable energy sources can have comparable or even lower land impacts when compared to fossil counterparts when examined over longer timescales, such as the average lifetime of solar projects (30 years)10,24,28. Solar power can reach land equivalency (i.e., the amount of time it takes for fossil-fuel-based systems and renewable power systems to have the equivalent land footprint and cumulative energy production) with natural gas and coal alternatives in less than a decade10,24.

Systematic research that quantifies the land-solar interactions covering large populations of PV projects across extensive tracts of land remains relatively limited. Existing analyses rely on relatively small datasets (e.g., <200 power plants in Hernandez et al.6) or present results focused on the direct panel area rather than the total project site29,30,31 (i.e., including the panels and all land use up to the project fence line), limiting the ability to directly use findings to confirm the land-use impacts associated with current and future solar energy generation24. Without readily available data describing the land use of solar PV facilities, the potential higher-order, indirect effects of solar land use on the global scale become even more difficult to measure. Furthermore, the variable use of metrics in existing literature prevents broad consensus about land-solar interactions, which can be circumvented by adopting a transparent methodology and consistent set of metrics21. Our analysis of the 719 U.S. solar PV projects (Fig. 1) contributes a systematic and replicable methodology that produced a dataset quantifying the resulting land transformation (the land area altered by the solar facility per unit of energy produced during its 30-year lifetime) and land-use efficiency (the land area altered per unit of installed nameplate capacity or electricity generation). The power plants in our sample are all connected to the U.S. Western Interconnection, which occupies an area rich in solar energy in terms of global horizontal irradiance (GHI in \({kWh}/\frac{{m}^{2}}{{year}}\))—a close proxy for the total endowment of solar resources available at each given location on the earth’s surface.

By combining deep learning and energy systems analysis, we present a workflow that can be broadly applied to solve inconsistencies in the quantification of land-solar interactions while elucidating the use of the built environment. While previous studies have documented efforts to localize and create inventories of solar PV installations in the U.S.29,31,32,33,34,35,36,37, access to the resulting data has been limited33,34,36 and the annotation of solar PV installations has been focused on the panel arrays29). We introduce a replicable and efficient machine-learning-based approach for analyzing land-use associated with solar PV that differentiates between the panel array area and the full project area of solar PV facilities. Our approach is applicable across diverse regions and installation types, not only generating robust datasets but also providing consistent metrics and transparent, replicable methods that offer critical insights for resolving inconsistencies in LCA and other macro-scale energy analyses.

We examined 719 utility-scale solar PV facilities from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) records that are connected to the Western Interconnection (Fig. 1a). Each of our utility-scale facilities has a nameplate capacity of at least 1 megawatt as defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA)38, with the median, mean, and total nameplate capacity being 3.5 megawatts, 19.7 megawatts, and 13,272 megawatts respectively. Our dataset also includes 110 utility-scale rooftop PV installations, predominantly situated on substantial structures such as university campuses, government laboratories, and corporate facilities, averaging 2.1 megawatts in nameplate capacity and comprising 1.8% (236.3 megawatts) of the total analyzed capacity. Our results suggest that solar projects examined in the study area cover 538 \({{{\mathrm{km}}}}^{2}\) of land, 416 \({{{\mathrm{km}}}}^{2}\) of which is covered by solar panels. Our PV panel footprint results show strong alignment with prior works completed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (USPVDB)30,31 (Fig. 2). Out of the 719 solar PV facilities examined in our study area, 252 and 609 were once examined by the aforementioned studies (Fig. 1b). When comparing across the same PV projects, our estimation for the area of PV panel arrays is close to that of the existing data. The minor differences can be attributed to three factors: 1) the later expansion in capacity for some projects after 2015; 2) inconsistent geopositioning of specific projects; and 3) different methods in accounting for the gap separating PV panel arrays. Specifically, solar arrays separated by more than 30 meters are annotated as separate polygons in the 2016 USGS data while arrays are examined on a case-by-case basis using our approach (see methods). Differences in methods point to the need for judicious use of results from different studies as they may not have been produced with commensurable methods. Our approach provides the land-use footprint of not only the panel area but also that of the entire solar PV facility by evidence of fencing, which is largely missing from existing data29,30,31,32. This additional information allows us to evaluate PV array spacing using the packing factor metric—the ratio of panel array footprint to that of the entire facility27. An evaluation of the 719 solar PV facilities shows a median and capacity-weighted average packing factor of 74% and 75%, respectively.

The land transformation for solar PV projects in U.S. states is, of course, influenced by the available solar resources (Fig. 3a, b). Specifically, the average land transformation of PV facilities is lower by 16% in the U.S. Southwest (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah) than in the Northwest (Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming). When evaluated in terms of capacity- and generation-based land use efficiency, Southwestern PV facilities outperform those located in the Northwest by 22% and 36%, respectively (Fig. 3c–f). The PV projects in Arizona and El Paso, Texas on average are the best performers among all projects in our sample. For both land transformation and land use efficiency metrics, evaluating PV projects solely on the footprint of solar arrays yields better performance results than estimates based on the total project footprint, which has important implications for future studies on PV power considering the balance of system for PV projects is increasingly likely to include potentially land-consuming subjects such as utility-scale battery packs. On average, the 609 ground-based solar PV facilities have a capacity- and generation-based land use efficiency of 24.7 \(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\) and 5.8 \(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\). Accounting for the varying installed capacity of PV projects, our results show a capacity- and generation-weighted average land use efficiency of 25.4 \(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\) and 6.9 \(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\), updating prior estimates27. The average lifetime land transformation for the examined facilities is 0.85 \(\frac{{m}^{2}}{{MWh}}\). Rooftop installations are excluded from these land-use calculations derived from project footprints, due to the absence of clearly and exclusively defined project site areas for these installations but are available in the published dataset.

Results differ between PV facilities using different mounting systems. On average, PV panel arrays on dual-axis tracking systems outperform their fixed-rack and single-axis neighbors within the same state by 25% and 39%, respectively in terms of land transformation (Fig. 4a). However, in terms of total land transformation for the entire project site, PV facilities built with dual-axis tracking systems are greater on average than their single-axis and fixed-rack counterparts in the same state by 58% and 13%, respectively (Fig. 4a), meaning the former has a larger land footprint than the latter. The same trend persists when evaluated using land use efficiency (Fig. 4b, c). This dichotomy arises because fixed-rack/single-axis PV panel arrays are built in a much more compact formation, taking up less total land than dual-axis panel arrays which require each individual panel to freely and fully track the movement of the sun. On the other hand, individual PV panels on dual-axis mounting systems exhibit greater efficiency in capturing sunlight during the day than their counterparts do.

Land sparing—including siting generation on already-developed surfaces such as rooftops or redeveloped brownfields—can support the potential synergy between technology and ecological health for sustainability energy development29,39,40. Using National Land Cover Data (NLCD) created by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium, we classify the surface cover within each project footprint (Fig. 5a, b) and report both contemporaneous and historical results. In 2019, 59% of projects in our sample are located on land classified as developed (including low, medium, and high intensity), accounting for 65% of total installed capacity. Using NLCD from 2001, when U.S. solar development remained in its infancy, only 1.6% of total installed capacity in our dataset was located on land classified as developed; however, 38% of projects were developed on land that was classified as cultivated crops. Our results confirm previous findings that rural anthromes (e.g., cropland) and biomes (e.g., grassland) that are close to human population are the most likely to have been previously sited for PV projects29,41. This outcome points to the potential for optimizing the dual use of land (e.g, agrivoltaics) to mitigate impacts on local ecological systems while sustaining growth of solar PV. Results indicate that PV projects are being built on various types of land, indicating the need to carefully design dual use systems and consider the sustainability of siting decisions across a variety of local environments. Approximately 14% of existing PV projects in our study area now are located on cultivated cropland, which could be retrofitted into dual use systems to obtain techno-ecological synergies29. An additional 15% of the PV projects utilize rooftop modules, which occupy surfaces within the built environment for solar energy. It can be argued that they do not directly transform additional land, highlighting their potential advantage as a land sparing opportunity. Land sparing opportunities exist but are underrepresented in our sample—PV deployment has in many places driven measurable changes in land cover.

Our systematic methodology enabled the first digital dataset containing project-level land information of solar PV connected to the U.S. Western Interconnection using deep learning. Using this dataset, we contributed a detailed demonstration of land-solar interactions in the region, resulting in novel records of the land use efficiency and land transformation of existing PV facilities with varying geographic and structural characteristics. Our findings confirm that land-solar interactions are highly dependent on local solar output potential and designs of panel mounting systems42,43. We build upon prior studies that apply deep learning to detect and characterize the area of solar PV as the first to characterize the land required by solar PV projects in their entirety as opposed to the solar arrays alone29,33,34,36. In doing so, we provide information on solar land use that is rarely seen in existing data—the entire project site of ground-mounted solar PV projects—and present a more complete picture of land-solar interactions.

A novel observation differentiating our findings from prior research is that facilities with higher performance, dual axis tracking mounting systems, are less efficient in terms of project-level land-use when compared to their fixed/single-axis counterparts. We attribute this finding to the much larger clearing space needed to install individual dual-axis solar arrays (e.g., to avoid inter-panel shading), which thereby reduce the panel density44. These results point to the need for analyses of land-solar interactions to go beyond the array footprint alone to better understand impacts related to the full project area. Additionally, our data enabled an important classification of the land cover occupied by PV installations, presenting an important approach that highlights the benefits of using the built environment to reduce ecosystem impacts45. The majority of the land used for PV projects utilizes land that previously belongs to the rural anthromes and biomes and is now developed, suggesting that solar energy projects are most frequently sited near human population and that land sparing outcomes can be achieved by siting projects to make use of both dual use agrivoltaics and the built environment. Definitive conclusions about the aggregate land-use impacts of solar PV facilities would necessitate ex-ante land cover classification for the same plots of land and potential knock-on effects of local solar energy developments on land use in other areas.

Importantly, our study represents the first attempt to quantify land use metrics using deep learning results, making it the first large-scale analysis of this kind that examines land transformation and land use efficiency. The results demonstrate the potential of using machine learning techniques to perform tasks that are prohibitively difficult and labor intensive (e.g., annotation of PV project site). The combination of GIS and machine learning tools is contributing valuable instruments for consistent collection and analysis of the land-use implications of energy developments. A nascent stream of research has shown the prospects of utilizing open-access map such as the OpenStreetMap to detect and create land-use inventories46,47. Such approaches have the benefit of coverage of large areas but have so far relied on relatively coarse imagery and remain challenged in achieving the high-precision boundary delineation required for intra-facility solar land-use analysis. Crowdsourced data, such as OpenStreetMap, also may be limited in completeness, geographic coverage, and consistency, and has resulted in incomplete solar inventories47. High-resolution aerial imagery such as that we use here more closely represents the ground truth of energy system development, ensuring a replicable approach to producing up-to-date analyses of the rapid development of solar PV. While semantic segmentation for PV detection is increasingly well established, we extend the field by integrating land use efficiency and land transformation metrics21,48.

While this study primarily focuses on quantifying land-solar interactions for PV projects, results have broad implications for data-driven decision-support in fields such as LCA and energy systems planning. LCAs of electricity generation, including solar PV, are increasingly including spatiotemporal inventories49. Site-level data, such as the inventory we produce here, can enable analyses that account for improved geographic representativeness and variability of impacts across projects. While spatial variability is important for solar PV, public inventories have been limited to date11,33,34,36. Future work could further enhance geospatial information by better characterizing transmission lines, access roads and distribution infrastructure50,51.

With rapid growth in solar energy, it is vitally important to improve land management and preserve ecological health while mitigating climate change45. A large-scale map of existing PV projects can inform a better understanding of land-solar interactions, including other social and geographical aspects of existing land-based economies and ecosystems30. Our methods and results contribute important decision-support for planning, policymaking, and analyzing the deployment of PV across states in the Western Interconnection. By publishing an open-access, georeferenced inventory with a carefully documented methodology, we establish a replicable approach to quantifying land-solar interactions, serving as an important benchmark for understanding the land implications of energy transitions with high growth in solar power.

The study area for this research project is the U.S. part of the Western Interconnection which includes the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and the El Paso County of Texas. We identified potential solar facility locations in our study area and collect annual generation data using the EIA facility data from 2019 (e.g., EIA-860 and EIA-923), which include electricity generating units with installed capacity of at least 1 megawatt. The land area of each solar PV project is determined using a combination of deep learning technology and aerial imagery analysis, the latter of which involved manual annotation to inform the deep learning model. The aerial imagery used in this study comes from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) database administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The NAIP images are acquired at a resolution of <1-meter ground sample distance across the entire US during agricultural growing seasons, representing the more accurate depiction of land-use compared to crowdsourced map databases used in some existing studies47. The image database is updated with a 3-year cycle—the one used in this study is published in 2019. The NLCD is a detailed mapping of the US with consistent and relevant land cover information from 2001 to 2019 with a two-to-three-year interval, created by a group of U.S. agencies named the MRLC. Data for the year 2001 and 2019 are used to better elucidate the change in land cover before and after almost all solar PV installations in our study area are built. The pixel resolution for NLCD is 30 m—suitable for solar PV projects which typically occupy around 200,000 square meters of land and much finer than what has been used in previous findings29.

We compare our estimates against two datasets on the land use of solar PV facilities for the conterminous U.S. published by the USGS in 2016 and jointly by the USGS and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 202330,31. The 2016 USGS dataset identifies locations of solar PV panels in the conterminous US in EIA utility-scale facilities data from 2015 and digitizes the footprint area of each solar array using aerial imagery from NAIP from the same year. In total, they documented that there were 740 U.S. solar PV facilities (1207 arrays) by 2015. Since the scope of our study is limited to the U.S. part of the Western Interconnection, we have a different study area than the two existing datasets.

The solar PV projects examined in our study are distributed across different climate regions with vastly different landscapes. Before deploying a deep learning model for image annotation, which has been shown to be a useful tool for land-use inventory-making and analysis, we need to ensure the performance of the model29,33,34,36,37,47. Our deep learning model needs to be able to capture the distinct features of solar PV systems against the varying backdrops of land cover types. To that end, we begin by training the model using a diverse set of manual annotations. Each solar PV power plant is located using coordinates obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on NAIP. The image of the plant and its immediate surrounding area is then cropped from the aerial imagery and saved for annotation. Specifically, a randomly selected group of 100 projects were manually annotated at first for the development of a deep learning model. The entire portfolio was then automatically annotated by the deep learning model. The product generated by the model then goes through manual post-processing before being compiled into a master shapefile.

Table 1 shows a summary of the six annotation classes we use for solar PV projects. In this solar PV annotation framework, PV panels, inverters, and other infrastructures (e.g., battery storage stations or buildings) are all within the project site. In addition, there will be no overlaps between PV panels and inverters, nor between external access roads and project sites.

In this annotation framework, we only consider (visually distinguishable) external access roads as a separate class, and consider internal roads for operation and maintenance as part of the project site without further classification. In addition, we consider the overall project site as a permanent site clearing and do not distinguish other temporary land use, which usually recovers or is cleared once the project construction is finished, and the project is in operation.

Decision rule on PV panel polygon delineation

The PV panels class can be annotated in multiple ways based on different decision rules on polygon delineation. Here we adopt a “visually distinguishable segments” rule to delineate solar PV panels—separating clusters of PV panels by evidence of relatively larger empty space that can be potentially utilized for other purposes (e.g., dirt road for maintenance vehicles). We decide on this rule in order to separate PV panels from adjacent support infrastructure such as inverters and acknowledge spaces that are reserved for maintenance access, while also categorizing small intervals between PV panels as part of the PV panels class since these parcels of land would not be used for other purposes. For instance, Fig. 6 shows an example of the annotation based on this “visually distinguishable” rule. Here solar PV panels are separated from on-site inverters.

To understand the impacts on PV panel areas using different polygon delineation rules, we compared the land area impacts with four different decision rules. The four rules being tested are based on three delineation methods: 1) the PV panel-only rule, which only accounts for physical PV panels and separates small intervals between panels; 2) the visually distinguishable segments rule, which is the decision rule we adopt as described above; and 3) the quantitative distance rule, which uses a quantitative measure to decide on segmentation, i.e., if panels have a distance larger than the threshold, they are categorized as different polygons, otherwise categorized as a single polygon. For the 3rd method, we use both 10 m and 30 m as decision rules to test, where the 30-m rule is adopted in the previous USGS study. An example of the annotation for the PV panels class based on different decision rules can be found in Fig. 7.

We compare the PV panel land areas for four solar PV projects using these four different decision rules. Potential differences between the decision rules that can be used in this methodology are illustrated in Table 2. Only accounting for PV panels results in about a 50 percent reduction in land footprint compared to using a 30-m rule in these sample projects. However, other than the PV panel-only method, the land area impacts using the other three decision rules are very similar, suggesting minor deviations when switching between these three rules. According to the example shown here, the difference in land area impacts of using different methods would be greater with larger size of projects.

While developing annotated images for solar PV, we also measure two distances in order to justify decision rules for the paper: minimum distance segmented and maximum distance not segmented. An example of the two distances being measured is shown in Fig. 8. The minimum distance segmented represents the minimum distance where two segments of PV panels are separated (due to inverters, roads, or other visually distinguishable features), whereas the maximum distance not segmented represents the maximum distance between PV panels that are aggregated as a single segment.

Development and application of the deep learning model

A deep learning-based network was trained to perform automatic segmentation of the PV panels based on a set of 100 solar PV facilities which is manually annotated according to rules detailed in the section above. We specifically chose U-Net as the deep network for segmentation as it has been seen to work well for segmentation-based applications in aerial imaging where precise boundaries are needed52. U-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder takes in the image as input and converts it to a lower dimensional latent space. These features are then forwarded to a decoder which converts the low-dimensional features to the segmentation map. The encoder path resembles a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, commonly seen in more recent end‑to‑end deep‑learning frameworks for mapping solar arrays33,34,36. It consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers that progressively reduce the spatial dimensions of the input image while extracting high-level features. Each stage in the encoder path typically consists of two convolutional layers followed by a max pooling operation. The decoder uses a combination of upsampling (transposed convolution) and concatenation operations to recover the spatial information lost during the encoding process. Each stage in the decoder path consists of an upsampling layer followed by two convolutional layers. U-Net incorporates skip connections between corresponding stages of the encoder and decoder paths. These skip connections allow the network to retain low-level details during the upsampling process, enabling precise localization of objects in the segmented output. Repeating such computation process using our training set of 100 annotations enables the model to take in any image and outline different objects within the image (e.g., PV panels). We develop the model by splitting the data into a 70-15-15 split for the train-validation-test. The model is developed using Python for coding, the Pytorch library for training, and a NVIDIA A100 GPU cluster for computation. We use an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 with a batch size of 16. The model is trained for 300 epochs until convergence.

Having developed our deep learning model, we start examining the land-use profile of our entire portfolio of solar PV projects. First, we geo-locate each solar plant in WECC using publicly available information from the EIA and download the corresponding NAIP images using USGS EarthExplorer. In rare cases where the coordinates in EIA surveys do not point to the actual location of the solar PV projects, we try to visually locate said projects using NAIP images or Google Maps. Areas of interest are then determined by creating a buffer area around the perimeter of each plant, with the buffer distance ranging from over 50 meters to include possible land use near the perimeter. The NAIP images within the buffer boundary are split into multiple images, each with a resolution of 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels. Each bundle of images for one plant is then fed into our deep learning model for examination, the outcome of which is merged back into a single shape file delineating the captured land use profile for each plant. Finally, we manually post-process each shape file, correcting any imperfections and collecting data for further land use analysis (Fig. 9).

In the end, our model performs well in terms of identifying image features that resemble empty spacing between PV panels as well as PV panels themselves. However, we do not provide land-use information on ancillary infrastructure in the final results because our model recognizes the various types and shapes of ancillary infrastructure across different landscapes with relatively poorer accuracy than it does panels. To identify any systemic bias in the annotations of panels and project sites, we benchmark our results pre and post manual corrections utilizing the Intersection over Union (IoU) score as our performance metric. Our analysis shows a mean IoU score of 0.822 with high statistical significance (p = 0.0062) and low variance (0.035). The results indicate little difference between the images pre and post manual correction, meaning that there was not much manual correction needed during the post-processing process.

Metrics

The typical nomenclature used in existing literature quantifies land-use efficiency in terms of land area “transformation” and “occupation” metrics. The former is used to evaluate the installation impact of energy systems, while the latter is used to consider the aggregate impact of system installation and operation9,11,26. The inherent difficulty in reporting land-use results under the current nomenclature lies in the lack of standardization in calculations of land area transformation and occupation. Currently, there are dozens of different terms used in existing studies to describe essentially the same two metrics, the majority of which are used both in capacity-based calculations and generation-based calculations with varying timescales19,48. The variation in methods and reporting metrics makes land-use estimations largely incomparable and, in turn, obscures the accurate translation of scientific findings into policy decisions21.

For this study, we proposed the usage of “land transformation” which has been one of the most common metrics used in life cycle assessment literature and other fields11,53,54,55,56. Each project was analyzed by calculating the land area altered per unit of energy produced in the assumed 30-year lifetime using the following equation:

$${Land\; Transformation}\left(\frac{{m}^{2}}{{MWh}}\right)=\frac{{Land\; area\; altered}\,({m}^{2})}{{Life\; time\; electrical\; energy\; production}\,({MWh})}$$

The land area of each project was estimated in terms of the total project footprint and the PV panel footprint. The former refers to all the land within the project site boundaries while the latter refers to the land occupied by the solar arrays. We also differentiate land-use efficiency by calculating capacity-based and generation-based land use efficiency metrics, which are needed to provide a holistic review of the theoretical and real-world land-use efficiency of solar PV facilities14. Importantly, our published data enable users to transparently calculate metrics as appropriate to their analyses48. Each project was analyzed by calculating the land area altered per unit of installed nameplate capacity or annual electricity production in 2019 using the following equations:

$${Capacity}\mbox-{based}\,{Land}\; {Use}\; {Efficiency}\left(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\right)=\frac{{Installed}\; {solar}\; {capacity}\,\left(W\right)}{{Land}\; {area}\; {altered}\,\left({m}^{2}\right)}$$

$${Generation}\mbox-{based}\; {Land}\; {Use}\; {Efficiency}\left(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\right)=\frac{{Electrical}\; {energy}\; {production}\; {in}\,2019 \, \left(W\right)}{{Land}\; {area}\; {altered}\,\left({m}^{2}\right)}$$",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02862-5/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2862_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-12-15 06:57:57.508989

“India stands at a decisive moment in strengthening its solar manufacturing ecosystem,” said Chetan Shah, Chairman and Managing Director at Solex Energy.
“While our module capacity has grown significantly, the ground realities of domestic cell manufacturing are often misunderstood.
In his view, solar cells remain the backbone of upstream integration, ALMM compliance, and India’s domestic manufacturing ambitions.
Rustagi noted that solar manufacturing is extremely capital-intensive, and globally, the large, vertically integrated players are best positioned to survive and grow over time.","The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s (MNRE) recent advisory to banks and financial institutions, calling for prudence in lending to standalone solar module manufacturing, has been welcomed by the renewable energy sector. Stakeholders say capital should flow into parts of the renewable energy ecosystem that have remained underdeveloped.

In an office memorandum, MNRE urged the Department of Financial Services to ensure that financing decisions “adopt a calibrated and well-informed approach” when lending to module manufacturing amid overcapacity.

India’s module manufacturing capacity, now nearing 150 GW, is already 200–250% higher than domestic demand and could cross 200 GW in the coming years.

However, upstream segments such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, and key ancillaries such as solar glass and aluminium frames, have not kept pace with module manufacturing growth.

Module capacity enlisted under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers List (ALMM) as of November 2025 was 121.72 GW, while the cell capacity registered under the ALMM List-II stood at 18.48 GW.

Industry insiders say the MNRE advisory is timely.

Dushyant Kumar, PV Quality Manager at AXITEC Energy India, said, “Overcapacity is pressuring prices and lowering utilization, and continued financing of standalone module plants could create avoidable debt risks. The priority now should be integrated manufacturing and upstream segments, such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, and key ancillaries, such as glass and frames. These are the real gaps holding back India’s solar supply chain.”

Unsustainable Buildup

The trigger for MNRE’s action was a letter from the All India Solar Industries Association (AISIA), which warned that installed and upcoming module capacities already exceed near-term domestic demand and that unchecked lending to more module and cell lines risks unsustainable debt buildup and potential non-performing assets.

“If fresh lending keeps flowing indiscriminately into new module lines, we risk pushing the industry towards distress and bankruptcies,” says Praveen Kumar, Director General at AISIA. “The intent was never to say ‘stop lending’ to the solar sector, but rather to urge lenders to be cautious about further expanding module capacity in an already saturated segment.”

He stressed that the Association also wanted to draw attention to the parts of the value chain where capital is still welcome: “Capacity in upstream manufacturing is still lagging behind potential demand, and where lending opportunities remain strong. MNRE’s subsequent clarification through its press release should put these doubts to rest and give banks and NBFCs the confidence to keep supporting viable, well-structured projects across the solar ecosystem.”

AISIA essentially told the government and the banking system that the sector is at risk of building factories that will be stranded if utilization stays low and prices remain under pressure.

Horizontal Growth

For years, government incentives, from production-linked incentives to customs duties and domestic content rules, spurred a proliferation of module assembly lines and, later, cell manufacturing lines. These were faster, cheaper, and less technologically intensive to set up than upstream facilities, making them the natural entry point for new players.

“India stands at a decisive moment in strengthening its solar manufacturing ecosystem,” said Chetan Shah, Chairman and Managing Director at Solex Energy. “While our module capacity has grown significantly, the ground realities of domestic cell manufacturing are often misunderstood. A major portion of India’s cell capacity is still based on older P-type technologies that require urgent upgradation, and only a limited share is truly future-ready N-type capacity.”

Shah warned that if lenders apply a blunt caution that doesn’t distinguish between modules and cells, they could inadvertently hurt a critical bridge segment. In his view, solar cells remain the backbone of upstream integration, ALMM compliance, and India’s domestic manufacturing ambitions. Restricting or delaying financing for genuinely competitive, technology-upgrading cell projects, he argued, would risk slowing the transition to advanced technologies such as TOPCon and beyond, precisely where India needs to move next.

The contrast with the upstream side is stark. While module capacity has raced ahead, cell capacity appears on track to meet demand in the near future, India still has only about 2 GW of ingot and wafer capacity and no commercial-scale polysilicon production. Solar glass and aluminum frames, crucial ancillaries for any serious module ecosystem, are also flagged by MNRE as segments where domestic capacity lags demand, with glass around 15 GW and aluminum frames around 17 GW per year.

Some stakeholders introduced a caveat. While agreeing that module overcapacity is real, they cautioned against overreacting. “While banks may exercise caution in the short term, growing demand for solar panels will require a substantial increase in solar capacity,” noted Avinash Hiranandani, Vice Chairman and Managing Director at RenewSys.

He argued that continued banking support for solar manufacturing, including modules, will remain crucial as India’s deployment targets ramp up, especially since “solar cell production has not yet caught up with rising module demand” and a broader ecosystem of ancillaries, such as encapsulants, also needs timely funding to scale.

The sector’s problem is not that too much capital has flowed into solar, but that it has flowed disproportionately into one layer of the stack.

The Road Ahead

The MNRE advisory to banks must also be seen in the context of India’s position within global supply chains. For long, the Indian industry has relied on the Chinese upstream supply. However, the actual build-out has left India with a large fleet of module lines and some cell lines that are still dependent on imported wafers and polysilicon.

Vinay Rustagi, Chief Business Officer at Premier Energies, pointed out that the real gap lies in ingots, wafers, polysilicon, silicon refining, and critical minerals and chemicals. “If we want true self-sufficiency and not just final assembly in India, then capital has to flow into these areas.”

The advisory, he said, was “a nudge for the financial system to align with the country’s long-term manufacturing and energy security goals, rather than adding more capacity where we are already relatively comfortable.”

Another layer to the rationale lies in the need to correct distortions created during the ALMM-heavy years. ALMM pushed developers to buy from domestic, listed manufacturers, which in turn incentivized many firms to quickly add or expand module lines to make it onto the list.

MNRE’s advisory signals that the next phase of growth should address structural gaps in the value chain.

Not everyone, however, is at ease with the implied consolidation. Smaller module manufacturers fear that prioritizing upstream could make it harder for them to raise funds.

Rustagi noted that solar manufacturing is extremely capital-intensive, and globally, the large, vertically integrated players are best positioned to survive and grow over time. “Smaller companies with limited, non-integrated capacities were always going to find it difficult to compete and to raise money at scale, regardless of this lending guidance.”

In that sense, the MNRE rethink on lending to module manufacturing is less a sudden change in direction and more a formal recognition of where market forces were already pushing the industry. If upstream capabilities, especially in ingots and wafers, are strengthened in time ahead of tighter ALMM timelines around 2028, that shift could ultimately support a more resilient, integrated domestic ecosystem that benefits the entire solar value chain.

Industry voices converge on one central point: prudence does not mean paralysis. A calibrated lending approach, as Shah and others argue, would distinguish between speculative, announcement-driven projects and genuinely competitive, technology-upgrading investments, especially in cells and upstream manufacturing. Hiranandani’s emphasis on long-term demand and ancillaries, Rustagi’s call for upstream depth, and AISIA’s focus on system-wide stability all point in the same direction: rebalance capital, don’t retreat from the sector.

“I’m generally not in favor of steering lenders or directing lending toward one segment over another. There’s already too much thumb on the scale in this sector,” commented Raj Prabhu, CEO at Mercom Capital Group.

“Sophisticated lenders are expected to conduct proper due diligence and price the risk of each segment based on fundamentals and demand-supply realities. The market rewards good underwriting with attractive returns and will punish poor decisions with bad loans.

If investment decisions are routinely ‘guided’ from the top or shaped by factions with their own interests, you end up with misallocation and poor outcomes. Government should focus on providing clear policy direction, long-term demand visibility, and targeted incentives to accelerate innovation towards building critical domestic supply chains,” added Prabhu.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-11-26T181504.817.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 02:00:33.852707

According to project documents seen by this newspaper, the exploration activities are expected to be conducted over a three-year period, commencing January 1, 2026 to 2028. The seismic works are earmarked for three sites, measuring a total of 25,604.78 square kilometers or almost the size of the Stabroek Block, operated by ExxonMobil.

Seismic surveys are routinely used in offshore oil and gas exploration activities worldwide to detect and define geological structures under the seabed.

An application for the initial oil exploration works was made by CGG, an affiliate company of the Viridien group. Viridien is a global advanced technology, digital and Earth data company that provides a comprehensive range of data, products, services and solutions for complex digital, energy transition, natural resource, environmental and infrastructure challenges. In addition to proprietary offshore projects for clients such as Exxon, which discovered the successful Liza field from CGG data, CGG acquired the only two offshore multi-client projects available for licensing in Guyana (Stabroek Phase 1 & 2).

Regionally, CGG recently completed a multi-client project in Suriname in 2023. Covering 1,800 sq km, Phase IV completed the programmed 14,500 sq km survey of newly acquired 3D data in deep and shallow water in the Guyana-Suriname basin.

On 11 November 2025, CGG applied for an Environmental Authorisation to the EPA, seeking to conduct geophysical 3D surveys within shallow waters offshore of Guyana. The areas for the shallow water survey are outlined on a map attached.

The survey area is offshore of Guyana, east of the border of Venezuela and west of the border of Suriname. The closest shore distance is around 120 km away and ranges with water depths approximately 10 to 70 metres deep.

According to the Project Summary, a research vessel with a towed streamer will be used for the seismic acquisition. Towed streamer 3D seismic acquisition allows for the efficient and comprehensive mapping of offshore geological formations, providing valuable insights for oil and gas exploration and production activities.

“This is a common method used to gather detailed subsurface geological information in offshore exploration for oil and gas. CGG currently plans to use the BGP Prospector for this project.”

The company noted that the vessel is fully furnished with state-of-the-art equipment for seismic 3D surveys.

Kaieteur News understands that the activities will be conducted in a total of eight phases beginning with setup and deployment, data acquisition and closing with data processing and interpretation.

Impacts associated with the planned development includes marine noise, marine water quality and climate, fishing and marine traffic disruptions among others.

Marine seismic data acquisition is based on the principle of ‘seismic reflection’. The method involves releasing pulses of acoustic energy (i.e., sound waves) at regular intervals along designated transect lines. In general, the energy penetrates subsurface formations and is reflected back to the surface where it can be detected by acoustic receivers, or hydrophones, encased in a long cable (i.e., streamer), which is towed behind the seismic vessel. Each time a seismic pulse meets a change in rock properties; part of the pulse is reflected back to the surface and received by the hydrophones. Consequently, by measuring precisely the difference in arrival time of reflected seismic energy, distinct subsurface rock layers can be identified, and subsequently mapped. This map helps geoscientists understand the geology and structure of natural resources. It plays an integral role in decision making when exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves in ocean waters.

No EIA

The EPA in a decision published on its website explained that the developer will not be required to conduct an EIA for the three-year seismic activities. The regulator listed three reasons for its decision but indicated that the project has not yet been approved.

The Agency said, “The impacts are transient. The acoustic disturbance moves continuously with the vessel and does not result in permanent habitat alteration or permanent presence.”

Additionally, it noted that “potential biological and socio-economic disruptions are reversible immediately upon cessation of the activity; (meanwhile) impacts related to vessel operation, routine discharges, and resource consumption are standard for offshore activities and are adequately mitigated by compliance with international conventions (e.g., MARPOL) and the proposed EMP.”

Monash Science 2025: Breakthroughs shaping a cleaner, safer and smarter future

2025 has been a defining year for Monash Science a year where curiosity ignited innovation, and ideas turned into national and global impact.

From rewriting humanity’s cosmic origin story to engineering virus cocktails that combat superbugs, Monash scientists are advancing solutions to some of the world’s most urgent challenges.

We’ve launched a new Climate Change Science Hub, welcomed a Sustainable Development Education team into the Faculty, and celebrated record-breaking success across Australia’s most competitive research funding schemes.

Our students have even reached for the stratosphere, literally, sending a telescope balloon skyward to explore the Sun.

At Monash Science, we don’t just observe the future, we build it.

Commenting on the year’s achievements Monash Science Deputy Dean Research Professor Katya Pas said:

“Our researchers are addressing the world’s most urgent challenges with imagination, precision, and fearlessness.

“Innovation isn’t just a metric here, it’s our mindset.”

Transforming the planet’s future

Breakthrough hydrogen technologies

Green hydrogen is a cornerstone of a decarbonised future but to deliver it at scale, we must dramatically reduce the cost of production. In a major advancement, Monash science researchers uncovered the fundamental science that could unlock cheaper, more efficient methods for hydrogen generation using abundant materials. This research lays vital groundwork for the clean energy revolution that will fuel industries and economies of tomorrow.

Seaweed secrets rewriting climate models

Kelp forests and marine algae are some of the planet’s most powerful and underestimated climate engineers. Monash scientists revealed the unseen chemical and biological processes shaping how seaweed interacts with the Earth system. Their findings could significantly improve the accuracy of global climate models and guide more effective ocean-based climate solutions.

Caution in ‘green’ fertilisers

As industries push for cleaner agriculture, new ‘green’ fertiliser technologies have surged to market but not all claims stack up. Monash chemists are leading global calls for rigorous testing to prevent unintended environmental harm from poorly understood nitrogen-conversion technologies. Their work ensures climate progress doesn’t come at the cost of soil, waterways or biodiversity.

Packaging and catalysis innovation leading national ARC success

From next-generation catalysts that reduce industrial emissions to packaging that is smarter, stronger and more circular, Monash Science researchers secured national leadership in the ARC Linkage funding round. These projects represent breakthrough solutions that will help industries transition to more sustainable manufacturing systems while preserving global food security.

Protecting health and life

Virus cocktails vs superbugs

Antibiotic resistance is escalating into one of humanity’s most dangerous health threats. Monash scientists developed a virus phage cocktail capable of targeting drug-resistant bacteria. This precision approach could deliver a lifeline in cases where antibiotics fail, marking a major leap toward the clinic.

New genetic code advances mRNA medicine

Behind every breakthrough therapy lies the molecular machinery that powers it. Researchers at Monash have identified a previously unknown layer of genetic coding that steers mRNA behaviour. With this discovery, the future of personalised medicine, including targeted treatments for cancer and rare disease, is one giant step closer.

Snakes striking faster than thought possible

How do venomous snakes launch deadly strikes faster than the human eye can track? Using high-speed imaging systems, Monash biologists captured the physics of these lightning-fast movements, insights that could improve antivenom design and inform emergency response strategies in regions where snakebite remains fatal.:

Understanding our planet above and below

Predicting the next megaquake

Deep beneath our feet, massive tectonic forces are at play and Monash geoscientists are decoding them. New modelling reveals where the next catastrophic earthquake could erupt across Southeast Asia, equipping governments and communities with critical foresight to reduce risk and improve resilience.

Students chasing sunlight at the edge of space

What happens when Monash Science students look to the sky? They build a solar telescope and send it into the stratosphere. This student-led mission is more than an experiment — it’s a launchpad for Australia’s next generation of space scientists and engineers.

Rewriting the laws of nature

Quantum particles act like social creatures

Defying expectations, Monash physicists discovered that photons can interact like cooperative agents rather than isolated particles. This behaviour — observed in cutting-edge quantum systems — could usher in more stable and powerful quantum computing architectures.

Binary stars everywhere

Our astronomers helped reveal that binary star systems — pairs of stars bound in orbit — are far more common than previously believed. This breakthrough reshapes how we understand stellar evolution and the origins of planets like our own.

Influencing the Nobel landscape

Monash crystallography research stood behind one of the world’s most prestigious recognitions — contributing to the discoveries honoured in the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. It’s a powerful reminder that foundational science shapes global triumphs.

Celebrating research excellence

A powerhouse year of Australian Research Council success strengthened Monash’s position as a national leader in discovery:

$11M+ in ARC Discovery funding for transformative research that expands human knowledge

DECRA funding nearly tripled, supporting five emerging stars as they tackle frontier science

Five ARC Future Fellows — with women leading the way in scientific leadership

Monash mathematician named Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, joining the global elite in mathematical research

Together, these achievements reflect a research culture defined by ambition, excellence and impact.

Accelerating climate solutions

This year, we launched the Climate Change Science Hub, a new interdisciplinary engine room accelerating climate research across ecosystems, oceans, policy, and planetary systems science. It cements Monash as a major contributor to solving the world’s defining environmental challenge.

We also welcomed a new Sustainable Development Education team, strengthening our capacity to equip future leaders with the scientific and systems expertise needed for a decarbonised and resilient world.",https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/image/0005/4189901/katya-pas_690x435.jpeg,N,,2025-12-15 02:00:38.308320

What, then, should GM workers do to oppose the impending layoffs?","Autoworkers: Take up the fight against layoffs! Fill out the form at the end of this article to speak out against layoffs and learn more about joining the Autoworkers Rank-and-File Committee.

Unless it is halted by collective action by workers themselves, the coming week could be the last for 1,145 workers at the General Motors Factory Zero assembly plant in Detroit. The automaker plans to slash production to a single shift beginning January 5, 2026. The permanent layoffs are being imposed on the eve of the holiday shutdown, which runs from December 24 through January 4, leaving workers to face unemployment and the loss of healthcare during the most financially precarious time of the year.

The job cuts follow a brutal year in which Factory Zero workers were subjected to extreme levels of overtime, routinely working between 72 and 80 hours a week for much of 2024. These conditions were followed by irregular temporary layoffs, creating a cycle of exhaustion and insecurity. Both shifts were placed on temporary layoff until November 24, 2025, before GM announced the move to permanently eliminate more than 1,000 jobs.

The United Auto Workers bureaucracy has not even made a pretense of opposing the mass layoffs, which will only deepen the social crisis in the city which houses the headquarters of both GM and the UAW. The official poverty rate in the Motor City is already 35 percent, with 51 percent of children living in poverty, according to the census report.

In the statement “Mobilize to stop GM layoffs at Factory Zero in Detroit—Build rank-and-file committees,” the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees (IWA-RFC) has called on workers to form independent committees capable of organizing a real fight, unifying workers across plants and borders and breaking out of the isolation imposed by the union bureaucracy. Only the mass, collective action by workers can stop the layoffs and fight for the right to secure, good-paying jobs for all.

The layoffs are not the result of any financial losses for GM. In October, the company raised its projected 2025 net profits to between $12 billion and $13 billion, up from a prior estimate of $10 billion to $12.5 billion. This followed record profits of $14.9 billion in 2024. GM stock has risen approximately 55 percent over the past year.

According to an investor note published December 12 on the financial website Trevis, “In the last decade, General Motors (GM) stock has returned $45 [billion] back to its shareholders through cold, hard cash via dividends and buybacks.” This represents 58.4 percent of GM’s current market capitalization—more than double the median payout ratio for companies listed on the S&P 500.

GM is also indefinitely laying off 550 workers at the Lordstown, Ohio Ultium Cells battery plant. An additional 850 workers there will be placed on temporary layoff effective January 5. And 710 workers will be temporarily laid off at the Spring Hill, Tennessee Ultium Cells battery plant beginning the same day.

Hundreds of workers at the nearby Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, also remain on layoff, with company executives considering whether to scrap the F-150 Lightning EV pickup truck altogether.

This is part of a global jobs massacre in the auto industry. VW, Bosch, ZF and other German auto and auto parts companies have announced 50,000 job cuts in the first 10 months of 2025 alone.

Together, these cuts expose the fraudulent character of the claims by the automakers and the UAW that the electric vehicle transition would bring stable, high-quality jobs.

A young worker who was laid off from Factory Zero several months ago told the World Socialist Web Site that he had heard through the “rumor mill” that the GM Lake Orion plant—which has been closed for retooling for two years—could ramp up or resume production in the third quarter of 2026. The facility is currently being reconverted back to internal combustion engine production, after earlier being tooled for electric vehicles at enormous cost.

“When I was at Factory Zero, I think I was, for the first year, working 12-hour shifts,” he said. After being laid off for at least the second time in just a few years at GM, “I lost my healthcare. The Affordable Care Act subsidy is probably not going to be continuing next year, so it will be really tough for some of us.”

He described the complete lack of information from the United Auto Workers. “One of my buddies was like, ‘don’t really expect much from the local.’ I don’t think any of the people involved in working in the union actually know what’s going on … there’s just a lot of uncertainty.”

Contrasting the company’s soaring profits with the conditions facing workers, he said, “The stock price of the company keeps going up and up.” He noted that GM and other automakers had received massive tax cuts. “I thought the whole point of trickle down was for the money to trickle down. Stock prices are going up, and it’s not trickling down.”

He added that there had to be a way to “tax people that are getting rich off of stock buybacks” and said younger workers were increasingly alienated from both corporate-backed parties. “My generation, we are just tired; and we’ve only been doing the adult thing for a few years now. There has not been a single good president in my lifetime … we’re looking for an alternative.”

Anger over the union’s complicity is widespread. A veteran worker at the Stellantis Toledo Assembly Plant told the WSWS, “The union just doesn’t back the people. We had this ‘Stand Up’ strike [in 2023], and Jeep was one of the few plants that were called out. That was stupid. We should all have been out at the same time.

“The union gives in to the company so much. There’s never a 40-hour week. It’s like my life is Jeep. You can’t plan anything for your family. We’ve got more than 1,000 guys on layoff, and they don’t want to go back to three shifts. That’s why we’re working all these hours, and guys are getting hurt.

“When I first hired in there in the late 1990s the union was still strong. But, man, how things have changed.” He voted against the 2009 concessions, explaining, “I wasn’t going to give up anything.

“I pay $100 to the UAW every month,” he said. “I don’t call it union dues anymore. I call it medical insurance. That’s the way you have to look at it, because it’s gotten so bad, and it’s just going to get worse.”

He pointed to the vast VEBA (Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association) retiree healthcare trust as a source of corruption. “There’s enough in there to take care of great, great grandchildren.” He said second-tier workers, who do not get pensions and retiree healthcare, constitute more than half the workers at Stellantis. “When we workers with pensions die off, the UAW and the company are going to dip into that money for themselves. You follow the money, and you’re going to see the corruption. It’s billions and billions, and it’s going up every month.”

On the rank-and-file campaign of Will Lehman for UAW president in 2022, he said simply, “It was great, great, great. I voted for him because he was rank and file and was trying to get the people on the shop floors together. It’s hard but that’s what we have to do.”

The worker also expressed anger over Trump’s witch-hunting of immigrant workers and war threats against Venezuela. “I’m against them blowing up fishing boats and killing people. They don’t even know what cargo they had.”

Hundreds of thousands of workers have viewed WSWS videos featuring Factory Zero workers, reflecting the depth of opposition. Online comments echo the same concerns. One worker wrote on Reddit, “GM is going to transfer the laid off workers to St. Louis or Texas and 90% will decline, resulting in being fired and disqualified from unemployment.”

Another asked, “Should we just call jobs in the automotive industry temp jobs from now on?”

Responding to a discussion of the UAW’s role, one worker explained, “Because the UAW and Shawn Fain supported Trump, and the reason this plant is closing is because Trump removed the EV tax credit essentially killing demand for EVs … and the UAW didn’t do anything to fight against those policies.”

The layoffs at Factory Zero are the predictable outcome of capitalist restructuring driven by investor demands, automation and profit maximization. Under capitalism, workers’ livelihoods are subordinated entirely to Wall Street.

The role of the UAW apparatus has been to facilitate this process. By refusing to mobilize the membership and by backing nationalist policies that divide workers by country and plant, the bureaucracy has functioned as an arm of corporate management.

What, then, should GM workers do to oppose the impending layoffs?

Asked this question Socialism AI, the new chatbox launched by the World Socialist Web Site, emphasized that workers cannot rely on appeals to management or the union leadership. The defense of jobs requires independent, democratic organization on the shop floor.

Rank-and-file committees, formed by trusted workers in every department and shift, must take control of the struggle, demand an immediate halt to layoffs, and fight for full pay and benefits for all affected workers.

Such committees would unify workers across plants and industries, prepare collective action—including strikes and mass protests—and link Factory Zero workers with autoworkers nationally and internationally through the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees (IWA-RFC). Only by breaking from the nationalism promoted by the UAW apparatus and advancing an internationalist perspective can workers counter the global auto industry’s restructuring strategy.

The fight to defend jobs at Factory Zero raises fundamental political questions. It is not simply a dispute with one company but a confrontation with the capitalist system itself that sacrifices workers’ lives and livelihoods for private profit. The transformation of the auto industry—automation, EV production and technological change—must be placed under democratic workers’ control and reorganized to meet social needs, not the further enrichment of wealthy shareholders.

The impending layoffs at Factory Zero are a warning. They demonstrate that without independent organization and collective action workers will continue to pay the price for the capitalist crisis. The growing anger among autoworkers points to the possibility of a broader movement—one that links the defense of jobs to the fight for political independence of the working class and the reorganization of society on socialist foundations.

“We need resources that can provide that energy for extended periods during these cold weather events,” Olson said.
Electric utilities have plans to build enough new power resources to make the grid reliable.","If the Northwest has a long cold snap, it may not have enough electricity, a consultant hired by utilities said.

Up to now, the region has had enough power to meet extraordinary demand. But the surplus is expected to turn into a deficit in 2026, E3 senior partner Arne Olson told the Washington Senate Environment, Energy and Technology Committee on Dec. 5.

Power plants that provide “firm” electricity, such as coal plants, are being shut down. Almost all new power plants are intermittent wind and solar installations, he said.

Windmills and solar panels make only a small contribution to grid reliability in cold snaps, according to Olson. Batteries typically supply power for only four hours, he said.

“If you have an event that lasts three or four days, the four hours is really not that helpful,” Olson said.

Two-part study

Public and investor-owned utilities in Washington and Oregon hired San Francisco-based E3 (stands for Energy and Environmental Economics) to do a two-part study.

The first part evaluated the grid’s reliability. The second part, still to come, will suggest ways to make the grid more reliable.

E3 projects the grid will become increasingly short of enough power to meet peak demands. The demand for electricity will grow, but the supply will shrink, according to figures compiled by E3.

“When I read this report, I had a hard time sleeping,” said the committee’s chairwoman, Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham.

Hydropower dams are a defense against power outages.

“If it’s a wet year, we are fine. If it’s a very, very dry year, and we have a cold snap, that’s when we have the biggest problems,” Olson said.

Demand accelerating

Data centers, electric vehicles and manufacturing are expected to accelerate demand.

Meanwhile, Washington’s clean-energy law commands electric utilities to get off fossil fuels by 2045. The state’s last coal plant is scheduled to close at the end of this year.

Wind, solar and batteries make up almost all new resources. As a result, the region will have less electricity available to meet peak demands. E3 projects the shortfall will grow to 8,600 megawatts by 2030.

“We need resources that can provide that energy for extended periods during these cold weather events,” Olson said.

“We’re replacing resources, but we’re not replacing them in-kind,” he said. “We are actually losing capacity, rather than gaining it over the last seven years.

“In the future, we’ll be looking at emerging technologies, such as geothermal or nuclear or long-duration storage that also may be able to help, but those aren’t available today,” Olson said.

Electric utilities have plans to build enough new power resources to make the grid reliable. But to keep up, they will have to pick up the pace, and it’s hard to get anything build, Olson said.

“More than has been built in the last 25 years has to be built in the next five years,” Olson said. “It’s very challenging to think we can get this amount of power developed over the next five years.”",https://chinookobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/BPA-lines.jpg?w=1024,N,,2025-12-14 23:57:44.895393

The move comes as a litany of energy-rich nations aim to decarbonize the fuel production market in their nations to provide cleaner energy resources for the downstream market.

Repsol plans to enable its Tarragona Ecoplanta to deliver vast amounts of fuels that will boost the downstream market

The company has noted that it plans to invest up to €800 million in the Tarragona Ecoplanta, which will be capable of producing vast amounts of methanol and renewable gasoline and diesel through the conversion of urban waste into energy resources. The project will be the first of its kind in Europe, and exemplifies the need to produce cleaner fuels for the industrial, shipping, and transport industries.

The project will boost the regional clean fuel operations as Spain, along with the rest of the world, aims to decarbonize the fuel market to meet stringent clean energy and emission targets by the end of the decade. Repsol has noted that the project will create up to 2,800 jobs during the construction phase, and will provide a further 340 jobs once the pioneering plant begins operations.

“Ecoplanta will strongly contribute to achieving the ambitious waste management objectives for the 2030-2035 horizon. Together with the improvement of selective collection, anaerobic digestion, and mechanical and chemical recycling, it will make it possible to achieve the recycling objectives and minimize the disposal of waste in landfills and incineration, as well as the improvements that this reduction in the use of landfills represents for the environment.” – Repsol statement on the Tarragona Ecoplanta

The project has received funds from the Innovation Fund of the European Union

Notably, the Tarragona Ecoplanta conversion of urban waste into methanol, renewable diesel, and gasoline will leverage Repsol’s already impressive infrastructure in the region. Repsol’s board of directors recently gave its approval for the project to move forward after it was selected by the Innovation Fund of the European Union due to its ability to drastically reduce emissions from methanol and renewable diesel production.

Reducing emissions in the transport sector has become a top priority for the international market, and Repsol’s pioneering Ecoplanta in Tarragona, Catalonia, will need an astonishing €800 million to begin operations, which Repsol is aiming for by 2029 at the very latest. Repsol’s plant will be able to process up to 400,000 tons of municipal solid waste annually, which it will then convert into 240,000 tons of renewable fuels such as diesel and gasoline.

The announcement of the project comes as the European Commission has recently unveiled a new plan to reinforce the EU’s chemical sector, paving the way for significant change in the regional energy market.

Repsol is aiming to become the market leader in clean and renewable fuel production

Repsol’s pioneering €800 million investment in the Tarragona Ecoplanta will completely reshape the downstream market as the world aims to diversify fuel production and reduce emissions from the transport sector overall. With Spain aiming to foster investments in hydrogen as a fuel source, the sentiment for clean fuel production in the nation has become all too clear. Repsol’s already impressive portfolio has positioned the company as a market leader that is not afraid to shake things up in the downstream sector, and add to that the pioneering Tarragona Ecoplanta project, and the future of clean fuel production in Spain is looking good.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/49.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 23:57:47.849652

The clean energy industry is experiencing a significant transformation, fueled by increased capital flow, evolving regulations, and the development of advanced trading platforms. With global electricity consumption expected to rise by 4.5% in 2025, the demand for robust, transparent systems to facilitate energy transactions is more pressing than ever. Leading this shift is REsurety's CleanTrade, a Swap Execution Facility (SEF) recognized by the CFTC, which has quickly established itself as a key player in clean energy market liquidity. This article explores how investments in regulated clean energy marketplaces are creating new possibilities for institutional investors, ESG-focused funds, and corporate energy purchasers.

Liquidity in Clean Energy: Financing Growth in a Dynamic Market

In 2025, the clean energy lending sector saw remarkable expansion, with project finance debt increasing by 7.6% in the first half of the year compared to 2024. This surge is attributed to several factors: accelerating electrification, strong investor appetite for ESG-compliant assets, and incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). For example, large-scale solar and wind projects with full contracts now obtain construction loans at spreads of just 150 basis points over SOFR, a significant improvement over the 300–1,000 basis points required for newer technologies or less established sponsors.

The real driver of liquidity, however, is the emergence of virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) trading platforms. Since its launch in September 2025, REsurety's CleanTrade has exemplified this trend. Within just two months, the platform facilitated $16 billion in notional value ready for trading, streamlining the process for energy derivatives and enabling institutional investors to manage price risk while supporting ESG objectives. CleanTrade’s transparent, regulated marketplace for financially settled clean energy contracts fills a crucial gap in market infrastructure, reducing counterparty risk and improving overall efficiency.

Regulatory Shifts: Challenges and New Pathways

The regulatory landscape for clean energy is becoming more intricate. The U.S. CFTC’s approval of CleanTrade has set a new benchmark for compliance and transparency in VPPA trading. Yet, recent amendments to the IRA—specifically through the Budget Reconciliation Bill—have introduced fresh hurdles. These changes have modified tax credit qualifications and imposed Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions starting in 2026, leading to a 4% average increase in the cost of U.S. wind and solar PPAs. As a result, developers and buyers are prioritizing projects with earlier completion dates to maximize IRA benefits.

At the same time, international regulators are tightening rules around renewable energy claims. For instance, updated European standards now exclude certain countries from renewable energy eligibility, complicating cross-border PPA arrangements. These developments highlight the need for flexible contract structures, with VPPA buyers increasingly adding clauses to comply with evolving frameworks such as the GHG Protocol and the RE100 initiative.

Strategic Considerations for Investors and Corporations

For institutional investors and ESG fund managers, platforms like CleanTrade open new channels for deploying capital. By standardizing VPPA derivatives, CleanTrade simplifies project financing and allows investors to diversify across different regions and technologies. This is particularly important as global investment in clean energy reached $2.2 trillion in 2025, with solar and wind leading new capacity additions.

Corporations are also leveraging VPPA platforms to manage price fluctuations. Settlement Swap Agreements (SSAs), which transfer wholesale power price risk to third parties while preserving the environmental benefits of renewable energy certificates (RECs), are gaining popularity. For companies committed to net-zero targets, SSAs provide financial predictability without sacrificing sustainability—a crucial advantage as regulatory and market standards become more stringent.

Looking Ahead: Building the Future of Clean Energy

The intersection of regulatory certainty, technological progress, and strong investor interest is reshaping the clean energy sector. REsurety's CleanTrade is more than just a trading platform—it is a foundational infrastructure that addresses the sector’s needs for liquidity, transparency, and risk management. As electricity demand continues to climb and regulatory frameworks evolve, investing in well-governed marketplaces will be vital to unlocking the full potential of clean energy. For institutional investors, ESG managers, and corporate buyers, the path forward is clear: the future of clean energy depends on platforms that seamlessly integrate financial performance with environmental responsibility.",https://img.bgstatic.com/video/open_graph_new.png,N,,2025-12-15 00:58:47.758997

On former rice fields in the country’s southwest, a hulking, X-shaped building is being built with equal urgency under great secrecy. That facility’s existence wasn’t widely known until researchers spotted it in satellite images a year or so ago.

Together, the colossal projects are China’s most ambitious efforts yet to harness an energy source that could transform civilization: fusion.

Fusion, the melding together of atoms to release extraordinary energy, uses fuels that are plentiful, carries no risk of meltdowns and leaves no long-lived radioactive waste. It promises near-limitless energy that might not only satisfy the surging demand for electricity to power artificial intelligence but also end reliance on the fossil fuels that are perilously overheating the planet.

Scientists first mused a century ago about fusion, the energy of the stars. In recent decades, they have made major strides toward reproducing the process in the laboratory using magnets and lasers. Yet forcing unruly atoms to combine is vastly more difficult than splitting them, as in the fission process that produces nuclear power today.

A fusion reactor must first heat hydrogen to temperatures hotter than the sun, turning it into plasma, the fourth state of matter. Then it needs to hold this violent plasma together for long enough that the atoms fuse and disgorge energy. China, the United States and other countries are now racing to develop the machines that can pull all this off and survive to do it again and again, reliably enough to power a grid.

The world’s two superpowers are in a tightening contest to dominate the energy future. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. is intent on producing oil, gas and coal and selling it abroad. Its chief economic rival, China, has become the world’s dominant supplier of clean energy in the form of solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles.

Fusion could change the calculus for both nations and the globe. Whoever conquers it could build plants around the world and forge new alliances with energy-hungry countries. But the Americans and the Chinese have very different strategies for getting there.

The United States is counting on private industry and American innovation to deliver results, with government agencies providing targeted support. From coast to coast, a fleet of start-ups has brought new urgency and ingenuity to the quest.

On the other side of the world, China’s government has made fusion a national priority, marshaling resources at daunting speed. Recently, a Shanghai start-up essentially matched an engineering breakthrough by America’s best-funded fusion company, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, in much less time. Over the summer, the Chinese government and private investors poured $2.1 billion into a new state-owned fusion company. That investment alone is two and a half times the U.S. Energy Department’s annual fusion budget.

The two countries’ progress could soon be tested head-to-head.

Commonwealth says that by 2027, the experimental device it is building in Massachusetts will pull off a key feat: producing more energy than it takes to run. That would be a signal that fusion could someday generate electricity for data centers, steel mills and more.

China’s leading plasma-physics lab is aiming for its new machine, which has the modest name of BEST and will sit in the twin-armed building in the country’s east, to cross that milestone in the next few years, too.

“It’s a very tight schedule,” said Lian Hui, a scientist at the lab. Even so, “we are very confident we will be able to achieve BEST’s research goals,” he said.

A National Priority

China’s commitment to science, and fusion, comes from the very top.

The government’s new five-year plan, covering 2026 through 2030, promises “extraordinary measures” to secure breakthroughs in fusion energy and other areas. China’s state-owned nuclear company is preparing detailed fusion research proposals, calling it “the main racetrack in future scientific and technological competition among the great powers.”

The country was a minnow in fusion only two decades ago, and it grew by teaming up with other nations. It worked closely with France to develop its most modern tokamak, a type of doughnut-shaped fusion machine. It became a key contributor to the 33-nation ITER fusion experiment (pronounced “eater”). During much of the past decade, American and Chinese researchers conducted joint experiments and extolled their nations’ “long-term friendship” in plasma physics.

Now, Chinese labs and companies are pouring concrete for cutting-edge research facilities of their own. The Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Plasma Physics is building both the new BEST tokamak and a 100-acre complex nearby where researchers will develop and test components to operate under the extreme conditions of a fusion device. Scientists there are also sketching out another tokamak that would power a pilot fusion plant in the 2030s and ’40s.

Richard Pitts, a British-French physicist at ITER, visited the BEST site in January last year, when it was little more than an empty platform. Today, it’s half finished.

China has learned a great deal from being part of ITER, and now it is applying that knowledge to make its own advances, Dr. Pitts said. “Every time I go there, I’m taken aback by the sheer numbers of people and the sheer efficiency with which things get done,” he said.

Even if the core technology works, however, fusion reactors won’t power the world until companies figure out how to build and operate them affordably and at industrial scale.

And on that front, China’s expertise in engineering and construction gives it a distinct advantage, said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior fellow at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation. “The risk for the United States is we create a viable technical pathway first, but then China engineers and scales it up before we can,” Mr. Goodrich said.

The Laser Path

In the southwest, another front in China’s fusion ambitions is racing ahead with much less public fanfare.

Scientists at the China Academy of Engineering Physics, in Sichuan Province, studied attentively as their counterparts at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California toiled for years before achieving a tantalizing demonstration of fusion’s potential. In late 2022, the lab’s lasers caused a pellet of hydrogen to “ignite,” meaning the reaction produced more energy than the energy from the lasers.

A senior scientist at China’s academy quickly called for his country to follow suit.

Livermore’s achievement marked “a major scientific breakthrough that will be memorialized in the annals of human history,” Zheng Wanguo said in an interview in early 2023. China, he said, should “strengthen investment and research” in fusion energy, “taking laser fusion ignition as the main technical approach.”

Within a year and a half, an enormous X-shaped facility had arisen outside the city of Mianyang.

Chinese laser industry reports, scientific papers and a patent application suggest the site will house Shenguang IV, a new laser ignition facility. Proposals for such a facility, whose name means “Divine Light,” go back in some form over 15 years. But the Livermore lab’s success seemed to put it on the fast track.

The speed of construction in Mianyang is “breathtaking,” said Livermore’s director, Kimberly Budil, given that it took her lab 20 years to build its ignition facility and get it fully running. Still, “operating that system reliably and effectively over time takes meaningful skills, and these are all lessons China will have to learn along the way,” Dr. Budil said.

Scientists at the China Academy of Engineering Physics have reason for secrecy. Like many at Livermore, they work in nuclear weapons research, and laser fusion offers a way to study the conditions of nuclear explosions without detonating actual weapons.

As China’s nuclear stockpile has grown rapidly under the country’s top leader, Xi Jinping, its military has looked for ways to maintain and perhaps upgrade warheads without violating a global ban on test explosions, experts say.

In recent months, the Academy of Engineering Physics has revealed plans to build another laser ignition facility in Chengdu, Sichuan’s provincial capital — a smaller, more commercial sibling to the one in Mianyang.

And Peng Xianjue, once an anonymous weapons designer, has transformed himself into an energy entrepreneur, promoting his vision of an untested type of reactor that would combine fusion and fission. China, Dr. Peng wrote in a proposal this year, should “aim for commercial application by 2040.”

The reason, according to the department, is that American start-ups are already moving quickly toward erecting such a plant.

To some scientists, the U.S. government needs to do more.

Investors have poured about $14 billion into fusion companies worldwide, with $7.6 billion of that going to American firms. “That’s a lot of money, but it’s going to take a whole lot more of that to get this across the finish line,” said George Tynan, a plasma scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Chang Liu worked for years as a physicist at the Energy Department’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Recently, Dr. Liu tried to recruit some younger scientists for his team, but the lab said it didn’t have the budget, he said. Experiences like this, plus family reasons, led him to move to Peking University, one of China’s best. A Princeton spokeswoman said the lab didn’t comment on personnel matters.

In America, the lack of government support is one reason so many fusion researchers are joining start-ups, Dr. Liu said.

Chinese officials, by contrast, are putting significant resources into a possible “ultimate solution” to humankind’s energy needs, he said. “They can really invest in things that are important,” he said.

Does Texas Pacific Land’s (TPL) Stock Split Strategy Reveal a Shift in Its Long-Term Playbook?

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Sasha Jovanovic

December 14, 2025

Texas Pacific Land Corporation has already amended its certificate of incorporation to enable a three-for-one stock split, increasing authorized common shares from 46,536,936 to 139,610,808 effective December 22, 2025.

This stock split, combined with fresh analyst coverage and ongoing interest from a major shareholder, could reshape how investors think about TPL’s liquidity and long-term positioning.

We’ll now explore how the three-for-one stock split and higher authorized share count interact with Texas Pacific Land’s existing investment narrative.

Texas Pacific Land Investment Narrative Recap

To own Texas Pacific Land, you generally need to believe in the long-term value of its Permian Basin land, royalty streams and growing water services business, even after a year of weaker share price performance. The three-for-one stock split and higher authorized share count primarily affect trading mechanics and liquidity, and do not materially change the near term earnings outlook or the key risk that revenue growth slows relative to expectations.

The most relevant recent announcement here is the stock split itself, which triples the number of shares outstanding without changing the company’s overall market value. For investors focused on catalysts like continued royalty and water services growth, the split mainly matters if improved liquidity and a lower per share price widen the potential shareholder base and sharpen market attention on how TPL executes from here.

Yet investors should be aware of how any slowdown in royalty production growth could affect...

Texas Pacific Land's narrative projects $895.3 million revenue and $610.3 million earnings by 2028. This requires 7.2% yearly revenue growth and about a $150.1 million increase in earnings from $460.2 million today.

, in line with its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Thirteen members of the Simply Wall St Community currently estimate TPL’s fair value between about US$402 and US$1,791, showing very different expectations. When you set that against the company’s focus on expanding water services as a second growth engine, it underlines how important it is to compare several viewpoints before deciding how TPL might fit into your portfolio.

- why the stock might be worth less than half the current price!

Most of data centers’ electricity usage is split between operating and cooling massive IT servers.","ANDERSON — Concerns about rising energy costs and the coming of data centers that guzzle water and electricity are driving legislation in the Indiana General Assembly.

According to data from the Citizens Action Coalition, Hoosiers’ electric bills have risen 17.5% within the past year.

That coupled with Gov. Mike Braun telling the Indianapolis Investment Forum in May that the state doesn’t have enough energy to meet the evergrowing demand for electricity has prompted concern from legislators.

During the 2025 session, which was completed early this year, the General Assembly passed legislation to encourage the use of small modular nuclear reactors, to the dismay of some clean energy advocates.

Representatives of the Indiana Conservative Alliance for Energy said they support the development of SMRs, but they noted that state officials shouldn’t overlook incentivizing alternatives such as wind and solar power. “We view current available advanced energy: solar, wind, battery storage as lowhanging fruit,” said Hunter Jones, executive director of the alliance. “The goal is to get electrons on the grid.” Many communities throughout the state have opposed the siting of wind and solar projects. Roughly 80% of Indiana’s 92 Indiana counties have moratoriums on such projects.

Jones feels the opposition is unwarranted — solar and wind energy would reduce costs in the immediate future, whereas SMRs could take decades of development before economic benefits would arise.

“Education and messaging in those communities (that oppose solar and wind projects) could be a lot better,” Jones said. “A lot of the advancements that have been made in the past decade are not the same solar and wind residents have in their mind.”

He also said the state should look into allowing residents to generate power with plug-in balcony solar panels.

In March, the Utah State Legislature passed a law allowing residents to use such devices to generate up to 1.2 kilowatts, enough to power blenders and other light-use appliances, without obtaining a permit or connecting with a utility. These panels cost less than $2,000.

Sam Carpenter, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, said the panels would pay for themselves within 4-5 years.

Indiana Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, has decided to follow a similar path with Senate Bill 74, which had its first reading Monday.

Plug-in solar panels don’t “need a requirement for utility interconnection, and that’s why they require legislation. The legislation also includes safety standards,” Carpenter said.

State officials could also change how electric bills are calculated.

The Indiana General Assembly’s Utilities Committee recently discussed the possibility of establishing a performance-based electricity pay rate, where a utility would be compensated at a rate based on the reliability and efficiency of the utility and its equipment.

Rates are traditionally calculated based on the utility’s cost of service — in other words, rates are increased or decreased to cover the cost of service.

Jones believes the idea has promise, though Carpenter said there are still too many variables that are unknown.

DATA CENTER CONCERNS

In several communities, Hoosiers have recently voiced concerns about water and electricity usage of data centers. According to the website Data Center Map, 80 data centers are either already built or in development in Indiana.

Most of data centers’ electricity usage is split between operating and cooling massive IT servers.

According to the Hoosier Environmental Council, Amazon’s Northwest Indiana data center project is expected to require 2.2 gigawatts of electricity at peak operating times, enough to power about half of the state’s households.

Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, has authored Senate Bill 79, which would require developers to disclose the amount of water and electricity a data center is expected to use before a permit can be issued.

The bill would also require data centers to report quarterly use of water and electricity to a working group that would include representatives of electricity suppliers, the data center industry, and representatives of the regional transmission organization in Indiana.

The working group would attempt to forecast the data center industry’s future in the state and submit its findings to the director of the state’s legislative services agency no later than Oct. 26, 2026.

A large data center could use at least five million gallons of water per day, the equivalent needed to serve a population of 50,000 people.

The River Ridge Commerce Center in Jeffersonville will house a Meta data center. Its power plant could treat up to 12 million gallons of water a day, the organization’s chief director, Wendy Dant Chesser, said in a Jeffersonville News and Tribune article.

The Meta data center is expected to be operational in 2026.

Such high volumes of need could strain existing water utilities, so Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville, is hoping fellow legislators will take action to protect Indiana’s water resources by passing House Bill 1043.

The legislation would require that developers obtain a water consumption permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources before establishing a data center.

Burton is also concerned about the quality of the water discharged by data centers.

“The goal is to make sure our water remains safe, drinkable. ... It’s important that if water is to leave the data center, that it’s safe,” he said.

To develop certain projects, companies often form joint ventures that leverage the expertise of the companies involved to advance projects to reach operational status. The United States has been progressing toward an increased reliance on the gas market as the nation dominates the international gas sector, producing more gas than any other nation. Now, a new conduit known as the Blackcomb Pipeline is reaching towards a 2026 commissioning date.

Joint ventures are often the only way to progress projects towards realization

Joint ventures serve an important purpose across the global energy market. Companies may struggle with certain aspects of a project, and often opt to bring on board other substantially large energy companies to progress operations towards actual, on-the-ground commissioning. With the increased output expected in the US market due to the new focus from the federal government, 2026 is looking good for the US energy market.

The Blackcomb Pipeline project was specifically designed to transport up to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day through an astonishing estimated 365 miles of 42-inch pipeline that will run from the Permian basin to processing facilities in South Texas. The supply of gas that will run through the Blackcomb Pipeline will be sourced from several operations in the Permian Basin.

A new joint venture has been created to advance the Blackcomb Pipeline project

Notably, WhiteWater, a US-based energy company, has formed a joint venture that already owns and operates the Whistler Pipeline to develop the Blackcomb Pipeline. The WPC Joint Venture brings WhiteWater together with Targa Resources to hopefully reach a final investment decision on the planned Blackcomby Pipeline next year.

“We are excited to partner with Targa by leveraging Whistler’s expansive footprint in Waha and Agua Dulce to develop the Blackcomb Pipeline. Blackcomb will provide much needed incremental natural gas takeaway capacity for Permian shippers.” – Christer Rundlof, CEO of WhiteWater

The plan, according to the joint venture, is to reach a final investment decision on the Blackcomb Pipeline project after it has secured a number of agreements with predominantly investment-grade shippers, including:

Devon Energy Corporation

Diamondback Energy Inc

Marathon Petroleum Corporation

Targa Resources

The WPC joint venture will bring invaluable assets to the project, as it has significant long-haul natural gas pipelines that regularly transport natural gas from the Permian basin to processing facilities in Texas. The WPC joint venture owns and operates several pipelines and processing sites in the Permian basin, including but not limited to:

Whistler Pipeline

Rio Bravo Pipeline

70% of the Blackcomb Pipeline

70% of the ADCC Pipeline

50% of the Waha Gas Storage facility

Targa Resources, which forms part of the WPC joint venture, has been developing its plans to build a new 500-mile ‘Speedway’ pipeline in the Permian, exemplifying the substantial assets it brings to the Blackcomb pipeline project. Joint ventures are often the only method to develop energy infrastructure needed to advance projects beyond the planning phase.

The Blackcomb Pipeline project still has a few regulatory barriers to navigate

While the new joint venture will progress the project to reach a final investment decision in the new year, the project is yet to receive the approval of regulators, but expectations are that the process will run smoothly over the coming months as it targets a 2026 operational commencement. The Permian Basin has long been the cornerstone of the US gas market, and over the years, it has attracted interest from some of the largest energy companies in the world, such as the Eiger Express Pipeline, which is also being developed by WhiteWater and its associates.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/48.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 19:58:26.182663

Guy HedgecoeAragón, north-eastern Spain

On the edge of the sleepy town of Figueruelas, a single, vast wind turbine spins around, casting its shadow over the buildings nearby.

It's a reminder of the importance of renewable electricity in this windswept area of Aragón, in north-eastern Spain, whose plains are host to many of the country's wind and solar energy farms.

Figueruela's status as a symbol of Spain's green transition has been further boosted recently, as work starts nearby on the construction of a vast factory that will produce batteries for electric vehicles.

Chinese firm CATL and the Netherlands-based Stellantis are investing a combined €4bn ($4.7bn; £3.5bn) in the facility. Yao Jing, China's ambassador in Spain, described it as ""one of the biggest Chinese investments Europe has ever seen"".

Luis Bertol Moreno, mayor of the town, says the area was a logical choice for the project.

""We're in Aragón, where there's wind all year round, there are lots of hours of sunshine, and we are surrounded by wind turbines and solar panels,"" he says.

""Those [energy sources] will be crucial in generating electricity for the new factory, and I understand that was the key reason for building it here in Figueruelas.""

The factory can be seen as vindication of Spain's energy model, which prioritises renewable sources. In 2017, renewables contributed just a third of Spain's electricity production, but last year they represented 57%.

By 2030, the government wants them to contribute 81% of electricity output.

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summarised his government's approach as he delivered a riposte to US President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel ""Dig, baby, dig"" slogan. ""Green, baby, green,"" said the Socialist, as he pointed to the benefits of renewable energy.

However, in recent months, Spain's all-in commitment to renewables has come under scrutiny. This was in great part due to an 28 April blackout that left homes, businesses, government buildings, public transport, schools and universities in the dark across Spain and neighbouring Portugal for several hours.

With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the outage, the country's energy mix became a fiercely-debated political issue. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative opposition, accused the government of ""fanaticism"" in pursuing its green agenda, suggesting that an over-reliance on renewables might have caused the incident.

Feijóo and others on the right advocated a rethink of the national energy model.

The fact that, a week before the blackout, solar generation in mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has fuelled such claims.

Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain.

""We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously] with no effect on the security of the system,"" says Concha Sánchez, head of operations for Red Eléctrica. ""Definitely it's not a question of the rate of renewables at that moment.""

Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues, including an ""unknown event"" in the system moments before, which saw anomalous voltage oscillations.

However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. A cyber-attack has repeatedly been ruled out.

Meanwhile, since April, Spain's electricity mix has been modified somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion that the country is at an energy crossroads.

Spain's nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout, pushing back against government plans to close the country's five nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035.

With many European countries undergoing a nuclear renaissance, the planned closures make Spain something of an outlier. The companies that own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030. That request is currently under consideration.

Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation. He believes nuclear energy provides stability while being compatible with the green energy transition.

""It's prudent to have a mix of renewables and nuclear energy,"" he says.

Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are not able to operate around the clock or when weather is unfavourable.

""How can you produce energy in those hours when the renewables are not producing?"" he asks. The answer, he added, is ""with a source like nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the year"".

The political opposition is staunchly opposed to the nuclear shut-down. The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described nuclear power as ""a crucial source of stability"".

Ms Sánchez acknowledges that there is room for improvement for Spain's electricity model, pointing to the Iberian peninsula's relative isolation from the European grid compared to most of its EU neighbours. She also sees storage as an issue.

""While we have taken a good path when it comes to renewable installation, we cannot say the same regarding storage,"" she says. ""We need to foster storage installation.""

Spain's political panorama adds an element of uncertainty to its energy future. The Socialist-led coalition has been mired in corruption scandals and its parliamentary majority appears to have collapsed in recent weeks, raising the possibility of a snap election in the coming months.

A right-wing government, which polls suggest would be the likely outcome, would almost certainly place less emphasis on renewables and advocate a partial return to more traditional energy sources.

But in the meantime, Spain's renewable transition continues.

And for Figueruelas, in Aragón, that means not just cheap, clean energy, but investment. The town's population, of just 1,000, is due to increase dramatically, with 2,000 Chinese workers scheduled to arrive to help build the new battery plant, which is expected to create up to 35,000 indirect jobs once it starts operating.

""These kinds of investments revitalise the area, they revitalise the construction sector, hostelry,"" says local man Manuel Martín. ""And the energy is free – it just depends on the sun and the wind.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d24e/live/3992fd80-d72d-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 19:58:13.929862

It would also completely end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.
“By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars, we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers.
The previous Conservative government delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 in 2023.
The ZEV mandate is a result of the Climate Change Act and its 2050 net zero duty, which the Conservatives have pledged to repeal.","The Conservatives have announced proposals to end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars and cut the legal requirement on car manufacturers to sell electric vehicles.

A Conservative government would abolish the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, ending the legal requirement for manufacturers to sell a fixed rising percentage of zero-emission vehicles each year – 80% of new cars and 70% of new vans by 2030, increasing to 100% by 2035. It would also completely end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.

A future Conservative government would also scrap all of the non-research and development subsidies associated with the ZEV mandate to “relieve manufacturers of more costly regulatory obligations”, which the party estimates would save £3.8bn over the next decade. Ministers would retain infrastructure funding to continue developing the electric vehicle market.

Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, said: “Labour’s rush to net zero is having a disastrous effect on the UK car industry. The Conservatives will ensure that we protect the environment, but we will do so without forcing families to bear the brunt of the costs, and forcing carmakers to meet deadlines that don’t reflect consumer demand.

“By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars, we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers. Britain succeeds when we back business and support innovation – that’s our plan for a stronger economy.”

Writing in the Telegraph, Badenoch said she was inspired by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and her “commonsense approach to net zero”, which required that “any push to tackle carbon emissions must not degrade Italy’s economy”.

The previous Conservative government delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 in 2023. However, Labour reinstated the ban and will require every new car to be zero-emission by 2035, on the grounds that the timeline will provide certainty to manufacturers and consumers.

The ZEV mandate is a result of the Climate Change Act and its 2050 net zero duty, which the Conservatives have pledged to repeal.

Doug Parr, the Greenpeace UK policy director, said: “Nothing the Tories suggest is likely to take effect before 2029, one year from when the ban takes effect. A U-turn now would create chaos after years of preparation for electric cars, wasting effort, risking jobs and leaving Britain stuck in reverse while the rest of the world accelerates towards cleaner, cheaper cars.

“If ever a political party wanted to sow confusion and uncertainty into one of Britain’s most important manufacturing industries, this is how you do it. It’s the opposite of what’s needed to cut pollution, lower running costs for drivers and secure long term jobs.

“Chinese electric vehicles will soon be better and cheaper than anything coming out of Europe or the UK. A phaseout date to incentivise UK manufacturing has to be part of the response. Scrapping rules would be a total disaster. It would undermine investment and leave manufacturers facing uncertainty in a rapidly changing global market. The Tories introduced this policy, and they should leave well alone.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7ef80140263da04bbc24032051f8c8cb01cde42/681_0_6830_5464/master/6830.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a43018e4805e251f511e56cf2db8c35",N,,2025-12-14 17:57:57.452539

“Very soon, you’ll see a stop of the rise of electricity prices. And with the continuation of [the Trump administration’s] policies of energy addition, you will see declines in electricity prices later this term,” Wright told host Jacqui Heinrich on “Fox News Sunday.”

As of September, electricity prices were up 5.1 percent relative to 12 months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In January, electricity prices were up 1.9 percent from the previous year.

Overall inflation in September hit 3 percent, the same as in January, according to the BLS.

The increase in electricity prices peaked at 15.8 percent in August 2022 amid global energy shortages stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Increases in electricity demand, particularly during extreme weather events, also drive up utility bills nationwide.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a semi-independent division of the Department of Energy (DOE), projects that next year, residential electricity prices will be up as much as 18 percent relative to 2022.

The price of other utilities, such as natural gas, regular gasoline, and heating oil, is expected to be 1 percent higher, 23 percent lower, and 32 percent lower next year relative to 2022, the EIA notes.

Wright, though, said that DOE is “doing everything we can to stop that rise in electricity prices.” The department, at the direction of President Trump, has prioritized slashing regulations on energy companies and cutting funding for green energy projects.

Department officials describe the vehicle as a pilot, not a fleet conversion. The EV is primarily used for urban patrol, traffic enforcement, and administrative duties, allowing officers and city staff to assess real-world performance, operating costs, charging needs, and officer usability.

AAPD leaders emphasize that the single EV does not replace traditional cruisers and is not intended for every policing scenario. High-speed pursuits, long shifts, and operations without reliable access to charging infrastructure remain better suited to gasoline-powered vehicles.

Still, the department says the pilot aligns with Ann Arbor’s broader sustainability goals while offering a practical way to test whether electric patrol vehicles can reduce fuel and maintenance costs over time. Quieter operation has also proven useful in residential neighborhoods and community-policing situations.

Ann Arbor’s limited experiment reflects a measured approach shared by other Michigan police departments.

The Michigan State Police has evaluated electric vehicles for administrative and support roles rather than frontline patrol. Departments in Dearborn, Royal Oak, and other metro Detroit communities have explored or tested EVs for specific functions, often focusing on traffic enforcement, command vehicles, or short-range urban patrols.

Across Michigan, police agencies cite similar factors driving interest: rising fuel costs, long-term maintenance savings, and access to state and federal fleet-electrification incentives. At the same time, departments remain wary of range limitations, winter performance, charging availability, and pursuit capability—especially in rural or high-demand environments.

As a result, most agencies view EVs as situational tools rather than full patrol replacements.

For now, Ann Arbor’s single electric patrol vehicle serves as a test case, offering data and experience rather than a declaration of a full transition.

In the closing weeks of 2025, Tesla Inc. is unleashing a barrage of incentives designed to turbocharge vehicle sales, a move that underscores the company’s aggressive push to clear inventory and maintain momentum amid fluctuating market dynamics. With offers including free premium upgrades on select inventory models, zero-percent APR financing for up to 72 months on the Model Y Standard Range, and zero-down lease options, Tesla is effectively lowering the barrier to entry for potential buyers. This strategy comes at a pivotal moment, as the expiration of federal tax credits earlier in the year has dampened demand, prompting the automaker to pull every lever to stimulate purchases before the calendar flips.

Industry analysts note that these promotions are not merely discounts but a calculated effort to bolster quarterly delivery numbers, which have shown signs of softening. According to recent data, Tesla’s U.S. sales dipped to under 40,000 units in November 2025, marking the lowest figure in years, as reported by Electrek. This decline follows the phase-out of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, which had previously buoyed affordability for models like the Model 3 and Model Y. In response, Tesla has layered on incentives that could save buyers thousands, effectively replicating some of the lost tax benefits through direct rebates and financing perks.

The free upgrade program, in particular, stands out as a novel tactic. Eligible buyers selecting from Tesla’s inventory can receive one complimentary premium feature—such as enhanced wheel designs, interior color upgrades, or even towing packages—without additional cost. This offer applies to on-site inventory only and is available while supplies last, adding an element of urgency to the promotion. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, from users like Tesla enthusiasts highlight the buzz, with many sharing how these deals are tipping the scales for on-the-fence consumers.

Decoding the Incentive Arsenal

Tesla’s current lineup of promotions extends beyond upgrades to include highly competitive financing. For the Model Y Standard Range, buyers can secure 0% APR for 72 months, a rate that’s virtually unheard of in the automotive sector and could translate to savings of over $5,000 in interest compared to standard loans. Additionally, zero-down leases for models like the Model 3 and Model Y start at $299 per month, making electric vehicle ownership more accessible to a broader demographic. These deals are detailed on Tesla’s official site, but third-party analyses, such as those from Not a Tesla App, emphasize their role in closing out the year strong.

This incentive blitz is part of a broader pattern for Tesla, which has historically ramped up promotions in the fourth quarter to maximize deliveries. In 2025, the urgency is amplified by external pressures, including increased competition from legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors, who are rolling out their own EV models with competitive pricing. Tesla’s approach contrasts with rivals by focusing on immediate value-adds rather than long-term warranties, a strategy that aligns with CEO Elon Musk’s emphasis on rapid iteration and customer satisfaction through software and hardware perks.

Moreover, state and local incentives continue to play a supporting role. As outlined in Tesla’s support resources via Tesla Support, buyers in regions like California or New York can stack additional rebates on top of Tesla’s offers, potentially amplifying savings to $10,000 or more. This patchwork of incentives creates a complex but rewarding environment for savvy shoppers, though it requires careful navigation of eligibility criteria, such as income limits or vehicle qualifications.

Market Pressures and Strategic Shifts

The timing of these promotions coincides with Tesla’s efforts to rebound from a challenging year. Sales data indicates a slowdown in EV adoption rates, attributed to factors like higher interest rates and consumer hesitation over charging infrastructure. Tesla’s response has been multifaceted, including not just price cuts but also enhancements to its product ecosystem. For instance, the inclusion of three months of free Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability and Supercharging with certain purchases adds intangible value, appealing to tech-savvy buyers who prioritize autonomous features.

Comparisons to previous years reveal an escalation in aggressiveness. In 2024, Tesla offered 1.99% financing and free FSD transfers, but the 2025 deals go further with zero-interest options and complimentary upgrades, as chronicled in updates from X posts by influencers tracking the company’s moves. This evolution suggests Tesla is adapting to a maturing market where differentiation through incentives is key to retaining market share, which currently hovers around 50% of the U.S. EV segment.

Critics within the industry argue that such heavy reliance on promotions could erode profit margins, a concern echoed in financial analyses. Tesla’s stock has experienced volatility, with shares dipping amid reports of inventory buildup. Yet, proponents counter that these short-term tactics fuel long-term loyalty, as satisfied customers often become repeat buyers or advocates for the brand’s ecosystem, including solar products and home energy storage.

Consumer Perspectives and Real-World Impacts

From a buyer’s standpoint, these incentives are transforming the purchasing process. Take the Model Y, Tesla’s bestseller: with the free upgrade and zero-percent financing, the effective cost drops significantly, making it competitive against gas-powered SUVs in the same price bracket. Anecdotal evidence from X discussions shows users calculating total ownership costs, factoring in fuel savings and maintenance reductions, which further tip the scales in Tesla’s favor.

Dealership experiences, or rather Tesla’s direct-to-consumer model, enhance this appeal. Unlike traditional automakers, Tesla’s online configurator allows real-time customization, with incentives automatically applied. This streamlined approach, combined with rapid delivery timelines—often within days for inventory vehicles—creates a sense of immediacy that’s rare in the industry.

However, not all feedback is glowing. Some potential buyers express frustration over limited inventory for upgraded models, leading to quick sell-outs in high-demand areas. Additionally, the expiration date of December 31, 2025, for most promotions adds pressure, potentially rushing decisions that could benefit from more deliberation.

Broader Implications for the EV Sector

Tesla’s moves are rippling through the electric vehicle domain, pressuring competitors to match or exceed these offers. For example, companies like Rivian and Lucid have introduced their own discounts, though none yet rival Tesla’s zero-interest financing. This competitive dynamic is fostering innovation, with a focus on affordability to counter perceptions that EVs remain a luxury item.

On the regulatory front, the absence of federal tax credits has shifted the onus to manufacturers like Tesla to bridge the gap. Industry insiders speculate that if sales rebound strongly in Q4, it could influence policy discussions in 2026, potentially advocating for reinstated incentives to accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation.

Economically, these promotions are injecting vitality into related sectors, from battery suppliers to charging network providers. Tesla’s Supercharger network, bolstered by free access perks, continues to expand, with over 60,000 stalls globally, reinforcing the company’s dominance in infrastructure.

Innovation Amid Incentives

Looking deeper, Tesla’s strategy intertwines hardware incentives with software advancements. The free FSD trials included in some packages serve as a gateway to subscriptions, where users pay monthly for ongoing updates. This model not only generates recurring revenue but also collects valuable data to refine autonomous driving algorithms, a core pillar of Tesla’s valuation.

Comparisons to tech giants like Apple reveal parallels: just as iPhone upgrades drive ecosystem loyalty, Tesla’s vehicle incentives encourage adoption of add-ons like Powerwall or solar panels. Recent promotions for energy products, as noted in Not a Tesla App‘s overview, bundle vehicle purchases with home energy discounts, creating a holistic value proposition.

Yet, challenges persist. Supply chain constraints, particularly for premium features like advanced batteries, could limit the scalability of free upgrades. Analysts project that if Tesla achieves its delivery targets—potentially exceeding 500,000 units globally in Q4—these incentives will have proven their worth, setting a precedent for future campaigns.

Forecasting the Road Ahead

As 2025 draws to a close, Tesla’s incentive-driven push is a testament to its adaptive prowess. By offering tangible savings and exclusive perks, the company is not just selling cars but cultivating a community of electric vehicle advocates. This approach may well redefine year-end sales tactics across the automotive industry.

For industry observers, the key metric will be delivery figures released in early 2026. If successful, these promotions could stabilize Tesla’s growth trajectory, mitigating the tax credit void. Conversely, underwhelming results might prompt further innovations, such as expanded model variants or international expansions.

Ultimately, Tesla’s current playbook highlights a blend of financial ingenuity and customer-centric design, positioning the company to navigate an increasingly crowded field. Buyers capitalizing on these deals today may find themselves at the forefront of an electric revolution that’s accelerating faster than ever.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-3849-1765747879.jpeg,N,,2025-12-14 17:57:49.518053

That means T1 has almost the entire supply chain associated with solar manufacturing and will soon support about 6,000 American jobs.
The simple truth is that T1’s solar manufacturing is American manufacturing.","OPINION:

Michael Kinsley, the great liberal writer and commentator, once noted that some people are always looking for heretics while others are always looking for converts. That trenchant observation may be applicable to a situation in Texas.

There, an American company based in Austin is trying to bring solar manufacturing back to the United States after what has been a generation-long effort on the part of the Chinese Communist Party to destroy that manufacturing capacity in the United States. The company, T1 Energy, owns and operates one of the world’s most advanced solar module facilities in Wilmer, Texas, where it will produce about 3 gigawatts of solar modules this year.

That’s pretty good for an outfit that changed its name last year when the company, then called Freyr Battery, bought a Wilmer factory and various other things from Trina Solar, unfortunately part of the sprawling network of companies owned or controlled by members of the communist regime in Beijing. Soon after the sale, the company changed its name to T1 and made clear it intended to grow and become an integrated solar and battery storage leader owned and operated by Americans.

The company supports tariffs directed at Chinese predatory behavior, including the Section 232 investigation of China’s activities related to solar manufacturing by the Department of Commerce. More important, T1 announced a deal in August with Corning to be a foundational customer for that company’s new ingot/wafer manufacturing facility. That means T1 has almost the entire supply chain associated with solar manufacturing and will soon support about 6,000 American jobs.

Here’s the tricky part: Trina Solar still owns about 20% of the company, according to reports, allowing it a minimum of two board members. That’s important in large measure because federal tax credits require companies to avoid relying on “foreign entities of concern” (a diplomatic way of saying the Chinese Communist Party) for their supply chains. That makes sense; there is no point in strengthening an already powerful and probably hostile adversary.

With all that said, it seems this is one of those cases in which the new crew is trying to fix a problem it inherited. It bought the company and its assets from Chinese owners. Are there still unappetizing people on the board? There sure are, but they own only 20% of the company, which means the good guys own 80%, and you have to think the Texans will solve that problem eventually.

President Reagan used to routinely and correctly note: “The person who agrees with you 80% of the time is a friend and an ally, not a 20% traitor.” That seems like useful context in this case. Whatever future there is for solar manufacturing in this country, it’s going to look like T1 Energy: technologically skilled, practical in business deals, and careful about the generosity and limits of government policies.

The simple truth is that T1’s solar manufacturing is American manufacturing. As CEO Dan Barcelo recently said when he met with Vice President J.D. Vance, “We are investing in energy from America, for America and by Americans … to build a domestic solar supply chain that is scalable, reliable and low cost.”

Electricity and computing power are now the building blocks of national strength. Mr. Barcelo’s company is helping ensure that we have the American energy we need to meet Team Trump’s energy goals and maintain American supremacy in the existential race to master artificial intelligence and command the economic and technological heights for the remainder of this century.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted the company a new patent for an electric vehicle (EV) battery thermal-runaway suppression system, filed on May 28, 2024, and granted on December 4, 2025.

In plain English, this is a built-in emergency fire-suppression system inside the battery pack itself, designed to react when a battery cell starts to fail and heat up uncontrollably. Instead of waiting for that heat to turn into a full-blown fire, the system is designed to attack the problem immediately with a specialized foam mixture.

For future Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep®, FIAT, and Ram EVs and range-extending electric vehicles (REEVs), this kind of tech could become a major selling point—especially for customers still uneasy about EV battery fires.

What Problem Is Stellantis Solving? –

Most modern EVs use lithium-ion or lithium-metal battery cells. Under normal use, they’re safe and efficient. But in a failure scenario—like physical damage, internal short circuits, or severe overheating—one or more cells can enter thermal runaway.

When that happens, the cell temperature rises rapidly, gases are released (some of which are flammable), and heat can spread to neighboring cells. If those gases ignite, you’ve got a battery fire that can be extremely difficult to contain. Fire departments often have to flood battery packs with thousands of gallons of water just to cool them down enough to stop the reaction.

Stellantis’ new system is designed to catch that process early and smother it from the inside, using the battery pack’s own cooling system plus a dedicated fire-retardant supply.

How The System Is Built Inside The Pack –

The patent describes a battery pack that still looks familiar on the outside: a rigid metal housing, rows of battery cells, a cooling system with coolant lines and heat sinks, and pressure vents. The extra technology is layered in around those components.

The key added pieces are:

A bladder filled with a fire-retardant chemical

This bladder is located close to the battery cells, typically between the cells and the top of the pack. It’s made from a flexible polymer, so it can be punctured when needed.

Two sets of blades

– First blades: aimed at the bladder, ready to pierce it and release the fire-retardant chemical.

– Second blades: aimed at specific points on the coolant inlet line, outlet line, or heat sinks to rupture them and release coolant directly into the pack.

Special coolant line sections

The cooling lines and/or heat sinks are built or modified with small sealed apertures—closed off with a soft plug material. These plugs are easy for the blades to pierce but strong enough to hold pressure in normal operation.

Actuation devices tied to a controller

Electric or solenoid-style actuators push the blades into the bladder and coolant components when commanded by the vehicle’s controller.

The system is integrated into the existing battery thermal management system, which already circulates coolant (typically a water/glycol mix) through heat sinks under or around the cells to manage normal operating temperatures.

How It Works In Real-World Terms –

Think of this as an innovative fire-suppression system that lives inside the pack and only triggers when it senses serious trouble.

Continuous Monitoring

Temperature sensors inside the pack monitor battery temperatures. There can be one sensor per module, or even per cell, depending on the design. These send signals to a controller that constantly evaluates whether temperatures are within safe limits.

Detecting Thermal Runaway Conditions

If the controller detects temperatures rising into a zone that indicates a thermal runaway event is occurring or about to occur, it switches from normal cooling to emergency mode.

Triggering The Blades

The controller commands the actuators:

The first blades puncture the fire-retardant bladder.

The second blades pierce the plug-filled apertures in the coolant line(s) or heat sink(s), opening them up.

Creating Fire-Retardant Foam

As the bladder empties, fire-retardant chemical spills into the battery compartment. At the same time, coolant escapes the opened ports under pump pressure. When the two fluids mix, they form a foam specifically formulated to:

Absorb heat

Smother hot surfaces

Help prevent flammable gases from igniting

Extinguish any flames if they’ve already started

Boosting Coolant Flow

The controller can also tell the coolant pumps to speed up, forcing more coolant into the ruptured areas, increasing the volume of foam generated, and helping spread it more quickly throughout the cells.

Managing Internal Pressure

The battery housing has vents with valves that can open if pressure builds up from gas generation during thermal runaway. The patent even suggests pulsing these valves—relieving pressure while keeping as much foam as possible inside the pack to continue suppressing the event.

Why This Matters For Future Mopar EVs And REEVs –

This isn’t just an engineering flex; it’s the kind of system that can directly affect customer confidence and real-world safety for upcoming Stellantis products.

Safer EVs For Everyday Owners

For someone buying a future Dodge Charger Daytona EV, a Jeep® Recon EV, a Chrysler crossover EV, a Ram pickup with a large battery pack, or a FIAT city car, the big question is simple: What happens if something goes wrong?

A system like this gives Stellantis a concrete answer: the vehicle is designed to fight its own battery fire from the insidebefore it becomes catastrophic.

Better Packaging And Potential Weight Optimization

If Stellantis can prove this system is effective, it may allow engineers to optimize how much passive fire protection is needed. That could, over time:

Reduce the amount of heavy shielding

Free up space inside the pack

Improve vehicle efficiency and potentially range

You’re not just making the pack safer—you’re also giving engineers another tool to balance safety, weight, and performance.

Strategic Move For Stellantis In The EV Space –

Patents don’t guarantee production, but this one checks a lot of boxes: it uses familiar components, integrates with existing cooling systems, and leverages proven fire-retardant chemistry. It feels less like a wild concept and more like a production-ready architecture that could roll out with upcoming platforms.

As Stellantis ramps up its electrified roadmap for North America, this battery thermal-runaway suppression system could become one of those “under the skin” features that helps set Mopar EVs and REEVs apart—especially in a marketplace where headlines about EV fires still grab attention.

If implemented, it would give future Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep®, FIAT, and Ram electric vehicles a serious technical talking point: not just fast, capable, or efficient—but smarter and safer when it matters most.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/photo-output.png,N,,2025-12-14 15:58:41.832844

Offshore wind’s fixed price delivers cost savings for those of us using that power, compared to scenarios without offshore wind.
Our first operational offshore wind farm is a great example of the rewards moving to renewable energy can give us.
With the upcoming cold season, AI and data center explosion, and ongoing rise in energy prices, now is the time for proven solutions like offshore wind.","The answer is simple supply and demand: to bring prices down and keep up with energy demand, we need to bring more energy supply online and invest in the infrastructure we need to deliver it. New versions of traditional energy generation will need years to come online. Right now, there’s one ready-to-go solution we can’t afford to miss: offshore wind.

Offshore wind is the most readily available resource to meet demand and keep prices stable. This is our best bet to address both the energy affordability crisis and the climate crisis at the same time. Big utility companies don’t own what drives wind turbines; wind is free. And with Long Island’s abundant wind resource, more offshore wind means expensive gas plants don’t have to turn on as often — keeping overall energy prices stable.

The benefits don’t end there. Offshore wind’s fixed price delivers cost savings for those of us using that power, compared to scenarios without offshore wind. Especially those that involve the ever-volatile cost of traditional energy. In fact, if New York’s three planned offshore wind projects had been operational in 2022, we could have saved ratepayers $77M in a single month.

Our first operational offshore wind farm is a great example of the rewards moving to renewable energy can give us. Last year, the South Fork Wind Farm produced electricity 92% of the time, consistently delivering power to 70,000 homes. The data shows South Fork produces energy steadily during the day and peaks in the evening — right when we start to power everything up after work, school, and dinners.

It also helped during times when we needed energy the most. When New York was facing an energy emergency during last summer’s heatwave, South Fork delivered power at close to its maximum potential, helping us avoid blackouts. This is just a preview of what we can expect from other wind farms, Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind — if they are allowed to continue.

New York needs to stop looking to the failed energy of the past. With the upcoming cold season, AI and data center explosion, and ongoing rise in energy prices, now is the time for proven solutions like offshore wind.

The PROTECT Florida Act codifies protections for Florida’s coastline against offshore drilling guaranteed in President Donald Trump’s 2020 executive order.
In the Senate, Republican Senator Ashley Moody announced she was introducing the American Shores Protection Act to prohibit oil drilling and natural gas exploration and development near Florida’s coastline.","A bipartisan bill to protect Florida’s coastline and prevent offshore oil drilling was introduced in Congress.

Florida Congressman John H. Rutherford introduced H.R. 6068, the Preserving Recreation, Oceans, Tourism, Environment, and Coastal Towns in (PROTECT) Florida Act, to prevent drilling off Florida’s coast. This bipartisan legislation codifies President Trump’s moratorium on oil and gas leasing, seismic testing, and exploration in federal waters off the coast of Florida until 2032.

“Florida’s coastal environment is a central part of our state’s economy and way of life,” said Rep. John Rutherford. “Floridians have spoken, and they do not want drilling off their coast. That is why I am proud to introduce the PROTECT Florida Act with my colleagues from Florida. This commonsense, bipartisan bill will ensure our environment is preserved for generations to come.”

This bipartisan legislation with support from members of Congress all over Florida comes after the Department of the Interior announced a Secretary’s Order titled “Unleashing American Offshore Energy,” directing the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to take the necessary steps, in accordance with federal law, to terminate the restrictive Biden 2024–2029 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program and replace it with a new, expansive 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program by October 2026.

Rutherford was joined by Representatives Jimmy Patronis, Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez, Daniel Webster, Lois Frankel, Gus Bilirakis, Byron Donalds, Maria Salazar, Anna Paulina Luna, Mike Haridopolis, Scott Franklin, Darren Soto, Laurel Lee, Neal Dunn, and Vern Buchanan in the U.S. House.

Florida’s economy relies on healthy and pristine beaches. According to NOAA, Florida’s coastal economy contributes approximately $760 billion to our nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) through tourism, fishing, and recreation.

The PROTECT Florida Act codifies protections for Florida’s coastline against offshore drilling guaranteed in President Donald Trump’s 2020 executive order. It extends the GOMESA protections in the Eastern Gulf and creates a new moratorium for Florida’s Atlantic Coast and the Straits of Florida through 2032.

In the Senate, Republican Senator Ashley Moody announced she was introducing the American Shores Protection Act to prohibit oil drilling and natural gas exploration and development near Florida’s coastline. This legislation would extend the drilling moratorium, which includes the shores of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, from 2022 to 2032, and would codify President Trump’s September 2020 executive action that protects Sunshine State beaches.",https://westorlandonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Floridacoastline1.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 14:59:47.423738

A new color of hydrogen has been created by Korean scientists, using only oxygen, water, and electricity.
In fact, Korean scientists have created a new color of hydrogen.
A new color of hydrogen has been created Hydrogen comes in various colors, including the turquoise hydrogen that Europe desperately wants for methanol production.
Korean scientists have fortunately created something that could lead to a new color of hydrogen.","This year is rapidly coming to an end, which means we are one year closer to the 2050 net-zero deadline. Presently, the global carbon footprint is high, and carbon emission levels are at an all-time high. Fortunately, nations are working hard to address the issue. A new color of hydrogen has been created by Korean scientists, using only oxygen, water, and electricity. The new method is a breakthrough in renewable energy and has showcased remarkable results.

Hydrogen has become highly in demand, especially for certain colors

The world is working hard to keep its overall carbon footprint as low as possible. Whether at home or at work, the world is focused on going greener. Unfortunately, we still face significant challenges in our greener, low-carbon pursuit, including, but not limited to:

Difficulty in decarbonizing certain industries, such as heavy industry and transport

Excess energy storage and transport difficulty

One element that could address some of these challenges is hydrogen. According to a report by the Environmental Defense Fund, some of the main reasons why hydrogen has increased in popularity include:

Ability to store excess renewable energy long-term

Complementary fuel to battery-electric vehicles

Grid flexibility capabilities

Ability to decarbonize carbon-heavy industries

Improved energy security

Does not emit carbon when burned

However, not all hydrogen types are environmentally friendly, and hydrogen’s color determines how truly eco-friendly it is. Yes, we realise hydrogen is essentially colorless, but the color we are referring to is the method that was used to produce it. In fact, Korean scientists have created a new color of hydrogen.

A new color of hydrogen has been created

Hydrogen comes in various colors, including the turquoise hydrogen that Europe desperately wants for methanol production. Hydrogen can have either a high or low carbon footprint depending on the method used to produce it. A color is assigned to the particular process to represent its carbon footprint, for example:

Brown or Black Hydrogen

Gasification is used to create hydrogen from brown or black coal

Extremely carbon-intensive

Green hydrogen

Water electrolysis is used to create hydrogen

Process is powered by renewable energy sources such as wind power

While green hydrogen is the holy grail, it is still expensive to produce, and the production process is slow. Korean scientists have fortunately created something that could lead to a new color of hydrogen. Find out more below.

Korean scientists just needed this to create it

A research team that consists of Dr. Sung Jong Yoo of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Professor Chan Woo Lee of Kookmin University, and led by Professor Jin Young Kim from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Seoul National University’s College of Engineering, has created a new and improved electrochemical catalyst to replace platinum in electrolysis.

Platinum is a costly, precious metal that is used as a catalyst in hydrogen electrolysis. Unfortunately, it also degrades quickly. The newly engineered catalyst is more cost-effective and has showcased higher efficiency and stability, making it a feasible alternative for commercial applications. It consists of a small number of precious metals and comprises a ruthenium-based nanocluster and a core-shell structure.

The core-shell nanocluster catalyst can potentially be used in the following applications:

Industrial applications

Hydrogen power plants

Environmentally-friendly transportation systems

Hydrogen fuel cells for cars

So, by just using oxygen, water, and electricity, and the new catalyst, of course, we could end up with hydrogen that is even ‘greener’ than green hydrogen. However, further development will still be necessary before the new core-shell nanocluster catalyst will be commercially available, and only time will tell how soon that will be. In other hydrogen news, South Korea has opened new 2025 tenders to expand its hydrogen-based power production capacity. Korea sure isn’t playing around!

Tokyo Gas is committing over $1 billion to the US gas and LNG market over the next three years—marking a major play to grow beyond its home turf in Japan.

What does this mean?

Japan’s top city gas provider is eyeing North America for expansion, driven by growing demand for natural gas in sectors like data centers and semiconductor manufacturing. Global enthusiasm for LNG remains strong, which backs Tokyo Gas’s bold strategy. After acquiring Rockcliff Energy last year, the firm recently grabbed a 70% stake in East Texas gas assets from Chevron, aiming to boost returns by ramping up US operations. The company is keen on possible deals involving liquefaction plants or new gas supply contracts, depending on how the market evolves. Meanwhile, Tokyo Gas is treading tricky waters back home, as it relies on Russian LNG under a US sanctions waiver that’s set to expire soon—a situation shaped by geopolitics and government policy.

Why should I care?

For markets: US energy assets are drawing global capital.

Tokyo Gas’s aggressive US expansion signals strong global investor confidence in American natural gas and LNG, especially as worldwide energy demand rises. The company’s latest moves—and its billion-dollar-plus commitment—highlight a long-term outlook for natural gas, even as clean energy talk picks up steam. This ongoing investment could mean more foreign capital flowing into US energy, fresh competition for homegrown firms, and active development in top gas regions.

The bigger picture: Global energy security hinges on diversification.

Tokyo Gas’s strategy spotlights how energy giants are shoring up their supply chains amid geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties. Last year, the company sourced nearly half its 11.56 million metric tons of LNG from Australia, while still relying on sanctioned Russian projects for a significant slice. By snapping up US assets and spreading risks across regions, the firm’s adapting to a world where energy security depends on smart strategy, not just resources in the ground.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2025_newsml_L4N3XH1LH_1901071635.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=169ba2e822c103518386be414eec32c6,N,,2025-12-14 15:58:51.078170

The outcome of the decision would determine whether the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission would proceed with granting 20-year extensions of the licenses of the two 1,100 MW nuclear reactors at the plant.

PG&E filed its license renewal application with the NRC in November 2023 and the NRC accepted the application for a full review in December 2023. The utility intends to keep Diablo Canyon running until 2045. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to approve the plant’s license renewal application in the first quarter of 2026.

The NRC’s approval depends on PG&E clearing two hurdles in California. The first is a land use plan that needs to be approved by the California Coastal Commission. The second is a certification from California Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board that the reactor site is in compliance with its water quality permit. The plant’s once through cooling system discharges the water back into the Pacific Ocean.

The NRC’s safety evaluation report issued in June 2025 concluded that operator Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) can continue to manage the site safely and within federal regulations. The report’s conclusions followed extensive technical reviews, audits, inspections, and public consultations.

First Up a Land Use Plan

Opposition groups targeted the Coastal Commission’s action calling for setting aside 4,000 acres from further development. The Environmental Defense Center and Mothers for Peace have opposed extending the licenses by 20 years for the two 1,110 MW Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR) units at Diablo Canyon every step of the way.

By way of background, environmental organizations thought they’d put a lid on the future of the plant in 2016 with an agreement to close the plant. In June 2016 four leading environmental groups signed on to the agreement to close the twin reactors and replace them with “greenhouse gas free resources,” e.g., solar, wind, and hydro. The groups involved included Friends of the Earth, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environment California, and the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility.

What happened next is that the State of California discovered that there was not enough generating capacity on the energy mix to cover the gapping hole was carved out of grid capacity once the reactors were shut down.

In response California Governor Gavin Newsome was able to convince the state legislature that the quickest way to be voted out of office was to let the nuclear plants stay dark which had already resulted in energy blackouts and skyrocketing utility costs. The two reactors had provided 10% of all the electricity generated in California.

In 2020 statewide rotating outages during a heat wave helped make his point. What green groups experienced is that you can preach the environmental values of renewable energy, but when people reach for the ‘on’ switch to their air conditioners, and all they hear are crickets, the party’s over.

California experienced an extreme heat wave in August 2020 that caused the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to direct electric utilities in its balancing authority to shed load, or in more common terms, to initiate rolling blackouts.

As expected, popular sentiment came around quickly when faced with stark choice that needed to be made to reverse the Diablo Canyon shutdown order in to keep the lights on and to prevent the California economy from taking a nose dive. In 2022 a state law ordered the plant to stay open for at least five years. It also authorized a $1.4 billion loan to be paid back by a combination of future profits and federal funding sources.

This experience did not deter opposition groups from hitting the Coastal Commission hard in 2025 forcing it to spend months in hearings over the proposed restrictions on land around the plant. However, in the end nine of the 12 commissioners voted to approve the new lands use plan.

In the end, the utility proposed a timeline to conserve up to 6,700 acres of land, create 25 miles of trail easements and put aside $10 million for trail construction to mitigate its operations through 2030. It also committed to a prohibition on selling another 5,000 acres of land through 2040, unless the sale is for conservation.

Meeting Water Quality Standards is the Final Hurdle

The remaining step in the license renewal process is the approval of permits through the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. The plant uses two million gallons a day of water drawn from the Pacific Ocean as a non-consumptive use for cooling purposes. Once the water has done its job, it is discharged back into the bay.

The California Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board is slated to vote in February 2026 on continued Diablo Canyon operations. To allow continued operation of the power plant, the Central Coast Water Board will consider two actions: renewing the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and issuing a Clean Water Act section 401 water quality certification.

Before the NRC’s license renewals can take effect, the Central Coast Water Board must certify that discharges to ocean waters resulting from the license renewals will comply with California’s water quality standards. (November 2025 staff presentation to the Water Board

Another issue related to regulating Diablo Canyon’s “once through” water use system is how it will protect marine organisms from being harmed by the intake systems. (Fact Sheet)

The same opposition groups will surely focus on these hearings as the decision by the Water Board is the last hurdle in the state’s review prior to the NRC decision whether to grant the license extensions. As they say in the world of Opera, “it ain’t over until the fat lady sings,” so watch this space.

Energy Demand is Growing in California

Diablo Canyon’s future as a key element in the state’s energy portfolio is driven by rising energy demand from data centers. The California Energy Commission says demand from data centers could grow by 4 GW in the next 10 years. The commission anticipates its next forecast will at least double. PG&E’s August 2025 estimate says demand could rise as much as 10 GW by 2035. That equals the energy of nearly five Diablo Canyons.

Diablo Canyon’s extended operations through 2030 are expected to annually reduce greenhouse-gas emissions

equivalent to carbon-dioxide emissions from 1.6 million cars.

Standard Nuclear Moves Ahead with Plans for TRISO Fuel Production

A new prime contract with the Department of Energy provides for a significant expansion of the firm’s capacity to manufacture TRISO fuel for advanced reactors

Standard Nuclear, Inc., a reactor-agnostic producer of TRISO nuclear fuel, announced that it has executed an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), marking a major milestone in an effort to bring privately funded advanced nuclear-fuel production infrastructure online in support of TRISO-fueled reactor demonstrations in 2026. Standard Nuclear is focused on the large-scale production of advanced nuclear fuel and radioisotope power systems.

Under the newly executed OTA, Standard Nuclear will transition key operational elements of its TRISO fuel production operations to full DOE oversight, ensuring adherence to the agency’s contracting framework. This enhanced oversight enables a substantial increase in the company’s TRISO fuel manufacturing throughput within its existing facilities.

Standard Nuclear is drawing on expertise from across the DOE complex to support this transition. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by Battelle Energy Alliance for DOE, is providing technical assistance through a Strategic Partnership Project (SPP) agreement executed earlier this year. The company is also receiving technical support and specialized training from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Y-12 National Security Complex.

“We’re proud to be the first TRISO fuel manufacturer to execute an agreement of this kind with the Department of Energy ahead of next year’s reactor demonstrations,” said Kurt Terrani, CEO of Standard Nuclear.

“The advanced reactor and fuel technologies now moving into deployment all originate from decades of DOE research and development said Jess Gehin, Associate Laboratory Director, Idaho National Laboratory.

Standard Nuclear Joins DOE Nuclear Fuel Line Program

DOE has conditionally selected Standard Nuclear as the first company to join its newly launched nuclear fuel line pilot program. This initiative is designed to strengthen the domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel, a key component in the deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. Standard Nuclear, based in Oak Ridge, TN, will lead the development and operation of a new nuclear fuel fabrication facility.

The project will also utilize infrastructure in Idaho to support production of advanced TRISO fuel – a next-generation nuclear fuel critical for high-performance reactors currently under development.

The company will be fully responsible for the construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning of the facility, while reactor developers will source uranium feedstock through DOE’s High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) allocation program.

The fuel line pilot program directly supports the DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program, which aims to bring at least three advanced reactor designs to operational criticality by July 2026. These next-generation reactors are expected to use more efficient, safer nuclear fuel like TRISO. Standard Nuclear said in its press statement the dual approach fast-tracks research, licensing, and deployment of innovative reactor technologies outside of traditional government labs, opening the door for private-sector investment and commercial-scale deployment.

Expanding domestic nuclear fuel capabilities is a strategic national priority. For years, the US has depended on foreign countries, including adversarial powers, for enriched uranium and other critical materials. This reliance introduces supply chain vulnerabilities, especially during times of geopolitical tension.

Earlier this year Standard Nuclear, Inc.,announced its launch from stealth with $42 million in total funding led by Decisive Point with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Washington Harbour Partners, Welara, Fundomo, and Crucible Capital.

Natura Resources Purchases Shepherd Power

The firm Also Partnered with NOV to Deploy Gigawatts of SMRs in early 2030s

Shepherd Power’s expertise in full-scale reactor deployment will accelerate Natura’s ability to provide comprehensive power options for customers, including site, build, own, and operate

Agreement will align Natura’s breakthrough reactor design with NOV’s manufacturing expertise to accelerate commercial deployment of Natura’s molten salt reactor (MSR) technology

Natura Resources LLC, a developer of advanced molten-salt nuclear reactors, has acquired Shepherd Power from NOV Inc. (NYSE: NOV) and signed an agreement with NOV to support commercialization of its small modular reactor (SMR) technology. As part of the transaction, NOV will become an investor in Natura and will appoint a representative to Natura’s Board of Directors.

The agreement will align Natura’s molten salt reactor design with NOV’s manufacturing, supply chain, and project management expertise to support delivery of multiple gigawatts of SMRs for data center and industrial applications between 2029 and 2032.

The acquisition adds Shepherd Power’s reactor deployment expertise, including regulatory and licensing experience, to the Natura team, strengthening Natura’s path to commercial deployment and enhancing the company’s ability to offer a range of industrial power options for customers.

Natura is building SMRs that use liquid fuel dissolved in a molten salt mixture. This design operates at high temperature and atmospheric pressure. It can use several fuel types, including recycled waste fuel and enables harvesting of rare medical isotopes critical for cancer treatment.

The firm said in its press statement that the design of Natura’s 100 MW reactor also will make it an option for produced water desalination, a critical issue for the Permian Basin and other areas of the U.S. with significant oil and gas production.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a construction permit in September 2024 for the deployment of Natura’s 1 MW reactor at Abilene Christian University. Natura expects to deploy this reactor in 2026.

Natura plans to file two commercial reactor applications with the NRC before the end of 2025 –one focused on medical isotope production and the other for grid-scale electricity generation. The company expects to deploy its first 100 MW commercial reactor in 2029.

State of New York Invests $40 Million in Nuclear Workforce Development

(WNN) The New York Power Authority (NYPA) will partner with qualified workforce development providers, including technical high schools, community colleges, universities, labour unions, and others to use $40 million in funding to develop nuclear energy technical training, retraining, coursework and apprenticeship programmes to prepare workers for employment in the advanced nuclear energy field.

Hochul’s direction to NYPA, the state’s public electric utility, plans to develop at least 1 GW of advanced nuclear capacity in upstate New York, an area in and around Oswego, NY. The NYPA will develop a ‘Master Plan for Responsible Advanced Nuclear Development’ in New York as part of a $1 billion proposal

In addition to the $40 million, the NYPA Board has awarded $4 million to universities and organizations to develop and expand programs that prepare New Yorkers for high-demand careers in artificial intelligence, electromechanical trades, and advanced power systems to meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

Three nuclear power plants, all in upstate New York, and all operated by Constellation Energy, currently provide 21% of the state’s electricity, and 42% of its carbon-free electricity, according to information from the Nuclear Energy Institute. The state supports the continued operation of the two-unit plant at Nine Mile Point and the single-unit Ginna and Fitzpatrick plants.

GE Vernova Hitachi SMR Design Clears Key UK Regulatory Review Milestone

(WNN) GE Vernova Hitachi announced that its BWRX300 SMR has cleared the second of three phases of the Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process at the U.K. Office of Nuclear Regulation. The GDA assess the safety, security, and environmental protection aspects of a nuclear power plant design that is intended to be deployed in Great Britain.

The GDA process is a voluntary, non-mandatory process. Successful completion of the three-step GDA culminates in the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation from the ONR and a Statement of Design Acceptability from the Environment Agency.

In May 2021, the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy opened the GDA process to advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors (SMRs). GE Vernova Hitachi submitted a GDA entry application for its BWRX-300 SMR to the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in December 2022. The BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH’s ESBWR boiling water reactor.

Step 1 of the GDA of the BWRX-300 began in January 2024 and focused on agreeing the scope and schedule for Step 2. Step 1 was completed in December 2024. It then entered Step 2, which focused on evaluating the fundamental adequacy of the design and its safety, security, safeguards and environmental protection documentation. The regulators have now completed Step 2 of the GDA and issued their Step 2 statements and assessment reports on the GE Vernova Hitachi design.

There are currently no plans to deploy the GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 design in Great Britain, and no sites have been identified for its deployment. If an organization decide to progress plans to deploy the BWRX-300 design, the regulators would need to undertake a further period of detailed design assessment before safety-significant construction could begin and environmental permits could be issued. This assessment could be conducted on a generic basis with GE Vernova Hitachi, should the company choose to return to the GDA process to complete Step 3.

“GE Vernova Hitachi opted for a shorter two-step GDA, making it the first requesting party to take advantage of the flexibility we introduced in our modernized GDA process,” said Rob Exley, ONR’s Head of the BWRX-300 GDA.

He added, “This means it is the quickest GDA engagement completed to date.”

Other Firms and the GDA Process

GDAs have previously been completed for the EDF/Areva UK EPR, the Westinghouse AP1000, the Hitachi-GE UK ABWR and China’s HPR1000 designs. A GDA Step 3 assessment is currently ongoing for Rolls-Royce SMR Limited’s small modular reactor design.

In August 2024 a Step 2 assessment began for Holtec International’s SMR-300. In August 2024, Westinghouse’s AP300 was accepted for a GDA review. Last month, TerraPower submitted its Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor and energy storage system into the GDA process in the company’s first regulatory step to deploying the technology in an international market.

Japan Quits Its Vietnam Nuclear Project

Reuters reports that Japan has pulled out of plans to build a commercial nuclear power station in Vietnam because the time frame is too tight, Japanese ambassador Naoki Ito told the wire service.

He said, “The Japanese side is not in a position to implement the Ninh Thuan 2 project.”

Japan at one time proposed to develop a nuclear power station for a location on Vietnam’s central highlands with a planned capacity of 2-3 GW.

A key focus of the power plant was to provide electricity to an aluminum smelting plant to move Vietnam up the value chain from simply exporting raw aluminum to developing a manufacturing capacity to produce finished durable goods.

In June, Bloomberg reported Vietnam was seeking discussions with Russia to accelerate its nuclear program and sign an investment cooperation agreement for a first nuclear power station. Vietnam is a global center of manufacturing operations for multinationals including Samsung and Apple. It has had major power blackouts as demand from its huge industrial sector and expanding urban populations often exceed the power available.

Vietnam, which shares a long common border with China, has long aligned itself with Russia to counter balance China’s influence on its economy and politics. Russia has proposed to build up to 4 GW of nuclear power generating capacity in Vietnam. Japan was supposed to have provided another 4 GW for a total of 8 GW. It is unclear whether Russia would commit to an 8 GW project or whether Vietnam could pay for it.

In 2016 Vietnam cancelled a proposal by Russia to build four 1,000 MW VVERs, and four more 1,000 MW reactors to be supplied by Japanese firms, due to the rising costs of the power stations and concerns about the country’s ability to safely manage the construction operations of the reactors.

Construction of the reactors had been set to begin in the province of Ninh Thuan province in 2014. The site is about 350 km / 135 miles northeast of Ho Chi Minh city (formerly Saigon).

The start date was pushed back several times by the government on the grounds that it did not have enough trained nuclear engineers to manage the construction nor the safety regulatory programs needed for a reactor development effort of this size.

In January 2015 Hoang Anh Tuan, head of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Agency, told western news media that the reason for the delays is that the government wasn’t ready to manage the project nor does it have a mature and independent nuclear safety and regulatory oversight agency. A national nuclear safety agency was set up in 2010, but much more work is needed according to this report.

At the time Vietnam did not consider small nuclear reactors because neither the Russians nor the Japanese had commercial units to sell them. Fast forward to 2025, Russia is building SMRs to power mining operations in Siberia but has not, so far, offered them for export. Japan does not currently have a domestic design of an SMR that is economically viable.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/diablocanyon-aerial_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 12:59:21.073845

Opinions about license renewal for “nuclear power plants that continue to meet federal safety standards” and for “definitely building more nuclear power plants” also are favorable in 2025.
Among those who feel very well informed about nuclear energy, 66% are strongly favorable and only 6% are strongly opposed.","In a world in which nuclear energy is experiencing a resurgence of interest and action, the determined efforts of groups opposed to the relicensing of the twin 1,100 MW PWRs at the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant flies in the face of global wisdom. According to the World Nuclear Association, as of 12/04/25, 33 nations have signed a pledge to triple the amount of nuclear power on the planet by 2050. That’s a lot of good company for any utility wanting to start, restart, and/or relicense a nuclear power plant of any size or design.

Dr Sama Bilbao y León, Director General of World Nuclear Association said: “The path to tripling nuclear capacity is open, but it demands bold, pragmatic, and visionary leadership. Governments must act now, but the industry needs to deliver and work together with civil society. A cleaner more resilient future is within reach with nuclear energy. We need to move with purpose, investing in solutions that work to shape a tomorrow that is defined by reliability, innovation, and climate responsibility.”

“Tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050, can be achieved, provided governments take immediate and sustained action to deliver on their own national targets for nuclear capacity.”

According to the report global nuclear capacity could reach 1,428 GWe by 2050, exceeding the 1200 GWe target set in the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy set in 2023 at in September 2023 COP28 in Dubai.

Nuclear Opposition Groups Face the Realities of the 21st Century

Closer to home, here in the US sustained commitments to nuclear energy are visible with projects under way to bring five nuclear reactors back from the dead. While the economic drivers of these projects vary, all of them have targeted being in revenue service as quickly as possible, several in the next few years, to meet rapidly growing demand from data centers and other sources of electricity demand resulting from the closure of coal fired power plants. These efforts put the relicensing of Diablo Canyon in good company.

Opposition groups and some elected officials in California don’t like what they see. The implications of the restarts of five reactors, and relicensing of two more at Diablo Canyon, set the examples for future financial investment decisions in small modular reactors as well as potential new full size reactors. The resurgence of nuclear power called for by the World Nuclear Association’s global pledge by 33 nations is well underway in the U.S.

Wikipedia lists 80 anti-nuclear groups in the U.S. These are direct action, environmental, health, and public interest organizations who oppose nuclear weapons and/or nuclear power. It is a real head scratcher why in the middle of the second decade of the 21st century, opposition groups are working in California, Michigan, and other places to spike reactor restarts and prevent the development of SMRs are stuck in the middle of the last decades of the last century.

The 1980s and 1990s were dark decades for nuclear energy in terms of spanners tossed into the gears of nuclear R&D with the cancellation of the Integral Fast Reactor. Public fears driven by the Three Mile Island accident in March 1979 were energized by an anti-nuclear movie “The China Syndrome,” which was released just 12 days before the accident.

A lot of lessons have been learned since which is why flogging current reactor restarts with the sins of the past make little sense. Even Japan, with the effects of the Fukushima accident still in the news, is restarting closed reactors and is holding planned to complete reactors that were under construction in March 2011.

Five Reactor Restarts Lead the Way

There are the five reactors being restarted in the U.S. Every nuclear utility in the US is watching their progress towards revenue service especially to see what lessons can be learned about the market for large 1,000 MW+ reactors and demand for electricity based on the rapid growth of data centers and the closing of coal fired power plants.

Holtec – Work well underway for the restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan. According to recent press statements by Holtec, Palisades is on track to restart in early 2026. When it does, it will be the first nuclear plant in the United States to generate electricity again after being decommissioned.

A long-term power purchase agreement signed between Holtec Palisades Energy and the non-profit Wolverine Power Cooperative is a key economic driver of the restart effort. Under the multi-decade agreement,

Wolverine committed to purchasing two-thirds of the power generated from a reopened Palisades, with Wolverine’s partner Hoosier Energy purchasing the balance. It also includes a “contract expansion provision” to include one or two small modular reactors that Holtec plans for the site.

At the time it was taken out of service, the 805 MW Palisades reactor was licensed to operate until 2031. Holtec notified the NRC last year that it intends to apply for a second, or subsequent, license renewal for the plant during the first quarter of 2026. This would extend the plant’s operating period by a further 20 years, to 2051.

As the first mover for reactor restarts in the nation, Holtec has also attracted the most vigorous opposition to its plans. Beyond Nuclear, an anti-nuclear group in Michigan, is opposed to the restart and 20-year license extension of the plant.

It also attacked Holtec’s plans to build two 300 MW PWR type SMRs at the site. A coalition of opposition groups, as described in a 12/06/25 article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, label Holtec as being untrustworthy. Beyond Nuclear’s opposition to the restart of Palisades is long standing. In 2022 it called the project a “zombie reactor restart scheme.”

V.C. Summer – The most dramatic restart announcement of the year is the planned restart of the twin Westinghouse 1,150 MW AP1000s at the V.C. Summer plant in South Carolina. Brookfield, the Canadian private equity firm that holds a majority share of the ownership of Westinghouse, has been selected by South Carolina utility Santee Cooper to complete two partially built Westinghouse 1,150 MW AP1000 PWR type nuclear reactors.

Brookfield won the V.C. Summer development contract with the main factor being a commitment to paying down $2.7 billion of an existing $3.6 billion obligation Santee Cooper has on the site and sharing ownership and power. Ratepayers have been stuck with the debt since the project collapsed in 2017. Until now there were no prospects to complete the twin reactors.

Neither reactor is even 50% complete. As a result of the uncertainty associated with the cost to complete the two reactors, Westinghouse and its EPC will be expected to make project management and controls for costs and schedules job number one.

In terms of regulatory status, the NRC terminated the combined licenses for the two reactors in March 2019. Santee Cooper and Brookfield will have to submit new applications for construction and operating licenses under the NRC’s Part 50 process. The documentation from the previous COLs for both reactors should, to some extent, make life easier in terms of relicensing the the two units.

For now Brookfield and Santee Cooper are working out the feasibility issues that are a precursor to a final investment decision and bringing an EPC on board to complete the reactors.

Constellation Energy – Efforts to restart TMI-1 in Pennsylvania, now renamed as the Crane Clean Energy Center, is targeting 2027 for revenue service for the 819 MW reactor. A 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft is the incentive for the restart.

Duane Arnold – In March 2025 NextEra Energy filed paperwork with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) indicating its intent to restart the 600 MW Duane Arnold nuclear power plant which is located in Iowa. The reactor was shut down in 2020 after 45 years of operation. The utility has also reportedly communicated with regional grid operators about its plans to be a source of power for new data centers being built in Iowa.

In October 2025 the utility said the plant is targeted to be fully operational by the first quarter of 2029. A key economic driver of the restart is that Google and NextEra Energy sign a 25-year agreement for Duane Arnold’s energy, as well as an agreement to explore deployment of nuclear generation nationwide.

Public Opinion Remains High for Nuclear Energy

According to Bisconti Research, Inc. the American public overall has a favorable view of nuclear energy. Here are some highlights from the 2025 report.

72% favor nuclear energy vs. 28% who oppose. The 2025 National Nuclear Energy Public Opinion Survey finds continued highly favorable public opinion of nuclear energy, despite a slight drop since 2024. Four decades ago, the numbers for favor and oppose were about even.

29% strongly favor nuclear energy vs. 6% who strongly oppose. Those who strongly favor nuclear energy outnumber those who strongly oppose by 5 to 1.

Chart: Bisconti Research, Inc.

Opinions are not polarized. The myth of polarized public opinion about nuclear energy is a thing of the past. A majority of Americans are fence-sitters on nuclear energy. They somewhat favor or somewhat oppose nuclear energy, with more tending to favor. Among persons with a strong opinion, those in favor outnumber those opposed by 5 to 1.

87% support license renewal, and 64% would build more plants. Opinions about license renewal for “nuclear power plants that continue to meet federal safety standards” and for “definitely building more nuclear power plants” also are favorable in 2025.

Since these questions were first asked in 1998, most of the public has agreed with license renewal of nuclear power plants that meet federal safety standards. In contrast, barely half the public (47% in 1998) supported definitely building more nuclear power plants. Those agreeing that we should definitely build more plants rose in recent years to a high of 72%. While that number fell 7 points between 2024 and 2025, it remains high.

A Call to Action for the US Nuclear Industry

The Bisconti report contains data that should be taken as a call to action by the U.S. nuclear industry.

According to the Bisconti report,one of the reasons why so many Americans take middle positions on nuclear energy is that they don’t feel very well informed about this energy source.

In 2025, only 15% feel very well informed on the topic, 47% somewhat well informed, 31% not too well informed, and 7% not at all well informed. The correlation between the level of feeling informed and attitudes is striking. Among those who feel very well informed about nuclear energy, 66% are strongly favorable and only 6% are strongly opposed.

Chart: Bisconti Research, Inc.

It is time for the nuclear industry’s trade organizations as well as scientific and educational organizations to ramp up their efforts to inform the public about the current progress being made with reactor restarts and the potential for entirely new builds of small modular reactors, advanced reactors of all sizes, and new 1,000 MW+ units.

A Strategic Reset, Not a Retreat The end of the Ford–SK On joint venture does not signal an abandonment of electric vehicles.","DEARBORN — Ford Motor Co. and South Korean battery manufacturer SK On are unwinding one of the most ambitious electric-vehicle bets of the past decade, ending their $11.4 billion joint venture to build EV battery plants in the United States as demand for electric vehicles softens and federal policy signals shift.

The move marks a sharp reversal from 2021, when Ford and SK On announced plans to construct multiple battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, a deal that was widely seen as a cornerstone of Ford’s long-term electrification strategy. At the time, soaring EV sales projections, generous federal incentives and tightening fuel economy standards pushed automakers to move aggressively into battery production.

Four years later, the EV landscape looks far more uncertain.

EV Market Hits a Reality Check

Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. have slowed through 2025, with battery-electric vehicles accounting for less than 10 percent of new light-duty vehicle sales. After years of double-digit growth, EV sales have flattened and, in some months, fallen sharply year over year.

Industry analysts point to a combination of factors: the rollback or narrowing of federal EV tax credits, high interest rates that have pushed monthly payments higher, and ongoing consumer concerns about charging infrastructure and resale values. At the same time, revised federal fuel-economy standards are expected to give gasoline and hybrid vehicles more breathing room, easing pressure on automakers to rapidly expand all-electric lineups.

Hybrids, which offer improved fuel efficiency without the need for charging, have gained market share faster than full battery-electric vehicles — a trend automakers are now leaning into.

How the Breakup Will Work

Under the terms of the dissolution:

SK On will take full control of the Tennessee battery facility, known as the BlueOval plant.

Ford will assume ownership of two adjacent battery plants in Kentucky, previously part of the joint venture.

SK On formally initiated the move to dissolve the partnership but says it plans to continue working with Ford around the Tennessee facility. The company says operating independently will allow it to improve productivity, increase operational flexibility and accelerate growth in its North American energy storage business.

Federal Loan Reassessed

The breakup also triggers a reassessment of a government loan originally approved at up to $9.6 billion to support the joint venture. Under the current administration, the loan is being restructured and reduced to limit taxpayer exposure and ensure faster repayment.

According to Bloomberg, the revised structure is designed to “reduce exposure to taxpayers and ensure prompt repayment.” Ford is working voluntarily with the U.S. Department of Energy to repay its portion more quickly than initially planned.

Ford’s EV Losses Mount

The decision comes as Ford continues to absorb heavy losses in its EV business. The automaker lost $5.1 billion before interest and taxes on its electric-vehicle operations in 2024 and expects losses to grow in 2025.

Chief executive Jim Farley has warned that under current market and policy conditions, U.S. EV sales could fall by as much as 50 percent, forcing automakers to slow investment and refocus on profitability.

“We believe the writing was on the wall this partnership was not going to work moving forward,” Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives told the Detroit Free Press. “Ford has to make some difficult moves, and this was a smart strategic one to rip the band-aid off.”

Michigan Impact: What It Means at Home

For Michigan, the breakup underscores the uneven pace of the EV transition — and the growing tension between long-term electrification goals and near-term economic realities.

Michigan remains the epicenter of U.S. auto manufacturing, with billions invested in EV assembly plants, battery research, and supplier retooling. But as EV sales slow, suppliers across the state face longer production timelines and increased uncertainty around volume forecasts.

Utilities and regulators are also watching closely. Large-scale EV and battery investments have raised concerns about electric grid capacity, infrastructure costs, and ratepayer impacts, issues that have already sparked pushback in rural Michigan communities where data centers and energy-intensive facilities are proposed.

At the same time, Ford and other automakers are signaling a renewed emphasis on hybrids and advanced internal-combustion technologies — segments that support existing Michigan jobs while buying time for EV markets to mature.

A Strategic Reset, Not a Retreat

The end of the Ford–SK On joint venture does not signal an abandonment of electric vehicles. Instead, it reflects a broader recalibration underway across the auto industry as companies adjust to slower adoption, shifting policy priorities and the need for tighter capital discipline.

Battery makers are increasingly cautious about overcapacity, while automakers are dialing back the scale and pace of EV investments once assumed to be inevitable. In that context, the breakup stands as a clear marker of how quickly the EV boom has cooled — and how pragmatism is replacing ambition as the industry charts its next phase.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FordSKEV.webp,N,,2025-12-14 12:00:03.180860

With utility bills on the rise, most homeowners are increasingly looking for ways to cut down their power bills. Depending on where you live, you may find yourself at a crossroads, wondering whether switching to a heat pump is worth the cost. They are known for being more costly to install than conventional HVAC systems, but they can be cost-effective over time, reducing your power consumption by a staggering 75%, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Plus, they always pull double duty year-round, allowing homeowners to heat and cool their homes with the same setup.

But despite their massive perks, if you've spent your time scrolling through online forums that talk about heat pump upgrades, you've probably come across a statement like, ""heat pumps don't work in cold weather."" And given that this claim is repeated so often, you might take it as a fact. But is it truly factual? The simple answer is no, although it is a myth that used to be true.

Heat pumps are typically vulnerable during harsh winters. After all, they usually keep your home warm when temperatures drop by extracting heat from the outside air and transferring it indoors. This means that when it gets cold enough to freeze, the pumps will have little to no heat to absorb, reducing their efficiency. Older models struggled with this issue, but great strides have been made to make it easier for heat pumps to extract sufficient heat from freezing outdoor air, more efficiently than before.

Generally speaking, modern heat pumps are a completely different story from those of the '80s and '90s, and even some of the early 2000s. Today's cold-climate models, like the Mitsubishi Hyper-Heating FX-Series (available on Amazon), feature advanced technology that provides warmth for your home even when the temperature outside dips below -13 degrees Fahrenheit. These models are specifically built to maintain strong heating output during extreme cold months, thanks to inverter-driven compressors and advanced refrigerants.

However, it's worth noting that although cold-climate heat pumps might still operate at 100% capacity, they will typically cost more. If you're trying to keep your home comfortable across all seasons while avoiding skyrocketing bills, you'll probably want to consider a hybrid heat pump. As a hybrid, this model comes with two systems: an electric heat pump that handles your heating needs when outdoor temperatures are mild to moderate and a furnace that can save the day when conditions are frigid.

Even beyond the ""heat pumps don't work in cold weather"" myth, there is still a ton of misinformation out there about these energy-saving appliances. Money is always a major factor when considering which type of heating system to get, and unfortunately, the idea that heat pumps are affordable is one concept that people don't believe. While there's some veracity to the idea that they're prohibitively expensive — hybrid and cold-climate models carry a higher upfront cost than standard models — but it's not true in all situations. After all, when you factor in home energy rebates, tax credits under programs like the Inflation Reduction Act, and energy savings, a modern heat pump will suddenly become much more affordable since the installation costs will be slashed by hundreds or thousands of dollars.

You might also hear the misconception that heat pumps are quite noisy. While this might have been true a few decades ago (since older units have a reputation for rattling and whining), today's pumps are built to run with a low hum. In fact, most operate at 40–60 decibel levels, which is similar to that of a refrigerator or a normal conversation. There is also the issue of maintenance. You might believe that heat pumps are more difficult and expensive to maintain than standard systems. But that's not true. Their upkeep is the same as that of a standard HVAC system. You'll just need to clean or replace the air filters, schedule annual maintenance service, and keep the outdoor unit clean.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/dont-believe-this-extremely-common-heat-pump-myth/l-intro-1765452877.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 11:02:53.205423

El Paso Electric is evaluating the panel’s recommendation, the utility said in a statement.
The judges said El Paso Electric’s proposed shareholder profit margin made up $38 million of the total requested rate increase.
El Paso Electric sought to change the solar customer fee – which would have likely resulted in an increase to rooftop solar customers.
“Regarding New Mexico, we have not yet finalized our filing, the revenue requirement or calculated residential customer impacts,” El Paso Electric said in its statement.","The proposed bill increase by El Paso Electric that could take effect next year may be decreased after a panel of judges overseeing the utility’s rate case sided with customers and suggested moderating it.

A final decision on the rate increase by the state’s Public Utility Commission likely won’t come until February. But the judges on Dec. 7 issued a proposal for decision – a recommendation for the state’s public utility commissioners – that argued El Paso Electric is asking to make too much profit off customers.

Instead of authorizing the requested shareholder profit margin of 10.7%, the PUC should approve an allowed return of 9.4% that’s close to the utility’s current authorized profit margin.

El Paso Electric is evaluating the panel’s recommendation, the utility said in a statement.

“Because this is an ongoing regulatory proceeding, we are not in a position to comment on specific recommendations included in the Proposal for Decision, including customer charge levels, return on equity, revenue requirement adjustments, or the treatment of distributed generation customers,” the utility said.

Since it filed to raise rates in January, El Paso Electric has argued it needs to collect about $85 million more annually from customers to pay off $1.55 billion in various investments it made between 2021 and 2024, such as the $217 million Newman 6 power plant unit that started operating in 2023.

Monopoly utilities can’t set their own rates. Instead, utilities have to seek approval from state public utility commissions to raise their rates to recover money they’ve spent on investments such as substations or power plants – plus their authorized profit margin.

The judges said El Paso Electric’s proposed shareholder profit margin made up $38 million of the total requested rate increase.

El Paso Electric’s original request would raise average monthly bills from $96 to $118.

It’s difficult to calculate how the recommendation from the judges overseeing the case would impact bills, but it’s likely the increase will be lower than the $22 proposed if the PUC adopts the recommended decision when commissioners vote early next year.

The judges recommended the PUC hold the flat monthly customer charge at $9.25 rather than the proposed $13.71. That would take off $4.46 of the proposed $22 per month increase. And if the PUC approves the 9.4% shareholder profit margin over the 10.7%, it would mean a smaller increase for customers.

A big part of the rate case involves what to do with customers who have rooftop solar panels. The utility currently charges a $30 minimum bill for rooftop solar customers, arguing they still rely on the grid when their panels aren’t producing electricity.

El Paso Electric sought to change the solar customer fee – which would have likely resulted in an increase to rooftop solar customers. But the judges recommended keeping the current fee in place and said the utility hasn’t studied closely enough how those customers affect the electric grid and the utility’s costs.

A coalition of pro-solar organizations known as the Joint Solar Advocates weighed in on the ruling, saying they largely supported the judges’ conclusions.

“The Joint Solar Advocates are generally supportive of the outcome in the recommended decision,” the group said in a statement to El Paso Matters. “Importantly, the (case’s judges) agreed that there is no cost-basis for a unique demand charge on customers that choose to install their own solar panels to meet part of their electricity needs.”

The solar advocates – which include the national nonprofit Solar United Neighbors and other pro-rooftop solar groups such as Public Citizen and Amanecer Peoples’ Project – say El Paso Electric should conduct a detailed study to look at the benefits rooftop solar customers bring as a decentralized source of electricity generation. And they want the utility to pay customers more for the electricity their panels produce.

That kind of study “is what’s really needed so that EPE and customers can make a more informed decision on adopting rooftop solar,” the joint statement said. “The study will also speak to the appropriateness of EPE’s minimum bill for solar customers, and the utility’s compensation rate for those customers’ energy exports back to the grid.”

Separately, El Paso Electric told the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission that it plans to apply to raise rates for its customers in New Mexico in February, likely after the Texas rate case is resolved. The utility in 2024 had more than 459,000 customers, including 107,000 New Mexico customers, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

El Paso Electric didn’t provide details yet to the NMPRC about what the rate increase in New Mexico could look like – for example, whether rates would rise more for residential, commercial or big industrial customers.

However, in the utility’s Texas rate case, El Paso Electric said it needs to bring in $140.7 million more from all of its customers, annually, to cover the cost of investments and operations, including $85.7 million more from all of its Texas customers. That would indicate the utility needs to collect about $55 million more from its New Mexico customers – a 38% increase in revenue.

“Regarding New Mexico, we have not yet finalized our filing, the revenue requirement or calculated residential customer impacts,” El Paso Electric said in its statement.

El Paso Electric plans to spend $4.4 billion in capital projects over the next five years as spending across the U.S. utility industry has accelerated rapidly in recent years.

Most of that spending is driven largely by the construction boom of power-hungry data centers and increased electricity demand for air conditioning in homes and businesses caused by climate change and higher average temperatures.

The worldwide move toward renewable energy is gaining momentum, propelled by urgent climate concerns and legislative measures such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). At the heart of this shift are American universities, which are not only advancing scientific breakthroughs but also preparing the workforce and influencing investment patterns in the green economy.

With jobs in renewable energy expanding at twice the pace of the broader labor market, the connection between education, workforce training, and financial investment is becoming a key driver in the sector’s evolution.

Academic Programs: Catalysts for Renewable Innovation

Universities across the United States have become vital centers for renewable energy education, offering programs that bridge engineering, policy, and digital innovation. Leading institutions such as MIT and Stanford are at the forefront, with initiatives like MIT’s Energy Initiative and Stanford’s Doerr School of Sustainability fueling advancements in solar technology, fusion research, and sustainable systems.

Other universities, including UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, are making strides in solar efficiency and bioenergy research, while the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Michigan are focused on modernizing the power grid and enhancing energy storage capabilities.

Beyond technical training, schools like Southwestern University and the University of Minnesota, Morris, are weaving renewable energy into campus life, achieving complete reliance on renewable electricity through Renewable Energy Credits. These campuses serve as real-world testbeds, equipping students with practical experience while showcasing scalable solutions.

Building the Workforce: Addressing Skills Shortages

The rapid expansion of clean energy has led to a significant demand for skilled professionals, especially in fields such as solar installation, wind turbine maintenance, and energy storage engineering. To meet this need, universities are partnering with industry and government agencies. For example, the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office supports initiatives like Bright Solar Futures in Philadelphia, which prepares high schoolers and young adults for careers in solar installation. The Gulf Research Program has also invested millions in projects like the Texas Green Careers Academy, helping residents in Gulf States transition into clean energy roles.

Community colleges and technical schools are equally important. The Solar Energy Industries Association works with these institutions to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) in the workforce. Meanwhile, platforms such as IREC’s Green Workforce Connect link job seekers with training and employment opportunities. State programs, like Maryland’s Offshore Wind Workforce Training, further demonstrate how local efforts are broadening access to clean energy careers.

Employment Growth and Ongoing Challenges

Today, more than 3.6 million Americans work in the renewable energy sector, with solar energy supporting over 7 million jobs worldwide. The IRA has spurred over $300 billion in clean energy investments, resulting in hundreds of thousands of new positions in solar, wind, and battery manufacturing. According to the 2024 U.S. Energy and Employment Report, clean energy jobs grew by 4.2% in 2023, outpacing the overall economy.

Despite this growth, the sector faces persistent hurdles. There is a notable shortage of skilled workers in construction and manufacturing, particularly as experienced tradespeople retire. The need for hybrid expertise—combining technical know-how with digital skills like energy analytics and artificial intelligence—is also increasing. Academic programs are evolving to meet these demands, but scaling up will require ongoing investment and supportive policies.

Investment Patterns: Universities as Innovation Hubs

Research conducted by academic institutions is increasingly shaping investment strategies in the clean energy space. For example, financial analyses from Duke University have influenced approaches to sustainable infrastructure. Tax incentives from the IRA have enabled colleges, such as Roxbury Community College, to launch geothermal and solar projects.

Private investors are also taking notice. As renewable technologies become more affordable, collaborations between universities and private partners are driving innovation in areas like energy storage and hydrogen solutions. However, the recent cancellation of funding for more than 200 energy projects by the Department of Energy highlights the sector’s sensitivity to policy changes.

Spotlight on University-Led Initiatives

Rowan University’s Green Jobs Academy offers adaptable training paths for students and workers, working closely with industry to develop credentials and degrees tailored to green careers.

University of Maryland Eastern Shore pairs a 2.1-megawatt solar installation with its Green Collar Initiative, providing renewable energy training to rural communities.

Princeton University’s geo-exchange system utilizes ground-source heat pumps to achieve net-zero emissions by 2046, showcasing the potential of university-led infrastructure projects.

These examples demonstrate how higher education institutions are not only preparing future leaders but also delivering measurable environmental and economic benefits.

Looking Ahead: Sustaining Progress in Renewable Energy

The U.S. renewable energy industry is at a pivotal moment. Academic programs are crucial for developing talent and fostering innovation, but maintaining progress will depend on continued policy backing, collaboration between public and private sectors, and ensuring equitable access to training and investment. As the industry continues to evolve, universities will play a central role in building a robust and inclusive green economy.",,N,,2025-12-14 12:00:07.417696

At the heart of this shift are American universities, which are not only advancing scientific breakthroughs but also preparing the workforce and influencing investment patterns in the green economy.

With jobs in renewable energy expanding at twice the pace of the broader labor market, the connection between education, workforce training, and financial investment is becoming a key driver in the sector’s evolution.

Academic Programs: Catalysts for Renewable Innovation

Universities across the United States have become vital centers for renewable energy education, offering programs that bridge engineering, policy, and digital innovation. Leading institutions such as MIT and Stanford are at the forefront, with initiatives like MIT’s Energy Initiative and Stanford’s Doerr School of Sustainability fueling advancements in solar technology, fusion research, and sustainable systems.

Other universities, including UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, are making strides in solar efficiency and bioenergy research, while the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Michigan are focused on modernizing the power grid and enhancing energy storage capabilities.

Beyond technical training, schools like Southwestern University and the University of Minnesota, Morris, are weaving renewable energy into campus life, achieving complete reliance on renewable electricity through Renewable Energy Credits. These campuses serve as real-world testbeds, equipping students with practical experience while showcasing scalable solutions.

Building the Workforce: Addressing Skills Shortages

The rapid expansion of clean energy has led to a significant demand for skilled professionals, especially in fields such as solar installation, wind turbine maintenance, and energy storage engineering. To meet this need, universities are partnering with industry and government agencies. For example, the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office supports initiatives like Bright Solar Futures in Philadelphia, which prepares high schoolers and young adults for careers in solar installation. The Gulf Research Program has also invested millions in projects like the Texas Green Careers Academy, helping residents in Gulf States transition into clean energy roles.

Community colleges and technical schools are equally important. The Solar Energy Industries Association works with these institutions to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) in the workforce. Meanwhile, platforms such as IREC’s Green Workforce Connect link job seekers with training and employment opportunities. State programs, like Maryland’s Offshore Wind Workforce Training, further demonstrate how local efforts are broadening access to clean energy careers.

Employment Growth and Ongoing Challenges

Today, more than 3.6 million Americans work in the renewable energy sector, with solar energy supporting over 7 million jobs worldwide. The IRA has spurred over $300 billion in clean energy investments, resulting in hundreds of thousands of new positions in solar, wind, and battery manufacturing. According to the 2024 U.S. Energy and Employment Report, clean energy jobs grew by 4.2% in 2023, outpacing the overall economy.

Despite this growth, the sector faces persistent hurdles. There is a notable shortage of skilled workers in construction and manufacturing, particularly as experienced tradespeople retire. The need for hybrid expertise—combining technical know-how with digital skills like energy analytics and artificial intelligence—is also increasing. Academic programs are evolving to meet these demands, but scaling up will require ongoing investment and supportive policies.

Investment Patterns: Universities as Innovation Hubs

Research conducted by academic institutions is increasingly shaping investment strategies in the clean energy space. For example, financial analyses from Duke University have influenced approaches to sustainable infrastructure. Tax incentives from the IRA have enabled colleges, such as Roxbury Community College, to launch geothermal and solar projects.

Private investors are also taking notice. As renewable technologies become more affordable, collaborations between universities and private partners are driving innovation in areas like energy storage and hydrogen solutions. However, the recent cancellation of funding for more than 200 energy projects by the Department of Energy highlights the sector’s sensitivity to policy changes.

Spotlight on University-Led Initiatives

Rowan University’s Green Jobs Academy offers adaptable training paths for students and workers, working closely with industry to develop credentials and degrees tailored to green careers.

University of Maryland Eastern Shore pairs a 2.1-megawatt solar installation with its Green Collar Initiative, providing renewable energy training to rural communities.

Princeton University’s geo-exchange system utilizes ground-source heat pumps to achieve net-zero emissions by 2046, showcasing the potential of university-led infrastructure projects.

These examples demonstrate how higher education institutions are not only preparing future leaders but also delivering measurable environmental and economic benefits.

Looking Ahead: Sustaining Progress in Renewable Energy

The U.S. renewable energy industry is at a pivotal moment. Academic programs are crucial for developing talent and fostering innovation, but maintaining progress will depend on continued policy backing, collaboration between public and private sectors, and ensuring equitable access to training and investment. As the industry continues to evolve, universities will play a central role in building a robust and inclusive green economy.",https://img.bgstatic.com/video/open_graph_new.png,N,,2025-12-14 11:59:59.785647

Global EV sales growth slowed to 20% in 2025 from 40% the prior year, per International Energy Agency data.
But with sales teetering, 2025 serves as a critical test of resilience in an industry where innovation alone may not suffice.","As Tesla Inc. navigates a turbulent 2025, the electric-vehicle giant finds itself in a precarious position, racing against time to stem a potential second consecutive year of declining sales. Recent data paints a stark picture: U.S. sales plummeted to under 40,000 units in November, marking the lowest monthly figure in nearly four years. This downturn comes despite aggressive discounting and the introduction of more affordable models, underscoring deeper issues within the company and the broader market for battery-powered cars. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, has been vocal about external pressures, but insiders and analysts point to a mix of internal missteps and shifting consumer sentiments.

The expiration of federal EV tax credits at the end of 2024 has exacerbated the situation, removing a key incentive that once buoyed demand. Tesla responded by slashing prices on its flagship Model 3 and Model Y, rolling out “Standard” variants priced as low as $35,000 to attract budget-conscious buyers. Yet, these moves have failed to ignite sales, with estimates from Cox Automotive showing a 20% drop from October’s figures. According to a report in Reuters, even the Cybertruck, Tesla’s much-hyped electric pickup, has underperformed, contributing only marginally to overall volume.

Musk has attributed some of the blame to broader economic factors, including high interest rates and a slowdown in global EV adoption. On social media platform X, formerly Twitter, he has posted about supply chain constraints echoing past challenges, such as chip shortages that hampered production in previous years. However, critics argue that Tesla’s aging lineup—dominated by models like the Model 3 and Y, which haven’t seen major refreshes in years—has left the company vulnerable to fresher competition from rivals like BYD Co. and Ford Motor Co.

Aggressive Discounts and Their Limits

In a bid to reverse the slide, Tesla has unleashed a flurry of promotions, including zero-interest financing for up to 72 months on select models and referral bonuses worth thousands in credits. These incentives, detailed in a recent article from Business Insider, aim to clear inventory and boost deliveries before year-end. The company is targeting a narrow window to surpass 2024’s sales total of about 1.8 million vehicles globally, but with only weeks left, the math looks daunting. Analysts project that without a miraculous December surge, Tesla could see its first back-to-back annual declines since its early days as a startup.

This strategy isn’t new for Tesla; price cuts have been a hallmark of Musk’s playbook, often used to stimulate demand during lulls. But the current environment differs. The end of tax credits has leveled the playing field, making Tesla’s offerings less competitively priced against gasoline vehicles, especially as oil prices stabilize. Moreover, consumer hesitation stems from concerns over charging infrastructure and range anxiety, issues that Tesla’s Supercharger network has mitigated but not eliminated entirely.

Adding to the complexity, Musk’s public persona and political involvements have alienated some potential buyers. Surveys from industry groups indicate that a portion of the liberal-leaning EV buyer base has soured on the brand amid Musk’s outspoken support for certain policies and figures. While Tesla maintains a loyal following, this backlash has contributed to softer demand in key markets like California, where sales dipped 15% year-over-year in the third quarter.

Global Pressures and Competitive Shifts

Expanding beyond the U.S., Tesla’s international performance tells a similar story of strain. In China, the world’s largest EV market, sales fell 6% in November, per data referenced in posts on X, as local players like BYD undercut prices with government-backed incentives. Europe hasn’t fared much better, with a 30% drop attributed to regulatory hurdles and economic slowdowns. A piece in The Times of India highlights how cheaper Tesla variants failed to spark interest, even as the company ramped up production at its Shanghai Gigafactory.

Musk has downplayed these figures, emphasizing long-term bets on autonomy and artificial intelligence. In recent X posts, he reiterated Tesla’s focus on self-driving technology, predicting that software updates like Full Self-Driving (FSD) version 13 will revolutionize the industry. Yet, regulatory scrutiny from bodies like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration continues to delay widespread deployment, limiting FSD’s revenue potential in the short term.

Competitors are capitalizing on Tesla’s vulnerabilities. Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. have introduced models with superior range and luxury features, while traditional automakers like General Motors Co. push affordable EVs subsidized by their vast dealer networks. Tesla’s reliance on direct sales, while innovative, leaves it exposed in regions with poor online penetration or where physical showrooms matter.

Internal Challenges and Leadership Focus

Inside Tesla, the sales slump has prompted a reevaluation of priorities. Musk, who juggles roles at SpaceX, xAI, and now advisory positions in the U.S. government, has admitted to stretching thin. X posts from earlier this year reveal his return to “sleeping in conference rooms” to oversee critical projects, including Starship launches and AI integrations. This divided attention, some executives whisper, has slowed decision-making on new vehicle development, such as the long-awaited affordable “Model 2” compact car.

Financially, the picture is mixed. While vehicle sales falter, Tesla’s energy storage business—bolstered by Megapack batteries—posted record revenues, offsetting some automotive losses. Stock investors, as noted in a report from Parameter, seem unfazed, with shares rising 3% despite the November data, betting on AI-driven growth over traditional carmaking.

Critics, however, warn that ignoring core automotive execution could prove costly. Aging factories and supply chain bottlenecks, reminiscent of 2021’s chip crisis that Musk publicly lamented, persist. Tesla’s Fremont plant, for instance, operates below capacity, hampered by labor disputes and parts shortages.

Strategic Pivots and Future Bets

To counter these headwinds, Tesla is doubling down on innovation. The company plans to unveil a revamped Model Y in 2026, incorporating advanced battery tech for longer range and faster charging. Musk has teased robotaxi services as a game-changer, potentially generating billions in recurring revenue once regulatory hurdles clear. Insights from Electrek suggest that without tax credits, Tesla may lobby for new incentives or explore partnerships with governments to subsidize infrastructure.

Yet, skepticism abounds. Analysts from firms like Morgan Stanley question whether these futuristic bets can sustain the company through immediate sales droughts. The Cybertruck’s production ramp-up, plagued by quality issues, exemplifies the risks: initial hype gave way to recalls and customer complaints, further denting brand perception.

Musk’s leadership style—bold, unfiltered, and often controversial—remains a double-edged sword. His X commentary on topics ranging from population decline to AI supremacy keeps Tesla in the headlines, but it also invites scrutiny. For instance, recent posts defending Tesla’s autonomy edge over rivals like Waymo have rallied fans, yet failed to translate into sales momentum.

Market Realities and Consumer Sentiment

Broader market dynamics reveal a maturing EV sector where early adopter enthusiasm wanes. Global EV sales growth slowed to 20% in 2025 from 40% the prior year, per International Energy Agency data. Tesla, once the undisputed leader, now holds about 15% market share, squeezed by hybrids that offer a bridge for hesitant buyers.

Consumer surveys, including those cited in Torque News, point to Musk’s polarizing politics as a factor in brand aversion. One respondent quipped that buying a Tesla feels like “endorsing a worldview,” prompting some to opt for alternatives like the Chevrolet Bolt or Hyundai Ioniq.

Despite these challenges, Tesla’s ecosystem—encompassing solar products, home batteries, and a vast charging network—provides a moat. The company’s vertical integration allows for cost efficiencies that peers envy, potentially enabling deeper discounts without eroding margins entirely.

Path Forward Amid Uncertainty

Looking ahead, Tesla must balance short-term fixes with long-term vision. Insiders suggest accelerating the Model 2 launch to under $25,000 could recapture entry-level buyers, especially in emerging markets. Musk has hinted at this in X discussions, stressing the need for volume production to replace the global fleet of internal-combustion vehicles.

Regulatory environments will play a pivotal role. In the U.S., potential policy shifts under new administrations could reinstate incentives, while Europe’s stringent emissions rules might favor EVs. Tesla’s Berlin Gigafactory expansion aims to tap this, targeting 1 million annual units by 2027.

Ultimately, Tesla’s fate hinges on execution. As Musk refocuses on core operations, the company could emerge stronger, leveraging its tech prowess to outpace rivals. But with sales teetering, 2025 serves as a critical test of resilience in an industry where innovation alone may not suffice.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-3828-1765673699.jpeg,N,,2025-12-14 10:01:22.464901

Driving sustainable practices in manufacturing

Julie Chapman, head of manufacturing and engineering at Duncan & Toplis explains

AS Photography on Pexels.com

Sustainability and environmental responsibility have shifted from being a ‘nice to have’ to an essential part of business strategy. For manufacturers, this isn’t just about meeting expectations —it is about staying competitive and aligning with the UK’s ambition to reach net zero by 2050.

Julie Chapman, head of manufacturing and engineering at Duncan & Toplis, said: “Manufacturing is an extremely energy-intensive industry.” Government data shows the sector emitted around 71 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2023, making decarbonisation a significant challenge. Yet, with Industry 5.0 ushering in a new era, technology is transforming the way manufacturers operate sustainably.

Introduced in 2021 as the ‘5th Industrial Revolution’, Industry 5.0 goes beyond connectivity and automation to address sustainability and societal impact. Ms Chapman explained: “It is not just about contributing to a healthier planet — environmentally driven practices can streamline processes, future-proof strategies and secure financial growth.” Across the UK, manufacturers are embedding sustainability into everyday operations, from factory floors to supply chains, to minimise environmental impact and conserve resources for future generations.

Technology plays a pivotal role in this transformation. Industry 5.0 emphasises collaboration between robotics, bionics and people, creating ultra-modern facilities where automation drives efficiency. By leveraging AI and the Internet of Things, manufacturers can reduce energy consumption, minimise waste through precision, and optimise supply chains. Highlighting how innovation is reshaping traditional workflows, Ms Chapman added: “Processes are becoming smarter and leaner.”

Renewable energy adoption

Reshoring is another trend gaining momentum. Encouraging UK production not only supports local economies but also delivers environmental benefits by reducing transportation emissions. Producing goods closer to where they are consumed cuts reliance on carbon-intensive global supply chains and strengthens the UK’s commitment to ‘net zero’. Renewable energy adoption is also accelerating, with manufacturers increasingly turning to wind, solar and hydro power. Significant investment in offshore wind, carbon capture and hydrogen technologies promises even greater progress in the years ahead.

Sustainability now begins at the design stage. Manufacturers are sourcing raw materials responsibly and prioritising recyclable or recycled components. Packaging is evolving too, with cardboard and paper replacing plastics to reduce environmental impact. Transport and logistics remain critical, as travel miles contribute heavily to emissions. Switching to electric or hybrid vehicles, alternative fuels like biodiesel, and even high-speed rail are helping manufacturers cut their carbon footprint.

The benefits of these changes extend beyond ecology to economics.

Improving efficiency through technology, reducing reliance on global supply chains and embracing renewable energy all lead to cost savings. Ms Chapman continued: “The case for ecological is also the case for economical.” Innovative solutions that reduce environmental impact can also unlock tax relief opportunities. The Government offers R&D tax incentives for businesses tackling scientific or technological challenges, whether by creating new processes or improving existing ones. These measures not only reduce tax liabilities but also build financial resilience, enabling reinvestment and continuous improvement.

The 2026 CAP Implementation Grant application round resulted in 222 approved projects that counties may complete over the next 12 to 24 months, resulting in an estimated reduction of more than 113,493 pounds/year of nitrogen, 28,816 pounds/year of phosphorus, and 11.8 million pounds/year of sediment delivered to the Chesapeake Bay. Pennsylvania has reduced more than 10 times the amount of nitrogen in the past 5 years than in the previous ten years, and water quality monitoring data shows significant improvements in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment levels.

“Pennsylvania’s clean water successes are rooted in collaboration—state, local, federal, legislative, and non-governmental partners, and of course landowners,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “The work will continue to evolve, and our focus will remain on setting our collaborative partnerships up for success well beyond 2025. The momentum is real, and you can see it in our improved water quality.”

The Chesapeake Executive Council is composed of the Governors of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the Chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At the meeting the Chesapeake Executive Council also approved the revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. The refreshed Watershed Agreement commits signatories to address nutrient and sediment goals and outcomes by 2040, with a midpoint assessment in 2033, coinciding with the 50-year anniversary of the Chesapeake Bay Program. Under the Shapiro Administration, Pennsylvania has accelerated progress toward its clean water goals by investing new financial resources, targeting high performing pollution reduction strategies, implementing innovative technical solutions, listening to local leaders and stakeholders, and providing sustained support to implement county-based action plans.

The 2025 CAP Implementation Grants include $9.5 million from the state Environmental Stewardship Fund and $6.2 million in federal funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including $1.1 million in Local Government Implementation (LGI) Funds for project implementation in the Octoraro Watershed in Chester and Lancaster counties. The LGI projects will be reported to support pollution reduction goals under the multi-jurisdictional Conowingo Watershed Implementation Plan, which aims to reduces pollution entering the Chesapeake Bay from the Conowingo Dam reservoir.

Through an innovative new arrangement, the block grant funding model of the CAP Implementation Grant has enabled DEP’s Bureau of Clean Water to provide $100,000 of 604(b) Clean Water Act planning funds to Mifflin County in support of restoration of the Town Run Watershed and $114,000 of federal Chesapeake Bay Implementation Grant funding through the Bureau of Watershed Restoration and Nonpoint Source Management for restoration efforts in the Hammer Creek Watershed. This is the first time the 604(b) Clean Water Act planning funds have been targeted through a partnership between DEP programs toward the Countywide Action Plans.

The electric vehicle sector, once hailed as the unstoppable force reshaping transportation, is facing its most significant headwinds yet in 2025. Global sales of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles have shown signs of deceleration, with particular weakness in key markets like North America. This shift comes amid economic pressures, policy changes, and intensifying competition from Chinese manufacturers. According to recent data, while overall global sales grew modestly by about 21% to 18.5 million units this year, the pace has slowed compared to previous explosive growth periods, driven largely by surges in Europe but offset by stagnation elsewhere.

In the United States, the removal of federal tax credits has dealt a severe blow to demand. Tesla, the longtime market leader, saw its U.S. sales plummet to a near four-year low in November, dropping roughly 23% year-over-year to around 39,800 vehicles. This decline persists despite the company’s efforts to introduce more affordable models. Broader industry figures paint a similar picture: North American EV sales are on track for their first annual drop since 2019, with growth decelerating sharply after subsidies were phased out.

Chinese giants like BYD, however, continue to dominate on a global scale. BYD overtook Tesla in battery-electric vehicle deliveries back in the fourth quarter of 2023 and has maintained its lead, capturing a 15.4% share of the global BEV market in the third quarter of 2025. This success stems from aggressive pricing, rapid model launches, and strong domestic performance, even as China’s overall market approaches saturation.

Shifting Dynamics in Major Markets

The divergence between regions highlights the uneven progress of EV adoption. In Europe, sales have surged, contributing significantly to the global uptick. Factors such as stringent emissions regulations and renewed incentives have propelled growth, with battery-electric vehicles leading over plug-in hybrids in the mix through the first nine months of 2025. Reports from Autovista24 detail how brands like Volkswagen and emerging players have capitalized on this momentum, pushing BEV registrations ahead.

Contrast this with the U.S., where the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit has chilled consumer interest. Industry analysts note that without these incentives, many potential buyers are opting for traditional hybrids or sticking with internal combustion engines. Tesla’s struggles are emblematic: despite rolling out cheaper variants of its Model 3 and Model Y, the company has failed to reverse the sales skid. Exclusive estimates shared with Reuters underscore this, showing November figures as the lowest since early 2022.

Meanwhile, China’s market, which accounts for over half of global EV sales, is showing signs of plateauing. BYD and peers like Geely Holdings have expanded aggressively, with BYD securing approvals for 38 new models in China this year alone, far outpacing Tesla’s three. Yet, even here, Tesla’s share in the new energy vehicle segment slipped to 2.03% in October, dropping it out of the top 10 for the first time in years, as per data from CnEVPost.

Competitive Pressures and Innovation Races

The rise of Chinese manufacturers isn’t just a domestic story; it’s reshaping international competition. BYD’s global market share in battery-electric vehicles stood at 15% in the third quarter of 2025, with Tesla trailing at 13%. This shift is evident in emerging markets like South America, where EV sales are booming without significant Tesla presence. A Reuters report highlights how importers in Peru and elsewhere are turning to affordable Chinese options, bypassing Tesla’s import hurdles.

Tesla’s challenges extend beyond pricing. CEO Elon Musk’s focus on robotics and other ventures has drawn criticism for diverting attention from core auto sales. A separate Reuters analysis points out that while Musk secured a massive pay package, vehicle deliveries have stagnated, with global sales projected to remain flat for the second consecutive year. In the U.S. and Europe, Tesla’s brand image has suffered, leading to declines of 5.7% and 10.7% respectively in 2024, trends that have persisted into 2025.

Innovation speed is another battleground. Chinese firms like BYD and Geely are launching models at a blistering pace, with Rest of World noting how they outstrip U.S. counterparts in regulatory approvals and market entry. This agility allows them to respond quickly to consumer preferences, such as demand for affordable crossovers and sedans, further eroding Tesla’s once-dominant position.

Policy Impacts and Consumer Sentiment

Government policies remain a critical driver—or deterrent—in EV adoption. The U.S. rollback of tax incentives has not only hurt Tesla but also broader players like Ford, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, whose sales dipped in April, marking a 5.6% year-over-year decline for new EVs. Posts on X from industry observers echo this, with sentiments indicating that the middle tier of the market is cracking under pressure, even as Tesla and General Motors show isolated bright spots.

In contrast, Europe’s supportive framework has fueled a 21% global sales jump, as detailed in a recent Electrek article. Yet, even there, Tesla’s sales are faltering, down 40-45% year-over-year in key months, while Chinese EVs surge. This regional disparity underscores how policy stability can make or break market momentum.

Consumer sentiment, influenced by economic factors like inflation and high interest rates, adds another layer. In North America, buyers are increasingly wary of EV range anxiety and charging infrastructure gaps, opting instead for hybrids that offer familiarity. X posts from analysts like Troy Teslike highlight Tesla’s brand challenges in the U.S. and Europe, predicting flat or declining sales unless addressed.

Forecasts and Future Trajectories

Looking ahead, projections from the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 suggest that while global adoption will continue, growth rates may moderate to single digits in mature markets. China’s dominance is expected to persist, with BYD and Geely Holdings projected to hold 15% and 10% shares respectively by year’s end, based on quarterly data from Counterpoint Research.

Tesla, facing these headwinds, is pivoting toward autonomy and robotaxis, but skeptics argue this distracts from immediate sales needs. BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook anticipates that shared mobility and autonomous tech could reinvigorate the sector, but only if integrated with affordable vehicles.

Emerging markets offer glimmers of hope. South America’s EV boom, driven by non-Tesla imports, signals untapped potential. However, without policy harmonization, global fragmentation could deepen, leaving North America further behind.

Strategic Responses from Industry Players

Automakers are adapting in varied ways. BYD’s strategy of flooding markets with diverse, low-cost models has paid off, as evidenced by its Q4 2023 overtake of Tesla in global deliveries, per a Statista chart. This approach contrasts with Tesla’s premium focus, which has alienated price-sensitive buyers.

U.S. firms like General Motors are finding success with targeted models, bucking the broader decline. Yet, the overall North American drop—projected as the first since 2019—prompts questions about long-term viability without renewed subsidies.

Chinese expansion into Europe and beyond intensifies pressure. Visual Capitalist’s analysis shows China’s makers widening their lead, with global reach cementing positions in 2025.

Broader Implications for the Auto Sector

The slowdown affects supply chains, from battery production to raw materials. Declining demand in the U.S. could ripple through lithium and cobalt markets, already volatile.

Investors are recalibrating expectations. Tesla’s stock has reflected these woes, with X discussions pointing to a 70% sales drop in some European countries and a 49% shipment decline in China, juxtaposed against BYD’s 161% growth.

Ultimately, the EV sector’s path forward hinges on balancing innovation, policy, and affordability. As Chinese players consolidate gains, Western firms must innovate or risk obsolescence.

Evolving Consumer Preferences and Market Realities

Shifting buyer priorities, such as a preference for vehicles with longer ranges and faster charging, are reshaping offerings. Hybrids are gaining as a bridge technology, eroding pure EV share in transitional markets.

Infrastructure buildout remains crucial. In the U.S., inadequate charging networks exacerbate hesitancy, while China’s dense setup supports higher adoption.

Global forecasts indicate EVs could reach 20-30% of new sales by 2030, but 2025’s slump serves as a cautionary tale of over-reliance on incentives.

Pathways to Recovery and Growth

Strategies for revival include cost reductions through scale. BYD’s vertical integration model offers lessons for others.

Collaborations, like potential U.S.-China joint ventures, could accelerate tech transfer, though geopolitical tensions loom.

In summary, while challenges abound, the underlying shift toward electrification endures, propelled by environmental imperatives and technological advances.

As I wrote on Friday: this is both a transition and an expansion. Several folks will be stepping up to use this platform and I couldn’t be more excited to hear what comes next.

A platform, now with more places to stand

Archimedes said: “Give me a place to stand and I will move the Earth.” This podcast will become a platform for more people to stand.

The podcast is moving into a multi-host format, and one of those new voices is Matt Boms, Executive Director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance (TAEBA). Matt has been a leader on some of the most important energy work in Texas: distributed energy resources, affordability, energy waste reduction, grid flexibility, and much more.

How I got “bit by the bug”

Matt asked how I got into energy. The real answer is, slowly and then all at once.

My early work in energy policy was at the Texas Legislature, in a stretch (2005 to 2009) when a lot was happening and the instincts to build and expand were strong.

That period mattered because it shaped a belief I still hold today: Texas works best when we put pragmatism above ideology. Texas is a place to build and do big things.

The next frontier is the grid edge

One of the big themes in this conversation with Matt is that the “cheap electrons” story is true on the generation side, but bills keep climbing because transmission and distribution costs keep rising.

So if we’re serious about affordability, we have to talk about the distribution grid, and the tools that can help us defer (or avoid) some of the costs associated with building out the grid. We’re still going to spend a lot but can we avoid some of it?

That’s where distributed energy resources (DERs) come in, and where Texas has a real opportunity to lead.

Matt and TAEBA recently looked at what DERs could do in Oncor’s territory. The numbers are big, but here’s the one that sticks: about $279 per family per year in savings. If you want a sense of how big a difference that would make for many Texans, check out my discussion with Margo Weisz of the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute:

There are two core value buckets behind these savings:

Wholesale market value (DERs competing through aggregation, the work ERCOT is already moving through)

Transmission and distribution deferral or avoidance (often the larger, currently under-valued piece)

If we get the policy design right, DERs can help lower system costs, enable load growth, and reduce the pressure that shows up on people’s bills.

Final Thoughts

If you’ve been listening for a while, let the new team (more announcements on that soon) know what topics you want them to cover next.

The next chapter is going to be great. I can’t wait to listen!

Doug Lewin (00:04.526)

Welcome back to the Energy Capital podcast. I’m your host, Doug Lewin. Today’s episode is a little different. The platform is expanding into a multi-host format. I’m really excited about these changes. I cannot wait to be a listener to this podcast and hear where it’s going. I’ve been working with your new hosts and there are several on the issues and topics and speakers they’re going to be inviting and I could not be more excited.

Doug Lewin (00:33.504)

about where this is gonna go. I put out a post this morning at the Texas Energy and Power newsletter called It’s a Transition and an Expansion. And that is exactly what it is. Change can be hard, but change can also be really good. And this is an opportunity for a lot of folks to use the platform that I have helped to build. There’s a famous quote from Archimedes where he says, give me a place to stand and I’ll move the earth.

Doug Lewin (01:03.768)

You all, dear listener, come on, it’s the Energy Capital podcast. Y’all, dear listeners, have given me a place to stand, given me a voice, and I’m deeply, deeply grateful for that. Now, other folks are gonna have this place to stand to move the Earth. Stand with them, help them through this transition and expansion, and I know you’re gonna be really excited to hear what comes next. So today, again, this is a little different.

Doug Lewin (01:31.2)

and thrilled to introduce one of the new voices who will be carrying this work forward. That’s Matt Bombs. Matt is the executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance, TABAA for short. They do some great work in Texas and Matt has done some great work, particularly around distributed energy resources. He was part of that aggregated distributed energy resource task force that has had a lot of success in Texas. He’s also part of the advisory committee on the backup power package program I talk a lot about. He was instrumental

Doug Lewin (02:00.138)

in getting the Texas Energy Waste Advisory Committee established here in Texas. So he’s done a lot of great work. He is an expert in his own right. He is very interested and curious about all this stuff, just like I am. And I’m thrilled that he’s one of the people that is going to be stepping onto this platform. So what you’re here today is me interviewing Matt and Matt interviewing me. A little bit of a retrospective looking back. I hope you enjoy this episode and I hope you enjoy all the episodes going forward.

Doug Lewin (02:28.364)

I can’t wait to listen myself and I know you’re gonna like what comes next. So with that, thanks for listening and let’s jump in.

Matt Boms (02:43.352)

Hi everybody, I’m Matt Bombs and I’m here with Doug Lewin on the Energy Capital podcast. Doug, it’s great to have you here on the podcast that you built. And now that I’m hosting the podcast with a few of my very talented and brilliant colleagues, it’s just a great opportunity to pick your brain and to hear more from you. I really do want to hear more about your story and how you first got into energy. What was the key factor that really brought you into this industry and how did you first get started?

Doug Lewin (03:11.522)

Yeah, Matt, before I jump into that, just want to say how thrilled I am to be able to take this platform that I think really is reaching a lot of people that are really interested in Texas energy. Texas is such a dynamic place and you’re such an important part of that ecosystem. And I’m thrilled that you’re excited to step into this role, like you mentioned with some others. So, you know, we, often joke in the energy world about energy transition and energy expansion. This is both, it’s going to be an energy transition and an expansion.

Doug Lewin (03:41.154)

You know, with, new hosts coming in and there’ll be multiple of them that’ll allow more exploration. And I’m just so thrilled you’re in that mix. So thanks, Matt. So to answer your question, it’s something I’ve talked about a little bit on the pod over the years, but not a lot. And yeah, look, I can’t even like tell you like, Hey, there was this moment or this, you know, day or week or month or year where it would like all clicked and like, this is what, like what I want to do with my professional life. It kind of happened over time.

Matt Boms (03:49.59)

Awesome. Thanks so much Doug.

Doug Lewin (04:09.614)

Certainly some of my first experiences with energy policy were at the legislature. And it was a time at the legislature, there was a really good time to be there. It 2005 to 2009. It was just a very different time over there, particularly related to energy policy. So like a lot of things were happening, right? 2005 Senate bill 20, which had an expansion of global portfolio standard, the big expansion of the transmission system commonly known as CREZ, but really that enabled a lot of the economic growth Texas had over the last 20 years.

Doug Lewin (04:39.758)

You know, that was passed in 05, 07, there was a major efficiency bill that was passed then. I had the privilege to work on that. That was with Representative Strauss before he was Speaker Strauss. And then, you know, 2000, when 2008, right, people forget this, but you had both Republican and Democratic candidates running on platforms that were extremely pro clean energy, climate action, all that kind of stuff. And obviously 2009, you had...

Doug Lewin (05:05.166)

President Obama and there was like RF funds and all that kind of stuff. So like, it was just kind of a fascinating time to be in there. Add to that, that like 2005, six Al Gore puts out inconvenient truth and Rick Perry fast tracked 11 coal plants. Now Perry was like, you know, pro wind and solar and pro transmission and pro coal. He’s got to like pro everything, but you know, 11 coal plants, right in the middle of that context of like this dawning awareness around climate change. It was just kind of, it was just a fascinating time.

Doug Lewin (05:33.932)

to be in it and I’ve always found the energy space to be dynamic and fast paced and interesting. And it’s just one of those subject areas that almost any subject areas this way, if you get bit by the bug and you’re into it enough, right? That there’s no like end to learning in it. I always feel that beginner’s mind thing is there that like any corner you turn, it’s like, wow. I didn’t know about that whole thing. Tell me about that. Right. I want to, I want to read up and get smart on that and

Doug Lewin (06:03.406)

after 20 years of doing this, I still have the same feeling. And to your point and your question, like that’s even more so now, right? The acceleration is accelerating, right? So like what I thought has always been a pretty dynamic space, way more dynamic now. And the amount of stuff that we all have to learn just to keep up, right? Not even get ahead, but just keep falling off the back of the treadmill. It’s, there’s so much right now. And I find that challenge of not just keeping up, but like,

Doug Lewin (06:32.962)

that challenge of really comprehending what’s going on, really seeing different stakeholders point of view and how do different entities view this very same problem so differently. So there’s this whole kind of social dimension to the work that I absolutely love as well. yeah, I can’t really like pinpoint a day or a year or something like that. It was just like the ledge through to be in the head of an energy efficiency organization to go into clear result. Everything throughout my career has just added to it and just sort of like.

Doug Lewin (07:01.398)

increased that passion every step along the way.

Matt Boms (07:04.866)

That’s really interesting, Doug, and I am really interested in hearing more about how things got more political. So you started in this role, you were working in the energy industry at a time where these different technologies were all emerging. And at a certain point, the technology itself began being painted as red or blue or whatever color of your choice. And I want to hear more about the politicization.

Matt Boms (07:29.718)

even leading up to Winter Storm Yuri, about how did that change happen and what was it like as someone who was actively working in the industry at that time?

Doug Lewin (07:36.61)

I

Doug Lewin (07:36.71)

think the politicization of energy, you know, is thankfully not as bad as in a lot of other areas, but it has at least tracked, if not equally, but sort of tracked the polarization that is happening in the countries and all. I’ll tell you, one of the, I’m proud of all the podcasts that I’ve done with Energy Capital Podcasts. And I’m going to be proud to hear all the ones you’re going to do. I’m so looking forward to being a listener going forward, but.

Doug Lewin (08:02.646)

You know, one of the ones I’m most proud of was with David Spence and it was about, you know, his book, brilliant book, Climate of Contempt, which sort of was the whole thing is about the polarization of climate policy. And I’ll say, I think that’s actually probably how it became so polarized was like climate change has become very polarized. The things that you wouldn’t have imagined 20 years ago could have become that polarized. know, McCain and Obama both running on doing something about climate change.

Doug Lewin (08:31.608)

Who would have thought like vaccinations would have become as politically polarized as they are. But I will say, I think this is an issue area where you see really, really interesting alliances, left, right, center. And I think it’s because if you can kind of step back and kind of focus on first principles, we all want a reliable and affordable and clean grid. Like I don’t care what your political ideology is. You don’t like air pollution. Like nobody wants to have polluted.

Doug Lewin (09:00.394)

skies and water. Like that’s not something somebody sets out to do. I think in this industry, people are actually pretty mature about understanding that there are trade-offs and that those trade-offs are quite real. And so I think as much as possible, Matt, what I have tried to do, and I hope you’ll continue to do this on this platform, is to dial down that temperature, to have discussions with...

Doug Lewin (09:26.996)

The first question of asking somebody to come on the podcast isn’t what political tribe are you a part of? It’s do you have interesting thoughts on energy? They may not be the same as my thoughts on energy. I actually hope they aren’t because if we’re only talking to people we agree with 100%, like what’s the point? I mean, you know, some of it is to explore differences. Some of it is just to learn from experts that know, you know, that’s been my great joy in doing this is having people on that know so much more than me that I can ask questions of.

Doug Lewin (09:57.014)

and get smarter and help the audience get smarter too. And I’ll tell you, I mean, I’m just so excited about some of the possibilities of, you know, cross ideological cross partisan. And I don’t even want to just say bipartisan. Like it could be all kinds of different beliefs that if you come to this from, want cheap, fast, reliable, clean power. Like

Doug Lewin (10:22.764)

Let’s talk about what are the things we can do to get all those. know, competition, right? That’s one of those places that like, you know, you get broad agreement in general, not a hundred percent, but broad agreement left and right that like competition is generally a good thing, particularly on the right, which has made things like really, really interesting in Texas. So I think as much as possible to depoliticize it, to dial the temperature down, to look for areas of commonality, you know, it’s interesting.

Doug Lewin (10:52.29)

Chairman Flores of ERCOT gave a speech at, I think it was at Gulf Coast Power Association where he talked about like, can we look for our similarities first and our differences next? And I just think that’s so powerful. And I’ve always tried to do that in my career, like connect with somebody first and then explore the differences. I think too many people are just leading with their differences. And like that’s on a human level makes it very hard to work with anybody.

Matt Boms (11:18.286)

Yeah, I completely agree with you. And that is not limited to energy, right? We’re seeing that across our entire society. And I think you said at the outset that speaks to kind of your curiosity as a person, but the fact that you’re not married to your ideas, right? Things change. We’re constantly learning. A lot of these concepts are new and emerging. AI is only beginning to emerge as this new pillar of society. We’re all going to have a lot to learn here.

Matt Boms (11:46.508)

moving forward. I think that at the outset, if we can just drop our prior set of expectations and maybe any biases that we have, that will help us all come together and work in a more productive way. And I certainly think that what you mentioned about competitive markets being, know, historically Republican principle in a Republican state, that was probably the single biggest factor in the renewable industry having success in Texas and continues to be right. So that will be

Matt Boms (12:16.334)

crucial moving forward. And I think that’s what’s bringing a lot of solar, wind and battery companies to Texas because of the competitive market that we have here. You don’t see that in other states. see even blue states having trouble with the renewable build out because of permitting problems or because of regulatory issues that they’re facing, because of the backlogs and interconnection that they have. And as a state, we’ve been able to leapfrog a lot of those problems. And there’s a whole bunch of reasons behind that that you can take us through.

Matt Boms (12:45.486)

But I think overall you’re right that the taking the ideology out of it and maybe focusing less on politics and more on practical solutions is probably how we’re going to move forward here and meet the load growth that’s coming. So that’s what I want to hear from you too is how are we going to possibly, some of the numbers are mind blowing. You’ve gone through this in previous podcast episodes. How do you see us meeting this next big challenge and this big tsunami of load growth that’s coming?

Doug Lewin (13:10.092)

Yeah. Well, first, before I get to that, I just want to back up to something you said just a minute ago, right? So like competition, yes, Texas has been a red state for a long time. When Senate Bill seven was passed, the house was still democratic. So it was a very bipartisan bill. Senate was Republican. Governor was Republican. House was democratic. And they had to find those solutions across, know, bicameral, bipartisan. And competition had strong support in the democratic house with Speaker

Doug Lewin (13:39.182)

Pete Laney, if I’ve got this right, and I think I do, it’s within a couple of votes, but I think it was 146 out of 150 voted for Senate Bill 7. So like, and again, I came into the legislature like a few years after that, and I think we’ve seen, there’s still a lot of bills that get that many votes, but not as many big bills. And that’s what I would hope we can start to get to is as a state, if we say these are the things we prioritize, right? Again, clean, cheap, fast, reliable, like,

Doug Lewin (14:08.81)

What are the things that kind of meet all of those things or most of those things? And how do we balance those using competitive market forces? And I’ll tell you, as far as the load growth goes, it’s really amazing. There was a study that Aurora did for ERCOT on the Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service. There were a lot of different models they ran and there’s a lot of different results that came out. There was only one result.

Doug Lewin (14:34.776)

that had 0.0 gigawatts worth of load shed in a winter storm Elliott, which was the 2022 winter storm in December, right before Christmas or 2023 heat wave. There’s only one that had zero rolling outages. And that was the very high data center load growth scenario. That was the only one like, you know, you could spend all this money and build new ancillary services and capacity markets, capacity constructs, all that kind of stuff. And you would still have.

Doug Lewin (15:05.022)

some outages. The one exception was the high load growth. And what they were modeling was if we had high load growth and data centers are bringing their own generation and 60 % of them have flexibility in them, that would get you down to 0.0. So I think, again, no matter what your political persuasion is, the investment that could be coming to the state, the potential to actually get the most reliable grid possible, right?

Doug Lewin (15:34.398)

while spreading the fixed cost of the system out to more users. Like all of this is there right in front of us. And I couldn’t be more excited to continue to be working in Texas towards this vision of a clean, reliable, affordable, you know, power grid, which we’ve made huge strides over the last five years in this state. There’s just no denying it. We got a long way to go. And pretty soon here, we’re going to flip the mic around. I’m going to ask you questions, Matt, because I know you over the last several years.

Doug Lewin (16:01.986)

have been working on some of the very things that I think are like most essential to get to that clean, reliable, affordable grid. So yeah, we’ll do that in a second, but I don’t know. I don’t want to cut you off. had any other like burning questions you want to ask.

Matt Boms (16:16.716)

Well, yeah, what changes now, because for most of your career, you know, correct me if I’m wrong, we didn’t have the kind of low growth that we have now, right? So that’s right. That’s a huge, drastic change from how energy has functioned over the last few decades, right? So where do we go from here? Like, where do you see policymakers really changing their views and making sure that we’re bringing these businesses to Texas instead of turning them away because we don’t have enough power?

Doug Lewin (16:47.202)

Yeah, look, to me, there’s so much, right? This is so complicated. Obviously, there’s a long record there for people to go back and listen to, hearing all this stuff. But to me, this kind of boils down to three main things, right? You’ve gotta keep the conditions for new supply to want to come to Texas. We have built more supply here than any other state by far. It’s not close.

Doug Lewin (17:11.406)

And that’s because of the competitive market design. So I think being protective of that competitive market design, keeping those price signals, you know, at the ERCOT board meeting, there’s some discussion around, not getting enough gas built. The gas queue has tripled in the last 18 months because those signals are coming from the new demand, right? So I think keeping that where particularly solar storage and gas, like those are the things that are going to be built over the next years. Wind too, there’ll be some wind in the mix, but.

Doug Lewin (17:40.194)

you know, probably not as much as the other three. Transmission, to be able to move all that power around and to be doing it in a way that is not, it’s not always congested, driving up costs, causing reliability problems. Congestion is not just a cost issue. It’s a reliability problem too. If you’ve got generation in a part of the state and you can’t move it to where it’s needed, you got reliability problems, right? We’ve had that South of San Antonio the last several years and we got it, we got to get ahead of that.

Doug Lewin (18:06.702)

And think ERCOT’s work on building out a 765 system, we’re recording on a day when the ERCOT board approved the building of the Eastern half of the 765 system. So that I think is really key. And then the last one, and this is probably a good segue to flip this around. And let me start asking you some questions, is the demand side. And I know you, Matt, you’ve played a huge leadership role in Texas on demand side.

Doug Lewin (18:30.686)

Demand side to me, look, I’ve spent a big part of my career working on energy efficiency and DERs, VPPs before anybody knew what a VPP was. Well, a few people knew, but it wasn’t as talked about as it is now, right? And I think that for a long time, the perception was, those are interesting and nice. Sure, who’s supposed to saving some energy and getting lower bills? Those are nice, but it was always just kind of like, there’s a little pat on the head, great work.

Doug Lewin (19:00.334)

cool, but that’s not the real stuff. In this environment with rapid load growth, those demand side solutions become absolutely essential and central. There’s a big discussion going on right now in the Twitterverse around this. Matt Iglesias had an article out, which I haven’t read yet, so I probably shouldn’t talk about it. I’ve only seen his tweets. So I will go read the article, Matt Iglesias, and digest your whole argument. But what I can gather from the Twitter spats is like,

Doug Lewin (19:29.548)

there is this kind of debate going on of like, is it more supply or demand side stuff? we be like demand flexibility and energy efficiency just aren’t going to be enough to meet our needs. We need to build more supply. And it’s like, well, of course, like, but, that’s not a binary. You don’t have to choose one or the other of those things. And, and as a matter of fact, if you choose one or other of those things, you’re probably going to end up short. We’re going to need resources everywhere we can get them. And that includes demand side resources and supply side resources.

Doug Lewin (19:59.616)

I just think that is a false choice if ever there was one. So I really think building up energy efficiency, distributed energy resources. So if you’re okay, Matt, I’m start asking you questions. Is that all right?

Matt Boms (20:12.856)

Yeah, I think you just did ask me like five questions.

Doug Lewin (20:14.958)

Doug Lewin (20:15.359)

So talk to us about distributed energy resources and energy efficiency. Tell us a little about your work in that area and what kind of excites you about that, what you’re excited to be working on.

Matt Boms (20:26.36)

Yeah, well, I think the way I like to think about this is electricity is the backbone of our economy, right? Like I went to school, I studied economics and the feeling that I have is the electric grid is the backbone for local economic development. There are other countries that don’t have the luxury that we have in the United States of having an abundant electric grid. And there are countries where businesses simply can’t operate because they don’t have a stable grid.

Matt Boms (20:55.33)

to count on like we do here. They also don’t have cheap electricity, right, which is something that we take for granted, just generally speaking, right? We have some variations across states, across counties, but for the most part, Americans have access to reliable, affordable electricity. And those are the key words that we want to keep it affordable. We want to keep it reliable. And that’s, think, the challenge that we’re going to be facing now with all the new data centers that are coming to Texas. So I think my feeling on this, Doug, is also that it’s not black and white. It’s not one or the other.

Matt Boms (21:25.292)

You can make the same argument that I just heard you make when it comes to different technologies, whether it’s solar, batteries, gas, wind, DERs, energy waste, transmission infrastructure. We need all of that. It’s not going to be choosing winners and losers. It’s going to be all of these different technologies playing their role in meeting our energy needs moving forward. Yep. So the key piece for me is how do we keep it flexible?

Matt Boms (21:51.466)

And I think the flexibility is what’s going to drive affordability and reliability in Texas. I don’t think that we’re at a point now in ERCOT where we can say our grid is sufficiently flexible to meet all of the load that’s coming. I think we have a lot of work to do. I think you can see that through price volatility. You can see that in parts of the state where during heat wave or a winter storm, the price signals are exorbitantly high and

Matt Boms (22:19.852)

distributed resources aren’t being valued the way that they should, right? There’s no reason we shouldn’t be valuing battery storage or backup generators or smart thermostats for the value that they’re bringing on those days that we really need them. And that might only be 1 % of the year, but when we really do need to count on them, that’s where we’re going to have to think of ways to support those technologies. And by doing that, you’re going to bring the costs down for consumers, right? Because right now it certainly feels like

Matt Boms (22:49.282)

For anyone that owns a home in Texas that has looked into rooftop solar or batteries, the prices are still too high. They’re just not affordable enough. And I think that’s where the policy comes in because the policy creates the market that we need to set up for distributed resources.

Doug Lewin (23:05.25)

Yeah, I was just going to say like that is, you when you talk about yes, like power is more reliable here, or more, I should say more affordable, more reliable too. But your point was it’s more affordable here than is a lot of places in the world. A lot of places you just can’t get electricity. Important to acknowledge, and I know you do acknowledge this, you just started to talk about it there, that like for a lot of people, power is, is unaffordable, right? We have a, we have a large portion of the population.

Doug Lewin (23:30.808)

that is really struggling to pay their bills, 30 to 40 % that are making choices between paying their power bills, paying for food and medicine. So this is really where I think it becomes really important when you’re talking about flexibility, if we can bring those flexible resources, whether they be batteries or demand response, right, through thermostats, heat pumps that are connected to a thermostat and have variable speed, all of those kinds of things.

Doug Lewin (23:58.434)

that you can meet, just like you said, Matt, that 1 % of the year, maybe it’s 2 % some years if there’s a really bad heat wave, but you’re talking about, you know, a few hundred hours, right, during a winter storm, right, having those batteries that are on the distributed network. And a lot of people say the batteries only last for one or two hours. If you’ve got a battery in your garage, it could be configured to last a lot longer than an hour or two. This is a common perception I think we’ve really got to get after, that every battery is only a one or two hour battery. Not true.

Doug Lewin (24:27.958)

It depends how it’s configured and we can stretch them out and have all kinds of different configurations to them. And if we can do that, not only does that bring the price of generation down, that means in some cases we won’t have to do as extensive a build out of the distribution grid, right? Which is the biggest driver of higher energy bills right now is on the distribution grid. So I know

Doug Lewin (24:53.422)

You and the organization, Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance, put out a study recently looking at the encore service territory and what DERs could mean for that. I think the number was something like eight and a half billion in savings over 10 years. Tell us a little about the findings and how could we actually get to those savings? What policy solutions might unlock some of those savings for consumers?

Matt Boms (25:16.43)

Sure, yeah, the calculation was around $2,000 in savings per rate payer over the next 10 years. And that’s a huge amount of savings for, like you said, folks that are struggling to pay their energy bills that really could use that relief, right? And might not necessarily have the capital to go out right now and buy a huge solar and battery system to install on their house. Or for a small business that frankly we’ve seen in Houston.

Matt Boms (25:45.272)

small businesses that after Hurricane Barrel went out and purchased backup generators because they can’t just accept a week without a business because a hurricane swept in and wiped out their power, right? And to your point, there are plenty of stories after Barrel of folks that did weather the storm through battery systems and through rooftop solar. So I think we have the arguments and we have the case studies to show that the technologies are working. You asked about what are the policies that could be put in place to solve the problem.

Matt Boms (26:15.054)

The way that the number was calculated as far as the roughly $2,000 per rate payer is on the one hand, you have the wholesale market value, right? So you have, if these technologies could compete in the wholesale market, how much potentially could we assign in value to those distributed resources? And that’s happening through the aggregated DER project, right? There’s a lot of work that needs to be done there, but it’s working its way through ERCOT.

Matt Boms (26:40.77)

The other half that is not at all being valued right now is through the transmission and distribution deferral, right? So for every distributed resource that’s put on the grid, you are ultimately deferring transmission and distribution that needs to be built out in the long-term, right? So that means an overloaded substation that might need to be replaced, but can you replace that with batteries or with whatever distributed technology works best for that particular location in Texas, right?

Matt Boms (27:10.614)

Right now we have a system set up where we are just building out poles and wires through our transmission and distribution utilities and we’re not assigning any value to DERs when they can be a more cost effective technology for rate payers. Because ultimately we’re trying to save money for rate payers through these technologies. So that’s where most of the value comes from, Doug. I know that you had Astrid Atkinson on your podcast recently who spoke about

Matt Boms (27:37.794)

The fact that it can be up to 75 % of the value of distributed resources could be attributed to that TND deferral, right? That’s the big piece here that we’re missing within the ERCOT system because that whole part of the value stack is missing currently in the way that our market is set up.

Doug Lewin (27:53.998)

Yeah, and the podcasts with Charles Hua, with Margo Weiss, like, you know, we see that the lines for generation have been relatively flat to some years down. Every once in a while you get a little blip like 2022 with the Russian invasion where like generation goes up. But generally, overtime cost of generation going down for two reasons. And when we talking about the competitive market earlier and you said, you know, it’s brought a lot of renewables, it also brought a ton of gas, right? Especially in the mid-aughts, right? Really cheap gas.

Doug Lewin (28:22.35)

cheap renewables have lowered the cost generation. Meanwhile, the lines for transmission and distribution are going up. Now I said earlier, I really do believe we need the 765 build out. It’s really important to be able to move power around more efficiently. Large amounts of power, those lines can carry four to six times the amount of the next voltage down. So we’ve really got to look to that distribution grid. And that’s really what I think this study is a really good one. We talked about it a little bit, I hope.

Doug Lewin (28:47.862)

Matt, you might be able to have Demand Site Analytics that did that excellent study. And I understand you guys are doing another one that is ERCOT wide that’ll come out at some point. So maybe that’ll be a good interview for you on the podcast going forward is really getting into that study and breaking down some of the assumptions there and how could those savings go bigger? How would they be smaller? What kinds of policies do we actually need to unlock those savings, right?

Matt Boms (29:10.584)

Yeah, that’s right. I also think this is an area where Texas could lead the country, right? Like it really is the new frontier. If you think about all the data centers that are being built and how they can contribute to that flexibility in Texas, that’s a huge opportunity. Like that’s the way we can unlock all of this load growth and the business opportunity in Texas, because all of a sudden you’re talking about dozens of gigawatts that are going to be coming online over the next few years.

Matt Boms (29:38.162)

And you have the capital to make it happen. You’ve got data centers that really the number one priority is how fast can I get power, right? It’s not about the capital that they have on hand. It’s about the speed that they can possibly get connected to our grid. So there’s an incentive there for making the grid more flexible and that enables more data center interconnection. So I’m hopeful that this will happen. I just think that we need to change the way we think about electricity, right? For those of us that have worked in this industry, we’re used to thinking about

Matt Boms (30:06.85)

the utilities delivering electrons to our homes and businesses. And something that is true, and like you said, we need those 765 lines to bring us cheap electrons from rural parts of the state. However, we also need to flip that on the table and say, well, these technologies weren’t around when the system was created, right? And so now all of sudden you have this great battery storage technology that can enable folks to generate their own power, right? And they should be rewarded for bringing flexibility to the grid.

Doug Lewin (30:34.862)

And you know what’s a great way to get like new resources onto the grid competition and markets. I actually got chills, Matt, when you said Texas could lead this, cause that has been a huge theme on this podcast, right? For years. And I’m so happy that you’re like grabbing the torch and going to keep that going forward. Cause that really is a theme here is Texas has a lot going for it. We have the elements here to put all that together. And I think you’ve got that vision.

Doug Lewin (31:04.66)

You can see that. You can kind of see that you got a puzzle in front of you. All the pieces are there. We’ve got the competitive market. You know, that means we’ve got competitive retail electric providers. We’ve got very innovative co-ops and munis as well. There’s a ton. I hope you’ll do some podcasts with, especially some of the co-ops. think I only did, I think it was only Bandera. Was that the only co-op? So like that’s kind of a big, big hole in this podcast that needs to be filled. There’s a lot going on at co-ops right now.

Doug Lewin (31:33.696)

in the competitive market, et cetera, Texas really has all those pieces to put together markets that send a price signal to these distributed resources to lower that distribution spending, bend the curve downward. And while we’re doing that, put those resources on people’s premises so that they have reliable and resilient service, even through those storms. Before we end, I just want to ask you just one more thing. And again, we’re teeing up like a bunch of different

Doug Lewin (32:03.768)

podcast episodes. hope the audience is getting a sense here, right? Dear listener that like there is no shortage of stuff to cover. There’s no shortage of people to cover it. I’m so excited to become a listener and hear where all this is going. But you’ve been working a lot on this Texas backup power package program, right? So this is this very innovative. think it instantly talk about Texas being a leader. Here’s Texas actually putting $1.8 billion towards

Doug Lewin (32:30.934)

Effectively microgrids, they may or may not actually be microgrids depending on how they’re configured, but effectively microgrids backup power systems at critical facilities like police stations and nursing homes, water treatment facilities, et cetera. You’ve been involved in that from the very beginning. Can you just share with the audience a little bit kind of a little bit more about what that is and why that’s exciting, why that’s been a priority for you over the last few years to work on and you know.

Doug Lewin (32:57.026)

what you might explore here on the podcast related to that really innovative program Texas has.

Matt Boms (33:02.062)

If we go back to the 2023 legislative session, this was part of SB 2627 that initially set up the Texas Energy Fund. think when folks hear Texas Energy Fund, they think of gas plants, That just automatically where our mind goes. But I constantly remind people that there’s the 1.8 billion allocated to the Backup Power Program, right? Of the 10 billion, 1.8 is for Backup Power. And so there’s a significant amount of resources that the state has allocated to this program.

Matt Boms (33:31.552)

I was surprised when it was first created that this hadn’t been done since Winter Storm URI. Like that was something that really stood out to me because you would hope that by now we would have backed up critical facilities. And I think it’s our obligation as people who work in this industry to make sure that hospitals, police, fire stations, nursing homes have power. If God forbid we have another Winter Storm URI event, we want to make sure that we’re taking care of.

Matt Boms (33:58.178)

our most vulnerable Texans, right? That’s something that we can all agree on. That’s not a partisan issue at all, right? We all want to protect vulnerable people in our state. So that was the impetus for the program. And I give a lot of credit to Alison Silverstein, who really put her blood, sweat, and tears into this program. And it’s something that we continue to work on with the Public Utility Commission. So I think the hope is that this will be launched next year.

Matt Boms (34:21.698)

This will be a program that ideally will bring in all the different vendors that are already manufacturing these technologies. It has to be a combination of solar, battery, and generator, right? It has to have those three. As an alternative, it could be electric school buses because those are essentially batteries on wheels, right? So those could be, if the load is small enough at some of these facilities, the electric school bus could absolutely power the facility for 48 continuous hours, which is what the statute says.

Matt Boms (34:50.082)

So I think what I’m looking forward to is the rollout of the program. I’m looking forward to bringing in private sector companies that are excited to roll up their sleeves and get these technologies out to rural communities across the state. And I think we also have to think about bringing in the critical facilities, making sure that they’re aware of this program, because, you know, it’s like when a tree falls in a forest kind of deal with if the critical facilities aren’t paying attention to this program, then they won’t know it exists. So I think we also have to support the program by bringing in all the different stakeholders and making sure that.

Matt Boms (35:20.12)

they’re aware that the program is here to support them. then hopefully next time a winter event or a summer event happens, these backup power packages will be in place to provide reliable power for those facilities.

Doug Lewin (35:33.902)

It’s such, such an important program. It’s such an important policy. And by the way, an example of where, you know, you had good bipartisan bicameral policy making happening. Like those are major policy decisions that take a lot of different input from a lot of different folks and kudos to the ledge for figuring that out. Now the PC is working to implement that and you’ll continue to cover that here. know that the backup power packages will be something also that could be talked about.

Doug Lewin (36:01.262)

at the Texas Energy Waste Advisory Committee, which you helped to get going. So we won’t talk about that one right now, but I’m just trying to tee up a lot of the different things that I know you’re gonna be talking about in the coming months. And I hope the audience is as excited as I am to get some different voices in here, explore some different topics that maybe I didn’t cover as much. And I just couldn’t be more excited about this next chapter. Matt, since we were interviewing each other, the question I always ask at the end, as you know,

Less than two percent of all Wyoming homes have rooftop solar panels, according to estimates from the Solar Energy Industry Association.","COKEVILLE, Wyo.—Tim Teichert and Jason Thornock want the sun to help them survive as ranchers in Cokeville, Wyoming. On an overcast May day, the two drove around the one-restaurant town, lamenting high electricity prices and restrictive Wyoming laws that they say have thrown an unnecessary burden onto their broad shoulders.

“I pay $90,000 in an electric bill,” Teichert said as he and Thornock made their way through fields of cattle, alfalfa and hay. “Jason’s about $150,000. If Jason had that $150,000 back, his kids could all come back to Cokeville, and work and live here, and you’d be able to raise kids here in Cokeville.”

In 2023, hoping to improve their margins, Teichert and Thornock each applied for Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grants, which the Biden administration had infused with $2 billion to help support farmers interested in renewable energy.

While neither man was thrilled about the prospect of applying for federal funds—they prefer smaller government—they were interested in using solar to cover their own electrical demand. Teichert and Thornock say this could have saved them five or six figures annually, and made their businesses more attractive to their kids.

Across Wyoming and the U.S., Americans increasingly face skyrocketing electricity bills. In 2023, Rocky Mountain Power, Teichert and Thornock’s utility and the largest in Wyoming, asked regulators at the state’s Public Service Commission to approve a nearly 30 percent rate increase; the next year, they asked to raise rates by close to 15 percent. Though both requests were ultimately granted at lower rates, affordability concerns have sent almost every corner of Wyoming scrambling for ways to defray rising electricity costs.

A fraction of homeowners already do this in the Equality State by using credits from their utility for generating their own electricity using solar panels and sending excess amounts back to the grid, an arrangement known as net metering. But Wyoming law caps net-metering systems at 25 kilowatts, large enough to include just about any homeowner’s rooftop solar system, but too small to provide enough credits to offset all the electricity larger properties, like ranches, draw from the grid.

Earlier this year, a coalition of environmentalists, businesses and ranchers, including Teichert and Thornock, unsuccessfully supported a bill that would have raised Wyoming’s net-metering cap to 250 kilowatts.

Teichert and Thornock were initially counting on changes to the law as they eyed REAP funds. Teichert, a sturdy man with pale blue eyes and a trim Fu Manchu mustache, eventually applied and was awarded a $440,000 grant to build a ranch shed supporting around 250 kilowatts of solar panels. Today, with no ability to net meter, he fears he may never recoup his investment, which was over $500,000. Thornock, whose wide, boyish grin sits atop a hefty build, was approved for $868,000 in REAP funding to build a 648-kilowatt solar system. Concerned that his project’s viability rested on the judgment of state lawmakers, he returned the money.

The Department of Agriculture has since stopped funding renewable energy projects on farmland. REAP was a “huge opportunity we all missed in Wyoming,” Thornock said.

The two men are not the only Wyoming ranchers interested in using solar to give their businesses more stability.

“A lot of ranchers really look to renewables to help diversify their revenue stream, keep the ranch whole, and keep their family on the ranch, keep the land together,” said Chris Brown, executive director of Powering Up Wyoming, a renewable energy advocacy group. Most of the ranchers he’s worked with are interested in leasing their lands to solar developers, rather than purchasing their own systems, and his organization is neutral on net-metering.

Rocky Mountain Power says it is open to changes in the state’s net-metering laws, and the utility did not take a position on net metering during last spring’s legislative session.

“It’s not a level playing field; you’re dealing with a monopoly—a government-subsidized monopoly, government-protected monopoly.”

— Jason Thornock

“We have worked diligently in recent decades with customers, municipalities, state legislatures, in order to facilitate particular regulatory and pricing changes to allow customers to meet their energy goals,” said David Eskelsen, a spokesperson for PacifiCorp, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company and a subsidiary of billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.

If rate hikes keep coming and margins don’t improve, Teichert, who runs his ranch with his brother, fears he and Thornock will eventually have to sell their lands, which crisscross much of Cokeville. They find other utilities’ arguments against net-metering expansion dubious, and fume at the business model and regulatory environment that allows utilities to earn enormous profits but restricts their customers from making their own energy use more affordable. The two ranchers find it particularly ironic that Rocky Mountain Power could build power lines across their property to carry renewable energy to California, Oregon and Washington, while it is illegal for them to install enough solar panels to cover their own electrical bills.

“It’s not a level playing field; you’re dealing with a monopoly—a government-subsidized monopoly, government-protected monopoly,” Thornock said on his ride to see Teichert’s solar array. “It’s got all the power in the world. And, like Tim says, they want to sell renewable energy to California, [Washington] and Oregon. They won’t let us do it because they want the control.”

Reaping Few Rewards

Teichert pulled his truck through a gate and into a field of alfalfa and hay. Just beyond was a shed with 18 red steel legs that looked like an enormous centipede straddling bales of hay and some farming equipment. On top of the shed sat Teichert’s $1.1 million solar system, which was designed to cover the electrical costs of running all his irrigation system’s pivots and pumps.

If Teichert could net meter, he says he would be more competitive with ranchers just a few miles away in Idaho and Utah, where net-metering laws are much less restrictive than in Wyoming.

In Idaho, ranchers can install up to 100 kilowatts of solar, and that number jumps to 2 megawatts for ranchers in Utah, 80 times the limit in Wyoming.

Rocky Mountain Power charges irrigators different base electricity rates in each state, but regardless of the price of the power, any savings are helpful to big users like agricultural operations.

“Quite a few of the farmers [in Idaho and Utah] do it,” said Teichert, of net-metered solar.

In 2023, while Teichert was designing his system, Thornock was considering whether it was wise to spend his money on a solar array. He believed there was a good chance Wyoming wouldn’t change its law to increase the cap on net metering. Since his system would be more than 25 times the size that’s allowed to net meter, Thornock anticipated it would be extremely difficult for it to pay for itself if he wasn’t credited for sending excess electricity to the grid. He backed out of his REAP grant, and advised Teichert to do the same.

But Teichert forged ahead and installed his panels, believing it would be no big deal to convince Wyoming lawmakers to adjust the state’s net-metering law—especially given the more advantageous arrangement ranchers in Idaho and Utah enjoy with the same utility. “I thought I’d be ahead of everybody,” he said.

Once the bill to raise Wyoming’s net-metering cap failed, Teichert pivoted. He began exploring a power purchase agreement with Rocky Mountain Power, in which the utility would buy electricity from him like he was a power plant. He said he had been told by the company installing his panels that a power purchase agreement could net him a good deal.

But when he saw how much the utility would pay him, he laughed. The utility would give him less than 1 cent per kilowatt hour in winter periods of low demand, and about 4 cents in peak summer demand hours. He would get much more of a financial benefit from the electricity he sent to the grid if he was instead compensated through net metering, which Wyoming law typically requires be credited at Rocky Mountain Power’s retail rate of electricity. The utility charges him around 14 cents per kilowatt hour, he said.

Setting up to sell his excess electricity to the grid through a power purchase agreement could leave Teichert even deeper in the hole, he added, as the utility informed him it would need $43,000 just to look at connecting his system to its grid.

Originally, Teichert expected to pay off his solar shed in 10 years, but with the additional costs and the rates the utility offered, “I don’t know that I’ll ever come out on the deal,” he said.

And now, the federal support that incentivized him to pursue solar has been eliminated; in August the Department of Agriculture announced it would no longer fund solar or wind projects through REAP.

Teichert eventually decided to purchase a battery system to back up his panels. He does not plan on selling any of his electricity to Rocky Mountain Power.

“I should have listened to Jason,” he said.

Thornock feels he dodged a bullet.

Driving away from the solar shed, Teichert and Thornock said their history with Rocky Mountain Power contradicts other utilities’ arguments against net-metering.

Lines in the Valley

The biggest of the power lines crisscrossing the valley where Teichert and Thornock ranch belong to PacifiCorp, whose planned Gateway West project to deliver renewable energy to customers in California, Oregon and Washington would add even more lines. Some of those new lines could cross Teichert and Thornock’s properties, the men say.

They’ve got more experience with power lines than most utility customers, as they actually built some of the smaller lines coming off Rocky Mountain Power’s system.

Both men say the utility sent inflated estimates of the cost to install new lines to bring additional power to their growing ranching operations, leading them to seek help elsewhere.

In 2020, Teichert said he contracted a company to put in a power line for about $600,000 after the utility told him he would need to pay over $1 million for the same job, he said. Thornock has repeatedly testified to state lawmakers that Rocky Mountain Power nearly bankrupted him when he first began ranching in the late 2000s after going back and forth with him about whether they would deliver power on lines he had installed. Thornock wound up in court and lost, then had to cover the utility’s attorney fees.

The whole saga “was that close to breaking me,” he said, as Teichert drove by the poles he had installed.

Utilities warn that net-metering systems can allow those with rooftop solar to avoid paying fixed expenses for the grid they feed into, like system maintenance and construction costs, which, according to reporting by the New York Times, account for a growing share of utilities’ spending. “That in effect sets up a subsidy flowing from customers who don’t use net-metering systems to those who do,” said Eskelsen, PacifiCorp’s spokesperson. Any price issues rooftop solar customers cause are confined within their “rate class” of customers who use a similar amount of electricity, he added.

Determining how—or whether—to alter the rates for net-metering customers to make sure they’re paying their fair share for the infrastructure that takes their excess energy has been a sticking point between utilities and Wyoming’s net-metering supporters. Rooftop solar supporters say that subsidization likely occurs all over the grid regardless of whether a homeowner or business is net metering, and claim that avoiding transmission costs saves all ratepayers money.

Experts generally say that rooftop solar’s dependence on infrastructure that it isn’t paying for won’t create billing issues until 10 to 20 percent of a utility’s customer base is in the program. Less than two percent of all Wyoming homes have rooftop solar panels, according to estimates from the Solar Energy Industry Association.

Given all the work he’s paid for, Teichert finds utilities’ arguments about cost sharing disingenuous. “When they sit there and say, ‘Well, we’re not paying our share,’ we’ve more than paid our share,” Teichert said. “That bugs me that they lie like that.”

Thornock said he would be happy to pay for any issues a net-metering solar system may cause—provided the new rate is fair, and preferably not suggested by a utility.

“We’re not asking for a handout. I don’t want Rocky Mountain Power subsidizing me,” he said. “I just want to be able to compete. I just want to be able to make a living.”

When told of Teichert and Thornock’s experience building their own power lines, Eskelsen was surprised, but said it was possible in such a rural area. “That’s not something that we typically allow,” he said.

But what really bothers Teichert and Thornock is the utility business model. In Wyoming, as determined by the Public Service Commission in the company’s latest rate case hearing, Rocky Mountain Power is entitled to a 9.5 percent return on equity, around the national average, according to S&P estimates. In other words, if Rocky Mountain Power uses shareholder funds to build long-term assets, like power plants, it can recover up to an additional 9.5 percent of the total value of those assets from its customers and deliver that back to shareholders as profit.

This incentivizes Rocky Mountain Power to “explode [their] costs,” Thornock said. “Ten percent of 10 million is a lot more than [10] percent of a million,” he continued. “Even I can do that math.”

At least one former utility executive believes that the nationwide average of around 10 percent return on equity for utilities is too lucrative, and should be closer to 6 percent to more appropriately reflect the benefits and risks of investing in a utility.

“We’re not asking for a handout. I don’t want Rocky Mountain Power subsidizing me. I just want to be able to compete. I just want to be able to make a living.”

— Jason Thornock

A utility’s return on equity is misunderstood, Eskelsen said, and functions more like a ceiling than a guarantee. Because utilities must “open our books to utility commissions,” who judge whether the company has spent prudently, they have a “powerful incentive” not to exaggerate their costs, he said. A commission disallowing a utility’s costs cuts profits for utility shareholders, he added.

Back in Teichert’s truck, he and Thornock laughed at the fantasy of getting a guaranteed profit on cattle and crop purchases. “I think that’s why there’s such a huge blowback from these utilities on net metering,” Thornock said. “They can see that if we let these guys produce their own power, they’re going to see right through all the nonsense.”

“And I don’t blame them,” he continued. “If I was in their shoes, man, that’s crazy money—and they’re protected by the government to do it.”

Staying Alive

For their way of life to remain sustainable for themselves, their kids and grandkids, Wyoming needs to either increase the net-meeting cap or change how it regulates utilities “so we can have something fair,” Teichert said.

But he and Thornock see many of Wyoming’s representatives as too deferential to utilities, and neither of them has much faith that the state will overhaul the system.

While it is not unusual for politicians in Wyoming to accept donations from sectors they regulate, at least one member of the Wyoming Senate has close professional ties to a utility. Dan Dockstader, a state Senator representing Teton and Lincoln counties, which includes Cokeville, is a board member of Lower Valley Energy, an electric cooperative.

As last year’s net-metering bill came up for a vote in the Senate, Dockstader amended the bill to exempt electric utility co-ops from Public Service Commission oversight when it came to setting net-metering customers’ rates. The commission now has “limited jurisdiction over eighteen retail rural electric cooperatives,” according to its website.

The amendment didn’t sit well with Thornock. “[Dockstader is] representing Lower Valley Energy, he’s not representing the people who are using the power,” he said.

“I was representing the interests of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association (WREA) with 14 electric power distribution cooperates and another three generation and transmission cooperates,” Dockstader said, in an email. “All efforts to pass legislation should include a balanced approach with the rural cooperatives.”

Those who have been trying to find a way to raise Wyoming’s net-metering cap agree that utilities hold a lot of sway with lawmakers in Cheyenne.

“We watched numerous amendments chip away at the original intent of the bill, to the point where we realized if it passed it would actually be a step back for rooftop solar deployment in Wyoming,” said John Burrows, climate and energy director for the Wyoming Outdoor Council.

“Utilities have established, professional lobbyists,” he continued. “They lobbied quite aggressively on this issue and I suspect that that had an impact on where the bill went.”

Moving forward, net-metering supporters are trying to resolve their differences with utility companies through a third-party facilitator before introducing another bill, according to Burrows.

“Net metering still needs to happen,” Thornock said. Other energy sources, like small modular nuclear reactors that can generate power without emissions, but rely on unproven technologies, intrigue him—but he worries they’ll also be hobbled by the kinds of problems plaguing net metering. “If we don’t get this net-meeting stuff figured out we’re not going to be able to take advantage of the technology that’s coming,” he said.

Clouds shrouded the high sun over Cokeville when Teichert dropped Thornock off at his house around noon. Cruising around his hometown, where he once taught middle school English, Teichert pointed out about half a dozen homes sporting rooftop solar panels. As the cost of living goes up, his 91-year-old mother’s house may be next.

“At some point, my mom’s gonna have to choose between, do you turn on the power or do you buy groceries?” he said.

Rising costs, including for electricity, pose a similar dilemma to his business. “If it gets to the point where you can’t afford to ranch, our only option is to start selling 35-acre parcels,” he said.

Eventually, Teichert navigated toward the mountains. He slowed to admire the clarity of a creek, pulled over to gush over the ski slopes just outside of town and spoke eloquently about Cokeville’s history as an energy hub. But on his way home, he saw ranchland that had been carved up and sold to developers, and his eyes winced with angst. He kept driving.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/042725_Bolster_Cokeville_034.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 10:01:34.612481

Dec. 14 (Reuters) - BNSF Railway, one of the crown jewels of Warren Buffett’s sprawling Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, calls itself an environmental leader in ⁠the U.S. rail industry with the cleanest locomotive fleet in North America.

“When ⁠you see our orange locomotives’ and freight cars’ ‍steel wheels moving on steel rails, think green,” BNSF says in its latest sustainability overview.

But the company is the largest player in an industry that has a pollution problem: U.S. freight railroads are a major source of pollution, chuffing out more nitrogen oxide, the primary component of smog, than all the nation’s coal-fired power plants combined, according to a Reuters calculation using government data.

U.S. railroads together produced about 485,000 tons of nitrogen oxide in 2024, compared to 452,000 tons emitted by U.S. coal-fired power plants, according to a Reuters calculation of reported annual fuel consumption multiplied by the EPA’s 2023 weighted-average emission rates.

BNSF, the nation's largest freight railroad, accounts for about a third of that total, producing 161,500 tons of smog-causing nitrogen oxide in 2024, according to the ‍data. “We don't dispute your number. BNSF is the biggest Class I railroad by volume,” BNSF said in an email.

BNSF's position as largest in the rail industry, as well as its profitability, will be challenged if regulators approve the planned $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, which would create the first U.S. coast-to-coast freight ​rail operator, Morningstar railroad analyst Greggory Warren said.

Reuters shared its calculations with four industry experts and all agreed it was a fair methodology. About 80% of the industry's NOx tons are produced by Class I railroads, the industry term for the six major railroads with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Details on the rail industry’s recent NOx emissions performance, BNSF’s share of those emissions, and the factors driving the ongoing high levels of pollution have not previously been reported.

Railroad locomotive pollution causes an estimated $48 billion in healthcare costs and 3,100 premature deaths annually in ​the United States, according to the EPA’s Co-Benefits Risk Assessment tool.

“Americans don’t realize how much harmful pollution comes from old diesel locomotives,” said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, a California group that advocates for public health. “EPA should require the railroad companies to modernize their fleets,” he said.

The EPA declined to comment specifically on rail pollution for this story, but said: ""The Trump EPA is committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water, and land for all Americans.”

AGING FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVES

The railroad industry’s poor emissions performance is due mainly to the fact that it has largely stopped replacing its aging fleet of locomotives. The average age of U.S. locomotives is about 28 years, compared with 20 years in 2009, according to EPA and industry reports.

That's a problem because federal emissions standards for locomotives depend on how old they are with the oldest grandfathered into the lightest limits.

With no requirement to retire old locomotives, the U.S. freight rail ​industry has dragged its feet on buying new ones, a dynamic amplified by industry fears that new regulations under future administrations could render their investments obsolete, according to Environmental Protection Agency data, and interviews with analysts and railroad executives.

Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, says railroads have lost their taste for innovation. ""Our air pollution standards for railroads have an engine-sized loophole in them, which companies are using to... keep old, dirty trains on the tracks,"" Markey said in a statement to Reuters.

The rail industry says that it is the cleanest option available to move freight over land, and cites data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. A locomotive can move a ton of freight about 500 miles on a gallon of fuel, which is three to four times more efficient than trucks.

The Association of American Railroads said it was also unfair to compare rail to power plants, ​saying locomotives have little choice but to burn diesel. ""These power plants have multiple other viable options for generation – coal, natural gas, hydropower, wind, nuclear, etc. That is not the case for rail,"" the trade group told Reuters.

BNSF, meanwhile, told Reuters that it is working to reduce its emissions through efficiency and technology improvements, and stands by its claim to have the cleanest fleet in the industry based on the outright number of modern locomotives in its possession.

BNSF said 360 of its 6,780 total are modern locomotives subject to the strictest federal emissions standards, called Tier 4, the largest ‌outright number in the industry.

That's just 5% of the company's total fleet that is active or in storage, according to Surface Transportation Board data. By contrast, rival Canadian National has nearly 300 Tier 4 locomotives, making up about 27% of its total fleet, according to analysts and CN press releases about new locomotive orders.

Tier 4 locomotives operated by BNSF's nearest competitors number about 270 at Union Pacific; about 225 at CSX Corp.; and about 80 at Norfolk Southern, according to EPA data, company press releases and trade industry reports.

BNSF spent $394 million on 165 new and rebuilt locomotives from 2020 to 2024. That was down 69% from the prior five ​years when it spent $1.26 billion on 558 locomotives, as replacement of aging engines—some lasting up to 40 years—slowed sharply, according to BNSF annual reports filed with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.

CLEANEST FLEET?

BNSF's high emissions, however, are not just the result of ⁠its size.

BNSF’s fuel economy is the worst among the country’s six major railroads, according to railroad operating statistics filed with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, the industry’s economic regulator.

In 2024, BNSF burned 1.14 gallons of diesel for every ton of weight it moved 1,000 miles, an industry metric called a gross ton mile. Union Pacific burned 1.08 gallons to move the same weight the same distance, and the most efficient, Canadian National, burned 0.88 gallons, according to the data.

Railroad industry analysts interviewed by Reuters said one reason for BNSF's low fuel economy is that it handles more intermodal freight than peers.

These high-priority shipping containers need to move faster than regular freight because they are typically more time-sensitive, said ‌Jason Kuehn, a railroad analyst and vice president at consulting firm Oliver Wyman.

BNSF's intermodal shipments totaled 5.3 million in 2024, or nearly 60% more than No. 2 Union Pacific, according to company disclosures.

Analysts said BNSF's efficiency is also likely hurt by its limited adoption of precision-scheduled railroading, an industry practice meant to reduce costs and fuel use through longer trains, fewer locomotives, and less idling time. Fuel efficiency can also be hindered by mountainous terrain and congestion on a railroad's network.

BNSF declined to comment on the reasons behind its relatively low fuel economy, but maintains it is an environmental leader in the industry based on its adoption of new locomotives, which allow it to burn fuel more cleanly.

“BNSF has the most modern platform locomotives in the rail industry, the basis for our cleanest fleet statement,” the company told Reuters.

It declined to provide details on its fleet-wide emissions intensity, and Reuters was unable to verify if it was better than rivals.

Tier 4 locomotives can reduce NOx emissions by about 80% compared to Tier 3 models, ‌according to the EPA.

FEAR OF REGULATION

The main reason railroads stopped spending big money on new locomotives is because they are worried new regulations - including proposed zero-emissions standards in California - could quickly make them obsolete.

""These locomotives have a lifespan of 40 to 45 years, and you're saying they won't be able to use those because we'll have zero emissions,"" said Roger Nober, director of George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center who retired as BNSF’s chief legal officer in 2023.

""Railroads don’t see that as an efficient ‌use of their capital.""

In 2008, the EPA hoped to clean up freight rail by setting new standards for locomotives, including higher standards for new Tier 3 and Tier 4 models. But rather than encourage replacement of old locomotives, rail companies have slowed down their purchases of new locomotives dramatically.

In 2008, the EPA estimated that at least 30% of freight locomotives would be operating under the strictest limits by 2025. But as of 2023 only 6.5% of 19,303 active locomotives operated by the big six railroads meet that limit, according to the EPA.

Before 2008, American railroads replaced their locomotives at a 4% rate per year, according to the U.S. Office of Transportation and Air Quality. By 2024, the industry replacement rate had dropped to 0.5% per year.

Neither BNSF nor its rivals provide exact data on the model years of active locomotives in their national fleets.

One key battle for the industry has been opposing California's proposed emissions standard, which would have banned locomotives older than 23 years from operating in ‍the state, and required all locomotives to be zero-emissions by 2035.

Because California is such a large market, it can effectively set the national standard.

Officials at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) estimated that by 2050 the stricter rules would have reduced 7,400 tons of diesel soot, 386,000 tons of NOx and cut cancer risk for those living near rail operations by up to 90%.

But it would have also barred 65% of active freight locomotives from operating in the state, rail officials say.

A week before Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. president in January, California withdrew the proposal.

Trump has been a frequent critic of CARB and was expected to block the initiative by denying ⁠California the waiver it would have needed to set state pollution rules that are tougher than federal ones.

In May, House Republicans introduced the Locomotives Act, which would prevent California from securing such waivers. The bill has been referred to the Energy and Commerce Committee.

FIGHTING GREEN TECHNOLOGY

The rail industry has also lobbied hard against the adoption of clean technologies. BNSF told the EPA last year at a public hearing that their test of a battery-electric locomotive failed to deliver enough power to move tons of freight over long distances.

""The battery had two megawatts of usable energy,” John Lovenburg, BNSF’s vice president for environment and sustainability, said. “That’s roughly 1/40th of the energy we will need for line-haul locomotives.”

Electric locomotives are viable for shorter routes and replacing diesel locomotives in switch yards, but for long distances they're limited by battery weight, said Alex Scott, a professor of supply chain management at the University of Tennessee.

Battery-electric locomotives are not prevalent in the United States and other parts of the world. But in China, India and Russia, a majority of their freight locomotives draw their power from overhead electric lines, or catenary systems.

That sort of electrification in North America would cost more than $1.1 trillion for 139,000 miles of track used by the six major railroads, according to a February 2025 study by the Association of American Railroads.

""The railroad industry is slow to adopt new things because if you have problems, it's not just your problem,"" Scott explained. ""You're creating problems for your customers and other railroads because they share track all of the time.""

Owned by the Seiko Epson Corporation, the brand is reinforcing its commitment to efficient, compact and precise innovation to address major environmental challenges.

A core component of Epson's philosophy is the reduction of its environmental footprint, with a particular emphasis on energy consumption across all its operations.

Epson's sustainability report outlines a clear strategy to achieve this, aiming to become carbon negative by 2050.

Decarbonisation and energy reduction targets

Epson’s strategy sets out ambitious, science-based targets for decarbonisation.

By 2030, Epson aims to cut its total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 90% and reduce its overall emissions by 55%.

These objectives are aligned with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target.

To meet these goals, Epson is concentrating on minimising energy consumption and reducing water use, waste and greenhouse gas emissions, especially within its European facilities.

Takanori Inaho, President of Epson Europe, says: “As we celebrate 50 years of the Epson brand, our commitment to pushing technology boundaries and driving meaningful sustainable change has never been stronger.

""The approval of our climate goals by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) formalises our ambition to become carbon negative by 2050, reshaping how we operate and collaborate throughout our value chain.""

To tackle Scope 3 emissions, which account for the largest portion of its carbon footprint, Epson has incorporated the end use of its products and the procurement of raw materials into its science-based targets.

Energy efficiency

A key step in its energy reduction journey during FY24 was the relocation of its UK headquarters to a more energy-efficient building.

The new office does not use gas for heating, a move that has contributed to a 56% reduction in Epson’s total gas consumption across its operations.

Epson intends to use its own technology to advance digitisation and automation, deploying manufacturing solutions designed to save energy and space.

Through these innovations, Epson plans to lessen its overall environmental impact while continuing to meet market demands and enhance productivity.

Boris Manev, Sustainability Director at Epson Europe, says: “We recognise that embedding responsible practices throughout our operations is an evolving process requiring dedication, transparency and collaboration.

""By aligning our ESG efforts with evolving regulations, we mitigate risks, unlock opportunities and reinforce our leadership in responsible innovation and corporate governance.”

A circular model for resource efficiency

Epson is also focused on closing the resource loop to foster a circular economy, which has direct implications for energy use.

Epson's goal is to use resources more efficiently and extend the life of its products through reuse and refurbishment programmes.

For instance, faulty printers can be returned, assessed and repaired before being resold.

This process extends the product lifespan, meaning the energy and raw materials required for new manufacturing are conserved.

In November 2024, Epson also introduced an ink cartridge refill initiative to collect and reuse spent inkjet cartridges.

As part of this programme, Epson plans to optimise pallet configurations and improve reverse logistics.

Engaging customers and partners to increase return rates could contribute substantially to Epson's wider sustainability and energy-saving objectives.

“Recognised with Platinum EcoVadis status, Epson is dedicated to responsible sustainability leadership,” Takanori says.

“The choices we make today will shape the next 50 years – and we are ready to lead with purpose and determination.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/74ab59c2b96acede31cad7daa4e2f7b4:3a0e7750ae5b2a96ef667f57b3320681/closed-resourse-loop-05.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 04:58:31.737346

The White House's policy pivot has thrown billions of dollars' worth of U.S. offshore wind projects into turmoil. Industry interest and investment are looking elsewhere, and developing regions with ample wind resources, such as Southeast Asia, have the most to gain from this likely reshuffling, analysts say.

Wind energy is essential to efforts to curb climate change, scientists say, as global temperatures drift perilously higher. Offshore wind, which uses turbines installed in the sea, is set to grow rapidly because it can harness stronger, steadier ocean winds to generate clean electricity, the International Energy Agency says.

Southeast Asia, with its archipelago nations, long coastlines and consistently windy seas, is emerging as one of the world's most promising regions for this technology. As energy demand continues to rise, the Philippines and Vietnam are building policy momentum that proponents hope will spur interest across the region.

Those moves could turn Southeast Asia into a model for other developing nations seeking to use wind energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, said Rebecca Williams, with the Global Wind Energy Council.

""Asia and Southeast Asia are a beacon of hope for the industry,"" she said.

Trump has actively sought to kill the U.S. offshore wind industry, one of his presidential campaign promises.

He opposes using renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes burning fossil fuels for electricity, contending that climate change is a hoax.

The White House has halted construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked and paused permits, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for wind energy and cut $679 million in federal funding for a dozen projects -- a complete reversal from former President Joe Biden's Administration.

Trump's anti-renewable energy stance has shaken U.S. confidence in offshore wind projects.

That has kickstarted an industry-wide search for other places to invest.

Globally, wind energy generation is growing, led by China. It dominates wind power installations and manufactures more than half of the world's wind turbines. Beijing is also emerging as a quiet force in the region's offshore wind buildout, supplying turbines and engineering expertise as countries race to tap their coastal wind potential.

""We're seeing more governments in the Global South, especially in countries in Asia, who haven't had that background in offshore wind, now really step up,"" Williams said.

Home to half of the global population, Asia is expected to account for much of the world's future energy demand. Yet the region still relies heavily on fossil fuels, and wind generates barely 7% of Asia-Pacific's electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.

The 11-member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, a vast region that includes tiny Brunei to populous Indonesia, have no installed wind power capacity.

So there's a lot of untapped potential up for grabs, said Amisha Patel, with the Global Offshore Wind Alliance, an organization of countries promoting offshore wind.

Trump's rhetoric is disappointing given America's vast wind potential, but it hasn't slowed global wind power developments, and ""Southeast Asia is stepping forward as the U.S. retreats,"" she said.

Last month, Singapore announced a three-year plan for wind energy conferences to attract investment and become a regional hub for the industry.

""Asia is looking very, very attractive because of the momentum that we're seeing there and the core understanding of the value of offshore wind,"" Patel said.

The Philippines and Vietnam have an early advantage.

The Philippines held its first offshore wind auction in November, allowing companies to bid and compete for the right to build 3.3 gigawatts of wind farms on designated seabeds. Energy Secretary Sharon Garin said that shifted offshore wind power from ""potential to reality,"" with clear rules and plans for how wind farms will connect to the grid, which ports they'll use and how equipment will be moved.

""The Philippines is ready to compete for global investment,"" she said in a statement.

Filipino corporation ACEN partnered with Denmark's Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners in May to co-develop the nation's first large-scale offshore wind project, aiming for up to 1 gigawatt in the central Philippine province of Camarines Sur.

Vietnam has revived long-stalled offshore wind ambitions, issuing new rules and courting foreign investors. It revised its national power plan in April, targeting up to 17 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035, and is speeding up marine zoning rules and updating permitting procedures.

Regulatory delays led Norway's Equinor to withdraw from Vietnam in 2024, but investor confidence is slowly growing. Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners is working with state-owned PetroVietnam on an offshore wind project in south-central Vietnam and Germany's PNE AG is planning a $4.6 billion, 2-gigawatt farm in Binh Dinh province.

Vietnam is exploring regional projects. It signed a deal in May for a transmission line to export power to Singapore and Malaysia.

China is also emerging as an important player in the region. State-owned Power China completed the Binh Dai offshore wind power project in Vietnam in November, according to the China's official Xinhua news agency. In the Philippines, Mingyang Smart Energy is exploring a 2-gigawatt project in Northern Luzon.

Extreme weather is a challenge for offshore wind, especially in the Philippines and Vietnam, which endured an onslaught of deadly typhoons this year.

But technology for disaster-resilient turbines exists, said Michael Hannibal of Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. ""Countries will just need to make sure offshore wind sites are adapted and made for the environment that they are to live with and stand in,"" he said.

What's the story

Global electric vehicle (EV) sales have surged by 21% in November compared to the same period in 2024, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The research firm noted that two million EVs were sold worldwide during the month. This brings the total global EV sales for the year to date to an impressive 18.5 million units. Europe has emerged as a major contributor to this growth, while North America continues to lag behind.

Market dynamics

Europe's EV market outpaces North America

The European EV market witnessed a remarkable 36% year-on-year growth in November 2025. Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales rose by 35%, while Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) sales jumped by an impressive 39%. This brings Europe's total EV sales for the year to date to a whopping 3.8 million units, up by 33% from January-November 2024. Meanwhile, North America continues to trail after US EV tax credits expired on September 30, 2025.

Growth factors

France and Italy boost EV sales with new initiatives

France has finally returned to year-to-date growth in November, up 1% after spending most of 2025 in the red due to earlier subsidy cuts. The rebound was led by automakers such as Volkswagen and Renault, a wider selection of EV models, and France's ""leasing social"" program aimed at helping lower-income households switch to EVs. Meanwhile, Italy saw record EV sales of just under 25,000 units in November after launching a new incentive program aimed at replacing older internal combustion vehicles.

For the moment, the outlook for MOCHI remains promising, much like the clear view through a window coated with this material.
Co-authors of the study include Amit Bhardwaj, Blaise Fleury, Eldo Abraham and Taewoo Lee, all postdoctoral research associates in the Department of Physics at CU Boulder.
Bohdan Senyuk, Jan Bart ten Hove and Vladyslav Cherpak, former postdoctoral researchers at CU Boulder, also contributed as co-authors.","The material is called Mesoporous Optically Clear Heat Insulator, or MOCHI. It can be manufactured as thick blocks or thin flexible sheets that attach to the interior surface of standard windows. At present, MOCHI is only produced in the laboratory and is not yet available to consumers, but the researchers report that it is durable and nearly completely see-through.

Because of its clarity, MOCHI maintains an unobstructed view, which sets it apart from many other window insulation products.

""To block heat exchange, you can put a lot of insulation in your walls, but windows need to be transparent,"" said Ivan Smalyukh, senior author of the study and a professor of physics at CU Boulder. ""Finding insulators that are transparent is really challenging.""

The research team published its findings on Dec. 11 in the journal Science.

Why Window Heat Loss Matters

Buildings of all kinds, from houses to large office towers, account for about 40% of global energy consumption. Much of that energy is wasted as heat escapes to the outdoors during winter or enters buildings during hot weather.

Smalyukh and his collaborators hope MOCHI will slow that unwanted heat flow.

The new material is a silicone-based gel with a complex internal structure. It contains air trapped within extremely fine pores that are far thinner than a human hair. These microscopic pockets make MOCHI an excellent thermal barrier. In fact, a sheet only 5 millimeters thick is enough to let a person safely hold a flame against it.

""No matter what the temperatures are outside, we want people to be able to have comfortable temperatures inside without having to waste energy,"" said Smalyukh, a fellow at the Renewable And Sustainable Energy Institute (RASEI) at CU Boulder.

How MOCHI Controls Light and Heat

Smalyukh described the key to MOCHI's performance as its precisely arranged air pockets.

The new material shares similarities with aerogels, which are well-known insulators used in many industries. (NASA uses aerogels inside its Mars rovers to keep electronics warm). Aerogels also rely on air-filled pores, but those pores are typically arranged in a random pattern that scatters light. This is why aerogels often appear cloudy and are sometimes referred to as ""frozen smoke.""

The CU Boulder team wanted an insulating material that would maintain clarity while providing strong thermal resistance.

To build MOCHI, researchers combined surfactant molecules with a liquid mixture. These molecules naturally cluster into thread-like shapes, somewhat like the separation that occurs when oil and vinegar form layers in salad dressing. Silicone molecules in the same mixture attach themselves to the surface of those tiny threads.

Through several controlled steps, the researchers then remove the detergent clusters and replace them with air. This leaves behind a silicone framework surrounding a network of ultra-small, air-filled channels. Smalyukh likens the intricate pattern to a ""plumber's nightmare.""

Air accounts for more than 90% of MOCHI's volume.

Stopping Heat at the Molecular Scale

Heat travels through a gas in a way similar to a billiards-style chain reaction. Energy causes gas molecules and atoms to move faster and collide with one another, passing heat along as they strike.

The pores inside MOCHI are so tiny that the gas molecules cannot freely collide. Instead, they repeatedly hit the silicone walls, which prevents heat from easily spreading through the material.

""The molecules don't have a chance to collide freely with each other and exchange energy,"" Smalyukh said. ""Instead, they bump into the walls of the pores.""

Despite this strong heat blocking ability, MOCHI reflects only about .2% of incoming light, allowing nearly all visible light to pass through.

Potential Uses and Future Development

The researchers envision many applications for a clear material that effectively traps heat. One possibility is a device that captures warmth from sunlight and converts it into low-cost, sustainable energy.

""Even when it's a somewhat cloudy day, you could still harness a lot of energy and then use it to heat your water and your building interior,"" Smalyukh said.

For now, MOCHI is not ready for commercial release. Its laboratory production requires considerable time, although Smalyukh believes that more efficient manufacturing methods can be developed. The components used to make MOCHI are relatively low-cost, which supports the long-term potential for scaling the technology.

For the moment, the outlook for MOCHI remains promising, much like the clear view through a window coated with this material.

This new initiative builds upon a substantial existing portfolio between the two companies, which already encompasses approximately 3.5 GW of power capacity that is either currently in operation or under contract.

The deal addresses the escalating energy requirements of the technology sector, a trend further highlighted by the companies’ recent agreements to add 600 megawatts of clean energy capacity to the electricity grid in Oklahoma.

The companies are currently in the active development phase for the first three campuses under this new agreement and have set a target of mid-2026 for the release of their first commercial technology product on the Google Cloud Marketplace.

Accelerate deployment of data centers

This collaborative effort focuses on accelerating the deployment of data centers by systematically addressing critical infrastructure hurdles.

These challenges include land acquisition, managing load interconnection, and the simultaneous development of supporting power generation resources needed to sustain large-scale artificial intelligence operations.A central component of this energy strategy involves the revitalization of nuclear power capabilities to support the electrical grid.

“Most recently, the companies announced the restart of the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa followed by two new long-term power purchase agreements to add 600 megawatts of clean energy capacity to Oklahoma’s electricity grid to support Google’s technology infrastructure,” noted a press release.

To facilitate this restart, NextEra Energy has formally requested that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) restore grid connection rights for the shuttered facility.

This regulatory filing seeks to reclaim interconnection rights that had previously been transferred from the nuclear plant to a planned solar energy project at the same site.

The move follows a licensing change request that NextEra filed with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in January, marking a distinct shift from solar back to nuclear baseload power to meet steady demand.

Digital transformation of operations

Beyond the construction of physical infrastructure, the partnership will implement a digital transformation of NextEra Energy’s operations using Google Cloud’s artificial intelligence tools.

This integration will utilize Google’s “TimesFM 2.5” time-series open-source forecasting model and the “WeatherNext 2” weather forecasting system. By combining these AI capabilities with NextEra’s proprietary asset data, the companies aim to improve grid reliability and resilience.

“Pairing NextEra Energy’s capabilities with Google’s latest time-series open source forecasting model, weather forecasting model and security-constrained power flow modeling will give NextEra Energy and its customers better insights into system optimization opportunities, enhancing utilities’ planning and grid management efforts to keep costs affordable while making electric service more reliable and resilient,” highlighted the press release.

This approach is designed to maintain safety and reduce operational costs for both the utility and its customers, particularly as the grid faces challenges from aging assets and unprecedented load growth.

NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO John Ketchum characterized the partnership as a reflection of the current moment where the energy and technology sectors are becoming increasingly intertwined.

The majority of environmental agency staffing cuts in Louisiana happened during Bobby Jindal’s terms as governor from 2008-16.
He placed environmental scientist Paul Templet in charge of Environmental Quality, and the administration tied industrial incentives to benchmarks for reducing pollution.
The Environmental Integrity Project report points out cuts in Department of Environmental Quality staff and funding come as Louisiana sees a boom in industrial investment.","From 2010 through 2024, the numbers show the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality personnel count decreased 24% with 222 positions eliminated from the agency. The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department.

As the Trump administration sheds staff and funding at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a new analysis places Louisiana among states that have notably slashed their pollution regulation resources even as industry expands.

The report from the Environmental Integrity Project evaluated staffing and changes in operating budgets at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality and comparable agencies in other states. From 2010 through 2024, the numbers show the agency’s personnel count decreased 24% with 222 positions eliminated from the agency. The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department.

“These cuts increase the risk that residents will face higher levels of pollution, especially if the EPA lacks the funding and capacity to do its job,” Environmental Integrity Project executive director Jen Duggan said Wednesday during a news conference for the report’s release.

“In Louisiana, we feel them deeply,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade who also took part in the news conference.

The report focused on the Department of Environmental Quality’s operating budget, or the money it spends to handle day-to-day tasks such as paying employees, maintaining facilities, lab analysis and grants to local governments. Large loans and federal grants, which are considered as capital costs, were excluded from the analysis where possible to avoid outliers because they vary widely from year to year and “do not measure a state’s capacity” to limit pollution, according to the report’s methodology.

The staffing cuts at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality are “among the most of any state,” according to the report. Other standouts included Mississippi, which reduced its environmental agency funding 71% from 2010 to 2024.

On the other end of the spectrum is California, which increased its environmental operating budget by 364% over the same 14 years.

At the federal level, the Trump administration has said it intends to bring the EPA’s employee count down to levels last seen during the Reagan era, when the agency had between 11,000 and 14,000 people of staff, NPR reported. It began Trump’s second term with about 15,000 employees.

The majority of environmental agency staffing cuts in Louisiana happened during Bobby Jindal’s terms as governor from 2008-16. The Department of Environmental Quality has not seen significant hiring or funding boosts dating back to Edwin Edwards’ fourth term as governor from 1992-96.

The agency’s boldest policy moves came after Gov. Buddy Roemer took office in 1988. He placed environmental scientist Paul Templet in charge of Environmental Quality, and the administration tied industrial incentives to benchmarks for reducing pollution. Since Roemer lost his reelection bid in 1991, governors who have succeeded him have, to varying degrees, urged cooperation with industry.

The Environmental Integrity Project report points out cuts in Department of Environmental Quality staff and funding come as Louisiana sees a boom in industrial investment. The number of facilities seeking air pollution control permits from the state rose 29% from 2016-24, with 1,906 applications last year according to the report’s analysis of public records.

A spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality responded to the report in a statement, saying the department meets all federal grant requirements and performance expectations while prioritizing “efficiency” and remaining “fully committed” to environmental protection.

The department has implemented an expedited permitting program to make up for its staffing shortages, allowing applicants to pay for agency staff members’ overtime as they work on the approval process.

Rolfes cites issues with this process in the report, saying it creates a conflict of interest.

“When you cut the resources of the agencies, you further depend on the companies themselves as the source of payment for permit writers — and that is an inherent conflict,” Rolfes wrote in the report. “When you have the company paying your overtime, you are just not going to ask the questions and scrutinize it the way you would if your salaries were being paid by the public.”

The analysis also identified Louisiana as having the highest amount of toxic air emissions per square mile of any state in the country. Staffing shortages also play a role in delayed response time to pollution issues, according to the report.

In 2019, the Environmental Integrity Project report counted only 10 LDEQ employees who handled all air enforcement actions at more than 500 major industrial facilities and hundreds more smaller locations. A Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report from 2021 also found the department was understaffed and could do more to address air pollution violations.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/westcentralsbest.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b44a2b66-f4e9-11e4-83a0-3bbd4468f030.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-12-14 04:58:51.755850

Patrick, I had a chance to see and participate in initiatives that had a catalytic effect on the state’s innovation economy.","MASSACHUSETTS HAS EXPERIENCED a full assault on the basic pillars of our innovation economy. Clean energy programs and infrastructure, biomedical research funding, immigration, and core funding and academic freedom at our state’s leading universities have all landed in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s reckless cuts and ideologically extreme policy agenda.

While President Trump wraps this all in America First rhetoric, these moves will severely undermine our country’s ability to compete economically and remain a global leader in cutting-edge research and development. Given the outsized role these areas play here, the threat to Massachusetts is particularly acute.

The Commonwealth needs to act boldly and creatively to respond to the threats to its innovation economy. Fighting to reverse these moves in Washington should be a top priority, but we surely can’t count on that happening. We may not be able, on our own, to mitigate the full impact of these harmful policies, but we can take action at the state level to counter their effects.

Over the summer, Gov. Healey unveiled a proposal to do just that. The Discovery, Research and Innovation for a Vibrant Economy, or DRIVE, Initiative includes a call for $400 million in state appropriations to help make up for some of the lost federal funding.

Committing public dollars to help bolster or jumpstart economic activity is not something that should be done lightly without due diligence and careful consideration. But in weighing the governor’s proposal, legislative leaders don’t have to look back too far for an example of unquestionable success with such a strategy.

It may be hard to remember, but Massachusetts wasn’t always the leading state for the innovation economy. In 2003, despite our state’s deep strengths in finance, health care, and higher education, the major economic story of the day was Boston losing Fortune 500 headquarters.

The Commonwealth had invested heavily in remaking Boston’s downtown and waterfront, but 20 years ago the Seaport was best known for inexpensive parking lots. The state’s economy had crashed in 2001, and it was only slowly regaining the jobs lost during the recession. In 2004, the Boston Foundation bemoaned the fact that greater Boston “lacked the collaborative gene,” which was essential to competing in the global knowledge economy. There was significant pessimism disguised as realism – which all made sense if you were a fan of the Boston Red Sox during the many decades leading to October of that momentous year.

As seen in the sudden reversal that year of our baseball fortunes, however, the world changes – sometimes quicker than you expect. I served in the Patrick administration during both of the governor’s terms, eventually as the state’s first assistant secretary for innovation policy in the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, and witnessed this firsthand.

Working under Secretary Dan O’Connell and the late Secretary Greg Bialecki, both of whom helmed the housing and economic development secretariat under Gov. Patrick, I had a chance to see and participate in initiatives that had a catalytic effect on the state’s innovation economy.

In 2008, Gov. Patrick and the Legislature partnered to launch the state’s 10-year, $1 billion Life Sciences Initiative, which served as a catalyst for regional partnerships and international investment.

The scale of the initiative drew international attention and investment in Massachusetts, while the vast majority of the state funds invested (over 70 percent of funds through FY 2014) were spent on research and development infrastructure and educational programs throughout the state. A 2018 impact study showed that Massachusetts outperformed peer states in life sciences wage and job growth from 2009 through 2016, providing evidence that the initiative did make a meaningful difference in improving the state’s competitiveness.

In 2009, the state provided seed funding for MassChallenge, one of the world’s largest startup accelerators and competitions. Anyone who attended a MassChallenge event can readily attest that it had a dynamic effect – as if a world-class region was meeting itself for the first time. MassChallenge reinforced the state’s international reputation for innovation while also supporting the state’s entrepreneurial ecosystem by inviting winners from regional startup accelerators to join its program.

In 2012, the state’s five largest research universities partnered to open the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center – a major research facility – in Holyoke. It was the first significant collaboration to ever take place among these universities – and there, too, a seed investment by the state was critical to its success. Through the computing center, the partner universities have sponsored collaborative research by faculty across their schools and with external partners, with the goal to make our state more competitive for major federal research funding opportunities.

Unquestionably, the Commonwealth is right to focus on a triad of long-term challenges that threaten our economic health and competitiveness: affordable housing, education and workforce development, and safe and efficient transportation. Progress in those areas creates a more livable state for all of us and unlocks bottlenecks to hiring and growth. But it won’t be enough to forestall the worst impacts of current federal policy.

The actions of the federal government strike at the very heart of our state’s competitive advantage. Massachusetts is a magnet for the world’s talent, from undergraduate students to postdocs to regional headquarters for major multinational corporations. We thrive on collaboration and the sophistication of our experienced researchers, investors, executives, advanced manufacturers, and technicians.

Collaboration is at the heart of our success. And collaboration requires trust, mutually agreed upon goals, resources, and sufficient stability over time to execute on plans. It requires belief, hope, and expectation that hard work will lead to accomplishment, whether that is in six months, a year or five years. The state investments described above succeeded in part because they were sustained commitments that improved capacity and created a reliable state partner that enabled the private sector and universities to make long-term plans and investments of their own.

That’s why it is imperative that our state’s leaders – from government, education, and industry – partner and respond robustly to this threat.

The House and Senate, with whatever modifications they deem appropriate, should move quickly to pass the DRIVE Act, which is designed to stabilize and grow our state’s research and innovation ecosystem. Roughly half of the funds would be devoted to backfilling some of the support for our universities, investing in promising research proposals that went through rigorous scientific review prior to the federal cuts.

The second half of the funds would support new collaborative research and initiatives that can accelerate our innovation economy. For new initiatives, the Commonwealth should require substantial direct and in-kind matches to magnify the impact of state dollars. In addition, the state should be ambitious in choosing initiatives that bring together multiple partners and advance national research priorities that have been defunded or opposed by the Trump administration.

We are, eventually, going to come out of this unsettling era. How we do so is up to us. In a moment in which fear and uncertainty abound, we should set the goal for Massachusetts to emerge as the strongest, most competitive innovation state in the nation in 2029.

Approach 2: Bloom Energy Price vs Sales

For companies like Bloom Energy that are still scaling and not yet consistently profitable, the Price to Sales, or P S, ratio is often a more practical valuation tool than earnings based metrics. It anchors valuation to current revenue, which is less volatile and easier to compare across peers.

In general, higher growth and lower risk can justify a higher P S multiple, while slower growth or greater uncertainty point to a lower, more conservative range. Bloom Energy currently trades at about 12.35x sales, well above both the Electrical industry average of roughly 2.17x and the peer group average of around 3.02x. This signals that investors are already pricing in substantial growth and improvement in profitability.

Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what a P S multiple should be, given Bloom’s growth outlook, margins, industry, market cap and risk profile. On this basis, Bloom’s Fair Ratio is 8.44x, which is meaningfully below the current 12.35x. That gap suggests the stock price is running ahead of what its fundamentals and risks would justify.

The worldwide shift toward sustainable energy has dramatically altered the strategies of institutional investors, with clean energy derivatives now standing out as a vital asset class. In 2025, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) granted CleanTrade approval to operate as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF), marking a significant advancement in the renewable energy sector. This regulatory breakthrough has helped resolve persistent issues such as market fragmentation and limited liquidity, positioning clean energy as a leading destination for institutional funds. This article delves into the operational models of CFTC-sanctioned platforms and examines the influx of institutional capital, highlighting how these developments are transforming liquidity in renewable energy assets.

Regulatory Advances and Market Evolution

When the CFTC approved CleanTrade in September 2025, it brought much-needed regulatory certainty to the market by overturning a 2021 advisory that had previously created confusion among participants. This move allowed CleanTrade to function as a centralized, high-standard venue for trading Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). Within just two months of its debut, CleanTrade saw $16 billion in notional trades, reflecting strong institutional trust in energy markets aligned with ESG principles.

The CFTC’s flexible approach extended beyond CleanTrade. In 2025, the agency withdrew its proposed Operational Resilience Framework for SEFs, citing overlap with existing rules and the need to harmonize with global standards. This change is part of a broader effort to reduce compliance complexity while upholding market integrity. For example, the CFTC granted exemptions to SEFs such as LSEG FX SEF, allowing them to forgo mandatory central limit order books—an acknowledgment of the practicalities of swaps trading. These regulatory adjustments have fostered a more dynamic environment, encouraging further innovation in clean energy derivatives.

Institutional Capital and Market Liquidity

Institutional participation in clean energy derivatives has grown rapidly. Bloomberg projects that ESG investments will soar from $39.08 trillion in 2025 to $125.17 trillion by 2032. In 2025, investments in clean energy surpassed those in fossil fuels by $1.1 trillion, with major players like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs increasingly focusing on renewables within their portfolios. CleanTrade’s integration of real-time analytics, carbon tracking, and advanced risk management tools has enabled investors to better align with ESG goals and manage counterparty risks.

Recent data further illustrates this momentum. In the third quarter of 2025, U.S. investment in clean energy and transportation reached a record $75 billion, with $25 billion directed toward clean energy production and industrial decarbonization—a 15% increase over the previous year, fueled by demand for electric vehicles and renewable infrastructure. However, the second quarter of 2025 showed mixed results: while utility-scale clean electricity and industrial decarbonization technologies grew by 13% compared to the previous quarter, investment in manufacturing for greenhouse gas reduction technologies fell by 15%. These fluctuations underscore the value of liquid, transparent markets like CleanTrade, which help stabilize institutional portfolios through reliable pricing and scalable risk management.

Broadening the Clean Energy Trading Ecosystem

CleanTrade is just one of several platforms shaping the future of clean energy derivatives. Between 2025 and 2026, the CFTC authorized additional venues, including Electron Exchange DCM, Railbird Exchange, and Quanta Exchange, reflecting a diversification of the market. Nodal Exchange, a prominent player in power and environmental markets, has expanded its offerings by launching new REC contracts and a web-based trading platform to improve accessibility. Together, these platforms cater to a wide range of regional and sector-specific needs, from small-scale solar initiatives to large-scale energy storage, making clean energy assets more attractive to institutional investors worldwide.

Ongoing Challenges and the Road Ahead

Despite significant progress, obstacles remain. The Q2 2025 Clean Investment Monitor reported a 36% drop in U.S. renewable energy investment compared to the latter half of 2024, while investment in the EU-27 surged by 63%. These regional imbalances highlight the necessity for harmonized regulations and cross-border liquidity solutions. Additionally, the cancellation of $7 billion in energy projects in Q2 2025 underscores the volatility inherent in capital-intensive industries.

Looking forward, the CFTC’s commitment to modernizing its regulatory approach—such as its spot crypto trading initiative—signals an ongoing focus on fostering innovation. Platforms like CleanTrade and Nodal Exchange are expected to play a pivotal role in connecting traditional energy markets with the demands of the green transition. As institutional investors increasingly prioritize decarbonization, the transparency and liquidity offered by CFTC-approved SEFs will be essential for scaling up renewable energy infrastructure.

Summary

The rise of CFTC-approved clean energy trading platforms marks a fundamental transformation in institutional investment. By overcoming market fragmentation, boosting liquidity, and supporting ESG objectives, these platforms are not only revolutionizing renewable asset markets but also redefining the influence of institutional capital in the global energy transition. As regulations adapt and new platforms emerge, clean energy derivatives are set to become a cornerstone of global investment strategies in the coming decade.",https://img.bgstatic.com/video/open_graph_new.png,N,,2025-12-14 03:58:24.203789

The DEC said it's 'transparent and thorough reviews' of Micron’s applications include public review and comment to ensure protection of public health and the environment.

CNY Central spoke with several neighbors during that public review and comment period, who had mixed opinions of the process, specifically the amount of time given to review hundreds of environment review pages.

“The permits finalized today provide important requirements for the protection of freshwater wetlands, water quality, and endangered and threatened species by minimizing impacts to natural areas, enhancing research, and ensuring conservation through monitoring while also preserving responsible economic development for Central New York,” Commissioner Amanda Lefton said. “I thank the DEC teams who worked across multiple offices and regulatory jurisdictions for their valuable insight and appreciate those who continue to engage with DEC in the permitting process.”

The permits issued include freshwater wetlands, endangered and threatened species, and six mitigation projects to create, restore, and enhance wetlands, in addition to a Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certificate, according to the DEC.

In addition, a draft Air Title V permit is currently available for public comment until Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025.

The DEC said it held two virtual public comment hearings on the proposed air permit application earlier this week.

Additional comment periods are open on connected actions that would extend water and gas service to the Micron main campus.

According to BBS’s 2024 Design Standards Manual, 95% of post-abatement waste will be sent to construction recycling centers.

VOCs are emitted as gases from solid or liquid materials and are present in many common building materials.","Fresh paint, shiny new plumbing and parts of a 50-year-old building will complete the brand new University Student Union set to open in 2028.

The Future U project, which began construction this summer, is a three-year renovation meant to reuse a majority of the original foundation built in 1972.

According to Melissa Soto, manager of Capital Program Development at Beach Building Services, approximately 90% of the USU’s original foundation will remain.

One of the few areas slated for demolition and replacement is the University Dining Plaza. Additionally, the 1972 plumbing and electrical systems will be replaced.

“It’s a really great opportunity to upgrade everything just to make the building function well and to reorganize,” says Soto.

A study from the Environmental Protection Agency found that around 600 million tons of construction and demolition debris were generated nationwide in 2018.

To avoid adverse environmental impacts, the Future U project seeks to reduce waste and source sustainably. According to Soto, furniture and building materials will be sourced within the U.S.

“Most new student unions are built new from the ground up, which means they require entirely new materials,” said Lisa Salgado, the Capital Projects Program manager at Beach Building Services, in an email exchange with the Current.

By using the majority of the 1972 foundation, BBS seeks to maintain the vision of the original building’s architect, Edward Killingsworth.

The student union is eligible but not yet registered for the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources, which work to preserve the cultural and artistic integrity of historic buildings and artifacts.

By preserving key historic elements of the original USU, such as the terracotta flooring and vintage tiles, the student union will remain eligible. Because of this, maintaining the USU’s mid-century modern style is important for the university.

According to Salgado, material reuse will reduce the carbon footprint of Future U and expedite construction.

Currently, the building is undergoing abatement, a process in which hazmat crews will conduct a complete sweep for hazardous materials, including asbestos, lead and more.

According to BBS’s 2024 Design Standards Manual, 95% of post-abatement waste will be sent to construction recycling centers. The 5% of ineligible materials will be sent to landfills.

Some materials are sent to special disposal sites where they have to be treated further, Soto said.

California State law required the CSU system to divert 75% of all solid waste from landfill disposal by 2020 through source reduction, reuse, recycling and composting programs.

The Future U project is maintaining these rates. 75% of the waste produced by the Future U project will be recycled or salvaged, according to Salgado.

“There’s construction waste recycling centers…that we take the material to where it gets recycled just as you would recycle your cans,” Soto said.

BBS is confident in the original structure’s strength – despite it being over 50 years old – and is implementing construction techniques to reinforce it.

“We do type one construction, where the interior is concrete,” Soto said. “We’re trying to build these really strong, long-lasting things.”

Type one construction uses non-combustable materials such as reinforced concrete and protected steel.

According to the National Fire Protection Association, Type I construction offers the highest level of fire protection and projects are considered noncombustible.

The original USU foundation is also being reinforced to meet modern-day seismic standards. An evaluation of the building was conducted to assess its ability to withstand earthquakes.

“There’s certain areas in the building that we do need to strengthen seismically, but it’s really not a lot, which is really exciting,” Soto said.

That gives BBS less work and allows them more time to make good on their promise of a 2028 opening.

In addition to the strong infrastructure, Future U will also introduce over 80 low-volatile organic compound materials into the new design.

VOCs are human-made chemicals that may pose short and long-term health risks. VOCs are emitted as gases from solid or liquid materials and are present in many common building materials.

“Low-VOC materials will keep the air healthy so all visitors can focus, socialize, and thrive,” Salgado said in an email exchange with the Current.

Many of the low-VOC materials listed in the Future U “Low-VOC Material Tracker” spreadsheet include paints, carpets and wall panels.

While the Future U project is still three years from completion, the renovation is necessary and will be worth it in the long run, Soto said.

“It’s lasted fairly well for 50 years,” she said. “Our goal is that we don’t have to touch [it] again for another 50 years.”",https://lbcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mural.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 22:58:06.736151

US District Judge Patti Saris agreed, writing in her order that the “Wind Order” was illegal because it was an “arbitrary and capricious” exercise of federal power, not to mention weird and creepy.
There wasn’t even a concept of a plan for regulatory review, because the point was simply to prevent new wind energy from coming online at all.
As for Monday’s decision overturning the Wind Order, the White House’s first response was, as always, to whine.
Now that Judge Saris has deflated Trump’s Wind Order, states and companies will still need to sue to move wind projects forward, causing costly delays and probably killing some projects altogether, so progress will remain slow.","In a blow to Donald Trump’s irrational war against wind energy, a federal judge in Massachusetts on Monday overturned Trump’s Day One executive order that had frozen all leases and permits for offshore wind energy projects. Seventeen states, led by New York but reaching across the country to Oregon and California, had joined the lawsuit, arguing that they and their residents were being harmed by the refusal to add clean, cheaper energy to the grid. US District Judge Patti Saris agreed, writing in her order that the “Wind Order” was illegal because it was an “arbitrary and capricious” exercise of federal power, not to mention weird and creepy.

Trump’s order placed an indefinite pause on all offshore wind energy development so that federal agencies could “review” the permitting process, supposedly to remove any of those mean unfair advantages that Joe Biden used to oppress wind’s poor, downtrodden competitors in the fossil fuel industry. As testimony in the case showed, however, hardly any such “review” had even begun, even 10 months after the order. There wasn’t even a concept of a plan for regulatory review, because the point was simply to prevent new wind energy from coming online at all.

In fact, lawyers for the administration agencies involved couldn’t demonstrate any real rationale for the stonewalling on permits beyond pointing to Trump’s executive order and the Department of the Interior’s memo putting the pause into place. Judge Saris wrote that the thin justifications given in those documents alone were insufficient to effectively shut down an entire industry. “Whatever level of explanation is required when deviating from longstanding agency practice, this is not it.”

OK, you were waiting for the “However,” weren’t you? Here we go: However, the order on its own doesn’t automatically approve any pending wind projects, and as Ars Technica explains, Judge Saris’s order can’t force the relevant agencies to stop simply slow-walking every project that’s in the pipeline, as well as new leases or permits. But it does at least mean that states and offshore wind developers can go ahead and sue the government for gumming up the process simply because Trump hates wind turbines and wants to protect dirty energy.

In fact, one such lawsuit, brought by the Danish wind energy company Ørsted, has already successfully lifted the administration’s stop-work order on a giant wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. When it’s completed next year, the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project, initially approved in 2023, will bring carbon-free electricity to more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. But in August, the administration ordered a halt to construction, even though Revolution Wind was more than 80 percent complete, claiming that the plant was somehow a “national security” threat.

The stop-work order didn’t get into specifics, probably because it would have been laughed out of court, because when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum tried to explain it on CNN, he came up with some weird speculation about how, ummm, let’s see, what if the wind turbines kept radar from detecting a big attack by, umm, “undersea drones” launched inside US territorial waters? That makes no goddamn sense at all because radar doesn’t work underwater and the Pentagon has already studied the possibility of wind turbines affecting radar, concluding that any minor interference can be “offset with planning and technological upgrades.” You fucking idiots.

As it was, DC Circuit Judge Royce Lamberth in September granted Ørsted’s request to lift the stop-work order while its suit against the government goes forward, and work has resumed on Revolution Wind. In fact, in November, the administration missed its chance to appeal Lamberth’s order, although it remains just as insanely devoted to favoring oil and gas over renewable energy.

As for Monday’s decision overturning the Wind Order, the White House’s first response was, as always, to whine. White House Spokesperson Taylor Rogers groused that darn it, that nasty old Joe Biden had given wind preferential treatment while being unspeakably cruel to fossil fuels, which is a difficult lie to reconcile with the fact that US oil production reached historically high levels during the Biden administration.

Still, Rogers, like every other Trumper, offered the same line every other administration hack does on any energy story, proclaiming that “President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security.” Why no, Rogers didn’t say anything specific about the ruling or whether the administration will try to pursue the case in the Supreme Court.

That’s virtually the same as the non-answer that fellow spokesbot Anna Kelly offered last month when asked if the administration would appeal to try to stop Revolution Wind: “In just a few months, President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and restored American energy dominance,” blah blah blah, with no mention of the wind farm or the judge’s decision.

Now that Judge Saris has deflated Trump’s Wind Order, states and companies will still need to sue to move wind projects forward, causing costly delays and probably killing some projects altogether, so progress will remain slow. US offshore wind may remain stymied until Trump is out of office, putting us farther and farther behind the rest of the world, which is all in on renewables. All the more reason to keep up the pressure to retake Congress and fight Trump’s climate stupidity at every step. For now, at least, states that want cleaner, more affordable energy for the long term have one less roadblock in their way.

That will include electric vehicles, many of which were leased during the tax credit era.

Coupled with depreciation, this means that a giant supply of low-mileage EVs are hitting dealer lots, many with excellent range and outstanding features.

Some people say that given recent trends, the auto industry bet wrong on electric vehicles. I see things differently. I think it bet wrong on high prices.

New car prices skyrocketed to around $50,000 this year, and EV models went even higher, especially after the $7,500 federal tax credit vanished. You can blame a number of trends for this. Inflation is certainly one of them. But in general, automakers looked at the car-buying trends of the 2010s—when Americans kept going bigger and better and nicer—and anticipated they too could keep going up and up forever.

Today, with interest rates still high and amid persistent inflation, people feel differently about new car purchases. More than ever, they're after a good deal. And in 2026, the used EV market seems poised to give it to them.

New data from the car-buying website Edmunds indicates that next year will see a surge in off-lease vehicles returning to the market. ""The sharp drop in leasing activity in 2022 left 2025 with unusually thin inventories of lower-mileage, near-new vehicles, limiting affordable choices for many shoppers,"" Edmunds analysts said. ""As leasing began to recover in 2023, the resulting 2026 lease returns will start to help fill a gap that was especially visible in 2025.""

If you want numbers around that, Edmunds estimates that around 400,000 more lease returns will return to the market in 2026. ""A healthier flow of off-lease returns will give consumers more flexibility—especially those priced out of the new-vehicle market or looking to avoid today's higher monthly payments,"" analysts said.

They don't say this explicitly, but I'll take things a step further: it's about to be a great year to get an awesome, affordable used EV.

As Edmunds notes in that data, about 71% of EVs sold in recent years were leased. This stemmed from a quirk in the EV tax credit rules: to qualify for the full $7,500, a car had to be built in North America—but if it was leased, any EV qualified for the credit regardless of where it was made. And carmakers started offering obscenely cheap lease deals just to entice people to go electric. Thus, nearly everyone who got a new EV in recent years leased it (including yours truly).

But since most lease deals are two or three years long, many of those EVs are due back next year (also including yours truly's car). And EV depreciation has been unfortunately steep—about 13% or more than gas cars, in part because there's no standard to evaluate battery health. These initial owners' losses, however, could soon be your gain. Many well-equipped used EVs now retail for $30,000 or less, often with excellent range, tons of features and more power than a comparable gas car.

Take the Ford Mustang Mach-E, still a staff favorite after all these years. According to CarGurus data, they now sell for an average of $28,970—which made me spit out my drink when I read it. If you buy a lease turn-in, like a 2023 Mach-E Premium with 290 to 306 miles of range, with loads of tech and probably less than 30,000 miles on the odometer. Find me a gas car deal that good. I'll wait. Or you give in to your evil side and get the Mach-E GT, with 480 horsepower. Those can also be had for much cheaper than they went for originally.

Or the Kia EV6, which I have. My car was over $50,000 when I got it (thanks, cheap lease deals). Today, CarGurus says their average used retail prices are around $27,427, as of this writing. Again, that gets you into a comfortable, family-friendly crossover with excellent performance, around 300 miles of range, Tesla Supercharger access (via an adapter) and the best charging speeds in its class for less than $30 grand.

And the Tesla Model Y is still hard to beat, especially if you buy one used. Right now, CarGurus says they retail for around $29,429 on the pre-owned market, and that gets you a lot of car for not a ton of money.

But if you're new to EV-buying, you may be thinking: what about the battery? The good news is that study after study shows us that modern EV batteries hold up remarkably well. With a lease turn-in around 30,000 miles or so, it's unlikely you will see any real battery degradation—and thus, loss of range—for a long time. On older Teslas, we've seen plenty of examples getting past 200,000 and even 300,000 miles with 80% battery capacity or more. It's simply not an issue like people think it is.

The EV tax credit once included a discount of up to $4,000 for used models, but that's unfortunately no longer the case. But depreciation is still opening the door to a great deal. So if you've been putting off car-shopping until 2026, your patience may soon be rewarded if you go electric—and then you probably won't go back to gas.

This position helped my administration seize every possible opportunity to expand Virginia’s energy mix, lower costs for hardworking families and grow our economy.
I also strengthened Virginia’s natural gas supplies and energy efficiency standards by advancing legislation to expand development of natural gas infrastructure and signing the Conservation and Ratemaking Efficiency (CARE) Act into law.
These energy policies — spanning all manner of energy sources, from natural gas to solar and wind energy — helped lower utility bills and create more jobs in the commonwealth.
That’s the best path forward to reduce energy bills, lower the cost of living and help us successfully move toward a prosperous clean energy future.","Following their major statewide wins and historic legislative victory in November, Virginia Democrats will deliver on several policy priorities in the 2026 legislative session — with affordability as issue one.

Throughout the campaign, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and the entire Democratic ticket championed lowering costs for Virginians, especially when it comes to the commonwealth’s surging electricity demand and utility costs. Virginia currently ranks 29th in the country for electricity affordability and we import more power than any other state in the nation. At the same time, our power demands are enormous. The commonwealth boasts the world’s largest data center market with 340 facilities and, if projections hold, data center construction could triple our state’s electricity demand by 2050.

If we want to continue growing our economy, create good-paying jobs and embrace technological innovations that position us as a global leader in science and technology, it can’t come at the cost of affordability and higher electricity bills.

During my time as governor, Virginia’s economy boomed. I was proud to add more than 200,000 new jobs, significantly reduce the unemployment rate, and help implement economic policies that led to personal income increasing by nearly 13%. My administration achieved these milestones because we embraced all types of energy solutions to power our economic growth. My Virginia Energy Plan acknowledged the rapidly changing energy landscape and laid out a strategy to drive innovation in energy generation by deploying diverse fuel sources, including nuclear power and natural gas, while dramatically expanding solar and offshore wind capacity and calling for state-led efficiency programs.

To help reduce overall energy consumption, I established an executive committee on energy efficiency and appointed a chief energy efficiency officer — the first state-level position of its kind in the country — to manage the planning, implementation and evaluation of energy efficiency throughout the state. This position helped my administration seize every possible opportunity to expand Virginia’s energy mix, lower costs for hardworking families and grow our economy.

I also strengthened Virginia’s natural gas supplies and energy efficiency standards by advancing legislation to expand development of natural gas infrastructure and signing the Conservation and Ratemaking Efficiency (CARE) Act into law. The CARE Act encouraged utilities to build pipelines and other infrastructure that would bring shale and coalbed methane gas to the market while keeping prices affordable for consumers. It helped reform the financial and regulatory mechanisms for natural gas utilities, delivering stronger efficiency options for Virginia consumers. These energy policies — spanning all manner of energy sources, from natural gas to solar and wind energy — helped lower utility bills and create more jobs in the commonwealth.

As our energy demand skyrockets, we must build on these efforts and there’s growing demand among Virginians for decisive action. Recent polling found that 62% of Virginia voters agree on building more natural gas plants and a majority of voters throughout the commonwealth said the price of electricity was an important factor in their vote this year, supporting a balanced approach to lower utility bills by expanding our state’s natural gas and renewable energy capacities.

New energy construction remains subject to planning, siting, permitting and building delays. But we can’t let that slow us down. Improvements to state regulatory processes that ensure safety and respect for our environment can help us move forward expeditiously to meet this critical moment and lower costs quickly.

Virginia’s unemployment rate has risen for the last eight months, and our third-quarter GDP dropped from 6.2% in 2024 to 1.7% in 2025. To keep growing Virginia’s economy, provide sufficient power to homes and businesses, and lower electricity costs, the commonwealth must diversify its energy sources — as we did when I was governor — and unlock the potential of affordable natural gas as more renewable energy sources come online. That’s the best path forward to reduce energy bills, lower the cost of living and help us successfully move toward a prosperous clean energy future.",https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/01/09/4473TWU2SGIYJLRPBES5IJXQXU.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-12-13 19:58:59.467382
,Clean Energy ,2025-12-13 22:57:25+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Data centers for AI could nearly triple San José's energy use. Who foots the bill?,Alejandro Lazo,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-13/data-centers-for-ai-could-nearly-triple-san-joses-energy-use-who-foots-bill,"The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need.
According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity.
No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.
Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy?
PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers.","The county seat of Santa Clara is touting its partnership with Pacific Gas & Electric, claiming the city is “the West Coast’s premier destination for data center development.” The investor-owned utility now estimates it has enough capacity in its planning pipeline to push the city’s electricity use to almost three times its current peak.

Those plans are forcing major grid upgrades, PG&E and city officials say, while raising questions about who pays for them and whether the state can keep the power clean.

Panelists at a CalMatters event in downtown San José clashed over key issues. They included a local official working with PG&E on the city’s data-center build-out, a tech advocate urging California to seize the economic moment, a Stanford energy expert pressing for a more modernized grid and a utility watchdog skeptical of AI’s promised benefits.

Their discussion centered on how quickly California should move to accommodate new demand, what information the public should be entitled to and how to keep customers from shouldering the cost of infrastructure that may never be fully used.

Proposals to more strictly regulate data center development died in the Legislature this year. Going forward, several state agencies and commissions are expected to take up further discussions, including the California Energy Commission, the Little Hoover Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission.

How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?

The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need. Companies can propose large facilities without committing to build them, the computing demands behind AI are changing quickly and cooling needs vary across the state. These factors make long-term energy needs hard to pin down.

According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity. That’s enough to power roughly 18 million homes, compared with California’s estimated 14 to 15 million. Regulators don’t expect all of those projects to be built, and assume the ones that do will come online gradually and operate at less than their requested capacity, producing a forecast of between 4 and 6 gigawatts by 2040.

Liang Min, who directs Stanford’s Bits & Watts Initiative, and a speaker on CalMatters’ panel, said that forecasting is particularly tough because companies are rolling out new AI apps — or “application layers,” as he put it — at breakneck speed. They include products like ChatGPT that use large language models. No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.

“Right now we’re really struggling,” Min said. “The risk is extremely high in the application layers.”

The Public Advocates Office, an independent consumer watchdog within the California Public Utilities Commission, recently warned that rapid data-center growth could leave Californians paying for billions of dollars in grid upgrades if projects never materialize or use far less power than promised.

“Ratepayers could end up paying for costly infrastructure upgrades that may not be needed for many years — or at all,” the office said in its commentary.

Min said forecasting data-center load is a national challenge, but California will need better tools to keep rates in check, meet its clean-energy targets and stay competitive with states racing to attract data centers and high-paying tech jobs.

Local officials have also begun to grapple with the uncertainty. In San José, city energy officials say they are reluctant to procure additional power until they know which projects will actually be built. “We do not want to buy more power than we need,” said panelist Lori Mitchell, director of San José Clean Energy, the city’s publicly-owned electricity provider. “That’s job No. 1.”

What are the environmental concerns around the data-center boom?

California’s data-center boom is bringing a wave of environmental concerns that state officials are only beginning to understand. Those concerns center on water use, the carbon emissions tied to rising energy demand and the air pollution from diesel backup generators.

Air quality is a particular concern. While back-up generators run only intermittently, their presence is concentrated in a handful of regions. In Santa Clara County, where many facilities sit close together in dense industrial areas, the local impacts could be greater simply because so much equipment is packed into a small space.

Yet the state still has limited visibility into what data centers are doing. Attempts to require more transparency stalled this year amid tech industry opposition. The only measure that became law gives regulators the authority to determine whether data centers are driving up costs — but stops short of requiring environmental reporting.

Ahmad Thomas, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and another panelist, said his group opposed the electricity disclosure and water reporting measures because they would make California less competitive.

“It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states,” he added.

Consumer advocates say the lack of information leaves communities unprotected. “We certainly think there needs to be more transparency — that’s a good thing,” said panelist Mark Toney, the executive director of the the Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group.

Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy?

The rapid growth of data centers could slow California’s clean-energy transition if it keeps the state tied to natural gas. And some of the carbon-free alternative energy sources that could meet their power needs are deeply controversial among environmentalists.

The state has pledged to reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, yet it still depends heavily on natural-gas plants during hot summer days. A recent report by the environmental think tank Next 10 and UC Riverside estimated that data-center carbon emissions nearly doubled from 2019 to 2023 — largely from gas-fired generation — underscoring how even a relatively clean grid may struggle to absorb AI-driven load without higher emissions.

State leaders are making policy shifts as AI demand grows. California this year approved joining a broader Western power market, a move driven in part by new demands on the grid, including data centers. Critics warn the change could expose the state to dirtier electricity from other states and weaken its control over clean-energy rules.

Min of Stanford argues that California will need to rely on options some environmentalists would rather avoid. That includes holding onto existing resources like the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. In a recent report, Min argued the state will also need more “clean, firm” power — resources that can operate around the clock — such as geothermal energy or natural-gas plants with carbon capture.

PG&E agrees. Spokesperson Stephanie Magallon told CalMatters in an email that nuclear power, carbon-capture systems and large solar-plus-battery projects are all options under consideration for powering data centers in its region. But environmental justice critics in California have opposed carbon capture technology, calling it unproven tech that risks extending fossil-fuel use.

Mitchell said community choice aggregators can manage new data-center load while keeping power clean and affordable. San José’s mix is already 60% renewable, and she said the biggest opportunity is flexibility — getting data centers to shift use off the hottest afternoons so the city can avoid buying additional power.

Will data centers raise your electric bill?

California’s data-center boom is reshaping the fight over electricity bills, exposing a divide over whether these new customers will lower costs — or drive them higher for everyone else.

PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers. It also claims the grid is underutilized on average — operating at about 45% of capacity — although the grid faces real strain during the hottest hours and in parts of the system that routinely run close to their limits. If data centers can be connected in places with available capacity, PG&E argues, they could help spread costs without worsening congestion.

Toney, another panelist, urged the state to slow down, warning that California is planning major infrastructure without knowing which data centers are real or how their costs will land on customer bills.

“I’m worried that we’re engaged in what I call faith-based policymaking,” he said. “The benefits are very speculative, but the costs are very real.”

Some states, said Toney, have begun tightening rules around the growth of data centers. One law in Oregon will require data-center grid costs to remain off household bills. A Minnesota law will give very large data centers their own billing category so regulators can keep their costs separate from other customers’ electric bills.

“This issue of data centers and the connection between affordability and clean energy is of national concern, and California is actually behind on this,” Toney said. “There’s this mythology about California being the leader all the time.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/174ebc7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/840x441+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe4%2Fc8%2Fa658cdb947ccb55cb401c2dafacb%2Fdata-center-system.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 18:59:47.978719

European automotive supplier FORVIA and Swiss clean-hydrogen specialist H2 Energy have expanded their collaboration to accelerate the industrialisation of hydrogen supply infrastructure by jointly scaling production of Multiple Element Gas Containers (MEGCs) — large modular units used to transport compressed hydrogen safely and efficiently. The strengthened partnership means that FORVIA, which has been supplying certified 38 MPa hydrogen composite tanks, will now take on end-to-end manufacturing responsibility for complete MEGC units, supporting broader hydrogen mobility and logistics deployment across Europe.

MEGCs are key components in the hydrogen supply chain, acting as robust containerised solutions that allow hydrogen to be moved from production sites to filling stations or industrial users. The renewed agreement builds on FORVIA’s expertise in high-pressure hydrogen storage systems and H2 Energy’s operational experience running a functional hydrogen ecosystem via its Hydrospider subsidiary in Switzerland, where more than 30 MEGCs are already used daily to supply green hydrogen to 18 hydrogen refueling stations and heavy-duty vehicle fleets. Production of the full MEGC units is scheduled to begin by the end of 2025, marking a major milestone in scaling last-mile hydrogen logistics ahead of broader commercial rollouts for mobility applications.

Under the expanded partnership, FORVIA will combine its manufacturing capabilities with H2 Energy’s practical hydrogen infrastructure know-how to improve safety, quality and cost efficiency in hydrogen transport solutions. MEGCs integrate FORVIA’s composite cylinders, which already meet stringent European ADR certification standards for road transport of hydrogen, ensuring compliance with top safety and regulatory benchmarks. This means the containers can be used with confidence in pressurised hydrogen environments, facilitating the broader adoption of hydrogen fuel for industrial and mobility use cases.

The collaboration also addresses one of the key challenges facing hydrogen mobility: bridging the gap between production and consumption through reliable logistics solutions. While hydrogen refueling infrastructure continues to grow across Europe, cost-effective and scalable transport systems remain essential for ensuring consistent fuel availability, particularly for heavy-duty transport and commercial fleets. FORVIA and H2 Energy’s combined efforts aim to strengthen this supply backbone by deploying MEGC fleets that can deliver compressed hydrogen where pipelines or local production are not feasible.

In statements about the partnership, leaders from both companies highlighted its significance for the hydrogen economy. FORVIA’s Hydrogen Solutions leadership emphasised the company’s commitment to advancing safe, high-quality hydrogen transport technologies as part of a broader shift toward sustainable mobility. Meanwhile, H2 Energy’s founder stressed that integrating FORVIA’s manufacturing expertise enhances logistical efficiency and accelerates the deployment of affordable hydrogen supply infrastructure — a critical enabler of clean energy adoption across transport and industry.

Hydrogen mobility is positioned as a major pillar of Europe’s decarbonisation strategy, especially for sectors where battery electrification is less practical, such as long-haul trucking and heavy-duty vehicles. Containerised hydrogen solutions like MEGCs play a pivotal role by enabling flexible delivery models and supporting hydrogen refueling infrastructure in regions where direct pipeline access is limited or non-existent. By scaling production and streamlining assembly processes, FORVIA and H2 Energy are taking a tangible step toward overcoming logistical barriers and helping to make hydrogen a more accessible and competitive energy carrier.

The partnership also reflects a broader trend among automotive suppliers to diversify beyond traditional vehicle components and contribute to the energy transition through clean mobility infrastructure. FORVIA’s investment in hydrogen transport systems aligns with its strategy to expand its portfolio in electrification and energy management, while H2 Energy continues to grow its integrated hydrogen value chain — from production and storage to distribution and use.

Looking forward, the companies expect that rolling out standardised, certified MEGC units at scale can help meet rising demand for hydrogen logistics solutions in both commercial transport and industrial sectors. As regulators, fleets and infrastructure developers increasingly adopt hydrogen solutions, partnerships like this one could accelerate the transition to lower-carbon mobility while supporting Europe’s climate goals.",https://telematicswire.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cropped-twfev-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-13 19:59:04.077718

A collision between AI data centers being built—in the current AI bubble and with full throated support by the Trump Administration—and aluminum smelters for electricity is no longer theoretical. Utilities across the United States are facing binding constraints on generation and transmission. When presented with competing requests for hundreds of MW of firm power, they are choosing the customer that can pay more, scale faster, and accept shorter contracts. That customer is almost always a data center. Aluminum smelting, which depends on cheap electricity locked in for decades, loses in that comparison even before policy enters the picture.

Primary aluminum smelting is uniquely exposed to electricity pricing because electricity is not an input at the margin. It is the input. A modern smelter consumes power on the scale of a city and must operate continuously. Interruptions damage equipment and shutdowns destroy economics. To remain viable, smelters typically need long term power contracts at roughly $40 per MWh. AI data centers, by contrast, can tolerate higher prices, shift loads geographically, and monetize power into high margin digital services. That asymmetry is structural and it defines everything that follows.

The decline of US aluminum smelting did not begin with AI, renewables, or EVs. It has been unfolding for decades. In the mid twentieth century the United States was the world’s dominant aluminum producer, anchored by hydroelectric power and protected domestic markets. As globalization accelerated, smelting shifted toward regions with abundant low cost electricity and stable policy frameworks. Canada, Norway, Iceland, and the Gulf states built modern capacity while US plants aged. Rising power costs, environmental compliance requirements, and underinvestment eroded competitiveness long before today’s debates.

By the early 2020s, only four primary smelters remained operational in the United States. The remaining active smelters are in Indiana, northern New York, western Kentucky, and South Carolina, typically co located with legacy power infrastructure and long standing utility agreements that allow them to operate at all. Domestic primary production fell to roughly 700,000 tons per year while total US aluminum demand hovered around 5 million tons. Recycling expanded to fill the gap and now supplies roughly 72% of US aluminum consumption (like steel, the United States is a global leader in primary metal recycling, which is a strong positive). Net imports supply the remaining 14%, mostly from Canada. The system adapted to smelter decline through recycling and imports rather than revival of primary capacity.

In 2025, the administration sharply escalated tariffs on imported aluminum, citing national security, supply chain resilience, and domestic job protection. Section 232 tariffs rose to 25% and then to 50% for most sources. The stated intent was straightforward. Higher prices would support domestic producers and encourage investment in new capacity. Tariffs would level the playing field and bring smelting back.

In practice, tariffs were applied to a system that was already import dependent and constrained by electricity availability. Before the 2025 escalation, the US Midwest duty paid premium typically sat in the $450 to $550 per ton range, reflecting the delivered physical cost of aluminum in the United States above the global benchmark price. Within months of the tariff increases, that premium rose to roughly $1,300 to $1,900 per ton, a two and a half to four times increase over the prior baseline. Over the same period, the base LME aluminum price increased by roughly $200 to $300 per ton, on the order of 8% to 12%. The result was a sharp divergence between global aluminum prices and the delivered prices paid by US buyers, driven primarily by policy rather than underlying metal scarcity.

This price increase did improve cash margins for surviving smelters that already had tolerable power contracts. It did not address the binding constraints that prevented restarts or new builds. Electricity remained too expensive and too uncertain. Capital costs remained high. Policy risk increased rather than declined. Tariffs raised the price signal without changing the underlying feasibility of investment.

The first industries to feel the impact were those that buy large volumes of aluminum and operate on tight margins. Automotive manufacturing sits at the center of that group. Modern vehicles contain increasing amounts of aluminum to reduce weight and meet efficiency targets. EVs contain more aluminum than internal combustion vehicles because battery packs, structures, and thermal systems demand it. When delivered aluminum prices rise by $800 to $1,500 per ton, the added cost per vehicle ranges from $150 to $400 depending on design.

Automakers cannot fully absorb those increases. They respond by delaying model launches, reducing incentives, substituting steel where feasible, and passing costs to consumers. For EVs, where price parity remains fragile, aluminum inflation slows adoption and undermines competitiveness. Tariffs that were meant to support domestic manufacturing end up raising input costs for one of the country’s largest manufacturing sectors.

Grid infrastructure and electrification face similar pressure. Aluminum is embedded in transmission lines, substations, transformers, and renewable energy structures. Materials often account for 20% to 30% of transmission project costs. When aluminum and related metals become more expensive, utilities must either raise rate cases, delay projects, or scale them back. Regulatory approval takes time and cost recovery is partial. The result is slower grid expansion and higher electricity bills over time.

Renewable energy projects absorb these costs as well. Solar frames, wind components, and balance of system equipment all rely on aluminum. While aluminum is not the dominant cost driver for renewables, it is a meaningful one. Rising materials costs compound existing supply chain and permitting challenges. Deployment slows at the margin, especially where power purchase agreements were bid at tight prices.

Packaging and consumer goods also feel the impact, though the per unit effect is smaller. Beverage cans, appliances, and household products incorporate large volumes of aluminum. Higher costs are passed through gradually to consumers. Each item increases by cents rather than dollars, but the effect is broad and persistent.

Substitution provides only partial relief. Steel can replace aluminum in some automotive and construction applications, but weight penalties, corrosion risks, and performance limits constrain that option. Composites and plastics have already displaced aluminum in many uses and face sustainability and recycling challenges of their own. In critical applications such as power transmission, aerospace, and heat exchange, aluminum has no practical substitute. Higher prices do not eliminate demand. They shift costs through the system.

Proponents of tariffs argue that these costs are a temporary price worth paying to rebuild domestic capacity. In theory, higher prices could support restarts of idled smelters and justify new investment. In reality, restart potential is limited, capital intensive, and still dependent on cheap long term power. Many idled plants are obsolete or partially dismantled. New smelters cost several billion dollars and require decades of confidence in power pricing and trade policy.

Capital markets are pricing materially higher risk in 2025, and that increase is directly linked to policy choices made by the Trump Administration. The escalation of trade tariffs, including the sharp increase in aluminum duties, has increased uncertainty around long term market access and price stability, which raises required returns for capital intensive industrial projects. Repeated use of executive authority to change trade rules has shortened investor time horizons and widened credit spreads for sectors exposed to policy reversal risk.

There is also a critical labor distinction that is often glossed over in discussions of smelter viability. The direct workforce inside operating aluminum smelters is heavily unionized, relatively stable, and largely composed of US citizens or permanent residents with long tenure and specialized operational experience. That workforce can keep an existing smelter running once it is operating.

Smelter restarts, major maintenance, retrofits, and new construction, however, rely far more on external and often non unionized labor pools. These include industrial construction crews, refractory specialists, electricians, welders, civil works contractors, and control system installers. In practice, parts of this supporting workforce have historically included undocumented immigrants or workers in mixed status households, particularly in construction, site preparation, and ancillary services. The Trump Administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement posture and expanded deportation actions have tightened these labor markets further, reducing availability, increasing wage pressure, and raising the risk of delays and work stoppages.

This raises project costs and lengthens schedules, which feeds directly into higher execution risk. For capital intensive projects with multi year timelines, this distinction matters. Even if a smelter can staff its unionized operations once running, uncertainty around the availability, legality, and cost of the broader maintenance and construction workforce further undermines investor confidence and pushes the effective cost of capital higher.

Compared with the 2010s, when stable trade policy, lower interest rates, and more predictable labor availability supported effective WACC levels in the 6% to 8% range, new US primary smelting projects in 2025 face effective WACC estimates in the 9% to 12% range or higher once policy volatility and labor constraints are fully priced. These risks compound over multi year build timelines. Even with higher aluminum prices, investors see more attractive risk adjusted returns in assets with shorter development cycles, lighter labor requirements, and clearer policy alignment, including AI data centers that are competing directly for the same electricity.

This combines to mean that restarting idled aluminum plants, something requiring hundreds of millions of dollars, or building new ones, something requiring billions, are very unlikely to reach final investment decision. The cost of capital alone raises the costs of these options by tens to hundreds of millions. This compounds the lack of competitively priced industrial electricity and the challenges with getting the skilled labor necessary for new plants. It’s much more likely that more primary aluminum smelters will close rather than new ones open, a situation directly attributable to the Trump Administration’s policies which were supposed to achieve the opposite.

The collision with AI does not end there. Data centers themselves require massive grid expansion. They need transmission, substations, transformers, and conductors to be built at unprecedented speed. Aluminum is embedded in all of that infrastructure. When tariffs raise the cost of those materials, the cost and timeline of data center electrification increase. The policy meant to assert industrial strength ends up slowing the infrastructure buildout required for digital growth.

Over time, these costs do not remain with producers. They are passed through to American consumers on staggered timelines across multiple sectors. In the automotive sector, higher aluminum input costs translate into vehicle price increases or slower price declines in the range of roughly $100 to $400 per vehicle, typically appearing within 6 to 18 months as model years turn over and incentive budgets tighten.

In beverage packaging, higher aluminum prices raise the cost of cans for soda and beer, adding on the order of a few cents per six pack or case. These increases tend to appear quickly, often within 3 to 9 months, as can contracts reset and packaging costs are passed through to beverage brands and then to retail prices.

In the electricity system, higher aluminum and metals costs raise the capital cost of transmission, substations, and grid equipment. Utilities recover these costs gradually through rate cases, leading to electricity bill increases that are smaller in any given year but persistent, often amounting to a few dollars per household per month over a 3 to 10 year horizon.

In construction, higher aluminum costs feed into windows, cladding, and structural components, contributing to incremental increases in housing costs that surface over multiple years as projects are repriced and delivered. Public budgets absorb part of the shock through subsidies and infrastructure support, which shifts costs into higher taxes or public debt over longer time frames. The incidence is delayed, spread across sectors, and difficult to trace to a single policy, but it is cumulative and unavoidable.

This pattern is regressive in its effects. Electricity and packaged goods costs represent a larger share of household spending for low income Americans, so even modest increases have disproportionate impacts. Higher beverage prices are visible and frequent, while higher vehicle prices delay access to EVs that offer lower operating costs, extending reliance on more expensive fuel and maintenance. Higher electricity rates affect all households as electrification advances and electricity becomes a larger share of total energy spending. What is framed as protection for domestic industry in practice functions as a broad cost transfer to consumers, delivered through higher prices and slower cost reductions, without producing a durable revival of domestic aluminum smelting capacity.

Beyond the current administration, the implications are strategic. Electrified economies are more productive, resilient, and competitive. They rely on abundant electricity, strong grids, and efficient materials supply chains. Policies that raise the cost of electrification inputs while failing to resolve core constraints slow the transition to an electrostate. Even if future leadership shifts course, the lost time and deferred investment compound.

A coherent strategy would need to align power policy, transmission buildout, trade stability, and targeted industrial support. It would need to recognize that electrons, capital, and skilled labor are the real bottlenecks. Blunt price levers applied to one part of the system ripple outward in unintended ways. The experience of 2025 shows that raising aluminum prices does not rebuild smelting, but it does raise costs across the economy.

Electricity will continue to flow to the highest value uses. Markets will keep choosing data centers over smelters when power is scarce. Unless policy addresses physical realities rather than price signals alone, Americans will continue paying more without securing the industrial future those costs were meant to buy.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_9kpu1f9kpu1f9kpu-800x442.png,N,,2025-12-13 19:59:15.005471

The minister for resources, Madeleine King, this week announced five new areas in the Otway basin, stretching from waters off the south-west coast of Victoria to the ocean west of Tasmania, would be opened up for gas exploration as part of the government’s future gas strategy.

As cabinet deliberates over a major intervention into the east coast gas market, including a gas reservation, King said unlocking new supplies would help contain gas prices and avert potential shortfalls forecast for the end of the decade.

“Exploration and new discoveries will play an important role in underpinning our energy needs and support Australian industry and households as we meet our net zero commitments,” King said in a statement.

The announcement comes just days after the Victorian government opened tenders for gas exploration in the Otway and Gippsland basins.

The Australian Greens and the Wilderness Society have sharply criticised the federal government’s move, warning the search for new gas supplies would worsen the climate crisis and endanger marine wildlife.

“Labor’s new ocean acreage handout is an environmental betrayal and an early Christmas gift to the fossil fuel companies driving the climate crisis,” the Greens’ resources spokesperson, Steph Hodgins-May, said.

The party’s oceans spokesperson, Peter Whish-Wilson, questioned how opening new gas fields squared with the transition to clean energy.

“Labor’s two-faced climate act is wearing thin,” he said.

The Wilderness Society’s fossil fuel industry campaigner, Fern Cadman, said the waters earmarked in the latest acreage release were “wholly unsuitable” for gas exploration.

“It’s deeply disturbing that while parts of our country are on fire, fuelled by climate heating and burning of fossil fuels, the Albanese government is mindlessly paving the way for new gas drilling. Australia is meant to be on a path transitioning away from fossil fuels, not opening the door to brand new gas,” Cadman said.

King said the five new areas – all in commonwealth waters – had buffer zones to protect marine park boundaries.

Public consultation on the five zones is open until 6 February, with applications for exploration permits closing on 30 June.

The announcement comes as the Albanese government prepares to release the findings of a six-month review of the east coast gas market, which is widely expected to recommend establishing a new scheme to force producers to reserve supplies for domestic use.

Cabinet ministers are also reportedly considering bulk-buying gas and selling it to businesses at discounted rates to prevent the closure of struggling manufacturers.

Ahead of the review’s release, a coalition of environmentalists, inequality advocates and clean energy groups issued a statement opposing new taxpayer subsidises for gas companies, which they said have been “allowed to plunder Australia’s public resources without accountability for too long”.

The nine organisations backed a 25% tax on gas exports, an Australian Council of Trade Unions’ policy that has been championed by the Greens.

It’s who we are. From the acequias that feed our fields to the small businesses that anchor our towns, New Mexicans know that when one of us is struggling, all of us step up. That spirit is what has sustained us through fires, floods, droughts and economic hardship and it’s the same spirit we need now as we confront the growing costs of a warming climate.

Because the truth is undeniable: Climate change is already reshaping daily life in New Mexico.

In the last fiscal year alone, our state spent more than $256 million responding to climate-driven disasters — from wildfires to flooding — through emergency executive orders, and this year the trend has been no different. Scientists and fiscal experts recently warned lawmakers that if we fail to act and prepare, climate-related losses could reach one-third of New Mexico’s annual budget by 2040. That would mean fewer dollars for the things we care about most: our children’s education, future infrastructure needs like roads and drinking water systems, affordable health care and the essential services that keep communities safe.

These aren’t abstract projections, they’re lived experiences happening today.

In Mora and San Miguel counties, the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire burned for nearly five months, destroying more than 630 homes and causing over $4 billion in damages. In Ruidoso, families endured the worst wildfire in their history, only to be hit again by catastrophic flooding that damaged hundreds more homes. Our ranchers have watched 20% of the state’s grazing lands disappear to heat and drought since the 1970s, and homeowners and communities statewide are facing double-digit insurance increases and dried out wells as the impact of extreme weather expands.

But New Mexicans don’t back down from big challenges. We meet them with resilience, responsibility and a commitment to protect what we love. That’s why we must commit to an economy-wide path to addressing the pollution that is causing our climate to change at a rate that’s outstripping our ability to adapt.

We’ve already taken strong steps. Our state passed the Energy Transition Act, adopted nation-leading methane rules and expanded renewable energy production. Thanks to these efforts, New Mexico is now a national leader in wind and solar, with clean-energy job growth outpacing the rest of the economy.

But our current goals to cut climate-damaging pollution rely on an executive order that can change with political winds. Families, workers and businesses deserve stability they can count on.

The Clear Horizons Act, introduced this year, provides that certainty. It codifies our 2050 net-zero targets into law, ensuring we have a real plan to reduce harmful pollution and protect the health, safety and economic security of New Mexicans. It gives state agencies the tools they need to track progress, address gaps and hold the largest polluters who emit over 10,000 tons of harmful pollution a year accountable.

Just as importantly, it positions New Mexico to attract billions in clean energy investments flowing to states with strong, consistent climate rules. That means new opportunities for working families: from solar installation and battery storage to energy-efficient construction, manufacturing and land restoration projects.

Next legislative session, let’s come together — urban and rural, northern and southern, conservative and progressive — and choose once again to take care of each other and our future by passing the Clear Horizons Act.",https://image.abqjournal.com/2938636.jpg?imageId=2938636&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-12-13 15:58:26.850808

This Insight addresses changes to IRA tax credits for electric vehicles, building energy use, and clean fuel production.

Electric Vehicles

The OBBBA repealed three electric vehicle (EV) tax credits originally enacted or expanded in the IRA, as described in Table 1.

The OBBBA terminated these credits for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025. In August, the IRS announced that it would interpret the term ""acquired"" to mean ""paid for,"" such that if an individual purchases an EV before October 1st, then takes possession of the vehicle at a later date, that individual will be eligible for a tax credit.

The OBBBA also repealed the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (AFVRPC). Prior to the enactment of the IRA, the AFVRPC subsidized 30% of the costs of installing refueling equipment for alternative fuel vehicles, with a maximum credit of $30,000 for businesses and $1,000 for individuals; the credit originally expired at the end of 2021. The IRA reinstated the AFVRPC through 2032, made EV charging equipment eligible for the credit, and increased the maximum business credit to $100,000. The OBBBA terminated the AFVRPC for property placed in service after June 2026. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) projects that repealing the credit will increase federal revenues by $2.0 billion during fiscal years 2026-2034.

Residential and Commercial Building Energy Use

The OBBBA repealed three tax credits and one tax deduction for building energy use that were previously modified by the IRA. The three credits previously expired at the end of 2021 and were reinstated by the IRA in 2022.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit (RCEC) subsidizes 30% of the costs that individuals bear for purchasing, assembling, and installing solar electric panels, geothermal heat pumps, and other renewable energy equipment at their residences. The IRA originally extended the credit through 2034, but the OBBBA repealed the RCEC for all equipment completing installation after December 31, 2025.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (EEHIC) subsidizes 30% of the costs of purchasing and installing energy-efficient equipment at their homes. Annual credit amounts are limited to $3,200 per taxpayer and generally to $600 per item, with some exceptions. The EEHIC was increased to its current amounts and extended through 2032 by the IRA. The EEHIC's repeal in the OBBBA is worded somewhat ambiguously, but appears to indicate that property placed in service after 2025 will be ineligible for the credit.

Contractors may claim the Credit for Construction of Energy-Efficient New Homes (CCEENH) for building and selling new energy-efficient homes. The IRA increased the credit's maximum value from $2,000 to $5,000 per home and changed the credit's expiration year to 2032. The OBBBA terminated the CCEENH for homes acquired after June 30, 2026.

Finally, the OBBBA terminates the Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction (EECBD) for property beginning construction after June 30, 2026. The EECBD allows businesses to deduct the costs of purchasing and installing energy-efficient equipment more quickly than they otherwise would under normal tax rules. The IRA made the deduction more generous, although it had low take-up.

The JCT projects that, through the end of FY2034, federal deficits will be reduced by $77.4 billion due to repeal of the RCEC, $21.2 billion due to repeal of the EEHIC, $5.4 billion due to repeal of the CCEENH, and $134 million due to repeal of the EECBD.

Clean Fuel Production

Prior to the enactment of the IRA, there were separate federal tax credits for biodiesel, biodiesel mixtures, agri-biodiesel, renewable diesel, second-generation biofuel, mid-level ethanol blends, alternative fuels, and alternative fuels mixtures. The IRA added a tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), then scheduled the SAF credit and all other fuel credits to expire at the end of 2024. The IRA consolidated these provisions into a single tax credit, the Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC), starting in 2025. CFPC amounts scale up or down according to a fuel's global warming potential, but had maximum values of $1 per gallon for highway vehicle fuel and $1.75 per gallon for aviation fuel.

The OBBBA reinstated the small agri-biodiesel producer credit between July 2025 and December 2026. The OBBBA doubled the credit's value from 10 to 20 cents per gallon; made the credit transferable; and allowed credit recipients to claim the CFPC for the same fuel.

The OBBBA also made a number of reforms to the CFPC. Three of the most consequential reforms were:",https://www.EveryCRSReport.com/reports/IN12625.png,N,,2025-12-13 17:58:35.102021

In the quiet industrial town of Somerset, Massachusetts, the Brayton Point Power Station has finally gone dark. Once a towering symbol of the region’s energy might, this coal-fired behemoth ceased operations three years ahead of its scheduled retirement, marking the end of an era for New England’s coal power. As reported in a recent update from Slashdot, the plant’s early shutdown underscores a broader trend sweeping across the United States, where coal plants are shuttering at an accelerating pace amid economic pressures and shifting energy priorities. This closure isn’t isolated; it’s part of a wave that has seen dozens of facilities bow out, driven by cheaper alternatives and environmental imperatives.

The numbers tell a stark story. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, planned retirements of coal-fired capacity are set to surge in 2025, with projections indicating a significant uptick from previous years. Analysts point to a combination of factors: the plummeting costs of natural gas and renewables, stringent emissions regulations, and a market increasingly favoring cleaner sources. In states like Washington, the last remaining coal plant, operated by TransAlta, was slated for closure this year but has instead pivoted to natural gas under a new agreement with Puget Sound Energy, as detailed in a report from Washington State Standard. This transition highlights how some operators are adapting rather than fully decommissioning, yet it still signals coal’s diminishing role.

Beyond individual plants, the ripple effects are profound. Coal once powered nearly half of America’s electricity, but its share has dwindled to around 13% in 2025, down from 51% two decades ago. Posts on X from energy analysts reflect a mix of sentiment, with some users noting the inevitability of this shift while others decry the loss of jobs in coal-dependent communities. The closures are not just about environmental wins; they reshape local economies, forcing workers to retrain or relocate as the industry contracts.

Shifting Winds in Energy Production

The pushback against coal’s decline has gained traction under the current administration. President Trump’s policies aim to bolster fossil fuels, including efforts to relax air pollution limits and stem plant closures. A Politico analysis reveals how the surge in electricity demand from data centers, fueled by the AI boom, is granting some coal plants a temporary reprieve. States are delaying retirements to meet this hunger for power, even as pollution levels tick upward—a reversal of the downward trend in emissions seen in prior years.

This lifeline, however, may be short-lived. The newest major coal plant in the U.S., plagued by operational failures, remains offline until 2027, according to insights from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Such setbacks underscore the unreliability and high costs of maintaining aging infrastructure. Meanwhile, international developments add pressure; South Korea’s announcement at the COP30 climate conference to phase out all coal by 2040 has alarmed exporters like Australia, as covered in The Guardian, signaling a global retreat from coal that could further isolate U.S. holdouts.

On the domestic front, regulatory bodies are navigating a delicate balance. In West Virginia, the Public Service Commission has stated it has no plans to approve shutdowns of coal-fired plants, emphasizing the need to maintain grid reliability amid rising demands. A recent WV MetroNews report quotes officials warning that replacing coal too hastily could lead to blackouts, especially as renewable integration lags in some regions. This stance reflects broader tensions between energy security and sustainability goals.

Economic Ripples and Job Market Shifts

The human cost of these closures cannot be overstated. Communities built around coal mining and power generation face uncertain futures. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the retirement of plants like Homer City has led to hundreds of job losses, compelling local governments to seek federal aid for retraining programs. Economists estimate that the ongoing phaseout could eliminate tens of thousands of positions by 2030, though new opportunities in renewables and natural gas are emerging to fill some gaps.

Yet, the transition isn’t uniform. While some states accelerate closures, others, influenced by the Trump administration’s “market-based” plans, are crafting strategies to keep plants operational longer. A piece from Energy Connects details how these initiatives aim to boost electricity supply before a full pivot to alternatives, potentially delaying the inevitable by a few years. This approach contrasts with historical trends; back in 2021, Reuters noted plans to retire over 6,100 megawatts of coal capacity, a figure that has only grown as economic realities bite harder.

Global comparisons provide further context. Asia’s major economies, including China and India, have outpaced the U.S. and Europe in cleaning up their power sectors this year, according to a Reuters report. This divergence highlights America’s slower progress, partly due to political resistance and the AI-driven demand spike that has prompted 15 coal plants to delay retirements since the election, as analyzed by DeSmog in recent X discussions and their publications.

Technological Pressures and Grid Challenges

The rise of artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword for coal. Data centers’ insatiable appetite for power has led to unexpected extensions for some facilities, but it also exposes the grid’s vulnerabilities. Posts on X from industry watchers, such as those discussing the 47% decline in U.S. grid reliability under past restrictive policies, underscore the urgency of diversification. One user highlighted how China’s addition of 243 coal plants in 2024 contrasts with America’s closures, raising questions about competitive energy strategies.

Technological failures compound the issue. The offline status of the nation’s newest large coal plant until 2027, as per the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, illustrates the maintenance challenges and high costs that make coal less viable. Operators are grappling with outages and repairs that erode profitability, pushing more toward retirement.

Looking ahead, projections from S&P Global, echoed in X analyses from years past, suggest coal’s share could plummet to just 5% by 2030 from 22% today. This forecast aligns with the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s outlook, which anticipates coal dropping to 7% of generation by 2035 even without stringent EPA rules, as noted in recent posts by energy commentators.

Policy Crossroads and Future Trajectories

At the policy level, the Trump administration’s relaxation of pollution controls, as explored in Politico, allows dirtier operations to persist, but environmental advocates argue this delays necessary innovation. The interplay between federal directives and state actions creates a patchwork of outcomes, with places like Washington opting for gas conversions while others cling to coal.

Economic modeling adds another layer. Analyses of initiatives like Project 2025 indicate potential job losses and GDP hits in states reliant on coal, with Pennsylvania facing up to 37,700 job cuts and billions in economic drag by 2030, according to reports shared on X. These figures emphasize the need for balanced transition strategies that mitigate harm to workers.

Internationally, the Guardian’s coverage of South Korea’s 2040 phaseout serves as a cautionary tale for U.S. policymakers, illustrating how swift commitments can reshape export markets and global supply chains. Australia’s coal industry feels the pinch, a reminder that America’s decisions ripple outward.

Balancing Reliability and Renewal

As closures mount, the focus shifts to grid stability. Officials in West Virginia, via WV MetroNews, stress keeping plants open to avoid disruptions, especially with data center growth straining resources. This sentiment echoes across X, where users debate the merits of coal versus renewables in maintaining baseload power.

Innovations in energy storage and transmission could ease the shift, but implementation lags. The Washington State Standard’s report on TransAlta’s gas switch exemplifies adaptive strategies, potentially serving as a model for other regions.

Ultimately, the story of America’s coal plants is one of inexorable change, driven by market forces, technological advancements, and policy evolutions. While some facilities gain brief extensions, the trajectory points toward a coal-free horizon, reshaping the nation’s energy framework for generations to come.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-3784-1765649797.jpeg,N,,2025-12-13 19:59:17.804791

Ford and SK On formed BlueOval SK in 2021 to build three battery plants: two in Kentucky and one at Ford's 6-square-mile manufacturing site in rural West Tennessee. The plants represent a combined $11.4 billion investment.

Under the mutual restructuring agreement announced Thursday, a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the Kentucky battery plants, and SK On will own and operate the battery plant in Tennessee, according to a statement from SK On. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be complete by the first quarter of 2026.

The agreement allows SK On to ""improve its operational efficiency"" and ""respond more effectively to evolving market dynamics and diverse customer needs,"" the company stated.

The start of production at the Tennessee battery plant ""remains flexible at this time, as it's tied to the ownership transition,"" an SK On spokesperson said Thursday.

BlueOval SK External Affairs Director Keli McAlister wrote in a statement that the company is aware of SK On's announcement and BlueOval SK is ""working with both of our parent companies to determine what this means for BlueOval SK.""

A representative for Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

State officials are keeping a close eye on the arrangement because of a nearly $1 billion investment in BlueOval City.

""We are aware of Ford and SK On's decision to end their U.S. battery joint venture. However, this corporate decision does not change or diminish the commitments made to West Tennessee,"" the state's Department of Economic and Community Development wrote in a statement. ""The jobs, investment and long-term, generational impact promised to the region remain on track.""

Ford has pushed back its start date for mass production at the BlueOval City campus twice over the last two years amid a shifting electric vehicle market.

The industry has faced heightened political turbulence as President Donald Trump's administration targeted Biden-era electric vehicle funding and tax credits.

As of August, Ford plans to start mass production of its next-generation electric pickup truck in 2028, three years after its initial production goal of 2025.

SK On ""plans to focus on profitable and sustainable growth in the U.S. by supplying electric vehicle batteries to Ford and various customers, as well as energy storage systems, from its Tennessee plant,"" the company stated.

It emphasized its ongoing commitment to the Tennessee plant, stating the facility is a ""cornerstone of its expanding U.S. advanced battery manufacturing capabilities and production.""

SK On will ""maintain its solid strategic relationship with Ford going forward,"" as the Tennessee battery plant is on the Ford campus.

When the BlueOval City project was announced in 2021, it received nearly $1 billion in state economic incentives contingent on creating 5,760 direct new jobs over a 10-year period, with Ford's vehicle manufacturing plant slated to employ 3,000 of those workers. The remainder would be employed by the BlueOval SK battery plant.

BlueOval SK reported in September that it had hired 350 employees in Tennessee and 1,450 at its battery plants in Kentucky.

Ford announced a $2 billion investment in August to convert a Kentucky manufacturing plant to build electric vehicles, starting with a mid-sized electric pickup truck slated to launch in 2027.

Figueres asks the key question: Can this new exponential curve of clean energy innovation outpace the exponential curve of climate impacts?","By Paul Roberts / For The Herald

The annual United Nations climate talks (COP30) concluded Nov. 22 in Belem, Brazil, with tepid agreements for more funding to address adaptation and slow progress to reduce emissions. The agreements did not include commitments to phase out fossil fuels as demanded by many nations.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The deal shows that nations can still come together to confront the defining challenges no country can solve alone.” But he added: “I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”

Nearly 200 nations sent delegations to COP30. The US was noticeably absent joining Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino. Still, there are reasons for hope. Huge strides are being made in clean energy innovation and economics, notably from China.

In an essay published in The Economist magazine, Christiana Figueres, Costa Rican diplomat and one of the primary architects of the 2015 Paris agreement said: “The question now is weather this exponential curve of clean energy innovation can outpace the exponential curve of climate impacts.” She went on to say: “The era when American politics could make or break global climate co-operation is over. The world is no longer waiting for Washington.”

Indeed, China is leading the world in clean energy development and technology. And they are exporting their technology, to the benefit of the Chinese economy and the global environment. The Nov. 8 issue of The Economist magazine published a “Special Report: China, energy and climate” (https://tinyurl.com/EconomistChinaReport.)

By the end of last year, the country had installed 887 gigawatts of solar-power capacity; close to double Europe’s and America’s combined total.”

The Economist report continues: “The coming-together of China’s enormous manufacturing capacity and its ravenous appetite for copious, cheap, domestically produced electricity deserves to be seen in a world changing light. They have made China a new type of superpower: one which deploys clean electricity on a planetary scale.”

China is on track to meet or exceed its emission reduction targets set under the Paris agreement. The COP30 negotiators have taken notice. So have other nations seeking to transition from fossil fuels to renewables, seeking energy independence, and emissions reductions.

“China is exporting it’s [renewable] revolution to the rest of the world,” The Economist continues. “America’s current government rejects renewable technologies. … China is now making more money from exporting green technology than America makes from exporting fossil fuels. … In a world where China and America vie for advantage of all sorts, climate is an area where China has a particularly strong hand; and President Donald Trump has folded America’s.”

China is demonstrating that the technical capacity to reduce emissions is here now. What has been lacking is political will. That, too, is changing with the economics. The Economist reports: “The anti-emissions machine is powered by self-interest. More clean tech elsewhere lowers China’s own climate risks by reducing global emissions. At the same time it brings economic benefits. For many years countries’ economic and climate interests have often been thought to diverge. … Today the economic and climate interests of the world’s biggest manufacturer and many of its export markets are increasingly aligned.”

China is well aware of it’s growing global stature from exporting clean technology. They are developing global partnerships while the U.S. is abandoning them.

Some states are filling the vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal from climate agreements. California, (the world’s fifth-largest economy), and Washington (the nation’s fourth-largest state economy) are leaders in climate change and clean energy technology. Both were represented at COP30 and are positively engaged in trade with China.

Figueres asks the key question: Can this new exponential curve of clean energy innovation outpace the exponential curve of climate impacts? China is demonstrating that it is possible, responding at both speed and scale.

Imagine what could be done if we were to commit the same level of resources and energy currently dedicated to AI development, toward clean renewable energy and combatting climate change? China is giving the world hope, and the world — minus one — is paying attention.

Eco-nomics

“Eco-nomics” is a series of articles exploring issues at the intersection of climate change and economics. Climate change (global warming) is caused by greenhouse gas emissions — carbon dioxide and methane chiefly — generated by human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels and agricultural practices. Global warming poses an existential threat to the planet. Successfully responding to this threat requires urgent actions — clear plans and actionable strategies — to rapidly reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate-influenced events.",http://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heraldnet_logo.png,N,,2025-12-13 14:59:58.746664

The legislative push to streamline energy infrastructure permitting represents a significant shift in federal policy.","The U.S. House of Representatives has taken a pivotal step in reshaping the permitting process for interstate natural gas pipelines. By passing the Improving Interagency Coordination for Pipeline Reviews Act, the House aims to expedite the federal permitting process, designating the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as the lead agency. This move is expected to streamline the often lengthy and cumbersome approval process, potentially leading to quicker development of energy infrastructure across the country. As energy demands continue to rise, this legislative shift could have significant implications for both energy companies and consumers.

Streamlining the Permitting Process

The passage of the bill by a vote of 213-184 marks a concerted effort by lawmakers to address inefficiencies in the current permitting system. Traditionally, interstate pipeline projects have faced delays due to multiple layers of regulatory oversight, particularly involving water quality certifications under the Clean Water Act. By allowing FERC to include water quality assessments in its environmental review process, the bill seeks to eliminate the need for separate state certifications, which have often been a bottleneck.

This legislative push comes amid growing concerns about the adequacy of existing infrastructure to meet increasing energy demands. With data centers and other high-energy-use facilities proliferating, the need for rapid expansion of the energy grid is more pressing than ever. Moreover, the bill is part of a broader legislative agenda aimed at reducing household energy costs, which have been on the rise. By expediting infrastructure development, the hope is to create a more reliable and affordable energy supply.

Support and Opposition

The bill has garnered support from various stakeholders, including industry groups and some policymakers who view it as a necessary step towards modernizing America’s energy infrastructure. American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers emphasized the importance of the legislation, stating,

“These bills help unlock the infrastructure America needs to meet growing demand for affordable, reliable energy.”

However, the bill is not without its critics. Environmental groups and some state governments have expressed concerns about the potential weakening of environmental safeguards. They argue that by reducing state involvement in the permitting process, the bill could lead to insufficient consideration of local environmental impacts. This tension highlights the ongoing debate between advancing infrastructure and preserving environmental integrity.

The Broader Legislative Landscape

The House’s action is part of a larger legislative effort to reform energy permitting processes. Another bill, Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today, has also passed with bipartisan support, signaling a strong desire across party lines to tackle energy infrastructure challenges. The Senate is concurrently working on its own set of reforms, focusing on amendments to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

US LNG Exports Surge to Record Highs in November, Driven by Cooler Weather and Robust Production

NEPA, a cornerstone of environmental legislation, mandates rigorous environmental reviews for major infrastructural projects. The Senate’s proposed reforms aim to streamline these reviews, potentially facilitating quicker upgrades to electric transmission lines and other critical infrastructure. As both chambers of Congress work on complementary but distinct legislative paths, the outcome could significantly reshape how energy projects are developed and approved in the United States.

Potential Impacts on Energy Costs and Infrastructure

If successful, these legislative efforts could lead to substantial changes in the energy landscape. By reducing the time and complexity involved in pipeline permitting, companies may be more willing to invest in new projects, potentially increasing the availability of natural gas and other energy resources. This could, in turn, lead to lower energy costs for consumers, who have been bearing the brunt of rising prices.

Moreover, enhanced energy infrastructure could improve reliability and reduce the risk of outages, especially as the country transitions to more renewable energy sources. However, the balance between speed and environmental protection remains a delicate one. Policymakers will need to ensure that the push for efficiency does not come at the expense of environmental standards and public health.

The legislative push to streamline energy infrastructure permitting represents a significant shift in federal policy. As the Senate and House continue to refine and negotiate their respective bills, the coming months will be critical in determining the future of energy development in the United States. How will these changes impact the balance between energy independence and environmental stewardship in the long term?

New Mexico tells a different story. Here, we’ve shown that when a state aligns talent development, policy and infrastructure, innovation becomes a powerful engine for economic growth.

Over the last few years, New Mexico has committed to a willingness to work together. Policymakers, universities, national labs and local businesses have built a foundation for a modern technology economy, one that is growing faster than many may realize. But as this new era of innovation accelerates, driven by artificial intelligence, advanced computing and electrification, the states that will lead are those that ensure they have the power and related infrastructure to sustain it.

Any long-term innovation strategy must first start with people, and New Mexico’s talent pipeline is increasingly one of our greatest strengths. Our workforce programs and higher education institutions are the engine of this effort, working hand-in-hand to prepare the next generation of innovators who will power our economy for decades to come.

The University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University and New Mexico Tech are producing thousands of STEM graduates each year and partnering directly with New Mexico businesses to match degrees in fields like cybersecurity, clean energy, aerospace and advanced manufacturing. In fact, New Mexico now ranks sixth in the nation for manufacturing employment growth and has added more than 12,000 new jobs in the last year alone.

Our state is also benefiting from organizations that nurture local talent in local companies. In Albuquerque, CNM Ingenuity has helped launch hundreds of startups and placed thousands of New Mexicans into high-wage tech jobs while the Elevate Quantum Tech Hub has positioned the state as a leader in quantum information science and attracted national partners in AI, defense and semiconductor innovation. These hubs, combined with a growing network of accelerators and university partnerships, are creating opportunities that keep our homegrown talent right here in New Mexico.

To help strengthen this foundation, I was proud to champion House Bill 20, which established the Technology and Innovation Division within the Economic Development Department. The bill secured more than $90 million to support recruitment, retention and training in high-tech fields — investments that will continue to attract companies specializing in AI, clean energy, advanced computing and bioscience. These are the kinds of employers that bring not only high-paying jobs, but long-term economic stability.

New Mexico also benefits from an unparalleled concentration of scientific power. World-class research centers like Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory are anchoring billions of dollars in federal research and increasingly partnering with local businesses to translate research into commercial products, new companies and career pathways for New Mexicans. Growing companies like UbiQD in Los Alamos, Descartes Labs in Santa Fe, and RS21 in Albuquerque are just a few examples of what’s possible when federal R&D is paired with local innovation.

But leading the next generation of technology requires more than talent and R&D. It requires reliable, affordable energy. Across the country, electricity prices are rising not because of AI or data centers, but because America has under-invested in its power grid for decades. Our aging infrastructure is forcing utilities to play catch-up, and our innovation ecosystem is paying the price.

As one of the nation’s leaders in wind and solar potential, New Mexico is better positioned than almost any other state to support the growth of energy-intensive industries like data centers and AI development. With grid modernization already underway, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build an energy backbone that supports innovation while keeping costs affordable for families and businesses.

Across every sector, New Mexico continues moving forward. Whether it’s strengthening our workforce, deepening partnerships with the national labs or modernizing our energy infrastructure, New Mexico has proven that smart, proactive policy leads to measurable economic outcomes.

New Mexico’s story shows what is possible when states take the lead: innovation thrives, jobs grow and communities benefit. As the national conversation continues, our example stands as a reminder that the future of America’s tech leadership won’t be written in Washington, but in states like New Mexico, where collaboration, creativity and long-term thinking are already shaping the next era of economic opportunity.

As Newsweek recently put it, America is “running out of children.” Pelosi’s San Francisco home is the epicenter, with children under age five in the Bay Area plunging by 38 percent since 2005.

But the burden of soaring debt may be Pelosi’s greatest legacy for children, contradicting promises she made on becoming Speaker.
The video briefly displays a beaming Pelosi surrounded by children on first becoming Speaker.","Since former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced she will not run for re-election, retrospectives have poured in on everything from her role in passing Obamacare to her skill in stock trades. But tributes have been noticeably missing on one theme Pelosi often stresses: that “we’re here for the children,” as she put it while surrounding herself with children in a 2007 photo-op on first becoming Speaker. There are good reasons why.

In his recent valedictory, Pelosi’s successor Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) could offer only generalities about that legacy: “For the children, as she often says, Speaker Pelosi has lived out the bedrock Jesuit value of working for the greater good.” He did no better in listing her “giant and historic legislative accomplishments,” touting specifically the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), Inflation Reduction Act, and American Rescue Plan Act. Those laws include few enduring policies focused on children.

Passed during Pelosi’s first stint as Speaker, Obamacare expanded taxpayer subsidies in all directions, yet its most prominent “children’s issue” may be a guarantee of coverage for “adult children” under their parents’ policies. The law’s broader legacy includes increasingly expensive workplace coverage. “The average cost of insuring a family of four through the workplace has nearly tripled since 2005,” according to the Milliman Medical Index.

Those growing costs compound the housing affordability crisis plaguing young adults. Large numbers live with their parents well into their 30s, contributing to historic lows in birth rates and a continuing drop in children. As Newsweek recently put it, America is “running out of children.” Pelosi’s San Francisco home is the epicenter, with children under age five in the Bay Area plunging by 38 percent since 2005. According to the 2020 Census, San Francisco has the fewest children of any US city.

Crafted during Pelosi’s second stint as Speaker, the American Rescue Plan Act notably included a massive expansion of the child tax credit, which Democrats hailed as transformative for children. In promoting the expanded benefit, Pelosi boasted “As I always say, the three most important issues facing our Congress are our children, our children, our children.”

But the expansion was temporary, and provided the credit for the first time to nonworking parents, effectively reviving work-free welfare checks eliminated on a bipartisan basis decades ago. Even Democrats balked at extending it, and it expired after just one year. As Sen. Joe Manchin, then a critical swing Democrat, put it in opposing an extension, “There’s no work requirements whatsoever. . . . Don’t you think, if we’re going to help children, that the people should make some effort?”

The subsequent Inflation Reduction Act included no major policies identifiable with children. Instead, it was panned by liberal advocates for rejecting new entitlements to child care proposed by President Joe Biden. “An important group of Americans was lost in the text of the final legislation: young children,” they lamented.

Liberal children’s advocates might find other faults. A federal paid leave program for parents failed to materialize. Food stamp expansions tilted toward childless adults, not children. And while spending is not the same as effectiveness andstates pick up many education, health, and welfare costs for kids, Eugene Steuerle and Urban Institute colleagues note federal spending “on children in 2023 was 9 percent of all federal outlays.” That is “projected to decline to 6 percent over the next decade” as spending on seniors continues to soar. Meanwhile interest on the ballooning national debt is “expected to grow from 11 percent to 17 percent.” One headline summarizes the result: “Congress Has Bankrupted America’s Future.”

That bankruptcy has been decades in the making, and both parties are complicit. But the burden of soaring debt may be Pelosi’s greatest legacy for children, contradicting promises she made on becoming Speaker.

Back then she pledged “Congress will commit itself to a higher standard: Pay as you go; no new deficit spending.” Instead, her eight years as Speaker saw federal debt explode by over $14 trillion. The financial crisis and pandemic contributed, but that’s surely not the “new America” she promised future generations, which would “not burden them with mountains of debt.”

That may explain something missing in Pelosi’s own retirement announcement. In a slick six-minute video, she describes her love of San Francisco, long House service, and billions delivered to favored projects and constituencies. The video briefly displays a beaming Pelosi surrounded by children on first becoming Speaker. But in 800 words reflecting on her legacy, it’s telling that Pelosi doesn’t once mention the group she regularly calls the most important: the children.

This strategy has been driven by lower oil and gas prices, which have limited opportunities for significant profit margins.
As U.S. energy firms navigate these challenges, they must consider how to leverage technological innovations and efficiency improvements to maintain competitiveness.","In recent weeks, U.S. energy firms have made notable adjustments to their oil and natural gas operations, as detailed by the energy services company Baker Hughes. According to their latest report, the number of operational rigs has decreased for the second time in three weeks. This reduction brings the total count to 548, marking the lowest level since late November. These changes are occurring amidst fluctuations in oil and gas prices, prompting companies to reassess their strategies. Despite these shifts, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects an increase in crude and gas output for the coming year, indicating potential growth in production.

Fluctuating Rig Counts and Market Impacts

The reduction in the U.S. oil and natural gas rig count is a key indicator of future production levels. Baker Hughes reports that the total rig count has decreased by 6.9% compared to the same period last year. This brings the current number to 548, reflecting a broader trend of declining rig counts over the past two years. In 2024, the count dropped by about 5%, and in 2023, it saw a more substantial decrease of 20%. These decreases have been largely influenced by falling oil and gas prices, which have led firms to prioritize financial stability over expanding production.

Despite the recent downturn in rig numbers, Baker Hughes noted a slight increase in oil rigs, which rose by one to 414, the highest since November 21. Conversely, gas rigs fell by two, bringing the total to 127. Such fluctuations highlight the volatile nature of the energy market as firms navigate changing economic landscapes and consumer demands.

Price Trends and Production Projections

Analysts predict that U.S. spot crude prices will continue to decline for a third consecutive year in 2025. However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts a rise in crude output. Production is expected to increase from a record 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to approximately 13.6 million barrels per day in 2025. This anticipated increase suggests that while prices may remain low, production efficiency and technological advancements could drive higher output levels.

On the natural gas front, the EIA projects a significant 63% increase in spot gas prices for 2025. This rise follows a 14% price drop in 2024, which led many energy firms to cut output. The downturn in 2024 was the first since the COVID-19 pandemic impacted demand in 2020. With higher prices, producers are likely to ramp up drilling activities, potentially leading to an increase in gas production to 107.7 billion cubic feet per day, up from 103.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2024.

Economic Considerations for Energy Firms

Energy companies are facing a complex economic environment as they balance production demands with financial health. The priority for many firms has shifted toward enhancing shareholder returns and reducing debt. This strategy has been driven by lower oil and gas prices, which have limited opportunities for significant profit margins. By focusing on financial stability, companies aim to secure their long-term viability in a competitive market.

Meanwhile, the anticipated rise in gas prices could offer a reprieve for producers. A higher price point might enable these firms to increase their drilling activities and production without compromising their financial strategies. However, the success of such endeavors will depend on the ability of energy firms to adapt to ongoing market changes and manage operational costs effectively.

Future Outlook and Industry Adaptation

The energy sector is at a crossroads as it contends with evolving market dynamics and environmental considerations. While projections indicate potential growth in production, firms must remain agile in response to fluctuating prices and regulatory shifts. The industry is also under increasing pressure to incorporate sustainable practices, which could redefine production methods and energy outputs.

As U.S. energy firms navigate these challenges, they must consider how to leverage technological innovations and efficiency improvements to maintain competitiveness. The balance between increasing output and sustaining financial health will be crucial in shaping the future of the industry.

Being polite has gotten us nowhere.” Blackburn copied The Denver Gazette a memo she sent to Gov.","Colorado residents could be paying a lot more for home energy, following the state’s decision last week to turn away from natural gas as a home cooking and heating fuel, experts said.

Some 1.9 million Colorado households warm their homes each winter using gas. That’s also how how tens of thousands of businesses heat their buildings. But that could change significantly in the near term under an order handed down by the state’s 3-person Public Utilities Commission.

Policy experts and advocates were all ears on Dec. 1, when energy regulators ordered Xcel Energy – the state’s biggest utility company – and other non-municipal utilities to slash their carbon output by 41% by 2035 as a step toward a 100% carbon-free future fired by solar and wind.

The only way to reduce carbon that much is by switching out the gas-fired furnaces, stoves and appliances of as many as 600,000 customers and changing them to electric heating. That’s according to the Colorado Energy Office, which was among two state agencies that cautioned the utility commission against its ultimate decision.

‘EXCESSIVE COLLATERAL DAMAGE‘

Some environmental activists embraced the commission’s decision, while it spawned shock and surprise among many other advocates, some of whom were confused by the order.

“This will cause excessive collateral damage for those least able to afford it,” said Sara Blackhurst, president and CEO of Action Colorado, a nonprofit community advocacy group based in southern Colorado.

​“Meeting the approved goal will be … challenging and difficult to achieve,” Michelle Aguayo, a spokeswoman for Xcel Energy, told The Denver Gazette in a written response. She added it “will increase customer costs.”

Although state legislation passed in 2021 had required any cost of carbon cutting to be capped at 2.5% of customers’ annual gas bills, sources suggested the actual costs of a conversion might easily exceed $12 billion – or higher.

News of the order happened just as Xcel warned customers of an impending major rate hike. This week, Xcel notified that it had submitted a proposal to the PUC for a 9.93% increase to take effect next summer. Small businesses would see a 9.48% rise.

Missing almost entirely from the Public Utility Commission’s order was any mention of rates or rate increases.

In the Dec. 1 order, 28 pages in length, there were three uses of the word “rate” or “rates” apart from references to “ratepayers” — utility parlance for customers.

Some advocates said the impact of such a transition would be shouldered entirely by customers.

“Who pays for those solutions are ratepayers,” a senior executive at a large utility told The Denver Gazette, who asked to remain anonymous to freely discuss the subject.

The Denver Gazette spoke with a dozen utility experts, company spokespeople, consultants, and consumer advocates, practically all of whom offered a negative assessment of the order, on whether the reduction could be carried out in 10 years and how it could be apportioned and financed.

Virtually all said they are hesitant to go on record in criticizing an order that began in the Colorado legislature and was handed down by the commission that directly oversees their industry’s operations.

‘IT’S PAID BY THE CUSTOMER’

“The biggest misdirection is in saying it is not directed at customers,” the senior executive said. “Electric costs are going up to pay for those transitions. It’s a simple understanding of how utility programs work, whether by a non-jurisdictional utility or an investor-owned or municipally-owned utility. It’s paid for by the customer.”

Those costs could be astronomical, according to experts.

The 600,000 customer figure, cited in testimony by the Colorado Energy Office in tandem with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, works out to be around a third of the state’s households using gas as their primary heating and cooking source.

Discussion of the climate goals in the order are specific to metric tons of carbon reduction, but the language gets vague as to whether customers would be required to switch out specific appliances or whether they would be entirely converted, starting with their gas furnaces.

If a conversion cost in the $20,000 range, the tab would be $12 billion.

However, that may not figure in the systemic costs of altering the gas distribution system and of gearing up electric production, transmission, and supply to meet any jump in demand, experts said.

Meanwhile, experts are frank in admitting there is little evidence that customers are anxious to have their gas ranges converted to electric or their heaters switched out for ground-source electric heat pumps.

“What if the consumer says, ‘I’m good with what I have?’” the senior utility executive asked.

The order also brings into question what responsibilities utilities have to their customers – for whom they are supplying a popular commodity, the executive added.

A source familiar with the commission’s internal workings who declined to be named questioned the origins of the 41% reduction figure, suggesting it seems arbitrary and in conflict with the enabling legislation.

This source noted that the major affected utilities had each submitted pleadings, and all had effectively countered that the approach isn’t realistic in a 10-year timeframe.

UTILITIES SOUGHT LOWER TARGETS

In pleadings leading up to last week’s decision, Dallas-based Atmos Energy, which supplies gas to some 129,000 Colorado customers, asked that the target be held at 22%, which was specified for 2030 in the original Senate bill requiring utilities to create “clean heat plans.”

Atmos told the commission it has an “overarching duty to ensure just and reasonable rates for customers,” adding higher target levels failed to acknowledge that customers continue to demand natural gas as a fuel. Even meeting the lower target by 2030, the company said, would require average annual costs of $55 million.

When asked about the decision, Atmos would only tell The Denver Gazette that its 2024 clean heat plan focused primarily on incentives to help customers improve the efficiency of their existing appliances, and that the company is working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while also prioritizing safety, “energy choice,” affordability, and reliability.

Atmos serves customers in areas including Greeley, Steamboat, Craig, Salida, Gunnison, Canon City, Lamar, and Durango.

In like manner, Black Hills Energy, which serves some 200,000 gas customers in southern Colorado, pleaded that recent targets are not achievable without “incredible investments.” Black Hills added that baseline data used by the commission in setting the new requirements are no longer accurate due to significant growth.

Following a query about the decision, a Black Hills representative would say only that the new reductions are significantly greater than what the legislature originally required, and that the company would balance state policy requirements with customer affordability.

“Recent survey results show that 90% of our natural gas customers value the ability to choose their energy source, and we will continue to advocate for their interests, “ Black Hills added in a written statement to The Denver Gazette.

Xcel Energy’s Aguayo told The Denver Gazette that her company, with 1.5 million gas customers in the state, is charting a similar course.

“With the support of state agencies, we brought forward a reasonable proposal to balance emissions reductions and affordability,” she said in her written reply.

‘MORE AGGRESSIVE GOALS’

“As our current plan shows, the overwhelming majority of participating customers are choosing natural gas as their backup fuel source, and the shift to these more aggressive goals is not in line with customer expectations, thereby creating achievability and feasibility concerns for the future,” she added.

Using natural gas power plants to replace older coal-fired plants has been widely credited for a major decline in carbon emissions across the U.S. over the past decade. Gas emits around half the carbon dioxide per unit of energy, compared to coal as a fuel. ​

Some environmental advocates have long sought to eliminate fossil-fired energy, including natural gas, as the source to power homes and industries. They have argued that newer technologies – notably wind and solar, backed by batteries – have become cheaper over time, and Colorado should fully embrace them quickly as they are better for the environment and human health.

Critics of that transition have countered that it is happening too quickly – and that low-income residents will ultimately bear the cost of that rapid change in jobs lost and higher energy bills.

Multiple sources suggested that gas household customers and apartment renters have little or no awareness of the major changes that could soon be headed their way – or of the possible rate impacts.

Sources also pointed out that the state’s own agencies had advised the commission to accept a lower target.

The Colorado Energy Office and the Department of Public Health and Environment originally proposed a reduction of 41% across the three gas utilities by 2035. But the agencies later changed their target, suggesting 31%.

Achieving the higher target, they testified, is questionable “in a setting where the uptake rate is low” and where 600,000 customers would have to fully electrify – requiring a switch to electric water heating, cooking, and clothes drying, in addition to space heating.

Most electrification to date had been “partial electrification,” the agencies told the commission, where customers switch over some appliances while leaving others.

“If the trend of partial instead of full electrification continues, the required number of customers adopting electrification to reach the 41% target would likely be much higher than 600,000,” the agencies added.

They recommended more study to determine whether even a 31% reduction would appear ambitious.

The Denver Gazette spoke with Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, about the change in direction and whether he was surprised the commission had adopted the steeper carbon reduction goal than the agencies recommended.

“We certainly respect the decision the PUC made,” Toor said.

He added that the picture would become clearer as cost trends are revealed and as more is learned about whether new measures to recover lost methane can help meet the reductions.

‘CRACY REAL QUICK’

“Utility costs are at the top of mind on both the electric and gas sides,” Toor added. “If it brings on a lot of demand and they need to be building new transmission lines, it can certainly affect rates. But a lot of upgrades are needed to distribution systems just because they are old.”

The Denver Gazette asked whether wind and solar, growing as a share of the grid’s capacity in Colorado, could actually be relied on to pick up demand in a major switch from gas.

Toor replied that a switch to greater electric might rebalance the annual demand of electric customers away from summer, when cooling demand peaks. But the supply side, he added, wouldn’t solely focus on wind and solar – but also on technologies like gas with carbon capture, geothermal, and small modular nuclear reactors.

However, the senior utility executive who spoke anonymously is less sanguine about a turnover.

“It gets crazy really quick. Every customer participates in those costs,” the executive said, musing over how a utility would pick which customers need to move over to electric.

The executive questioned whether broader costs of those utilities covered by the PUC action are being taken into account, including retrofitting their existing services where their territories for gas don’t necessarily align with service for electric.

“The system is sized to meet the load,” the executive added. “To retro existing service will be very expensive, and that’s been completely overlooked.”

That executive suggested that market considerations — the willingness of customers to cooperate and the workforce availability to carry out conversions — have not been well evaluated.

“If it’s desirable to drive customers to an all-electric economy, the best way to incentivize that is to make it as affordable as possible, but Colorado has done exactly the opposite of that,” the executive said.

“It’s a vanity that we can attack everything all at once and assume it will be free.”

Meanwhile, the cost implications arrive at a moment when Colorado’s job market could be headed for decline after a decade of growth. Latest jobs data shows the state continuing to show better than average employment.

However, unemployment is running above average in some areas, warned Brian Lewandowski, who heads the University of Colorado’s Business Research Division.

With the potential for serious rate increases a possibility, The Denver Gazette reached out to all three announced gubernatorial candidates to weigh in on the PUC’s action.

Attorney General Phil Weiser’s spokesman replied he would be unable to comment at this time. Following the PUC order, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet’s campaign distributed what it calls a “cap-and-invest” plan to “Address Climate Change and Cut Energy Costs.” However, the campaign did not follow up on a conversation requesting a specific comment on the order.

‘A ONE-TWO HIT’

Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, R-Weld County, one of the Republicans running for governor, told The Denver Gazette that the PUC order is worrisome.

“A mandate to transition away from reliable, affordable, clean natural gas to unreliable and more costly wind and solar energy just doesn’t make sense,” she said in a written reply.

“The reality is pretty simple: people are going to pay more and have fewer options when it comes to heating their homes and keeping the lights on. When the PUC isn’t honest about the costs, it’s everyday Coloradans who end up feeling it the most,” she said.

Sara Blackhurst with Action Colorado noted that her organization serves counties around Pueblo, whose residents are already worried about potential job loss as its Comanche coal-fired power plant faces a scheduled closure.

The plant’s older Unit 2 generator, which had been scheduled to close this year, is being kept online after the newer, more efficient Unit 3 showed reliability issues, jeopardizing the stability of the grid.

Blackhurst said that, among the consequences of the order, is to “take effective replacements for Comanche off the table.”

“They went rogue. What they’re doing to my hometown is a one-two hit,” Blackhurst said about the PUC decision. “We’ve gone past go-along to get-along. Being polite has gotten us nowhere.”

Blackburn copied The Denver Gazette a memo she sent to Gov. Jared Polis following the PUC’s order, questioning how home heating reliability would be maintained, how the load growth would be covered, and how low-income and rural households would be protected.

She also criticized the public messaging around electrification that she says depicts electric heat pumps as a cheaper alternative to gas heat.

“The real-world data — including from climate-conscious Colorado homeowners who already use heat pumps — shows a different picture,” she said.

“If heat pumps were truly cheaper in Colorado winters, we wouldn’t have to mandate them. People would choose them voluntarily,” Blackburn wrote.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fe69352d3b53fa58932010138ea09a3b-1024x706.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 12:00:11.774578

India’s electric vehicle (EV) industry is on track for a dramatic transformation as demand for EV batteries is expected to grow more than fourteen-fold by 2032, according to a new industry report. The 2025 EV Battery Technology Review Report by Customized Energy Solutions (CES) projects that annual battery demand in India will soar from around 17.7 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2025 to an astonishing 256.3 GWh in 2032 — a growth rate that reflects the rapid adoption of electric mobility across the nation. This expansion underscores not only the increasing number of EVs hitting Indian roads but also the mounting government support, emerging battery technologies, and aggressive model launches that are reshaping the country’s automotive landscape.

The CES report highlights that this growth trajectory is being fuelled by a combination of rising fuel prices, stronger consumer demand for cleaner and cost-efficient transport options, and supportive policy frameworks aimed at accelerating electrification. A compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 35 per cent is expected over the next seven years, painting a picture of one of the fastest expansions in India’s clean-energy sector. As battery demand climbs, manufacturers and investors are gearing up to scale production, diversify technology portfolios, and attract new capacity investments to meet this surge.

One of the key drivers of this transformation is innovation in battery chemistry and technology. Technologies such as next-generation LFP (lithium iron phosphate) Gen 4, advanced NCM (nickel-cobalt-manganese) cells, and emerging alternatives like sodium-ion batteries are poised to make EV batteries safer, more affordable, and capable of delivering better performance and longer driving ranges — all critical factors in driving wider adoption of electric vehicles in India’s diverse market. This technological evolution is expected to benefit everything from two-wheelers and three-wheelers to passenger cars and commercial EVs, making electrification more accessible across vehicle segments.

In addition to technological advances, India’s energy and automotive policy environment is playing a significant role. Government incentives, regulatory norms aimed at reducing carbon emissions, and targeted support for EV and battery manufacturing are helping to build a robust ecosystem that encourages both domestic production and foreign investments. Local battery makers are now exploring major capacity expansions while global firms look toward India as a promising hub for EV battery production and innovation.

Analysts say the anticipated increase in battery demand will have wide-ranging impacts. It is expected to spur job creation in manufacturing and related services, reduce reliance on imported energy and battery components over time, and strengthen India’s positioning in the global EV supply chain. However, meeting this demand will require sustained investment in infrastructure — including battery gigafactories, charging networks, and raw material supply chains — alongside continued research in battery recycling and sustainability practices.

For consumers, this growth may translate into a broader range of EV models, improved affordability, and better performance, making electric vehicles a more attractive choice for daily commuting and long-distance travel. Manufacturers are expected to expand product offerings in both passenger and commercial segments, responding to evolving consumer preferences and environmental priorities.

In summary, the surge in EV battery demand projected for India over the coming decade highlights a pivotal shift toward electrified mobility that promises to reshape the country’s automotive sector, drive industrial growth, and support environmental sustainability goals. With continued technological advancements and policy support, India’s EV battery ecosystem is poised for explosive growth, making it a key cornerstone of the nation’s transition to cleaner, greener transportation.",https://telematicswire.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cropped-twfev-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-13 13:59:35.836768

To decarbonize buildings, HEET explored how we could most effectively achieve building electrification, the dominant strategy for reducing the sector’s carbon footprint.
The pipes could transfer their energy to ground-source heat pumps, which can both heat and cool homes.
Ground-source heat pumps are roughly twice as efficient as the popular air-source heat pumps, which incidentally have been outselling gas furnaces since 2022.
An Oak Ridge National Laboratory study on geothermal heat pumps (Feb. 14, 2024) showed it would cost 30% less to decarbonize the grid through individual ground-source heat pumps than it would using air-source heat pumps.","A neighborhood in Framingham is the location of the nation’s first utility-owned geothermal network. Thirty-six buildings, including single- and multifamily homes, the local housing authority and municipal buildings are being heated and cooled in this pilot program, which could serve as a model for the country.

Geothermal networks can extract heat stored in the Earth to warm buildings in the winter, as well as cool them by pumping heat from buildings back into the ground during the summer. This technology taps local energy that’s always available, shielding customers from fluctuating fossil fuel prices and availability issues.

Boston-based HEET.org was instrumental in driving the Framingham project. The organization aims to evolve our energy system to an affordable, clean energy model. In assessing areas for greatest climate impact, HEET elected to target building stock, which accounts for roughly 30% of all carbon dioxide emissions, explained Angie Alberto Escobar, HEET’s gas-to-geo transition director, during a recent webinar hosted by MetroWest Climate Solutions. (A link to a recording of the session is on the MCS website.)

To decarbonize buildings, HEET explored how we could most effectively achieve building electrification, the dominant strategy for reducing the sector’s carbon footprint. HEET also researched the effect of increasing demand for electricity on the electric grid and electric peaks — key energy cost drivers.

To address these issues, HEET proposed in 2017 that gas utilities, which have millions of miles of aging pipes laid under streets, replace those pipes with water-filled geothermal pipes. The pipes could transfer their energy to ground-source heat pumps, which can both heat and cool homes. Ground-source heat pumps are roughly twice as efficient as the popular air-source heat pumps, which incidentally have been outselling gas furnaces since 2022. An Oak Ridge National Laboratory study on geothermal heat pumps (Feb. 14, 2024) showed it would cost 30% less to decarbonize the grid through individual ground-source heat pumps than it would using air-source heat pumps.

Escobar explained that the team asked: “What if we took advantage of the right-of-way that the gas system currently has, used the utilities’ expertise of laying pipe in the street, and simply changed the energy transfer medium from gas to water?”

This type of geothermal network is similar to the gas system, in that it has a distribution pipe that runs down the street’s right-of-way, with service lines to each building. Instead of a gas furnace, a heat pump in each home or building is supplied with water by this distribution loop. This closed-loop system avoids the risk of dangerous leaks because the energy transfer medium is water, with a very small amount of antifreeze.

HEET collaborated with Eversource, which started work on the Framingham project in 2024. After a year of construction, the pilot is up and running. By January, HEET expects to have data on the project’s payback period and cost-effectiveness.

A key benefit of this approach is that it gives utilities a path to migrate their aging gas systems to a carbon-free energy source. Massachusetts has one of the oldest gas systems in the country, with about 17% of its underground pipes considered leak-prone as of 2024. These pipes leak methane — a greenhouse gas that has 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.

Fixing these leaks is costing ratepayers about $500 million per year, according to HEET. Repair costs are expected to exceed $40 billion, which would make updating the gas infrastructure one of the most expensive projects ever undertaken by the state (by contrast, the Big Dig cost about $14.8 billion). Given these phenomenal costs, along with the state’s legislative mandate to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, it makes sense to explore alternatives, Escobar notes.

These types of projects would also allow the existing gas workforce to transition their skills. These workers, who did the majority of the work on the Framingham project, have invaluable expertise in laying and repairing pipes.

HEET is supporting another local project at the Franklin Field Apartments (129 units) in Dorchester. It will be the first networked geothermal pilot project in Boston. The project is being led by National Grid, in partnership with the Boston Housing Authority.

In addition, Escobar reports increased utility interest throughout the nation. A utility network group meets quarterly to actively explore this technology.

“This technology offers a hyper-local energy source,” she said. “We are harvesting what is already around us; it is not subject to supply disruptions or pricing variability of fuels being shipped from far away. By using the energy already around us and leveraging the systems that serve us today, we can protect future ratepayers and build the equitable, carbon-free future we all want, at the speed the climate needs.”

Investments aim to stabilize the grid and support industrial and mining growth

Zambia seeks to ease its 90% reliance on hydropower through private-sector projects

The Tanzanian conglomerate Amsons Group signed a partnership agreement on Tuesday, December 9, with Exergy Africa, an energy-focused investment firm active in East and Southern Africa, to develop 1,300 megawatts (MW) of solar and coal-based power capacity in Zambia.

The total investment for the planned projects is estimated at about $900 million, according to the agreement signed in Lusaka.

The projects aim to improve grid reliability for key industrial sectors and enable new investment in manufacturing and mining.

Solar capacity of 500 MW is expected to be added to the national grid within 18 months, and the full 1,300 MW should be completed within 24 months. In detail, 1,000 MW will come from solar plants and 300 MW from a coal facility.

Amsons Group CEO Edha Nahdi said Zambia is a strategic and fast-growing market for the group, noting that the conglomerate will bring logistical strength and clean-energy investment to support Zambia’s industrialization and energy stability.

“This partnership represents a major commitment to Zambia’s power sector and industrial future. By partnering with a group that already operates at scale across multiple African markets, we have paced ourselves to move faster, reduce project risk, and deliver reliable power where it is needed most,” said Exergy Africa Limited director Monica Musonda.

Reducing hydropower’s dominance in the energy mix

Zambia’s Minister of Energy, Makozo Chikote, who attended the signing ceremony, said the projects announced by Amsons Group and Exergy Africa support the government’s energy-sector development strategy, which calls for a stronger role for private investors.

In recent months, the Zambian government has multiplied announcements of new solar-plant projects developed with local and foreign private partners to reduce its dependence on hydropower, which accounts for 90% of the country’s electricity mix, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). This heavy reliance exposes the grid to climate-related risks, including droughts that lower reservoir levels and trigger production deficits.

Amsons Group is a diversified energy and industrial conglomerate operating in Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique, the DRC, and Zambia. Its activities include fuel distribution, cement manufacturing, milling, logistics, packaging, real estate, and electronics assembly.

The latest round of FAST NY grants will fund infrastructure upgrades in Albany, Erie, Fulton, Herkimer, and Orange counties, aiming to make large sites ready for employers looking to build quickly.

What FAST NY does

FAST NY, short for Focused Attraction of Shovel-Ready Tracts New York, helps communities upgrade land so companies can move in without long delays. The program supports roads, water and sewer systems, power, and other infrastructure critical for advanced manufacturing.

Since the program launched, New York has awarded more than $326 million to 39 sites across upstate. The state also added another $100 million to FAST NY in the current budget year.

Where the money is going

The largest award, $25.48 million, will go to the Village of Maybrook in Orange County. The funding will help redevelop the long-vacant Maybrook Rail Yard into the Switchyard Terminal for Economic and Advanced Manufacturing, creating six rail-accessible building sites about 75 miles from New York City.

Fulton County will receive $8.99 million to revitalize Tryon Technology Park, a former state juvenile correctional facility in Perth. The upgrades will prepare a 220-acre site for multiple large manufacturing buildings, with a focus on agribusiness, food processing, and life sciences.

In Herkimer County, $7.9 million will support infrastructure upgrades at the Central New York Business Center in Frankfort. The project includes gas main upgrades, fire protection water storage, road improvements, and utility extensions to attract advanced manufacturers.

Albany County and Erie County will each receive $500,000 for pre-development work. In Albany County, the funding advances planning for the Al Tech Advanced Manufacturing Campus in Colonie. In Erie County, the money supports engineering and permitting for sewer and wastewater upgrades in the Town of Elma.

A statewide economic push

State officials say the grants aim to bring good-paying jobs back to regions that lost manufacturing decades ago. FAST NY sites target industries like semiconductors, clean energy, life sciences, agribusiness, and advanced manufacturing.

Companies already attracted through FAST NY-backed sites include fairlife, Chobani, Siemens Mobility, and Edwards Vacuum. Those projects are expected to bring more than $2.2 billion in private investment and nearly 3,000 jobs statewide.

Local leaders in the funded counties say the projects will help turn long-idle or underused land into engines for regional growth, while giving New York a competitive edge in attracting large employers.

The Kentucky Resources Council, Earthjustice, the Mountain Association, and the Metropolitan Housing Council commissioned the 65-page report.

Kentucky electricity customers could save $2.6 billion by 2050 by moving away from fossil fuels and toward more renewables and battery storage, according to the report.

It says that two laws enacted by the General Assembly make it harder to wean Kentucky off the fossil fuels that are becoming more expensive.

Ashley Wilmes is the executive director of the Kentucky Resources Council. She says that threatens to make electricity unaffordable for many residents.

“When people are choosing between their grocery bills and keeping the lights on, and when employers face rising electricity bills, our economy suffers,” she said. “Kentucky's economic future is directly tied to whether families and businesses can afford their electricity bills.”

Four major Kentucky utilities are seeking rate increases. They rely heavily on coal.

Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities are seeking approval for increases of $9 and $5 per month, respectively, for the typical customer.

East Kentucky Power Cooperative’s plan would raise the average bill by about $5 a month.

Kentucky Power’s proposed rate increase – $27 a month – is the highest in the region.

Wilmes says those plans won’t make Kentucky a more attractive place to live or do business.

“Continuing to rely on these aging, costly coal plants and then adding new gas on top of them is the most expensive and the most risky path we can take,” she said. “It drives up our rates, and it undermines the very economic development that we are all working to attract.”

The report says Kentucky could achieve a 95% clean electricity portfolio by 2050 and still save customers $1.6 billion.

Either way, the report says, the state should move away from building new gas plants, as all four utilities plan to do over the next several years, and continue investing in old coal plants.

The report says Senate Bills 4 and 349 increase future risks to electricity customers by effectively requiring replacement capacity to come from fossil fuels.

Kentucky generated 67% of its electricity from coal in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, more than any state but West Virginia.

Nationwide, coal fell to 15% of electricity generation in 2024, down from nearly half two decades ago. Wind and solar surpassed coal for the first time last year.

Coal production and jobs in Kentucky have fallen precipitously in the past few decades. The industry employed fewer than 4,000 workers in the June-to-September quarter, according to the Energy and Environment Cabinet’s coal dashboard.

Annual coal production is down to what Kentucky used to produce every three months.

“The Paris agreement has set in motion a shift towards clean energy that no country can now ignore,” she said.
Would this have happened without the Paris agreement?
The first blow to the fledgling Paris agreement came within just a year, with the election of Donald Trump as US president in 2016.
Roughly 90% of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions since the Paris agreement has come from China.","Ten years on from the historic Paris climate summit, which ended with the world’s first and only global agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, it is easy to dwell on its failures. But the successes go less remarked.

Renewable energy smashed records last year, growing by 15% and accounting for more than 90% of all new power generation capacity. Investment in clean energy topped $2tn, outstripping that into fossil fuels by two to one.

Electric vehicles now account for about a fifth of new cars sold around the world. Low-carbon power makes up more than half of the generation capacity of China and India, with China’s emissions now flattening, and most developed countries on a downward trend.

For Laurence Tubiana, a former French diplomat who was one of the main architects of the Paris accord and is now chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, this is a remarkable achievement. “The Paris agreement has set in motion a shift towards clean energy that no country can now ignore,” she said.

Would this have happened without the Paris agreement? Unlikely, according to Bill Hare, chief executive of the Climate Analytics thinktank. He said: “The 1.5C limit [for rising global temperatures] and the net zero goal have reshaped policy, finance, litigation and sectoral rules, helping to rewire how states, markets and institutions work.”

Ed Miliband, the UK energy secretary, said look where temperatures were headed before Paris, if you want to judge the summit’s impact. The planet was on track for more than 4C of heating, a catastrophic increase.

After Paris, that came down to 3C. Then, after Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, which reaffirmed the 1.5C pledge, carbon-cutting commitments brought the projected temperature rise to about 2.8C. Today, the forecast stands at about 2.5C, if all existing promises are fulfilled.

“We’ve made progress as a world, but we also know that is far short of what we agreed at Paris,” said Miliband. “You’re trying to get 193 countries to agree to these big fundamental questions about the trajectory of their economies, their societies, the way their energy systems work. No wonder it’s difficult.”

Yet the shaky response to the Paris agreement from some key countries in its immediate aftermath has added significantly to the climate crisis we now face, and the failure of rich governments in more recent years to uphold their side of the bargain with the poorer world threatens to implode the global consensus.

The question now is: can countries learn from the mistakes of the past decade, in order to keep the Paris agreement alive in the next?

The history of the last 10 years in climate politics is one of glaring contradictions, forward leaps followed by backsliding, and cooperation attended by fracture. The first blow to the fledgling Paris agreement came within just a year, with the election of Donald Trump as US president in 2016. He vowed to withdraw from the pact, and began the process in 2017.

This year, that pattern looked set to repeat: in January, on re-entry to the White House, Trump began the withdrawal process again, while kicking off damaging global trade turmoil through the imposition of swingeing tariffs.

Though Trump’s first withdrawal did not create the “snowball” effect some had feared – no other functioning country has left since – he may also bear partial responsibility for another blow: after 2016, China vastly speeded up its rate of carbon dioxide output.

When Xi Jinping travelled to Paris in November 2015, and for a short time after, emissions from the world’s second biggest economy looked to be peaking at just under 10bn tonnes per year.

But in 2017, that dream was dashed. Coal-fired power took off again, and China’s carbon output resumed its upward march, at an accelerated pace, reaching 12.3bn tonnes last year.

Beijing economic thinking is opaque and there are still differing conclusions about what caused the spike. Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, believes the government was seeking to shore up economic growth by traditional means: “It was the real estate market, it was buildings, steel, cement. It’s different now,” he said.

But Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, warns of the damage China’s actions did to arguments for climate action in the US: “In the immediate aftermath of Paris, China began the biggest building spree of coal-fired power plants in history. They went on a coal binge, and the rest of us just had to hope it would subside. It made everyone cynical.”

Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, discerns the hand of Trump in the rise in emissions from 2017. He argued it was “partially a reversal of [China’s] overall economic policy, then it was a response to Trump’s tariffs, then redoubling on using real estate as a growth driver”.

Roughly 90% of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions since the Paris agreement has come from China. And yet those emissions tell only half the story. Last year, China added more renewable energy than the rest of the world combined, and clean energy made up 10% of the country’s GDP, with similar figures likely this year. China’s manufacturing strength has sent the price of solar panels plunging by about 90% in the last decade.

It is true that China may yet return to coal, but Wang Yi, a senior adviser to the Chinese government, said at Cop30 last month that Xi Jinping was committed to clean energy for the long term. “The central government, including President Xi, is very clear to us that we must, in the next five years, speed up the new power system,” Wang said.

If the world should manage to cling to the 1.5C limit – which is still possible, according to Hare, if the current overshoot is swiftly remedied, then China will deserve a large slice of the credit.

And where China leads, India has followed. The country’s carbon emissions outstrip Europe’s, and it could overtake the US in a decade to become the world’s second biggest emitter after China.

But half of India’s installed power generation capacity is now low-carbon, and the country met its target on renewable energy five years ahead of time. Wind and particularly solar are set to grow even faster this year, but coal production has also surged.

Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water thinktank, said the country is headed for a clean future: “India is now planning for a grid that can absorb much larger volumes of renewable energy. This is transformative. All the building blocks are there.”

The Paris agreement, in which countries agreed to limit global temperature rises to “well below 2C” above preindustrial levels while “pursuing efforts” to stay within 1.5C, was possible only because of the determined efforts of a global alliance in which some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries made common cause with some of the richest and most polluting.

The High Ambition Coalition, spearheaded by the charismatic Marshall Islands diplomat Tony de Brum, brought more than 100 countries together and drove the final months of work.

But many observers are worried about a fracture between developed and developing countries that has appeared to widen at recent Cop summits. Poorer countries were shocked by the global north’s tardiness in sharing vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, but they supported moves at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021 to reinforce the 1.5C goal.

They hoped the rich countries would reciprocate the next year with help for the loss and damage fund – money that goes to the rescue and rehabilitation of communities stricken by climate disaster – but only achieved that with a struggle.

Then, last year, at Cop29 in Azerbaijan, rich nations provoked fury from the global south when they refused until the final hours to put numbers on their contribution to the $1.3tn a year promised in climate finance by 2035, and tried to feint at first with a lower sum than the $300bn finally agreed.

Evans Njewa, chair of the UN’s Least Developed Countries grouping, reminds rich countries that providing financial assistance is an obligation, rather than an option. “We expect that these commitments will set into real, sustained financial flows,” he said.

“Climate finance to us is not charity. It is a legal obligation, so it must be mobilised and be provided to us. It is the only means of a global response to this global crisis.”

At the most recent climate summit, poorer countries did achieve the tripling of finance for adaptation, to $120bn a year, though it will not be fully realised until 2035, rather than the 2030 deadline they preferred.

That could go some way to rebuilding trust, but one participant in the talks told the Guardian that poor and vulnerable countries “do not want to be taken for granted”, and would need further evidence of rich countries’ solidarity.

If Paris is to survive, the rich countries will need to do more to fulfil their promises and heal the rift. They will also need to lead on the roadmaps to phase out oil and gas stemming from a voluntary agreement made at Cop30.

That is likely to mean working with petro states – such as the United Arab Emirates, under whose Cop28 presidency in 2023 the promise to “transition away from fossil fuels” was originally made – rather than shunning them.

Meanwhile, the biggest developing economies must show that renewable energy can substitute for fossil fuels, rather than being additional to them, and can bring down carbon rapidly, rather than simply subduing its rate of increase.

All of these efforts will face outright hostility and possibly attempted sabotage by the US.

Though Trump sent no delegation to Cop30, his officials played an extraordinary role at the International Maritime Organisation negotiations on a potential carbon levy in October. Developing country delegates were plagued with intimidatory emails and phone calls from the US state department, threatening visa revocations and economic sanctions. Countries are now braced for what US tactics may come next.

For Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, today’s changed geopolitics presents the biggest threat to the Paris consensus. “Climate change negotiations do not take place in a vacuum. They reflect the increasingly multipolar world we live in,” she said.

“Unlike some other multilateral processes, though, we continue to make progress against all odds. That this progress is incremental and not in line with needs on the ground is obviously extremely frustrating. [But] we are prepared to continue to work with all partners to secure a viable future for our people.”

For large as well as small countries, she adds, multilateral cooperation on the climate is the best hope, as “We do not have the option to go it alone.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eac5d782849c5423f24be7ca6faf74af4e577f1/312_0_2876_2301/master/2876.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d88345f06d7dcd4a651bf4bd4f1c40ec",N,,2025-12-13 12:59:59.595261

While China has enjoyed manufacturing dominance and India has many solar panels to boast, the Asian giant that has been awoken is neither China nor India. By 2026, five million solar panels will span fields in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan and reshape the entire clean energy sphere.

A significant leap by the “sleeping giant” in Asia

This MTerra development has been labelled as perhaps the largest integrated solar-and-storage installation in the world. This solar and storage project has received backing from Meralco PowerGen and SPNEC and enjoys a $600 million investment from the global infrastructure leader, Actis.

As per the project’s vision, 3,500 MW of installed solar capacity will be supported by 4,500 MWh of battery storage. Although the figures are rather ambitious, the construction has shown rather impressive results already. With 778 MW of operational solar panels already in this Asian country, we are only given a glimpse of what can be expected next.

The project expands beyond clean power generation. Since this Asian country charges some of the highest electricity prices in Asia, a successful project would mean cleaner energy for all and energy that is more affordable. Furthermore, the transition to cleaner power would mean far less reliance on fossil fuels throughout the country.

2026, a rather significant turning point for the MTerra development

The Energy Regulatory Commission recently approved the ₱14.25-billion transmission network, and thus far, high voltage lines are 80% complete. The good news is that in 2026, the project’s core phase will go online. The initial phase is meant to put hundreds of megawatts into the Luzon grid. This project’s full output is scheduled for 2031 and 2040, causing this Asian country to benefit from the project much earlier than expected.

Once activated, the 2026 phase will be responsible for adding daytime generation and will also work towards stabilizing the grid at times of peak demand. For this country, this is a major leap forward, as it is a country known for its brownouts.

Which Asian country is making economic and environmental leaps?

The solar farm will provide power to over 2.4 million households in the Philippines. For many citizens, this will considerably reduce the financial burden of high electricity prices on many Filipino families. The solar output will severely undercut the fossil fuel generation.

With full operation underway, more than four million tons of CO₂ are emitted annually. The reduction in CO₂ emissions would mean that emissions from three million cars would be reduced. The economic benefit is that MTerra has already created more than 9,500 jobs and has created numerous training programs like the TERRAnsform. In the next 10 years, more than ₱23 billion for local economies will be generated.

Rather significant leaps can be found occurring in China as well, with China aligning 6,000,000 solar panels, resulting in megafarms that stretch offshore. While China’s major solar advancements are rather noteworthy, the clean energy development in the Philippines is rather inspirational as well.

The Sleeping Asian giant has woken up

Looking forward to the MTerra 2026 major milestone and the second phase in 2027, this country has shown that it can overcome infrastructural challenges to execute renewable projects on a global scale. With five million panels being aligned, this signifies a major technical achievement. The Philippines is a country proving that sustainable power can come from almost any Asian country.

The U.S. Senate held a couple of votes on Thursday but did not renew them. So it may be that on January 1, the program will return to the original Obamacare subsidies.

Democrats are portraying the imminent return of original Obamacare as a Republican effort to destroy healthcare. They have finally admitted that the Affordable Care Act is a dismal failure.

The original program that’s about to return used tax dollars to subsidize health insurance policies for people who earned up to 400% of the federal poverty level, capping their premiums at between 2% and 9.96% of their income. But the money wasn’t sent to the policyholder. It was sent straight to the insurance companies after the Internal Revenue Service administered a complicated system of “advance premium tax credits” based on an income projection. Later, the taxpayer would have to settle up with the IRS based on actual income, either receiving a higher subsidy or paying some of it back.

Soon after President Joe Biden took office he signed the American Rescue Plan, which temporarily increased the Obamacare premium subsidies and removed the income cap of 400% of the federal poverty level. Then in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act extended these enhanced subsidies to the end of this year.

Democrats have been frantically trying to coerce Republicans into extending the expiring subsidies, even insisting, unsuccessfully, on renewal of the subsidies as a condition for ending the recent government shutdown. So far, Republican leaders in Congress have held firm, ready to allow the enhanced subsidies, which were always supposed to be temporary, to finally end.

This appears to be a fight about fraud, and whether it will be exposed in January or stay hidden for another year or more.

If there’s one thing we’ve learned about Team Biden, it’s that fraud didn’t bother them.

For example, in August 2022, the Biden Treasury Department informed the Office of Management and Budget that the IRS would not be permitted to estimate, report or address “improper payments” in four COVID relief programs: Economic Impact Payments, Recovery Rebate Credits, Sick and Family Leave Credit and Employee Retention Credit.

“Due to the short-term nature of pandemic-related programs, estimating the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources,” the Biden team told the IRS, according to a report released in May by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, also known as TIGTA.

The IRS was still required by law to evaluate these programs’ risk of improper payments. It found them to be “susceptible.”

Estimating and reporting improper payments in certain tax credit programs is something the IRS does every year at the direction of Congress. TIGTA checks in to see whether the agency has reached the goal of reducing improper payments to below 10 percent. They haven’t.

Improper payments are defined by the 2019 Payment Integrity Information Act as “any payment that should not have been made, was made in an incorrect amount, or was made to an ineligible recipient.” The problem was not new in 2019. Similar laws seeking to stop improper payments were enacted in 2016, 2013, 2010 and 2002.

None of them solved the problem. In fiscal year 2024, the Earned Income Tax Credit alone was the source of improper payments totaling $15.9 billion. Overall, the IRS found $21.6 billion in improper payments in fiscal year 2024, spread over the four “high-risk” tax credit programs they regularly examine.

One of those programs is the Obamacare subsidy. Its formal name is the Net Premium Tax Credit, or PTC. The IRS found that in fiscal year 2024, the “improper payment” rate for the PTC was 28.5%.

The enhanced subsidies for Obamacare were made especially vulnerable to fraud. The Biden team considered document-based verification to be a barrier to coverage. The government required only self-attested projected income. There was supposed to be a settle-up of the correct subsidy amount the following year, but the penalties for failing to reconcile the subsidy with actual income were suspended.

By effectively eliminating any enforcement of income accuracy and “streamlining” away documentation requirements, the Biden administration opened the door to massive fraud. Not only could individuals understate their income to receive larger subsidies, shady brokers could sign people up for coverage without their knowledge, or even enroll fictional people in Obamacare policies. This would generate commissions for the brokers and profits for the insurers, who received government payments for the premiums for these policies but never had to pay any claims on them.

A recent study by the Paragon Health Institute, a think tank founded in 2021 by a former Trump administration official, cited data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services showing that the number of enrollees who didn’t use their benefits at all tripled between 2021 and 2024 to reach 11.7 million.

Paragon’s researchers estimated that “improper enrollment” jumped from 5 million in 2024 to 6.4 million in 2025, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $27 billion this year alone.

It didn’t help that the Biden administration allowed the auto-renewal of coverage without annual verification of income eligibility. In 2025, nearly 11 million Obamacare enrollees were automatically re-enrolled.

Freed from the “barriers” of documentation, enrollment soared. Before the enhanced subsidies began in 2021, there were about 12 million people enrolled in coverage from the Affordable Care Act marketplace. This year, it’s 24 million. But how many are real?

The Department of Health and Human Services tried in August to implement a new “Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Rule” to fight fraud. It was immediately challenged in court, postponing enforcement.

Fraud in government programs has plenty of bodyguards.

The challenge is to tell stories that are honest about the scale of the crisis while remaining faithful to evidence about what works.","For a movement so often framed by loss—and confronting a particularly difficult moment—conservation is relearning how to talk about itself. This shift may signal something deeper than messaging: a recalibration of what persuades people to care, to fund, and to act, especially as the world edges toward 2030 amid ecological strain, political volatility, and thinning public trust.

A few months ago, I put out an invitation to the conservation sector: share how you are navigating this moment, which many have described as a period of crisis. That invitation resurfaced on Friday when Crystal DiMiceli referenced it during a fireside chat at the Emerging Leaders in Wildlife Conservation 20th anniversary event in Washington, D.C.

DiMiceli asked what lessons are emerging so far. One of the most consistent responses has centered on communication: “Less crisis, more agency.”

Not because the crisis has abated, but because alarm on its own no longer mobilizes as reliably as it once did. If anything, it exhausts. Years of grim headlines have revealed an uncomfortable truth: when people are offered only catastrophe, many disengage. They stop reading, stop caring, and, in some cases, stop believing that anything meaningful can still be done.

What seems to be gaining ground instead is a focus on success—often partial, sometimes fragile, but demonstrable. Not triumphalism, but optimism grounded in evidence. Conservation framed as something people actively do, rather than something that merely happens—or fails to happen—to nature.

This reframing has another effect: it broadens the constituency. When conservation is presented solely as the protection of pristine places or distant species, it can feel remote, even exclusionary. When it is tied to livelihoods, rights, health, and local resilience, it becomes more immediate and more widely owned.

That shift necessarily includes Indigenous peoples and local communities, long treated as stakeholders and only belatedly recognized as rights-holders and decision-makers. Initiatives that scale tend to share a simple, if demanding, feature: genuine local buy-in. Not consultation after the fact, but ownership from the outset. Programs designed externally may pilot well; they are far less likely to replicate. Those rooted in place often spread precisely because they are not generic.

Scale, in this sense, is not synonymous with size. It more often emerges from accumulation: many small successes, repeated and adapted. The idea sounds modest, but it reflects how change actually travels. Replication depends less on grand design than on transparency, data, and narrative clarity. Successful programs can point to visible benefits—more fish on the reef, steadier incomes, safer water—and explain how those outcomes were achieved. They show their work: documenting evidence, acknowledging failures, and describing what was adjusted along the way. That openness builds credibility locally and makes the work easier for outsiders—like funders, partners, and peers—to understand and adapt.

The importance of diversified funding has surfaced repeatedly as well. Conservation efforts tethered to a single donor, funding stream, or a specific political moment tend to be brittle. Initiatives supported by a mix of philanthropy, public finance, community enterprise, and earned income are more likely to absorb shocks. In an increasingly volatile funding environment, that diversity functions less as a luxury than as a form of resilience.

The next five years will test whether the sector can meaningfully internalize these lessons. Integrating people and nature is no longer rhetorical garnish; it increasingly shapes whether conservation efforts are seen as legitimate or extractive. Rebuilding trust through transparency may, in some contexts, matter as much as the number of hectares protected. Narratives are beginning to shift toward agency, though doing so without drifting into fantasy will require discipline. Technology, deployed with care, can help—by lowering monitoring costs, improving access to data, and linking local efforts to wider audiences. Rights and environmental justice will shape outcomes regardless of whether they are explicitly acknowledged. Treating them as secondary concerns is not a neutral stance; it carries consequences that are often both predictable and expensive.

One model that illustrates how these threads can come together is Health in Harmony’s “health for forests” approach in Borneo. Rather than asking communities to stop logging because forests matter globally—an argument that can feel abstract or even alien—the organization begins with a more proximate question: What do you need? Frequently, the answer is access to affordable, reliable health care.

Health in Harmony responds by providing tiered health services, sometimes at no cost, in indirect exchange for verifiable conservation actions such as monitoring forest boundaries or restoring degraded land. What emerges is not a transaction so much as a shift in how the forest is perceived. It is no longer framed as a global asset preserved at local expense, but as integral to community health, security, and dignity. Crucially, the conservation solutions themselves are developed by the community, ensuring genuine ownership rather than compliance. The model aligns environmental outcomes with immediate human well-being—a linkage that feels increasingly central as conservation looks toward 2030.

In this context, the parallels with journalism are hard to miss. Journalism’s role can appear almost old-fashioned: to check abuses of power, inform the public, and offer ideas that expand what people consider possible. Yet the conditions under which it operates may be harsher. Disinformation spreads faster than corrections. Resources are shrinking across much of the media landscape. Civic space is narrowing in many places where environmental stakes are highest.

Still, journalism remains a public good that underpins nearly every other intervention, in conservation and beyond. Without credible information, policies misfire, markets distort, and communities are sidelined. Accountability begins with facts that can be trusted. So, often, does hope.

At Mongabay, our response has been to move closer to the ground: establishing autonomous local bureaus, expanding multilingual reporting, and deepening partnerships with local journalists. We have tried to pair investigative reporting with solutions coverage—on the premise that exposing wrongdoing matters, but so does documenting what works. Not as advocacy, and certainly not as cheerleading, but as evidence. Tracking how information is used—who it reaches, how it circulates, and what it influences—adds another layer of accountability.

This thinking sits behind a phrase that can sound suspect until unpacked: “optimism is a strategy.” It is not blind positivity. It is deliberate. A form of realism that recognizes despair as paralyzing and treats hope, when grounded in evidence, as a catalyst for action. Hope untethered from facts quickly curdles. But when anchored in proof, it sustains effort. Jane Goodall has long articulated this idea, often describing her role as that of a messenger of hope.

There is no shortage of examples. Mountain gorillas have recovered against the odds. Black-footed ferrets, kākāpō, and saiga antelopes have returned with sustained conservation effort. Entire island ecosystems have rebounded following the removal of invasive species. Forest loss has slowed in places once written off entirely. These stories are not just moving; they are instructional. They offer concrete lessons about what made recovery possible and how similar conditions might be recreated elsewhere.

Telling these stories has become a more intentional part of journalism’s contribution. I was told more than once that Mongabay was among the most depressing sites on the internet, chronicling species loss, forest destruction, and the rising toll of environmental defenders killed for their work. The description stung because it was not entirely wrong. So we made a conscious decision to expand our solutions reporting—not to dilute the gravity of the crisis, but to pair it with verified accounts of progress. Not ignoring what is broken, but insisting on documenting what is being repaired, and how.

That effort has taken shape through series on Indigenous-led conservation, conservation technology, agroecology and regenerative landscapes, and women at the forefront of community conservation, among others.

This evolution has coincided with another trend: news avoidance. Research from the Reuters Institute suggests a growing share of people – about 40% on average – actively tune out the news. The reasons vary, but two categories of reporting consistently retain their attention: solutions-focused stories and positive news. That finding loops back to the same insight emerging in conservation conversations—agency matters, even for engagement.

Narrative, in the end, is not incidental. Facts alone rarely move people. Stories do. The challenge is to tell stories that are honest about the scale of the crisis while remaining faithful to evidence about what works. If people conclude that nothing can be done, they will not try. If they see that effort yields results, even incremental ones, they are more likely to stay engaged. Optimism, in that sense, is an antidote to paralysis.

What sustains my own optimism? Mostly evidence. People doing extraordinary things with modest resources. Recovery demonstrated rather than promised. Enough is now known that ignorance is no longer a plausible excuse. A constituency for conservation that is widening—slowly, unevenly, but perceptibly. And time spent in nature itself, a reminder of both what is at stake and what still endures.

That impulse is also why I’ve been writing more tributes to those we’ve lost: people who quietly carried conservation forward, often without recognition or institutional backing. Their passing is a loss, but the purpose of remembering them is not elegy alone—it is to show what one person can do, and to leave readers not only saddened, but asking a simple, generative question: what might I carry forward?

Hope, grounded in evidence, is not a mood. It is a method. In conservation, as elsewhere, it is increasingly clear that lasting change depends on it.",https://www.butlernature.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/04-brunei_251115216942_0235z-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 15:00:10.004090

The market, not the courtroom, should decide America’s energy future.","A quiet but important shift is taking place in conservative energy policy. Across the center-right, a growing number of U.S. policymakers, business leaders, and investors are returning to classical principles — recognizing that markets, not government intervention, are the best way to secure America’s energy future.That’s what makes Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s lawsuit against major asset managers so misguided. The lawsuit accuses firms like BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard of conspiring to limit investment in coal. But what’s really being challenged is the freedom of investors to make market-based decisions about risk, technology and opportunity. Paxton isn’t fighting overreach. He’s fighting capitalism itself. For generations, conservatives have argued that free enterprise and limited government produce better outcomes than top-down control. In the 2010s, the American Tea Party movement rose by explicitly campaigning against big-government mandates — from Common Core to the Affordable Care Act to Wall Street bailouts. Whether you agree with the movement or not, Paxton’s effort flips that logic on its head, substituting the judgment of politicians for that of investors and consumers. Using the power of the state to punish private firms as Texas and other states are trying to do for assessing market realities undermines the very principles of free enterprise conservatives have long defended.Conservatives across the country are speaking up. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who served as President Trump’s Energy Secretary, has called Paxton’s lawsuit “misguided,” warning that it will undermine President Trump’s energy agenda. He’s right. The reality is that investors are responding to economics, not ideology. Renewable energy, like wind and solar, have become more competitive and cost-effective. It is why investment in clean energy globally is expected to top $2.2 trillion by the end of the year. Emerging technologies are gaining traction. Markets reward efficiency and innovation, and they penalize waste and stagnation. When the government steps in to dictate how capital should be deployed, it distorts these signals and increases costs for everyone.If the goal is to strengthen America’s energy leadership, the path forward isn’t litigation, it’s certainty. China is moving full speed ahead to dominate global clean energy manufacturing and electric vehicles. Investors, utilities, companies, and developers need stable policy and predictable rules to plan decades-long projects. Permitting reform, consistent tax policy, and clear regulatory standards will do far more to unleash American energy investment than courtroom battles waged by politicians with a vendetta.Investment is already flowing. Across the country clean energy projects are expanding, many of them in Republican-represented districts. These projects aren’t ideological. They’re about job creation, reliable power, and economic competitiveness. As demand for electricity grows — driven by data centers, electric vehicles, and industrial production — the United States must bring more generation onto the grid. Every credible forecast shows that we will need more energy sources to meet that demand.This is where conservatives have a clear advantage. A market-driven energy agenda doesn’t require choosing between fossil fuels and renewables. It simply requires letting competition decide which technologies deliver the most affordable, reliable, and secure energy. That approach aligns perfectly with conservative values: economic freedom, property rights, and limited government.The language conservatives use also matters. Energy security, reliability, and economic growth are the winning arguments. Last month, I joined a group of former Republican members of Congress to push this message home: American competitiveness depends on abundant, affordable energy. If we fail to provide it, electricity prices will rise for everyone, industries will leave, and our geopolitical strength will weaken. The choice before conservatives is straightforward. We can embrace a forward-looking, pro-market energy strategy that builds on our strengths — or we can drift toward using government power to pick winners and punish others because of politics. The former leads to innovation and growth. The latter leads to stagnation and uncertainty.Conservatives built their legacy by trusting markets, empowering entrepreneurs, and limiting government interference.

The five-seat interior has more space than a Toyota Tacoma cab, and Telo has a more efficient battery and lower price than most electric trucks on the market. The only thing it’s missing is a front: If Telo were a dog, it’d be a snub-nosed pug.

“From a design standpoint, you really need to create iconography,” Béhar said. “My inspiration is always what people need — the idiosyncrasies of modern life.”

With financing from local tech titans Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Tesla cofounder Marc Tarpenning, Telo positions its debut truck as a small yet mighty alternative to electric pickups from Rivian, Tesla, and Ford.

“When you see the car, you can’t help but react in some way,” Tarpenning wrote in a blog post last year, comparing Telo’s rise to that of Tesla, though with far less time, money, and manpower.

But with the EV market colder than an expired lithium battery, Béhar and his team face a precarious time in the industry. We visited Béhar’s design studio to see why he thinks he can make Americans fall in love with small, idiosyncratic electric trucks at a time when they seem to want everything bigger.

‘I want the truck now’

Three engineers were on their hands and knees, combing over the epoxy floor of Fuseprojects, Béhar’s design firm in the Potrero Flats, searching for a screw that belonged to a motherboard they were tinkering with moments earlier. Dressed in sweatpants and with hay-colored, unkempt hair, Béhar strode beside them to shake my hand.

Charming and a bit of a dude, Béhar grew up in Lausserne, Switzerland in a multicultural home with a German mother and a Turkish Jewish father. Though they visited museums and archeological sites across Europe, where Behar was exposed to different cultures, design was not something he learned about at home. Rather, his design sensibilities were shaped largely by two industrial-era movements: the American modernists Charles and Ray Eames and the Italian modernists the future-forward experimentalists like the Italian visionaries such as Joe Colombo and Achille Castiglioni, celebrated for their future-oriented experiments with how people live and interact., and the American modernists Charles and Ray Eames.

After moving to California in the late 1980s and graduating from ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, Béhar went on to create products and companies that helped shape the look and feel of contemporary technology — often with a built-in ethos of sustainability. He would go on to implement his passion for the Eames’ in his Herman Miller Sayl chair, now a fixture of modern workplaces., His and OLPC XO laptop, a Y2K-era device designed to make computers—and thus education — more accessible to low-income students, incorporated mapping the Italians’ idea that objects could be instruments for new ways of living. (The laptop is one of several Béhar-designed pieces in SFMOMA’s permanent collection.)

“I believe in humanistic technologies,” he said. “It’s important for us to show not just where tech can go but should go, because I’m a little puzzled by what some of these tech companies are doing.”

Behar lives in Cow Hollow with his wife, art dealer Sabrina Buell, daughter of Democratic Party mega-donors and San Francisco socialites Susie Thompkins Buell and Mark Buell. Behar and his wife also share a home in Bolinas, beside a large cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

“We have never been fazed by the elements,” Buell told The Nob Hill Gazette in 2018 after she and Behar got married on the alkali floor of Burning Man’s playa.

At Fuseprojects, products and design awards are plopped around the foyer. Among these is a cardboard model of the Mission motorcycle, an electric two-wheeler that Béhar and Forrest North, Telo’s chief technology officer, worked on in 2008. It set the land-speed record for electric two-wheelers at the time, reaching 150 mph, but the company folded after years of financial strain, infighting, and the loss of key engineers to Apple (opens in new tab).

In 2022, Béhar and North got together again, this time with Jason Marks, now CEO of Telo, around the idea of making another electric vehicle. They figured they’d try another motorcycle, North said.

“We kept showing the slide to people that showed the motorcycle, a small car, then a small truck, with the whole idea of mobility for the city,” North said. “Every time they would say, ‘Oh, I want the truck now.’”

The group listened, founding Telo in 2022 with the goal of delivering a tiny, electric truck.

A difficult time to come to market

When Telo was founded, the EV market was flying high. While gas-powered car sales plummeted during the pandemic, EV sales skyrocketed at a rapid clip, thanks in large part to the momentous success of Tesla, government incentive programs, and an expansion of charging infrastructure.

In 2021, President Joe Biden clambered into a hulking Ford F-150 Lightning in Dearborn, Michigan. “Anyone want to jump in the back or on the roof?” Biden asked reporters. “These suckers are something else!”

That year, global sales for EVs hit a high point, surging more than 160% from 2020 to roughly 6.5 million vehicles — leading Ford, General Motors, and others to announce that they would phase out gas-powered cars in the coming decades.

But that was then. In the years since, the market has cooled. The cost of EVs continues to rise. President Donald Trump nixed federal credits that offered up to $7,500 in tax breaks for EV buyers. And the AI boom has vacuumed nearly all available funds for startups, making it a difficult time to raise money for hardware.

Ford is reportedly considering halting production (opens in new tab) of the F-150 Lightning, its flagship EV, which Biden so enjoyed.

Still, plenty of people want EVs. “At the end of the day, it’s an affordability issue, not a demand issue,” said Stephanie Valdez, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. “There’s a market [for Telo], but there’s a lot of headwinds.”

Telo isn’t the only tiny electric truck on the horizon. Slate Auto, which has backing from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, made waves this year when it announced an electric truck with a $20,000 price tag. Telo’s truck is priced at $41,000, still well below the roughly $60,000 for EV cars and for conventional trucks. Its 350-mile range is exceptional for an electric pickup, and its positioning as a city-friendly vehicle could prove compelling for urban drivers.

Many high-profile San Franciscans are have shown interest. Last week, Béhar’s friend Mayor Daniel Lurie arrived at Fuseprojects to test-drive the Telo. Lurie climbed into the driver’s seat, his hulking security guard fitting in the back, while the designer hopped up front. The crew sped off up Potrero Hill.

Political stunts, it seems, might not be disappearing from the EV marketing playbook anytime soon.

Testing it out

While Béhar’s design team works out of Portrero, Telo is headquartered in a small building in the dusty end of San Carlos, a Peninsula town that has become a breeding ground for EV technology. Across the street is the flying car company Joby, and next door is a former Tesla office where North worked 20 years ago on the frontier of electric vehicles.

It was there that I got to take one of the tiny trucks for a test drive. The first thing I noticed was that despite being 6-foot-2, I had ample space. Telo handled with the responsiveness of the average EV and had a surprisingly sharp turning radius for a truck. When I pulled out of the parking lot, I pushed the pedal to the floor to test the 0-60 capability. Four seconds might not beat a Tesla, but it’s faster than most EVs and was enough to turn my stomach upside down.

As North and I zoomed through the cookie-cutter suburb of San Carlos, electric and gas-powered trucks towered over us. We paused next to a 20-foot-long, 8,500-pound green Rivian, and North scoffed that this was all the auto industry had to offer.

For people who want something smaller, “that’s where we come in,” North said.

Telo considers itself at the vanguard of the third generation of electric vehicles. The first wave was the hybrid era ushered in by the Toyota Priuses in the early 2000s; the second was dominated by Tesla and Rivian; the third, Béhar argues, begins with companies like Telo and Slate, where design is freed from the old constraints of industry-standard EVs.

“In many ways, the designs of the previous generations of EVs are more conventional, because they followed industry standards,” Béhar said. The new generation, he added, lets designers break them.

There is still plenty of engineering work ahead before Telo hits full production. In September, Telo secured a $20 million Series A investment — modest by industrial automotive standards, but notable in a slowing EV market. Thirteen thousand pre-orders suggest at least a sliver of pent-up demand for a truck that doesn’t require its own ZIP Code.

Earlier this year, as Mini Cooper unveiled its latest two-door model, something unexpected happened: The Mini got bigger.

Béhar, back at Fuseprojects, considered that development. In a moment that could read as quiet pride in his tiny outlier of a truck, he raised his eyebrows and let a slow grin spread across his face.

“They actually made it bigger,” he said. “The new Mini — it’s 1 inch longer than us.”",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_qo5523ipbp3cj7432l5ld2re2d/-C100.00%25x78.71%25%2C0.00%25%2C0.00%25-FWEBP,N,,2025-12-13 11:02:29.047097

According to a report from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, California’s cap-and-trade program is one of the largest cap-and-trade projects in the world.
Five billion dollars has been generated since the Golden State launched the cap-and-trade program in 2012.
More than $453.5 million went to grants that pay for transportation projects close to schools, workplaces and other common destinations, the governor’s office said.
Officials with the California Environmental Protection Agency, the California State Transportation Agency, the California Transportation Commission, the California Department of Transportation and the California Housing Finance Agency were not available or declined to answer questions on Friday.","(The Center Square) - Republican legislators pushed back against California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s announcement that almost $865 million acquired from some of the state’s biggest emitters will pay for affordable housing and clean transportation projects, among other efforts funded by the state’s cap-and-trade program.

“We saw that in 2022, wildfires erased nearly 20 years of emission progress,” Assemblymember Tom Lackey, R-Palmdale and a member of the Assembly Transportation Committee, told The Center Square. “I’m a bit frustrated by that, and unfortunately, the administration still has no comprehensive wildfire prevention strategy. I think it’s a little bit disingenuous to brag about climate leadership while doing so little to stop the biggest source of our pollution and devastation - the wildfires.”

State Sen. Meghan Dahle, R-Redding, and a member of the Senate Transportation Committee, added that while she sees good housing projects being developed by the state’s cap-and-trade program, especially in rural communities, she also sees cap-and-trade increasing living expenses for most Californians.

“I am also very mindful that the cap-and-trade program is a tax on energy that drives up the cost of fuel for California drivers, who pay the highest pump prices in the nation to drive to work,” Dahle told The Center Square. “I recognize the good work being done, but we can’t tax our way out of the cost-of-living crisis in California.”

Six Democratic legislators, including the chairs of the transportation committees in the Assembly and Senate, were not available to speak to The Center Square on Friday. Five Republican legislators who are members of each chamber's transportation or housing committee were also not available to comment.

According to a press release sent out by Newsom’s office, the projects that will get portions of the cap-and-trade money include an expansion of public transit. Other projects include building affordable housing and rebuilding infrastructure damaged in this year’s wildfires, among other efforts. Projects also include buying 30 new zero-emission public transit vehicles, construction of 150 bus shelters, and the creation of 45 miles of bikeways and 20 miles of walkways, the governor’s office said.

The cap-and-trade program requires big emitters to buy “allowances” for the greenhouse gases they emit, the governor’s office said, generating billions of dollars in funding over the years that go into projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In all, 39 affordable housing projects in 21 communities across the state will get some of this money and major sustainable transportation upgrades, the governor’s office said.

According to a report from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, California’s cap-and-trade program is one of the largest cap-and-trade projects in the world. The program is a big part of the state meeting its greenhouse gas emission goals. Five billion dollars has been generated since the Golden State launched the cap-and-trade program in 2012. A database from the International Carbon Action Partnership identifies agriculture, forestry fuel use, mining and extractives, transport, buildings and power as the economic sectors or industries that are included in the program.

Lindsay Buckley, the communications director for the California Air Resources Board, said the money comes from the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is financed by the state’s cap-and-trade program. The program is more than a decade old and has generated more than $33 billion that have been re-invested into climate-related projects, like affordable housing and sustainable communities.

Companies that include oil refineries and food processing facilities are part of the program, Buckley told The Center Square on Friday. They are some of the companies that are considered what Newsom called “the biggest polluters” in the state.

“We refer to them as just the state’s biggest emitters, and literally, on paper, they are the ones that emit the most greenhouse gas emissions in the state,” Buckley said.

More than $453.5 million went to grants that pay for transportation projects close to schools, workplaces and other common destinations, the governor’s office said. An additional $185.6 million will go to rebuilding infrastructure in Los Angeles after the damage of this year's wildfires.

“The funding puts billions of dollars to work reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening the economy, and improving public health and the environment -- especially in disadvantaged communities,” said Kalin Kipling-Mojaddedi, communications lead for the Governor’s Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation.

“California is using California Climate Investment funds to protect health, stability, and opportunity across the state,"" Kipling-Mojaddedi wrote The Center Square in an email Friday.

Wetlands act as natural storm-surge buffers, slow the flow of floodwaters, filter pollution and provide crucial habitat for fisheries.","A proposed federal rule could dramatically reduce the number of wetlands in Louisiana that qualify for protection under the Clean Water Act, a move that could expose millions of acres to development.

Under the proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to waters that are “relatively permanent” — meaning they hold water year-round or with only brief interruptions — would remain federally protected. Wetlands that are seasonal, intermittent or connected only after storms would likely fall outside federal jurisdiction.

The change is intended to conform with the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, which sharply restricted how wetlands can be regulated. But the new proposed rule, issued last month, goes further by removing several longstanding categories of protected water, like interstate waters, and by formally defining terms that are likely to make federal oversight even narrower.

“This rule would turn the Clean Water Act on its head,” said Mark Davis, the director of Tulane University’s Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy.

A report from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy nonprofit, estimates that up to 3.9 million acres of Louisiana wetlands — roughly half of the state’s remaining wetlands — could lose protection under the proposed rule. Nationally, the group projects that as much as 84% of wetlands protected prior to the Sackett ruling, or 55 million acres, could fall outside federal authority.

Since the 1930s, Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of wetlands.

The EPA, led by Administrator Lee Zeldin, said the proposal is designed to provide legal clarity by defining a “Water of the United States,” or area protected under the Clean Water Act.

“Democrat Administrations have weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families,” Zeldin said in a statement. “No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.”

Where in Louisiana will wetlands lose protection?

A map produced by NRDC from federal data illustrates the potential impact in Louisiana. Coastal wetlands that are continuously connected to the Gulf of Mexico are likely to remain protected. But inland wetlands — including wetlands areas in parishes such as Avoyelles, Concordia and St. Tammany — could lose federal safeguards.

Other parts of the state, including deep marshes in lower Terrebonne Parish and wetlands near the mouth of the Mississippi River, appear as gaps on the map because water there is considered sufficiently deep and permanent to retain federal protections. The map focuses on areas where protection status is likely up for debate.

Even so, the analysis is only an estimate. Determining whether a wetland is protected requires a site-specific assessment, which can be time-consuming and costly. That’s one reason the homebuilding and agricultural industries have pushed for a narrower federal rule.

“When the Clean Water Act passed, it was the best thing that ever happened. We needed it,” said Randall Noel, the president of Reve, Inc., a homebuilding company in Laplace, and a former president of the National Homebuilders Association, which supports the proposed rule. But in the years since it was first passed, Noel said the law’s scope has expanded past its original intent.

“A quarter of Americans can’t afford a house, in part due to the costs required for wetlands determinations at the beginning of a project,” he said. Noel pointed to a sugarcane field he hoped to build on that was initially classified as a wetland, a decision he disputed. He said the new rule would make the permitting process more predictable.

But environmental groups say the proposal would leave large portions of the state vulnerable. Wetlands act as natural storm-surge buffers, slow the flow of floodwaters, filter pollution and provide crucial habitat for fisheries. Those functions could be compromised if protections are lifted.

“It will reduce the number of streams, wetlands and other waters that the Clean Water Act protects from pollution and destruction,” said Matthew McKinzie, a senior director with the NRDC. “Even for those waters that remain technically protected, it will make it harder to enforce the law against illegal polluters.”

Davis argues that the rule’s lack of clarity means it could make permitting decisions more difficult. The agency says a wetland must be connected to a relatively permanent waterbody at least during the area’s wet season, though the rule does not define when that season occurs.

“What is the ‘wet season?’ Nobody knows,” Davis said. “For something that's supposed to eliminate confusion, it creates a lot of confusion.”

The EPA and Army Corps published the proposal on Nov. 17 and are accepting public comments through Jan. 5. After the comment period closes, the agencies will decide whether to finalize the rule, revise it further, or reopen it for additional review.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/9b/49b5624b-db6a-456d-a415-5d2d13c8b72e/673fd5915b6e6.image.jpg?crop=1977%2C1039%2C0%2C4&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-13 11:02:20.929272

The map focuses on areas where protection status is likely up for debate.

Even so, the analysis is only an estimate. Determining whether a wetland is protected requires a site-specific assessment, which can be time-consuming and costly. That’s one reason the homebuilding and agricultural industries have pushed for a narrower federal rule.

“When the Clean Water Act passed, it was the best thing that ever happened. We needed it,” said Randall Noel, the president of Reve, Inc., a homebuilding company in Laplace, and a former president of the National Homebuilders Association, which supports the proposed rule. But in the years since it was first passed, Noel said the law’s scope has expanded past its original intent.

“A quarter of Americans can’t afford a house, in part due to the costs required for wetlands determinations at the beginning of a project,” he said. Noel pointed to a sugarcane field he hoped to build on that was initially classified as a wetland, a decision he disputed. He said the new rule would make the permitting process more predictable.

But environmental groups say the proposal would leave large portions of the state vulnerable. Wetlands act as natural storm-surge buffers, slow the flow of floodwaters, filter pollution and provide crucial habitat for fisheries. Those functions could be compromised if protections are lifted.

“It will reduce the number of streams, wetlands and other waters that the Clean Water Act protects from pollution and destruction,” said Matthew McKinzie, a senior director with the NRDC. “Even for those waters that remain technically protected, it will make it harder to enforce the law against illegal polluters.”

Davis argues that the rule’s lack of clarity means it could make permitting decisions more difficult. The agency says a wetland must be connected to a relatively permanent waterbody at least during the area’s wet season, though the rule does not define when that season occurs.

“What is the ‘wet season?’ Nobody knows,” Davis said. “For something that's supposed to eliminate confusion, it creates a lot of confusion.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/shreveportbossieradvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/f4/bf4b125f-779f-55dd-89ea-abaec8d3ac0b/693c8d75a6407.image.jpg?crop=1977%2C1039%2C0%2C4&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-13 08:58:33.119652

Today, West Virginia produces about 15 GW of capacity generation.
For businesses, the state’s West Virginia Forward — a collaborative project between the state, West Virginia University and Marshall University on economic development strategies — reveals that rising electricity costs are already hurting competitiveness.
West Virginia businesses are focused on getting by, when they should be focused on growing operations.
West Virginia businesses don’t have that option.","The cold days of winter have barely set in, and electricity is already one of the biggest concerns in West Virginia. At kitchen tables, in campaign speeches, and at national energy forums, people are asking the same questions: How do we keep power affordable? reliable? All while demand grows?

At local hearings, residents are worried about rising bills. At economic-development meetings, leaders are debating how to power energy-hungry data centers. And just the other week in Charleston, energy experts at the West Virginia Energy Summit outlined a stark reality: demand is climbing, costs are rising, and staying competitive will require a new approach. A major focus of the Summit was Governor Patrick Morrisey’s “50 by 50” goal — a forward-thinking plan to generate 50 gigawatts (GW) of power capacity by 2050. Today, West Virginia produces about 15 GW of capacity generation. Meeting that target would mean unprecedented energy investment and could position the state to attract new industries and drive economic growth.

But as we consider how to meet that goal, we can’t ignore a hard truth: electricity in West Virginia is becoming too expensive for the businesses and families who rely on it.

And for utilities to build new power plants, energy users will only continue to see their bills rise to pay for those costs. For businesses, the state’s West Virginia Forward — a collaborative project between the state, West Virginia University and Marshall University on economic development strategies — reveals that rising electricity costs are already hurting competitiveness. Since 2008, the price percentage change for large energy user electricity rates has increased more than almost all other states:

Commercial businesses have risen by 92 percent — the second-fastest increase in the nation.

Industrial businesses are up 85 percent, also second worst in the country.

West Virginia businesses are focused on getting by, when they should be focused on growing operations.

While West Virginia’s energy costs surge, neighboring states — Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia — allow large commercial and industrial customers to procure their own electricity through a competitive wholesale market. This simple policy difference lets businesses shop for contracts and prices that fit their needs, potentially saving them millions in the process. The results are undeniable. A Cleveland State University study found that between 2019 and 2024, Ohio businesses using competitive procurement — instead of their local utility — saved $1.17 billion per year. That’s a billion-dollar proof point that choice lowers cost.

West Virginia businesses don’t have that option. They’re required to buy electricity at rates set by the utilities — no matter how high those rates climb. That rigidity is discouraging new companies from locating or expanding here. And many existing employers are struggling under the weight of rising power bills.

The problem could accelerate if utilities begin building new generation to meet the 50 by 50 goal. Constructing just one 700-megawatt natural gas plant could cost more than $800 million — and those costs are not paid by the utilities, but passed directly on to you, the ratepayer.

There’s a better way to meet growing energy needs, protect consumers, and make West Virginia more attractive for future business: allow the largest energy users to buy their own electricity.

A modernized wholesale shopping option simply gives large employers an additional tool to manage their energy needs. Utilities would continue serving the vast majority of West Virginia customers and still serve as the default option for large users. This approach doesn’t replace the existing structure — it complements it — giving major employers more flexibility and stability in planning their long-term energy costs.

Opening the market would also send a clear and constructive signal to independent power producers that West Virginia welcomes private investment in new generation.

Rather than relying solely on utility-built projects — and the ratepayer obligations that come with them — the state could tap billions in outside investment to supplement utility plans. Importantly, this structure shifts the financial risk of new generation away from households and small businesses and onto private developers, especially in the event that future demand does not materialize as projected. That’s a safeguard to protect the pockets of consumers.

Critically, none of this requires sacrificing oversight, reliability, or West Virginia’s longstanding commitment to a strong grid. Neighboring states have shown that competitive procurement and incumbent utilities can coexist successfully. The result is a system that accelerates investment, attracts new industry, and applies downward pressure on price — without compromising reliability.

West Virginia must stay competitive and prevent jobs from drifting to neighboring states. Give businesses confidence to invest, and put the Mountain State back in the running to attract new industries — and keep those that are already here. Letting large users manage their own power is a simple way to stay in the highly competitive fight; and just as important, help protect the pockets of Mountaineers.

Under the stipulated agreement, Georgia Power has pledged to use extra revenue from data centers to keep other customers' rates in check.
It's far from guaranteed customers' bills will shrink that much, if at all — a point PSC staff conceded during Wednesday's hearing.
In a statement, Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said the agreement will mean ""more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia's future.""
""This agreement gives Georgia Power everything they've asked for with very little in return for regular Georgians,"" he added.","Georgia Power and the Public Service Commission's staff unveiled a deal Wednesday that would allow the utility to add about 10,000 megawatts of power supplies in just five years, an unprecedented expansion that's mostly to serve data centers.

The agreement, known as a stipulation, is not final. I tstill must be approved by the five members of the PSC. But in other cases in which stipulations were reached, the commission has stuck closely to the agreement, so the deal is likely a preview of what the PSC will approve.

The deal calls for all 9,885 megawatts of new power plants and other generation resources Georgia Power was seeking to be ""certified,"" a key step that would allow the company to start construction and paves the way to charge customers down the road. The overall expansion is more than double the combined generating capacity of the four nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle near Augusta.

Most new electricity supplies the utility wants to build itself or buy from other power plants would rely on burning gas, which produces potent greenhouse gases that are warming the planet. The rest would come from battery storage systems and some solar.

Nearly all the new power generation muscle is needed to serve data centers, the energy-intensive computing warehouses springing up across Georgia to serve artificial intelligence and other digital products.

Monopoly utilities like Georgia Power earn profits on investments in new power plants and transmission lines, so the deal, if approved, would likely boost the bottom line of its parent, Southern Company.

In a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, Georgia Power estimated the new power resources it would be allowed to build would require at least $16 billion in capital investment. That does not include power the company would purchase from third parties or other related costs, so the plan's ultimate price tag could be significantly higher.

In testimony filed before the hearings, PSC staff had warned residential customers could eventually see monthly bills jump $20 or more if the utility's full expansion were approved and data center demand does not materialize. Staff had previously recommended the commission sign off on only about a third of the new power supplies, at least for now. The rest, they said, were ""speculative"" and risky investments for customers.

'Downward pressure'

Rising power bills have emerged as a potent political issue nationally and in Georgia. Georgia Power customers have seen their monthly electricity bills rise six times in roughly three years because of decisions made by the all-Republican commission.

Democrats flipped two Republican-held PSC seats last month in an election that largely became a referendum on utility bills with Democrats alleging the GOP members were rubber stamps for Georgia Power. Those Democrats, incoming commissioners Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, will be sworn in next month and will not have a say in this deal.

Under the stipulated agreement, Georgia Power has pledged to use extra revenue from data centers to keep other customers' rates in check.

In return for the endorsement of its fleet expansion, Georgia Power agreed to structure its next rate adjustment — slated to be proposed in 2028 — to put at least $8.50 in ""downward pressure"" on residential customers' monthly bills.

It's far from guaranteed customers' bills will shrink that much, if at all — a point PSC staff conceded during Wednesday's hearing. ""Downward pressure"" is not the same as a rate cut and many residential customers use more electricity each month than the 1,000 kilowatt-hours used to estimate bill impacts.

Any rate increases or decreases resulting from the agreement won't be felt until 2029.

In a statement, Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said the agreement will mean ""more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia's future.""

""Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that's a great result for Georgians,"" Greene added.

Environmental and consumer groups have a less rosy view of the deal.

Thomas Farmer, the vice president of advocacy for the Southface Institute, called the proposed deal an ""extraordinary ask that will impact our state for decades.""

""This agreement gives Georgia Power everything they've asked for with very little in return for regular Georgians,"" he added.

'Closed door' deal

The deal was announced just 90 minutes before hearings on the company's plan were set to start Wednesday and was met with surprise at the PSC's downtown headquarters. The hearings this week are the last chance for parties to argue for and against the deal before the commission votes on Dec. 19.

The hearings themselves, which could last through Friday, got off to a rocky start Wednesday.

As PSC Chair Jason Shaw tried to kick off the proceedings, he was drowned out by a group of environmental and consumer advocates that stood in front of the dais chanting things like ""Power to the people, not Georgia Power."" Several protesters were forced out of the hearing room by police, but a Georgia State Patrol office confirmed none were placed under arrest.

Once the hearing got underway, commissioners continued to get an earful during the public comment period. For more than two hours, a chorus of speakers said they were frustrated by high power bills and worried about the higher temperatures that will result from increased burning of fossil fuels.

Georgia Tech student Kiran Kapileshwari said the stipulated agreement was negotiated ""behind closed doors"" and blasted it as a ""profound breach of public trust.""

PSC spokesperson Tom Krause said these agreements are common in PSC cases and called the process ""very open and public.""

""It was negotiated in the same manner as stipulations in any legal process,"" Krause said.

Kapileshwari and others also criticized the timing of the PSC's scheduled vote on Georgia Power's historic expansion. The final vote on Dec. 19 will take place less than two weeks before Hubbard and Johnson take office. Two environmental groups unsuccessfully sought to delay the vote until the New Year.

In a rally Wednesday morning outside the PSC offices, Hubbard said there are cleaner and better alternatives to the gas plants Georgia Power wants to build, and said he did not believe the customer impacts of the company's plan have been fully vetted.

Hubbard said he had not heard about the deal the utility struck with the PSC staff and learned of it only when asked by reporters.

""I don't know what's going on behind closed doors, so I can't speak to that, but I will be sitting at the table very soon,"" Hubbard said. ""And if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu, and that's appears to be what happened today.""

Those were jobs that kept local diners open, hardware stores busy, and families rooted in this corner of Missouri.
Without investment in affordable, reliable power, tariffs won’t cut it.
Down here in the Bootheel, farmers are struggling with the same energy problem that sank the smelter.
It’s been almost two years since the smelter closed, but I still think of the job and people I worked with every day.","When I fire up the tractor before sunrise in Campbell, the hum of the engine takes me back to a different kind of power — the kind that used to surge through the aluminum cells at Magnitude 7 Metals in Marston before it closed its doors almost two years ago.

Back then, I worked nights surrounded by sparks and heat, helping turn raw ore into the lightweight metal that keeps America running. These days, I work the same Bootheel land at my neighbors farm, but the story hasn’t changed much: whether you’re smelting or farming, you’re fighting the same battle for affordable energy, steady pay and a future worth passing on.

When the Magnitude 7 Metals smelter closed nearly two years ago for the second time, hundreds of good-paying union jobs vanished overnight. Those were jobs that kept local diners open, hardware stores busy, and families rooted in this corner of Missouri.

I thought tariffs would keep us safe — after all, that’s what we were told in 2018 when President Donald Trump imposed Section 232 tariffs to bring our industry back from the brink. For a while, it felt like that might happen. The former Noranda plant restarted. Paychecks flowed back into our towns. But without addressing the root problem — sky-high electricity costs driven by our reliance on the aging New Madrid coal plant — tariffs, though helpful, are only a temporary patch.

Without investment in affordable, reliable power, tariffs won’t cut it. That’s why the gates at Magnitude 7 are still closed today.

The truth is, Missouri’s economy runs on the same current: whether you’re melting metal or tending crops, you need dependable electricity at a fair price. Down here in the Bootheel, farmers are struggling with the same energy problem that sank the smelter. High power costs drive up grain drying bills, squeeze irrigation budgets, and eat away at razor-thin margins. And most of that power still comes from the New Madrid coal plant, a costly system that’s left both industry and agriculture in a tough spot.

We’ve got what it takes to fix this. Missouri is rich in natural and human resources: flat land, steady wind, strong sun, and hardworking people ready to make a living. If we invested in renewable energy right here — from solar arrays outside Sikeston to wind projects across the state — we could lower costs, strengthen the grid, and give towns like Marston and Campbell a second chance.

Coal is still essential in the short term, since we lack the infrastructure to switch fully to renewables right away, but the transition has to start somewhere and coal won’t be around forever. Cleaner, cheaper power could help farms grow and maybe even bring primary aluminum production back to life.

America still needs aluminum, and it’ll need a lot more of it in the coming years. Every tractor, truck, and transmission line depends on it. And Missouri can play a bigger role in meeting that need, not by relying on quick political fixes like tariffs, but by giving workers and farmers the tools to compete with cleaner, more efficient energy.

Across America, data centers are booming, and billions in new investments are being proposed right here in Missouri. But for all that growth, these massive facilities won’t create anywhere near the number of steady jobs a smelter once did. What they will do is compete for the same limited supply of electricity — driving up demand and making it even harder for industries like aluminum and agriculture to afford the power they need to survive

Let’s stop pretending tariffs will rebuild our economy. The people who power Missouri — on the factory floor and in the fields — know what we really need: investment in affordable, modern energy that lets us work hard, earn fair, and stay rooted right here at home.

It’s been almost two years since the smelter closed, but I still think of the job and people I worked with every day. Every time I do, I think about how connected our struggles are in this part of the state. The lesson is clear: if we want to rebuild Southeast Missouri, we have to invest in energy that works for everyone — from the aluminum cell to the plow.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/smelter.png,N,,2025-12-13 11:01:35.611417

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third year in a row in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to around 13.6 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, EIA projected a 63% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020. EIA projected gas output would rise to 107.7 billion cubic feet per day in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

Congressman Patronis: “Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, Aaron Bean, for introducing this amendment. Mr. Chairman, after working hard to obtain Federal approval in the first Trump administration, a weaponized court system pulled Florida’s 404 permitting out from under us, even though our program was thoroughly vetted and approved in 2020. Florida’s DEP has become a national model for environmental protection, and Washington should be learning from us, not tying our hands. The amendment makes it clear that once a State assumption program is approved, the EPA cannot withdraw it unless Congress explicitly says so—no more regulatory whiplash, no more political games. For Florida, this is critical. It protects our section 404 program, and it ends the uncertainty caused by conflicting court rulings and shifting in interpretations in Washington. Meanwhile, the Army Corps of Engineers got a gut punch with an overwhelming caseload while working hard to try to solve dozens of projects that an activist judge has placed on hold in our communities that they desperately need, like stormwater, schools, and even sewer treatment plants not under construction, protecting our most precious environments. But we can’t unless the permits can be issued. This is about predictability, federalism, and letting the States manage their own waterways.

While Hochul has not released a clear accounting of how much Sunrise Wind will raise electric bills, her office has previously reported only a few dollars per month for the average household.
The true cost to consumers—and the final price of the nation’s largest wind project—will only become clear once the turbines start spinning.","The price tag for Sunrise Wind, New York’s flagship 924-megawatt offshore wind project, has become increasingly difficult to pin down as costs escalate and financial assumptions shift. Early state documents put the project’s cost at roughly $1.5 billion, but industry analysts now say a more realistic figure is somewhere between $6 billion and $9 billion once inflation, supply-chain pressures, and higher interest rates are factored in.

Ørsted, which owns 100 percent of the project, has not publicly stated a firm estimate—one that most likely will not be finalized until construction is complete over the next few years.

To keep the project alive, the Danish company has taken extraordinary steps to raise capital. After failing to “farm down” a stake in Sunrise Wind—its preferred model of selling partial ownership to reduce risk—the company turned to shareholders with a massive $9.4 billion rights offering. Two-thirds of that infusion was earmarked for Sunrise Wind alone, underscoring both the size of the undertaking and the difficulty Ørsted faces in securing private partners willing to shoulder U.S. offshore wind uncertainty.

Where that money ultimately comes from, however, is not in dispute. The project’s financing structure ensures that Long Islanders will cover the bulk of Sunrise Wind’s cost. A 25-year Offshore Renewable Energy Certificate contract with the state guarantees Ørsted a fixed payment for every megawatt-hour produced—paid directly through electric bills.

At the federal level, Inflation Reduction Act incentives, including a 30 percent Investment Tax Credit, could shift billions more onto U.S. taxpayers. With the Trump Administration souring on wind projects, federal support may dry up, leaving New Yorkers to carry the burden alone. Critics warn that Gov. Kathy Hochul may throw the company a taxpayer-dollar lifeline—an investor bailout that could make one of the highest-taxed regions in the nation even more unaffordable.

While Hochul has not released a clear accounting of how much Sunrise Wind will raise electric bills, her office has previously reported only a few dollars per month for the average household.

As of late 2025, a dramatic recalibration of market share is underway, driven by aggressive new model launches, innovative technological advancements, and strategic pricing from both established automotive giants and agile newcomers, particularly from China. This shift signals a maturation of the EV industry, moving beyond a single leader to a more fragmented and intensely competitive landscape, with immediate implications for consumer choices, manufacturing strategies, and investor portfolios worldwide.

A New Era of Competition: Tesla's Grip Loosens as Challengers Accelerate

The narrative of the EV market in 2025 is increasingly defined by Tesla's shifting position. Once the undisputed titan, Tesla's global EV market share saw a notable decrease to 7.5% in the first half of the year, a 4.2 percentage point drop year-over-year. While it held over 13% of the global Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) market share in Q3 2025, with a 7% year-over-year sales increase, its regional performance paints a more complex picture. In 13 European countries, Tesla's market share plummeted from a peak of 36% in Q3 2019 to 10.2% in Q3 2025, with overall sales down more than 50% compared to 2024.

In the United States, November 2025 saw Tesla's sales hit a four-year low, falling nearly 23% year-over-year to 39,800 units. This decline was largely attributed to the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025, which caused the overall U.S. EV market to contract by over 41% in November. Paradoxically, due to even sharper declines among competitors, Tesla's U.S. market share actually increased from 43.1% to 56.7% during this period, highlighting the significant impact of policy changes on the entire sector. In China, Tesla's retail sales in November experienced a 5% year-over-year decline, placing it fifth in the country's New Energy Vehicle (NEV) retail sales ranking.

This evolving landscape is a direct result of the aggressive strategies employed by Tesla's rivals. BYD (Build Your Dreams) (SHE: 002594, HKG: 1211) has emerged as a formidable global force, dominating the EV market in the first half of 2025 with a 19.9% share. In China, BYD led the NEV market in November 2025 with a 23.2% market share. Its global exports reached a record 131,935 units in November, with sales quadrupling in Europe, doubling in Southeast Asia, and increasing by over 50% in South America in 2025. Notably, BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time in April 2025.

The Volkswagen Group (XTRA: VOW3) is solidifying its position, especially in Europe, where it holds about 27% of the BEV market. By the end of September 2025, its global BEV deliveries reached 717,500 units, a 42% increase from the same period in 2024. Popular models like the Volkswagen ID.4/ID.5, ID.3, Audi Q4 e-tron, Audi Q6 e-tron, and Škoda Elroq have driven this growth. In the U.S., General Motors (NYSE: GM) has become the second-largest EV seller, delivering 144,668 EVs through the first three quarters of 2025, a 103% jump from all of 2024. Strong demand for the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, and GMC Sierra EV propelled GM's record third quarter with 66,501 EV deliveries.

Chinese manufacturers are also making significant strides. Geely (HKG: 0175) ranked third globally in BEV sales in Q3 2025 with a 10% market share, and its Zeekr brand alone recorded 61,000 deliveries in October. New entrant Xiaomi (HKG: 1810), a smartphone giant, made a splash with its SU7 sedan, which outsold Tesla's Model 3 in China in December 2024. Its YU7 SUV, launched in mid-2025, garnered nearly 240,000 firm orders in just 18 hours, priced lower than the Tesla Model Y with a claimed higher range. XPeng (NYSE: XPEV) saw its sales surge by 270.26% year-over-year in the first seven months of 2025, while Leapmotor (HKG: 9863) exceeded 70,000 deliveries in November. Nio (NYSE: NIO) delivered a record 87,071 vehicles in Q3 2025, a 40.8% increase year-over-year, driven by its NIO, ONVO, and Firefly sub-brands. Even Ford (NYSE: F), despite a significant plunge in its November 2025 EV sales after the loss of federal tax credits, hit record highs in Q3 2025 for its EV models like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, though its hybrid sales are now outperforming pure EVs.

The Shifting Tides: Who Wins and Who Loses in the EV Race

The current dynamics in the EV market are creating clear winners and losers, reshaping the competitive landscape. Companies that have embraced diversification, aggressive pricing, and regional market specificities are generally thriving, while those relying heavily on past successes or singular market strategies face increasing pressure.

Winners:

BYD (SHE: 002594, HKG: 1211): Undoubtedly a major winner, BYD's comprehensive strategy encompassing battery production, diverse model lineups (including hybrids and BEVs), and aggressive international expansion has propelled it to global leadership in market share. Its strong performance in Europe, Southeast Asia, and South America, coupled with its dominant position in China, positions it for continued growth.

Volkswagen Group (XTRA: VOW3): Leveraging its vast manufacturing capabilities and brand portfolio, Volkswagen has successfully positioned itself as the BEV market leader in Europe. Its strategy of offering a wide range of EV models across its brands (Volkswagen, Audi, Škoda, Porsche) allows it to cater to various consumer segments, from affordable to luxury.

General Motors (NYSE: GM): GM's significant investment in its Ultium platform is bearing fruit, making it the second-largest EV seller in the U.S. The strong demand for models like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, and GMC Sierra EV indicates that traditional automakers can effectively transition and compete in the EV space with compelling products.

Chinese EV Startups (Geely (HKG: 0175), Xiaomi (HKG: 1810), XPeng (NYSE: XPEV), Leapmotor (HKG: 9863), Nio (NYSE: NIO)): These companies are demonstrating immense agility and innovation, rapidly introducing new models with advanced features and competitive pricing tailored to the vast Chinese market. Xiaomi's immediate impact with its SU7 and YU7, and the consistent growth of XPeng, Leapmotor, and Nio, highlight the strength and dynamism of the Chinese EV ecosystem. Their increasing focus on overseas expansion also signals future global competition.

Losers/Challenged:

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): While still a major player, Tesla is undeniably facing significant headwinds. Its declining market share in crucial European and Chinese markets, coupled with a U.S. sales slump post-tax credit expiration, indicates that its premium pricing and relatively limited model lineup are becoming vulnerabilities. The strategy of introducing cheaper variants appears to be cannibalizing sales of higher-margin models rather than expanding its customer base, impacting overall revenue. Tesla's long-term focus on AI and autonomy, while strategic, may not be sufficient to fend off rivals focused on immediate, competitive product offerings.

Ford (NYSE: F) (Pure EV Segment): Despite record EV sales in Q3 2025, Ford's significant plunge in November 2025 EV sales post-tax credit removal, coupled with a $1.4 billion loss in its EV business in Q3, highlights the fragility of its pure EV strategy. While its hybrid sales are robust, the challenges with models like the F-150 Lightning suggest that the transition to pure EVs is proving more difficult and costly than anticipated for some legacy automakers.

The fierce competition is also leading to intensified price wars, particularly in China, which benefits consumers but pressures profit margins for all manufacturers. The ability to innovate rapidly, manage supply chains efficiently, and adapt to diverse regional consumer preferences will be crucial determinants of long-term success.

Wider Significance: Reshaping the Global Automotive Landscape

This dramatic shift in the EV market extends far beyond individual company performance, signaling profound implications for broader industry trends, regulatory frameworks, and geopolitical dynamics. The diminishing dominance of a single player, Tesla, and the rise of a multipolar EV ecosystem represent a maturation of the industry, moving from early adoption to mass market competition.

One of the most significant trends is the diversification of EV offerings. Manufacturers are no longer just producing premium sedans; they are rolling out SUVs, compact cars, commercial vehicles, and even ultra-luxury options, catering to every segment. This broad appeal, particularly from traditional automakers like Volkswagen and GM, is allowing them to leverage existing customer bases and dealer networks to gain traction against Tesla's more focused lineup. The rapid emergence of affordable, feature-rich EVs from Chinese brands is also fundamentally altering consumer expectations, especially in cost-sensitive markets.

The ripple effects are being felt across the entire automotive supply chain. Battery manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and software developers are all experiencing increased demand and diversification of their client base. This competitive pressure is accelerating innovation in battery technology, charging speeds, and in-car software, pushing the boundaries of what EVs can offer. Furthermore, the rise of Chinese brands on the global stage challenges the long-standing automotive order, potentially leading to new manufacturing hubs and export routes, particularly as these companies expand into Europe and Southeast Asia.

Regulatory and policy implications are becoming increasingly critical. The U.S. federal EV tax credit's expiration in September 2025 vividly demonstrated the profound impact government incentives have on consumer demand and sales volumes. This event underscores the need for stable, long-term policy frameworks to support EV adoption and manufacturing. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to balance environmental goals with economic competitiveness, often leading to domestic content requirements or specific incentive structures that can favor local manufacturers. The ""Inflation Reduction Act"" in the U.S., for instance, aims to bolster domestic EV and battery production, potentially creating trade tensions with countries like China and Europe.

Historically, major technological shifts in industries have rarely been dominated by a single entity indefinitely. From the early days of computing to mobile phones, initial pioneers often face stiff competition as technology matures and market entry barriers lower. Tesla's current situation can be compared to how early tech giants eventually faced robust competition from a multitude of innovative players. This period of intense competition is healthy for the industry, fostering innovation, improving product quality, and ultimately benefiting consumers through more choice and competitive pricing.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Evolving EV Landscape

The coming months and years will be pivotal for the electric vehicle industry, with several short-term and long-term possibilities shaping its trajectory. The current competitive intensity is unlikely to wane; instead, it is expected to escalate, demanding strategic pivots and continuous adaptation from all players.

In the short-term, expect continued price wars, especially in high-volume markets like China, as manufacturers vie for market share. This will put significant pressure on profit margins, potentially leading to consolidation among smaller or less efficient EV startups. We may also see an acceleration of new model launches, with a focus on affordability and advanced features like improved range, faster charging, and sophisticated AI-driven infotainment systems. The impact of government incentives will remain a critical factor, with regions adjusting policies based on market performance and environmental targets. For instance, the U.S. market will be closely watched to see how it recovers from the post-tax credit slump and if new state-level incentives emerge.

Long-term possibilities include a more diversified global EV market, with regional powerhouses emerging. Chinese brands are poised to become significant global exporters, challenging established players in Europe and other international markets. Traditional automakers, having invested heavily in EV platforms, will likely continue to gain ground, leveraging their brand recognition and extensive service networks. The focus will shift beyond just selling vehicles to building comprehensive EV ecosystems, including charging networks, battery swapping services, and integrated energy solutions.

Potential strategic pivots will be crucial. Tesla, for instance, might need to diversify its product lineup more aggressively, potentially introducing more affordable models or expanding into new segments like commercial vans, rather than solely relying on its existing premium offerings and long-term autonomy vision. Competitors will need to focus on supply chain resilience, battery technology innovation, and software differentiation to maintain an edge. Partnerships and collaborations, such as joint ventures for battery production or charging infrastructure, could also become more common as companies seek to share costs and accelerate development.

Market opportunities will emerge in niche segments, such as rugged off-road EVs, specialized commercial vehicles, or ultra-luxury electric offerings. The development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and fully autonomous driving will continue to be a battleground, attracting significant R&D investment. Furthermore, the burgeoning demand for sustainable energy solutions will create opportunities for companies integrating EVs with home energy storage and smart grid technologies.

However, challenges will persist. Raw material scarcity and price volatility for battery components, the need for robust and widespread charging infrastructure, and consumer range anxiety remain significant hurdles. Geopolitical tensions could also impact supply chains and market access, forcing companies to localize production. The overall profitability of EV divisions will be under intense scrutiny, as many traditional automakers are still reporting losses in this segment.

Ultimately, the EV market is heading towards a future characterized by intense innovation, consumer-centric product development, and a highly competitive landscape where agility and strategic foresight will be paramount.

Wrap-up: A New Dawn for the Electric Vehicle Industry

The year 2025 marks a definitive turning point in the electric vehicle market. The era of single-player dominance is drawing to a close, giving way to a dynamic, multi-faceted competitive environment. The rise of formidable rivals like BYD (SHE: 002594, HKG: 1211), Volkswagen Group (XTRA: VOW3), and General Motors (NYSE: GM), alongside an agile cohort of Chinese innovators, has fundamentally reshaped the industry's contours. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), while still a major force, is facing unprecedented pressure on its market share and profitability, signaling a need for strategic re-evaluation.

The key takeaways from this shifting landscape are clear: diversification of product offerings, aggressive pricing strategies, and regional market adaptability are now paramount for success. The expiration of government incentives, as seen in the U.S., underscores the sensitivity of EV demand to policy changes, highlighting the need for stable regulatory environments to foster sustainable growth. This period of heightened competition is not merely a challenge but also an accelerator of innovation, pushing the boundaries of battery technology, charging infrastructure, and vehicle intelligence.

The WOTUS rule, borne of the Clean Water Act, identifies those waters that are federally protected from pollution by development and industry.
The EPA’s proposed rule change would strip Clean Water Act protections from 80% of all wetlands and over 5 million miles of streams across the country.
The good news is that this rule change is not a done deal – yet.
The EPA is taking public comments on the proposed WOTUS rule change until Jan. 5, and we must speak up forcefully against it.","Right now, our country is facing a serious and significant threat to wetlands, water, and the spirit of the federal Clean Water Act. And that threat is being made by the very people who are tasked with protecting our environment.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced in mid-November that it intends to significantly weaken the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, gutting wetland and water quality protections across the country, and leaving every state more vulnerable to flooding and contaminated water. The WOTUS rule, borne of the Clean Water Act, identifies those waters that are federally protected from pollution by development and industry.

The EPA’s proposed rule change would strip Clean Water Act protections from 80% of all wetlands and over 5 million miles of streams across the country. We're not talking about tiny, insignificant puddles. These small streams feed their waters – and whatever those waters contain – into our rivers and lakes, and thus into our children’s drinking water. If they are left unprotected, then we – as individuals, families and communities – are at risk.

Wetlands exist in a dozen or more forms across North Carolina, including the mountains, where you might be lucky enough to stumble on one of the last of the mountain bogs; it’s spongy ground home to many endangered and threatened plants and animals. Wetlands sequester carbon, nurture our fisheries, provide wildlife habitat and flood mitigation (particularly during large storm events), and help keep our drinking water clean. This rule change would erase protections from millions of acres of wetlands, leaving them – and we, who depend on them – vulnerable to unchecked destruction.

It's difficult to overstate the devastating impacts this rule change would have on water quality and the increased risk of flooding for all Americans, but North Carolina finds itself in a particularly precarious position. In the past, North Carolina's legislature recognized the critical role wetlands play in our unique environments statewide, establishing protections for them above the minimum required by federal law.

But in 2023, we suffered a one-two punch to those protections, beginning with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that willfully mischaracterized the nature of wetlands in favor of development, and then the baffling decision by our state's legislative leaders to cede regulatory authority and align North Carolina's wetlands definition with the weakened federal standard.

With this decision, the General Assembly abdicated its sworn responsibility to protect our state, and made it impossible for us to exert any autonomy in the name of wetland protections. This alignment, under the newly proposed change to WOTUS, could ravage North Carolina’s wetlands. It would be, quite literally, a disaster.

The good news is that this rule change is not a done deal – yet. We have a chance to stop it. Americans – and North Carolinians – have historically demanded strong protection for our waters and wetlands, and we can do it again.

In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught on fire. Decades of unregulated industrial discharge had created an incongruous catastrophe: The river, the water itself, was ablaze. Americans were outraged. As the country looked on in horror and the environmental damage we had wrought was laid bare, a visceral understanding settled on the collective: Our survival relied directly on the health of the world around us, and that world was literally burning. Something needed to be done, and Americans demanded change. Our government took action, promising ""never again"" – and the Clean Water Act was born.

Now, we must demand of our government that same vigilance, that same common-sense response, that same display of courageous leadership. The EPA is taking public comments on the proposed WOTUS rule change until Jan. 5, and we must speak up forcefully against it.

Once upon a time, we lived in a country that believed in protecting its people by protecting the environment they live in – a country whose leaders listened to scientists, understood the critical importance of wetlands and forests and rivers, and enacted the regulations necessary to protect them.

We can live in that country again. We can again demand that our leaders do their job by protecting us from all threats, foreign and domestic – including the folly of those who would carelessly jeopardize the health of the environment that sustains us all.

Even when quarters were tough, the trendline pointed up. But the data from November 2025 has delivered a stark reality check: Tesla’s US monthly sales have dropped below the psychological floor of 40,000 units.

According to the latest industry estimates, Tesla moved approximately 39,800 vehicles in the US last month—a figure we haven't seen since the supply-constrained days of January 2022. This represents a stinging 23% year-over-year decline and a massive deceleration from the frantic pace of the third quarter.

This isn’t just a blip; it is the culmination of a ""perfect storm"" involving policy shifts, an aging product lineup, and a brand identity crisis that centers squarely on its CEO. Here is a deep dive into why the EV king is losing its crown in its home market and what it will take to stop the bleeding.

The Tax Credit Hangover and the ""Standard"" Misstep

The immediate catalyst for this drop is clear: economics. The expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025 created a massive demand vacuum. We saw a ""pull-forward"" effect in Q3, where buyers rushed to lock in deals, leaving the Q4 cupboard bare.

Tesla anticipated this. In October, they launched new ""Standard"" range variants of the Model 3 and Model Y, priced roughly $5,000 lower to bridge the gap left by Uncle Sam. On paper, it was a logical move. In practice, it has backfired.

Early data suggests these cheaper variants aren't bringing in new buyers; they are simply cannibalizing sales of the higher-margin Premium trims. As Electrek reported this morning, the demand for these stripped-down models is tepid at best. Buyers are looking at the value proposition—a lower-range, de-contented Tesla without a tax credit versus a flood of feature-rich competitors—and walking away.

The ""Musk Penalty"": When the Brand Becomes Baggage

We cannot discuss Tesla’s 2025 slump without addressing the elephant in the room: Elon Musk.

For a decade, Musk was Tesla’s greatest marketing asset. Today, he is arguably its biggest liability in the US and Europe. His deep involvement in polarizing political campaigns throughout 2024 and 2025, specifically his leadership role in the ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE) and vocal support for far-right figures, has alienated a significant portion of the EV-buying demographic.

The data supports this ""reputational fatigue."" Surveys from Forrester and other firms have noted that the ""sheen"" has worn off the brand. Liberal and centrist buyers, who once viewed owning a Tesla as a badge of environmental honor, now increasingly view it as a political endorsement they aren't willing to make.

Even Musk seems to recognize this strategic error. In a candid moment recently cited by InsideEVs, Musk admitted regrets regarding his political entanglements, noting that the backlash has had tangible effects on the company. When the CEO’s personal brand actively repels 50% of the market, sales slumps are inevitable.

An Aging Fleet in a Fresh Market

Beyond politics and tax credits, there is a fundamental automotive problem: The cars are getting old.

The Model Y is the best-selling car in the world, but it is no longer the newest or most exciting. The Model 3 received a refresh (Highland) back in 2024, but the core platform is aging. Meanwhile, the Cybertruck remains a polarizing, high-priced niche product that has not ramped up to the mass-market volumes needed to offset declines in the sedan and SUV segments.

Contrast this with the competition. Hyundai and Kia have released a blitz of varied, stylish, and high-performing EVs. The US legacy automakers are finally finding their footing with reliable electric trucks and SUVs. Customers walking into showrooms today have choices that didn't exist three years ago. Tesla’s ""minimalist"" interior and tech-first approach are no longer unique selling points; they are just one option among many.

Global Pressure: The Walls Are Closing In

The US sales drop is mirrored by struggles abroad. In Europe, Tesla’s market share is under siege from both Volkswagen Group and Chinese entrants. In China, BYD continues to be the juggernaut.

While Tesla still holds its own in profit margins, its volume growth—the engine of its stock valuation—has stalled. Reports indicate that while global EV sales are up 21% in 2025 driven by Europe and China, the US is stalling, and Tesla is losing its grip on the narrative of being the ""only game in town."" The Chinese OEMs are moving faster, iterating software quicker, and offering luxury interiors at price points Tesla has refused to match.

What Tesla Needs to Do to Turn Around

Is this the end of Tesla? Absolutely not. But it is a severe pivot point. To reverse this slide and climb back above the 50k monthly sales mark in the US, three things need to happen immediately:

Launch the ""Model 2"" (Next-Gen Platform): The time for rumors is over. Tesla needs a true mass-market vehicle priced under $30,000 before incentives. The ""Standard"" Model 3 cuts aren't enough. The market needs a compact, affordable Tesla to compete with the incoming wave of cheap Chinese EVs and affordable options from Kia/Hyundai.

Decouple the Brand from the Man: Tesla needs a stronger, independent marketing voice. The company has historically spent $0 on advertising, relying on Musk’s X (Twitter) account. That strategy is now broken. Tesla needs traditional, high-quality brand advertising that reminds people why the cars are good—safety, Supercharging network, and software—without the political baggage of its CEO.

Refocus on Core Auto Execution: While Robotaxi and Optimus robots are exciting for the stock price long-term, they don't sell cars today. Buyers are frustrated with ""FSD"" promises that haven't fully materialized. Tesla needs to improve service center availability, build quality, and customer support to win back the trust of the ""normie"" car buyer who just wants a reliable vehicle, not a science experiment.

Wrapping Up

November’s drop below 40,000 units is a wake-up call that cannot be ignored. It signals that the era of easy growth for Tesla is officially over. The company is no longer fighting against gas cars; it is fighting against its own aging lineup, a polarized brand image, and a hungry field of competitors.

Tesla has the engineering talent and the cash reserves to fix this. The question is whether leadership is willing to put aside the political distractions and the ""robotaxi or bust"" mentality to do the hard work of being a car company again.

The executive order also seeks to get rid of state standards that protect Americans from water pollution, water depletion, and toxic fossil fuel pollution at data centers.
In response, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter Director Pam Mackey-Taylor issued the following statement: “This executive order won’t do anything to decrease costs or protect us.
Utility bills are skyrocketing nationwide due to growing energy demand from data centers and utilities’ reliance on expensive fossil fuels—Iowa doesn’t want to be next.","DES MOINES, Iowa — Last night, Donald Trump issued an executive order seeking to remove state guardrails around artificial intelligence and the infrastructure needed to run AI, including popular state-level initiatives to require data center build transparency, protect privacy, and reduce impacts on electric affordability, air pollution, and water usage. While two new data center campuses are under construction in Cedar Rapids, several other data center projects are underway or have been proposed in Iowa.

The critical state protections at risk—including guardrails like large load tariffs—are in place to ensure everyday Americans are not held liable for data centers’ massive power, water and infrastructure use. Across the country, Sierra Club has helped utilities, regulators, and consumer advocates implement commonsense safeguards like long-term contracts, credit guarantees, and minimum bills that protect affordability for residential customers.

The executive order also seeks to get rid of state standards that protect Americans from water pollution, water depletion, and toxic fossil fuel pollution at data centers. If these protections get rolled back—which Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency is already trying to do—Americans will be exposed to far more pollutants in their air and water.

In response, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter Director Pam Mackey-Taylor issued the following statement:

“This executive order won’t do anything to decrease costs or protect us. Here in Iowa, we are fighting for state protections because we all have a right to privacy and transparency, and everyday Iowans should not be held responsible for the massive costs of data centers operated by the likes of Google and Microsoft.

Utility bills are skyrocketing nationwide due to growing energy demand from data centers and utilities’ reliance on expensive fossil fuels—Iowa doesn’t want to be next. We care about keeping our state affordable and shouldn’t have to compete with Big Tech for water. Our state leaders must be doing everything in their power to lower these costs, prioritize affordability, and set safeguards for all of us, rather than bulldozing secret or unvetted projects through communities that are struggling to keep the lights on and keep water drinkable. We need to stand up for an affordable, livable future in Iowa.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-13 11:02:24.537235

(LS C&S) is planning a major additional investment in Chesapeake, Virginia.
LS C&S’s investment builds on the previously announced first phase of LS GreenLink USA’s state-of-the-art cable manufacturing and pier facility project, which broke ground in April 2025.
“LS GreenLink has already brought hundreds of millions of dollars to Hampton Roads, and these three projects from LS Cable and Systems will build on that success.
“Congratulations to LS Cable & System and the entire LS Group on another major investment in Chesapeake,” said Hampton Roads Alliance President and CEO Douglas L. Smith.
Youngkin approved a performance-based grant of $1,000,000 from the Virginia Investment Performance Grant.","Power and communication cable and system solutions company LS Cable & System Ltd. (LS C&S) is planning a major additional investment in Chesapeake, Virginia. Undertaken through three LS C&S subsidiaries, the $689 million project is expected to be the single largest capital investment in Hampton Roads region history. It is expected to create more than 430 new jobs.

LS C&S’s investment builds on the previously announced first phase of LS GreenLink USA’s state-of-the-art cable manufacturing and pier facility project, which broke ground in April 2025. While separate from the LS GreenLink project, the new initiative expands the company’s overall presence in the U.S. and reinforces LS C&S’s long-term commitment to the region.

“This investment represents an exciting step in our continuing growth in the United States,” said LS C&S President and CEO Bon-Kyu Koo. “We’re not only expanding our manufacturing capabilities, we’re strengthening the U.S. domestic supply chains and supporting America’s leadership in energy and technology. By continuing the partnerships with the Commonwealth of Virginia, the City of Chesapeake, and the Hampton Roads region, we’re creating opportunities for the local community while helping to ensure secure, reliable infrastructure that supports national security and the nation’s energy future.”

“The LS GreenLink project has been a major commitment for LS C&S, and this new investment builds directly on that foundation,” said LS C&S Regional President of North America Gisu Kim. “It strengthens domestic production of critical components such as copper rod, magnet wire, and rare-earth magnets, vital to reinforcing supply chain resilience and advancing U.S. energy independence.”

LS C&S is evaluating several Chesapeake-area locations for the new manufacturing complex, which will feature advanced capabilities across three key business lines:

Copper rod production utilizing copper recycling and smelting

Magnet wire manufacturing to support automotive and industrial markets

Rare-earth magnet production, essential for electric motors and advanced weapons systems

“Today’s announcement shows that Virginia is committed to leading the nation in our efforts to reshore American manufacturing and secure our nation’s supply chains,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “LS GreenLink has already brought hundreds of millions of dollars to Hampton Roads, and these three projects from LS Cable and Systems will build on that success. As we develop the future of American energy and infrastructure, unfettered access to copper products and rare earth magnets will become even more crucial. I am proud that the Commonwealth is able to work with partners like LS C&S as we build a brighter future for the Commonwealth.”

“With three exciting projects in Chesapeake, LS Cable and Systems is poised to transform America’s tech manufacturing supply chain,” commented Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura. “Securing these supply chains does more than ensure smooth manufacturing timelines; it helps safeguard our national security. LS C&S’s continued investment in the Commonwealth shows that when the government moves at the speed of business, big things can happen quickly.”

The Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) worked with the City of Chesapeake, the Hampton Roads Alliance, and The Port of Virginia to secure the project for Virginia. Gov. Youngkin approved a $7.3 million grant from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund to assist Chesapeake with the project, as well as a performance-based grant of $1.5 million from the Virginia Investment Performance Grant. The company is also eligible to receive benefits from The Port of Virginia Economic and Infrastructure Development Zone Grant Program. LS C&S’s job creation will be supported through the Virginia Talent Accelerator Program, which was ranked the No. 1 workforce training program in the U.S. by Business Facilities for the third consecutive year.

“Congratulations to LS Cable & System and the entire LS Group on another major investment in Chesapeake,” said Hampton Roads Alliance President and CEO Douglas L. Smith. “The Hampton Roads Alliance is proud to support LS Group and to work alongside the City of Chesapeake as the company advances its commitment to expand U.S. power grid infrastructure. This investment aligns directly with the Hampton Roads Playbook, which prioritizes defense, energy, aerospace, and logistics. Energy security is national security and projects like this further solidify Hampton Roads as a global energy leader.”

“LS Cable’s $689 million investment solidifies Chesapeake’s position as a premier destination for advanced manufacturing,” said Chesapeake Economic Development Director Steven Wright. “The establishment of new facilities for magnet wire and sintered rare-earth magnets production will provide much-needed support for U.S. supply chains for emerging mobility technologies and modern energy systems. This project will bring skilled jobs to Chesapeake and will strengthen the long-term industrial competitiveness of our region.”

“The Port of Virginia is ready to support LS Cable & System’s strategic investment in Chesapeake,” said Port of Virginia CEO and Executive Director Stephen A. Edwards. “Advanced manufacturing facilities like LS Cable not only strengthen Virginia’s role in global trade but will help accelerate innovation in the electric vehicle industry. The Port of Virginia is a 21st-century port complex that will provide LS Cable the supply chain efficiency, consistency and connectivity needed to succeed in today’s competitive marketplace.”

Eaton Expands With $50M Investment In Henrico County

In Henrico County, intelligent power management company Eaton will invest more than $50 million to expand its existing manufacturing footprint. Upon completion, the project is expected to create 200 new jobs, bringing Eaton’s local team to nearly 500 employees. The company selected Henrico after assessing multiple locations across the country.

Eaton will open a new campus in Henrico County, more than doubling its regional footprint, to increase manufacturing of critical power distribution technologies to help meet record demand from data center customers. Production at the new 350,000-square-foot Richmond area facility is expected to begin in 2027. The expansion will support production of static transfer switches, power distribution units, and remote power panels — essential technologies that provide reliable, uninterrupted power.

“Eaton is continuing to invest in U.S. manufacturing and is thankful for the strong collaboration and support in Virginia. Our latest manufacturing expansion builds on our history in the region and reflects on the incredible abilities of our longtime local employees,” said Aidan Graham, senior vice president and general manager of Critical Power Solutions at Eaton. “We’re uniquely positioned to help our data center customers meet the rapidly increasing power requirements for AI factories through our expansive manufacturing footprint and our focus on innovation and engineering excellence.”

“Eaton’s latest investment in Henrico is proof that Virginia companies and workers are stepping up to meet our growing power needs,” said Gov. Youngkin. “The only thing better than bringing a new business to Virginia is watching an existing Virginia business expand. By producing even more critical power equipment in the Commonwealth, Eaton is helping drive Virginia’s future and strengthening our competitive edge.”

The VEDP worked with Henrico County to secure the project for Virginia. To support Eaton’s investment, Gov. Youngkin approved a performance-based grant of $1,000,000 from the Virginia Investment Performance Grant.

“Eaton’s decision to expand in Henrico reinforces our reputation as a place where manufacturers truly succeed,” said Henrico EDA Board of Directors Chair Edward S. Whitlock, III. “With this second major investment in the past five years, Eaton is doubling down on its commitment to our community, further strengthening our local workforce, and supporting technologies people rely on every day. We wish them continued success as they grow and create new opportunities here in Henrico.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lscs.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 15:00:58.286829

In one of the most barbaric episodes during WWII, the Nanjing Massacre took place when Japanese troops captured the then-Chinese capital Nanjing on Dec 13, 1937.
Int'l guests call for remembering history at China's national event honoring Nanjing Massacre victims","The U.S. auto market's push toward electric vehicles (EVs) is hitting major roadblocks as the federal government not only removes purchase incentives but also proposes to relax long-term fuel economy standards.

The global EV market grew by nearly 28 percent in the first half of 2025 compared to a year ago.

While growth in China and Europe appears strong, the U.S. market is facing challenges.

At the end of September, the Trump administration ended the 7,500-dollar tax credit for buying electric vehicles.

Tesla saw a sales bump as people rushed to buy before the credit was eliminated.

But in October, U.S. EV sales fell nearly 50 percent compared with a year earlier.

Dealers sold 74,835 electric vehicles in the U.S. in October, according to Cox Automotive data, representing a 48.9 percent year-over-year decrease.

In a further blow to the EV industry, the Trump administration proposed lowering the average fuel economy standard automakers need to meet by 2031 by nearly 16 miles per gallon, or 6.8 kilometers per liter.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed significantly reducing fuel economy requirements from model years 2022 to 2031, requiring an average of 34.5 miles per gallon by 2031, down from 50.4 miles per gallon (21.4 km per liter).

The big three automakers praised Trump's move that could loosen regulatory pressure on emissions from gasoline-powered cars.

Brian Moody, executive editor for Autotrader and Kelly Blue Book, a U.S. auto evaluation and research company, believes hybrid vehicles should get a boost.

""The less gasoline a car burns, the less it pollutes. And so when you start looking at vehicles like hybrids that get 40, 50, 60 miles per gallon, or a plug-in that can get 75 to 80 miles per gallon, that has to be part of the solution too, because it uses existing infrastructure, and it's what consumers want or what they feel comfortable with,"" he said.

Moody agrees that the Trump administration's policies have hurt EV sales, but they may also force EV makers to improve their products.

""They'll just have to be better. They'll have to be as good as a gasoline-powered car, as good as a hybrid, or better than a diesel. And they can't cost more. So, now consumers will be looking at the total landscape. And when a car has the right combination of value, price, durability and resale value,"" he said.

The state of California has one of the most ambitious green goals in the country, set by Governor Gavin Newsom: to make 100 percent of new cars sold in the state zero-emission vehicles by 2035.

But in June, the Trump administration revoked California's special permission to set its own high vehicle pollution standards, which a dozen other states chose to follow. That leads many to believe California will no longer be able to meet its zero-emission vehicle goal.

Moody pointed out that without major infrastructure investments, the U.S. power grid could not handle the rapid growth of EVs, unlike those in places like China or Europe.

EV sales face challenges due to cancellation of US gov't incentives

International guests who have dedicated their lives to historical truth joined China's 12th national memorial event honoring the hundreds of thousands of victims killed by Japanese troops in the Nanjing Massacre during World War II.

The memorial was held on Saturday at the public square of the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province. China's national flag was flown at half-mast in the presence the crowd that included survivors of the massacre, local students, and international guests.

In one of the most barbaric episodes during WWII, the Nanjing Massacre took place when Japanese troops captured the then-Chinese capital Nanjing on Dec 13, 1937. Over the course of six weeks, they proceeded to kill approximately 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers.

Joining the crowd was Christoph Reinhardt, the great-grandson of John Rabe (1882-1950) who was then a representative of German conglomerate Siemens in the war-ravaged Nanjing. During the Nanjing Massacre, Rabe set up an international safety zone with other foreigners, and they together saved the lives of around 250,000 Chinese people between 1937 and 1938 from the Japanese invaders.

Throughout the massacre, Rabe continued to keep a diary. To this day, all his pages remain one of the most comprehensive historical records of the atrocities committed by the Japanese aggressors.

Sayoko Yamauchi, who was also in the crowd of mourners, arrived in Nanjing on Friday from Japan's Osaka to attend Saturday's ceremony, just as she has done almost every year since China designated Dec 13 as the National Memorial Day for the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre in 2014.

Yamauchi's grandfather was one of the Japanese soldiers who invaded Nanjing in January 1938. However, since first setting foot in Nanjing in 1987, she has dedicated herself to uncovering and spreading the truth about Japan's history of aggression and enlightening the Japanese public about their country's wartime atrocities.

In 2014, ahead of China's first National Memorial Day for the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre, Yamauchi, along with 10 other individuals, received an award for her special contribution to the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders.

By attending the grand memorial event, Reinhardt and Yamauchi both said they hope to convey a message of remembering history and cherishing peace.

""This is my fifth visit to China, and Nanjing, and the third times I visited the ceremony. I have a wish that these survivors survive again and again and again. But my other wish is that the families of the survivors, that they transport the information, the right intention like their ancestors, because anyone must hold a hand (during) this remembering,"" Reinhardt told China Central Television (CCTV) in an interview before the event began on Saturday.

""Our delegation is on its 20th visit to China, coming to Nanjing to express our heartfelt condolences to those who perished 88 years ago, to remember this history, and to reflect on what we can do for a new future. That's why we are here,"" Yamauchi told CCTV on board the bus that took her to a local hotel in Nanjing on Friday evening.

Piedmont Natural Gas says there are several simple steps customers can take now to save money while staying warm.

Piedmont recommends setting thermostats to the lowest comfortable temperature. Using a smart or programmable thermostat can automatically reduce energy use while residents are asleep or away from home.

Taking advantage of sunlight can also help cut costs. Leaving blinds or curtains open during sunny winter days allows natural heat to warm a home. Closing them at night helps prevent heat from escaping through windows.

Routine maintenance is another way to save. Changing air filters regularly helps heating systems run more efficiently, reducing energy use. Dirty filters force systems to work harder, which can drive up costs.

Water heating is another major expense. Piedmont suggests setting water heater temperatures to 120 degrees. Homeowners may also consider on-demand or tankless water heaters, which only heat water when needed.

Sealing drafts can result in significant savings. Caulking, sealing and weather-stripping cracks and openings can reduce heating and cooling costs by as much as 10% to 20%. Ensuring air ducts are properly sealed is also important, as leaks into attics or crawl spaces can significantly increase energy bills.

Adding insulation to ceilings, floors or walls can further reduce energy demand, helping homes stay warmer while lowering monthly costs.

Piedmont Natural Gas says it offers online tools to help customers better understand and manage their natural gas use. Customers can view monthly usage history through their online accounts to spot trends and identify savings opportunities.

Dec 12 (Reuters) – The Trump administration is not expected to finalize 2026 biofuel-blending quotas before the end of this year, according to three sources familiar with the situation, extending uncertainty over a policy closely watched by the rival oil and ‍agricultural sectors.

The slowdown would throw one of the administration’s most consequential energy policy choices into next year and folds the highly anticipated quotas into a growing cluster of interlocking decisions the White House is weighing on biofuels policy.

Together, the moves have raised expectations the administration may look to strike a broader – albeit elusive – agreement between rival oil and agricultural interests.

The Environmental Protection Agency, which administers biofuels policy, has scheduled meetings with ‌stakeholders on the quota rule early next, two sources told Reuters, a ‌sign that the issue will be pushed into next year.

A third source also said the EPA’s decision was unlikely by the end of this year.

The sources spoke about the matter on condition of anonymity.

The EPA told Reuters it was still reviewing public comments on the volume requirements and declined to offer any ​guidance on timing. The volume mandates are administered under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the federal program that mandates the blending of biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel into the U.S. fuel supply.

A ‍delay in finalizing the mandates is important because fuel ​makers, farmers and commodity traders use them to lock in supply contracts, ​hedge volatile crop and energy markets, and justify investments in new production capacity.

Without clarity on next year’s ‍quotas, companies say they are forced to hold back on deals and delay spending decisions that shape biofuel output and margins.

WHITE HOUSE LOOKS FOR COMMON GROUND

Earlier this year, the EPA proposed raising total renewable fuel requirements for 2026 and 2027, significantly increasing targets for advanced biofuels and biomass-based diesel targets while tightening rules on the use of imported biofuels.

The EPA had initially been expected ‍to finalize the proposal by the end of October.

The quotas have increasingly been swept into a broader set of critical energy and agricultural policy decisions the administration is weighing in the coming weeks – issues ‍that appear separate on their ‍own but could be linked as part of a wider bargain between ​rival oil and agricultural interests, the sources said.

Those issues include legislative efforts ​to ⁠allow year-round sales of gasoline containing higher blends of ethanol, a proposal ‌to penalize imported biofuels and feedstocks, and unresolved questions over whether and how larger refiners could be required to make up for gallons exempted from the RFS.

The White House has held several meetings in recent weeks with oil and agricultural groups in hopes of finding common ground.

Asked whether these issues are becoming increasingly connected, the EPA said it is “committed to strengthening American energy security and supporting American farmers.”

Most Wall Street experts kept their ratings the same after Rivian held its first “Autonomy and AI Day” event.
“RIVN signaled a shift from an [automaker] adopting autonomy to one leveraging AI to build end-to-end autonomy,” Needham analyst Chris Pierce wrote Friday.
“We attended Rivian’s Autonomy & AI Day yesterday in Palo Alto and came away mostly impressed with the strategic direction outlined by management,” Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu wrote Friday.
Electric vehicle sales have slumped since tax credits worth up to $7,500 ended in September.","Rivian Automotive showcased its plans for artificial intelligence and self-driving technology on Thursday, drawing interest from investors even as the electric vehicle company faces tough questions about sales and money.

The stock had a rough day Thursday, dropping 6.1% to finish at $16.43 per share. But things turned around Friday, with shares climbing more than 15% during trading hours.

Most Wall Street experts kept their ratings the same after Rivian held its first “Autonomy and AI Day” event. However, Needham bumped up its price target by 64% to $23 per share, citing the technology reveals and possible future deals where Rivian could license its systems to others. The firm also expects stronger sales next year when the company launches its new midsize R2 SUV.

“RIVN signaled a shift from an [automaker] adopting autonomy to one leveraging AI to build end-to-end autonomy,” Needham analyst Chris Pierce wrote Friday.

“We attended Rivian’s Autonomy & AI Day yesterday in Palo Alto and came away mostly impressed with the strategic direction outlined by management,” Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu wrote Friday. “However, the stock’s weakness seems warranted given the run-up since earnings and lack of a major AI partnership/deal announcement.”

Company unveils custom chip and self-driving plans

At the event, Rivian unveiled several new technologies. These included RAP1, a custom chip built for “physical AI” and self-driving features, along with updated software that acts as the vehicle’s brain, a new AI helper, and a plan for reaching “personal L4″—meaning cars that can drive themselves completely.

The rollout starts later this month with improvements to the hands-free driving system. Rivian plans to keep adding features until vehicles can drive fully on their own in the coming years. The company didn’t say exactly when full self-driving or a robotaxi service might arrive.

Before the event, Rivian shares had jumped more than 30% to $17.50. Even with those gains, the stock remains far below its IPO price of $78 per share in 2021.

Barclays analyst Dan Levy and others said the technology announcements, including the surprise chip reveal, looked good, but Rivian still needs to prove itself in difficult market conditions.

“With RIVN facing a tougher path to breakeven on core vehicle sales alone, we believe with enhanced AV/AI capabilities, RIVN is further paving the path to additional software/service revenues, which would be margin accretive,” Levy wrote Friday. “To be clear, there is certainly a ‘show me’ element for RIVN on its capabilities.”

The company faces several obstacles. Electric vehicle sales have slumped since tax credits worth up to $7,500 ended in September. Support from the Trump administration appears limited, and Rivian has internal problems with products and funding.

Several analysts pointed out that even Tesla, the top EV seller in America, struggles with low adoption of advanced driving features. Rivian is playing catch-up to competitors who have offered such systems for years.

Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe defended the company’s approach, saying building everything in-house, like software, AI, vehicle platforms, and other technology, will make the automaker faster and better than rivals.

“AI is enabling us to create technology and customer experiences at a rate that is completely different from what we’ve seen in the past,” Scaringe said at the event.

This strategy, plus Rivian’s $5.8 billion software partnership with Volkswagen previously reported by Cyptopolitan, has led Wall Street to value Rivian’s software business more than its car manufacturing operation.

Software business valued higher than car sales

Morgan Stanley, which recently downgraded the company, has a $12 price target that breaks down to $7 for software and services and $5 for making and selling vehicles. Some analysts think Rivian could license or sell its new technologies, including chips.

“RIVN is developing a suite of hardware and software offerings to remain competitive in an Auto 2.0 world. However, several risks remain around demand, potentially limiting data capture needed to reach higher levels of autonomy,” Morgan Stanley’s Andrew Percoco wrote Friday, according to CNBC.

Morgan Stanley kept its rating based on concerns about slow adoption of self-driving features, weak EV demand before the R2 launch next year, and a long road to making money.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan agreed: “The advancements enhance Rivian’s product offering but do not address ongoing concerns around liquidity and R2/R3 profitability.”",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rivian.webp,N,,2025-12-13 11:59:59.325767

Troy Balderson’s (R-Ohio) simple Affordable, Reliable, and Clean Energy Security Act underscored the titanic shift in the public psyche over the past decade. Note, it’s neither the “Clean and Reliable Act” nor the “Clean and Affordable Act.” Instead, affordability gets top billing.

This is no accident: Electricity costs are skyrocketing, and affordability is top of mind for Americans. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports average retail revenues per kWh increased in 46 states since last August. Those rates vary significantly from state to state, from a 23% increase in Maine to an 8% decrease in Hawaii.

Looking at American households, residential electricity rates alone rose by 6% over the last three months.

And this isn’t a recent phenomenon. The National Center for Energy Analytics points out that, since the beginning of 2010, the average change in residential electric prices increased by 63%.

What’s driving these double-digit increases? Customers are now experiencing the full impact of decades of divestment from reliable energy generation in favor of intermittent and costly substitutes. For decades, states have engaged in a green-tinted race to the bottom, competing over clean-energy credentials. States have increasingly imposed mandates for renewable energy and insisted that intermittent power from the sun and the wind was the most affordable option.

But in practice, this transition gave us higher rates and a fragile grid. Over the last five years, an alarming number of grid crises have rocked communities nationwide. Major events included the California heat wave in 2020, Winter Storm Uri in Texas in 2021, and Winter Storm Elliot in the mid-Atlantic in 2022. Elliot, though mild compared to other storms, revealed weak points in Pennsylvania’s grid.

Faced with no heat in the depths of winter or air conditioning in the height of summer, it didn’t take long for the consensus on clean and green to shift to reliable and affordable.

But rather than present a realistic correction, several elected leaders opted to scapegoat. Last December, five governors sued PJM Interconnection, claiming the grid operator failed to take steps to bring down prices. However, the prices these governors railed against were the predictable result of supply shortages stemming from their misguided policies, such as enforcing costly climate-related mandates and prematurely closing fossil fuel power plants.

Even blue-state governors have reversed course on the “clean is king” myth. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul approved a new gas pipeline through her state “to ensure grid reliability and affordability.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has touted lower costs as a major goal of the latest energy reform bill that ends the state’s moratorium on new nuclear generation. Energy affordability was the leading kitchen-table issue for the recent gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey — though the governors-elect’s policies are suspect.

Clean and green is no longer the consensus as residents begin to question when the rising rates will end.

In Pennsylvania, the pivot away from carbon taxes to spur clean energy was clear when the recent state budget eliminated the years-long effort to enter the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the multistate compact that caps emissions from power producers and sells “allowances” to them.

But the cap-and-trade scheme proved to be politically untenable. Economic forecasts showed that RGGI would increase electricity bills by 30%. Also, even with RGGI, forecasts showed increased carbon emissions across the PJM grid. Despite his best efforts to keep RGGI alive, Gov. Josh Shapiro relented, agreeing to withdraw his appeal to a lower court’s ruling that rightly stated RGGI was an unconstitutional tax–a noteworthy first for any state considering such a compact.

Clean is no longer top of mind, but affordability is. Poll after poll reveals a growing concern among voters about their ability to afford their utility bills.

Fortunately, Pennsylvania can show the way. In fact, the Keystone State pulled off the unimaginable: It cut emissions while also increasing electricity generation. Pennsylvania’s Independent Fiscal Office found that, from 2019 to 2024, the commonwealth removed seven million metric tons of carbon emissions — roughly the same amount cut by its RGGI neighbor to the east, New Jersey. However, during the same period, New Jersey’s electricity generation decreased by 13% while Pennsylvania’s increased by 5%.

With numbers like that, who needs RGGI?

Pennsylvania demonstrates that “affordability” and “clean” aren’t mutually exclusive terms. It is possible to have the best of both worlds.

And that’s what legislation like the Affordable, Reliable, and Clean Energy Security Act accomplishes: It reflects the voters’ desire to balance cost with reliability and environmental stewardship. Lucky for us, that’s precisely what markets can do.

In the U.S. alone, around 24 billion pounds of solvent waste was generated in 2024, according to an Environmental Protection Agency tracker. Some of these solvents — the liquid medium within which reactions are performed — are costly and pose hazards to the environment and human health.

Green chemistry is a movement that hopes to solve the solvent problem and make chemistry safer, more environmentally friendly and sustainable. Isaiah Speight, William & Mary assistant chemistry professor, recently talked with W&M News about the promise of green chemistry.

Speight studies mechanochemistry — the use of mechanical force to drive chemical reactions. He is one of 11 principal investigators involved in the National Science Foundation Center for the Mechanical Control of Chemistry. A collaboration across 14 institutions, including Texas A&M University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Vanderbilt University, this group is focused on establishing a fundamental understanding of mechanochemistry.

Speight has contributed several articles to Chemical & Engineering News on this topic, including “Why green chemistry makes science safer for everyone” and “Greening Chemistry: Time is a terrible reagent to waste.”

The Speight group’s work is one example of how the W&M community is driving forward sustainability research and working to safeguard the environment. Check out the Year of the Environment webpage to learn more about the university’s initiatives.

Q. What is green chemistry?

A. Green chemistry is less a specific technology and more a guiding philosophy. It’s a thought process of how to make chemistry environmentally safer and more sustainable, while also improving safety for the user. It considers the entire life cycle — from how materials are sourced to how a product is used and ultimately disposed of — with the goal of protecting everyone who interacts with the chemistry along the way. This holistic approach benefits not just the people doing the work, but the broader scientific and commercial communities.

Q. What sparked the genesis of green chemistry?

A. This mindset began gaining traction throughout the 20th century as chemists became more aware of the health and environmental impacts of their work. Earlier laboratory practices were often unsafe by today’s standards — people smoked in labs, mouth-pipetted and handled toxic chemicals with minimal protection. As evidence of harm accumulated, tighter regulations, safer practices and environmental protections followed. Those shifts helped lay the groundwork for what we now call green chemistry.

Q. How is the field of green chemistry developing today?

A. Today’s green chemists are focused on continuing to increase safety for people and the environment while also making chemistry more robust and reliable — meaning reactions are faster, safer and produce higher yields with less waste. Techniques like biocatalysis, photocatalysis and mechanochemistry help us do that by using safer solvents, fewer solvents or none at all.

Q. What are solvents and why can they be problematic?

A. Many chemical reactions are performed in solvents — meaning the reactants are dissolved in a liquid that facilitates the reaction. The issue with solvents is twofold. First, common solvents like chloroform and dimethylformamide can pose health risks to lab workers. Second, they make up a large component of chemical waste and can harm the environment.

Think about having a bowl of cereal. You finish the solid cereal, but the milk left in the bowl has served its purpose and gets poured down the drain. In this analogy, the milk is the solvent — it enabled you to eat the cereal efficiently, but once the “main ingredient” is gone, it’s treated as waste.

The same thing happens in many chemical reactions. You run a reaction, isolate the product and the solvent that enabled the reaction often has no further use, so it gets discarded.

Q. Tell me more about your specialty: What is mechanochemistry and how does it fit into green chemistry?

Instead of mixing chemicals in a solution to perform reactions, mechanochemistry uses mechanical energy, grinding for example, to make bonds or break them apart. Importantly, mechanochemistry uses little to no solvents, which is making it quite a hot field at the moment. But it’s not a new idea. Humanity has been doing mechanical grinding since the dawn of time: Think of grinding herbs to make medicines and spices or crushing berries to make paints for pictograms in caves.

Q. Beyond decreasing solvent use, what are other advantages of mechanochemistry?

A. So disclaimer: Mechanochemistry is not a panacea, but it does allow for some very unique reactivity profiles. For example, this approach can perform some reactions very quickly compared to liquid-based reactions.

If you look at a solution reaction, you’re just kind of swirling things around and hoping that they meet. Sometimes you have to wait a long time for this to happen, especially because a lot of reactions are run very dilute for safety reasons. But in a mechanochemical environment, there’s nothing else there but the reagents themselves. So the chemical compounds are always going to find each other.

And decreasing or eliminating solvents means that mechanochemistry isn’t bound by the rules of solubility. Reagents chemists would normally avoid — because they won’t dissolve or there’s no solvent that drives the reaction you want — suddenly become usable. It creates this open playground we can explore.

Q. How does your mechanochemistry lab differ from a standard chemistry lab?

A. In a standard chemistry lab, you’ll see round-bottom flasks and beakers for mixing solutions. Our lab is fundamentally different; everything we do is a “collision event” or a “grinding event.”

We use a very simple setup: hollow stainless-steel cylinders loaded with chemical reagents and a stainless-steel ball. We then apply force by shaking, spinning or vibrating these cylinders.

This movement isn’t just a way to mix materials; it is the chemistry itself. The specific motion and applied force guide the reaction, offering a powerful way to control outcomes and explore new chemical transformations that aren’t possible in a solution-based environment.

Q. Where do you see the field of green chemistry headed in the next few years?

A. The critical turning point for green chemistry is happening right now, driven by education.

We are training junior scientists to inherently think in an environmentally sustainable way. The future growth of the field lies in equipping the next generation of scientists with the mindset and tools needed to make discoveries in a safer, faster and more conscientious manner.

Q. What’s one way your lab is involved in this movement?

A. The National Science Foundation Center for the Mechanical Control of Chemistry is a multi-institution effort to figure out the fundamental “rules” of mechanochemistry — what makes a reaction work when force is applied, how reactions progress and how we can control them. My students and I are involved in this collaboration in a number of ways, from elucidating fundamental reactivity profiles of early stage mechanochemical reactions to designing 3D printed reaction vessels to creating a database of mechanochemical reactions.

QUOTES OF THE WEEK:

“Today is a win for Hoosiers, and a win for our democracy.”

— Megan Robertson, executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters, on the Indiana Senate’s decision not to advance a new gerrymandered congressional map.

“By raising costs with his bans on clean energy, and rolling back dozens of clean air and water protections, Trump is making life less sustainable for regular folks every day.”

— LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis on Trump receiving a medal from the Nobel Sustainability Trust.

“If passed as is, the PERMIT Act will increase pollution in our public waters and strip state and tribal rights to effectively protect their own waters. It will also dramatically increase water bills across the country, particularly in rural communities.”

— Representative Kristen McDonald Rivet speaking on the House floor in opposition of the PERMIT Act.

TOP NEWS IN ENERGY AFFORDABILITY

NEW REPORT OUTLINES HOW WE CAN SLASH ELECTRIC BILLS: A new report from RMI details how the affordability crisis is affecting people’s energy bills across the country, and provides solutions to reduce energy bills for our communities.

RMI TAKE: From the report, “Energy affordability is now a national concern, and many energy experts are saying we’d be lucky to stabilize costs, that cutting bills isn’t even possible. That’s wrong. We can actually cut energy bills a lot.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

HOUSE REPUBLICANS ADVANCE ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION: House Republicans advanced a slew of anti-environmental and pro-polluter permitting bills – including the PERMIT Act (H.R. 3898), H.R. 3668, and H.R. 3628 – that would make it easier for expensive dirty energy projects to get approved while sidelining clean, affordable energy, decimating clean water safeguards, and cutting out the public’s voice while doing nothing to lower energy costs.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis said, “We need to remove the barriers to building cheap and fast-to-deploy clean energy sources that are best positioned to meet rising energy demand, address skyrocketing costs, protect our communities, and ensure access to clean air and water. That starts with stopping the Trump administration from effectively banning clean energy, which threatens half of all new electricity projected to come onto our country’s grid in the next five years. It also means building transmission, speeding up the connection of clean energy projects, modernizing our grid and more.

“But House Republicans are doing none of these things. Instead, they are, once again, prioritizing handouts to their fossil fuel buddies, over helping support the real solutions to address skyrocketing energy costs for hardworking families. Passing this slate of extreme bills would further advantage expensive dirty energy, while kneecapping cheap clean energy and preventing public input on harmful projects that could impact our communities. Our public lands, waters, health and communities are at risk, as these bills could mean more pipelines, coal-fired power plants, and other projects polluting our air, water, and land.”

REP. QUIGLEY TAKE: Representative Mike Quigley, co-chair of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition and member of the New Democrats Coalition, said, “This week, House Republicans passed THREE BILLS to raise your electricity costs and abandon cheap, clean energy. Once again, they have chosen to double down on failed policies that have increased electricity prices 13% nationwide since the beginning of Trump’s term.”

ICYMI: STATE NEWS

INDIANA SENATE REJECTS TRUMP’S MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING PUSH: The Indiana state Senate voted 31-19 to reject a Trump-backed push to redraw congressional maps in the state. The proposed maps would have wiped out the only two Democratic districts in Indiana.

ICV TAKE: Indiana Conservation Voters Executive Director Megan Robertson said, “Today is a win for Hoosiers, and a win for our democracy. Lawmakers listened and made the right choice, and we are grateful.

“By halting this unnecessary and deeply unpopular attempt to redraw Indiana’s Congressional maps mid-decade, the Senate affirmed what people across our state have been saying for months: Hoosier leaders need to be focused on issues that affect our everyday lives, not a misguided plan to redraw maps that were just drawn four years ago.”

NEW YORK ESTABLISHES MANDATORY GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING PROGRAM: New York finalized new regulations that require major polluters including factories, power plants, landfills, and fossil fuel companies to measure and report their climate emissions annually. This data will allow state regulators to develop strategies to reduce pollution and track progress and is especially critical since EPA announced it will no longer require greenhouse gas emissions reporting.

NYLCV TAKE: New York LCV said, “We applaud Commissioner Lefton and the Department of Environmental Conservation for finalizing New York’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. With the EPA abandoning their duty to collect this information and protect Americans, this rule could not come at a better time. Reliable, comprehensive emissions data is essential for effective climate action, and this program will provide the information necessary to ensure clean air and healthier communities across New York.

“By identifying the state’s largest emitters, particularly those affecting disadvantaged communities, this rule also strengthens accountability and ensures solutions are directed where they’re needed most through the Clean Air Initiative. NYLCV celebrates this important step forward and will continue to work with state leaders to build a cleaner, healthier, and more equitable future for all New Yorkers.”

MARYLAND GOVERNOR REVERSES COURSE TO FUND CLIMATE CHANGE STUDY: Just months after he originally vetoed a bill to do the same, Governor Wes Moore announced he will approve $500,000 to study the impacts of climate change in Maryland.

SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT TRANSITIONS TO PFAS-FREE GEAR: The San Francisco Fire Department has become the largest fire department in the country to transition to gear that is not made using PFAS, or “forever chemicals.” PFAS are dangerous for human health, and can cause issues ranging from weakened immune system to increased risk for various cancers.

ICYMI: NATIONAL NEWS

SCOTUS POISED TO ROLL BACK 100 YEARS OF PRECEDENT TO GIVE TRUMP MORE POWER: The Supreme Court held oral arguments in the case Trump v. Slaughter this week. The case challenges Trump’s unlawful firing of Democratic Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, but extreme right-wing justices on the Supreme Court seem likely to rule in Trump’s favor, rejecting 100 years of precedent and handing more power to this president to fire independent agency heads.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Director of Judiciary and Democracy Doug Lindner said, “While the Trump administration continues to recklessly grab power from the people, extreme MAGA justices on the Supreme Court appear poised to hand over even more power to the MAGA president at the cost of our freedoms and protections. Giving Trump the green light to fire leaders of independent agencies in defiance of law passed by Congress is anti-constitutional and overturns nearly a hundred years of the Supreme Court’s own precedent. It would endanger our health, safety, freedoms, and protections from corporate abuses at a time when corporate money and power are rising in our politics due to rulings by these same MAGA justices. Preventing abuse of power is critical to ensuring our democracy works for all people across our country. We need judges who will respect the rule of law instead of enabling authoritarianism.”

LCVAF ENDORSES MARK WARNER FOR RE-ELECTION: LCV Action Fund announced its endorsement of Mark Warner for re-election to the Senate representing Virginia. Warner is a dedicated champion for our climate and our democracy.

LCVAF TAKE: LCV Action Fund Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld said, “Senator Mark Warner is fighting for a clean energy future and to protect the health and safety of our communities, while the Trump administration continues their attacks on our environment, government institutions and clean energy, raising utility costs for families. It has never been more critical for members of Congress to stand up for our democracy, our rights, and our climate, and LCVAF is all in to support Senator Warner for re-election.”

WARNER TAKE: Senator Mark Warner said, “I’m honored to earn the endorsement of the LCV Action Fund. I’m proud of my work negotiating the bipartisan infrastructure law and enacting the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which are delivering cleaner, more affordable energy. At a time when our country urgently needs more electricity, the Trump administration’s decision to cancel projects funded by these laws is driving costs up for families. I’m committed to working with partners like LCVAF to hold this administration accountable and repair the damage being done to our energy future and our environment.”

FEDERAL JUDGE STRIKES DOWN TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER HALTING WIND ENERGY: A federal judge has ruled that Trump’s executive order halting approvals for all wind energy projects on public lands and waters violates federal law. The order, signed on Trump’s first day in office, has slowed efforts to provide clean, affordable wind energy across the country.

ELM TAKE: Environmental League of Massachusetts Vice President of Policy and Regulatory Affairs Amy Boyd Rabin said, “Yesterday’s victory is a victory for offshore wind and for regulatory certainty. It shows that the federal government can’t make arbitrary rules against certain industries and allows offshore wind to start to get back on track, even within this administration and time period.”

Beijing’s crash-course construction program — both of its power plants and data centers — has contributed to the People’s Republic’s increasingly unsustainable debt burden.
“The Trump Department of Energy is preparing to finance up to 10 nuclear power plants in an effort to usher in a nuclear energy ‘renaissance,’” the Washington Free Beacon reported this week.
In addition, the administration will help finance the development of small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) — transportable nuclear power plants that can generate upwards of 300 megawatts of electricity.
This is a long-term problem, and a handful of nuclear reactors — whenever they eventually come online — will not solve it alone.","The Wall Street Journal has some bad news for the United States. The demand for power is on the rise. It’s expected to keep rising for the foreseeable future. And while China is poised to meet this challenge, America is not.

According to one Goldman Sachs estimate, China will have about “400 gigawatts of spare capacity” by 2030 — more than enough to meet both consumer needs and the demands of the energy-intensive AI sector. By contrast, over the next three years, “U.S. data centers could face an electricity shortfall of 44 gigawatts, the equivalent of New York state’s summertime capacity,” the Journal reports.

Last year, American data centers accounted for 45% of global data-center electricity consumption, according to the International Energy Agency, compared with 25% for China. . . .

Chinese data centers can now secure power for as little as 3 cents a kilowatt-hour using longer-term purchase agreements, according to China’s National Energy Administration. In the U.S., operators in markets such as northern Virginia typically pay 7 to 9 cents a kilowatt-hour, said Michael Rareshide, a partner in charge of the data-center practice at real-estate advisory Site Selection Group.

There may be bumps along the road to Chinese energy dominance. Beijing’s crash-course construction program — both of its power plants and data centers — has contributed to the People’s Republic’s increasingly unsustainable debt burden. Nor is it clear how the AI race will unfold in the long run, or whether the technology will merit the infrastructure investments it is precipitating. Straight-line projections tend to disappoint.

But there can be no doubt that the United States needs more power. With that imperative in mind, the Trump administration is taking steps to reduce the nation’s power deficit.

“The Trump Department of Energy is preparing to finance up to 10 nuclear power plants in an effort to usher in a nuclear energy ‘renaissance,’” the Washington Free Beacon reported this week.

In the outlet’s interview with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the WFB revealed the administration’s plan to provide low-interest financing for a push to build an initial tranche of reactors. That initiative dovetails with the administration’s efforts to get the nation’s mothballed reactors, like Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island and Michigan’s Palisades Nuclear Generating Station, back online.

In addition, the administration will help finance the development of small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) — transportable nuclear power plants that can generate upwards of 300 megawatts of electricity. Indeed, the administration revealed this week that it would provide $800 million to public initiatives and private enterprises designed to jumpstart SMR development.

This is a long-term problem, and a handful of nuclear reactors — whenever they eventually come online — will not solve it alone. But it’s a good start.

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Arrived

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

Worthy Bonds

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

IRA Financial

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo Idle Cash

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

American Hartford Gold

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts.

As the president aggressively abandons renewable energy, both the Ukraine and Japan calamities raise a question: Can one such calamitous nuclear power plant accident wipe out all the savings allegedly cheap nuclear power has brought to the damaged country?","For more than three decades I was the director of grants for a science foundation that funded, in large part, environmental protection. Over that time my attention increasingly turned toward news about huge nuclear power plant disasters, numerous radioactive waste leakages here and abroad, and the lack of a permanent U.S. radioactive-waste storage facility. Through subscribing to many science publications over these decades, I recognized that much of the reporting on these nuclear issues was contradictory, misleading, or incorrect, especially in the lay press — a trend that continues today.

The U.S. currently has 54 nuclear power plants with 94 operating reactors in 28 states. Soon there could be more: President Trump plans to resuscitate the nuclear power industry by building 10 new nuclear reactors, which are scheduled to begin operation as soon as 2030. To make that happen he is speeding up the approval and construction processes while simultaneously laying off more than 2,000 Department of Energy staffers — including Nuclear Security Administration employees.

Oh, and he’s simultaneously decapitating the green energy industry with $22 billion in clean energy projects cancelled just this year, according to an analysis at The Hill.

It all amounts to a huge gamble, not just for the country but for people’s lives — and the planet.

Companies That Profit From Nuclear Power Find Nuclear to Be Safe

Just last summer the U.S. Department of Energy published a long, congratulatory article about Trump’s four executive orders to speed along this process of licensing and launching new reactors. Similar cheerful articles come from the Nuclear Energy Institute, World Nuclear Association, International Atomic Energy Agency, and other organizations that make money from nuclear power.

Are people who do not work in the nuclear power industry similarly happy about this nuclear resurgence? Recent public-opinion surveys by organizations such as Pew Research Center, Bisconti Research, and Gallup suggest that a majority of Americans support nuclear power.

But there’s a problem if you look closer: For example, the Gallup poll asked participants “Do you favor or oppose nuclear energy as one of the ways to provide electricity for the U.S.?” The results yielded a 61% finding that Americans favor nuclear power “strongly” or “somewhat.” What there is no sign of in Gallup’s website discussion about this poll is questioning respondents about whether they ever heard of Chernobyl, Fukushima, or Three Mile Island, or know about the many radioactive leaks from plants in numerous locations in the United States and abroad, or that there’s nowhere to safely store radioactive waste that can remain active for millennia.

In the press coverage of this Gallup poll there was no sign of reporters who actually went beyond the press release summary to the Gallop website to examine the questions asked, find out how the survey audience was selected or how many people were in the survey that claims its results apply countrywide. Nonetheless, the results were found to be worth reporting as fact at Forbes, The Hill, Grist and others, including The Motley Fool.

The Problem Is Everywhere

Today approximately 440 nuclear power reactors operate in 31 countries. An additional 70 are under construction, and more than 110 are in various planning stages around the world, according to the World Nuclear Association.

Megacompanies investing billions in partnerships with nuclear plant owners to accommodate their energy-guzzling AI ambitions include Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.

As we’ve seen from the disasters at Three Mile Island, Fukushima and Chernobyl, there’s no such thing as a fail-safe nuclear plant, but these profit-making companies are prepared to take the gamble.

Around the world there have been at least 140 incidents of nuclear power plants malfunctioning in 17 countries, many of them with multiple incidents.

Each plant’s site will react in its own unpredictable way to earthquakes, floods, lightning strikes, wildfires, radioactive leaks, wartime bombs and terrorists, as well as more common human errors of construction and maintenance.

The companies building and operating these plants understand the risk, but as with all gambling, the house always wins. In the United States, reactor owners are limited to $500 million liability for damages by the Price Anderson Act. Retroactive insurance-payment increases can raise coverage, but ultimately the federal government — i.e., the taxpayer — covers damages that rise to hundreds of billions of dollars.

In Japan and Ukraine

To understand the risks, we need to keep the biggest nuclear disasters to date in mind, including the 1986 power plant explosion in Chernobyl, Ukraine, which was caused by errors in the design of the plant’s reactors, as well as errors in their maintenance.

The blast released 400 times more radiation than the Hiroshima bomb, contaminating 40,000 square miles with radioactivity. Residents’ descendants won’t be able to return to their family homes in the 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone for another 24,000 years.

The also disastrous 2011 nuclear plant meltdown in Fukushima, Japan, was caused by an earthquake’s tsunami flooding the plant. Explosions followed the four reactor meltdowns. This should not have come as a surprise: More than three dozen earthquakes have hit Japan since just the turn of the century, and the country registers tremors every day due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire, a subduction zone that causes the constant grinding of two plates in the earth’s mantle.

Estimates of Fukushima’s cleanup costs start at about $540 billion. But when you include the ripple effect throughout Japan’s lands, waters, and economy — along with the 30-40 year duration of the cleanup — costs will soar to 23.4 trillion yen or $1.6 trillion dollars, according to The Japan Times (in an article that was subsequently deleted from its site but remains accessible through Archive.org). An estimated 880 tons of radioactive fuel debris remains at the Fukushima plant and the release of treated, radioactive waters will go on for at least 30 years.

As with Chernobyl, cost estimates do not and cannot accurately include all financial losses that will drift through these economies for decades. While not much information has been published about Chernobyl-caused losses, we do know that Japan does not include indirect economic losses such as the car exports that plummeted after the meltdown, long-term tourism declines, the cost of clearing the ghost towns, years of healthcare expenditures, the cost of contaminated food-fish from untreated radioactive water that leaked into the ocean and soils, and more.

In the United States

The most radioactively polluted site in the world is right here in the United States: the Hanford nuclear site in Washington state, launched in 1944 and still home to 53 million gallons of nuclear waste. Cleanup estimates range from $364 billion to $589 billion with a 2086 completion date, according to a 2025 report from the Department of Energy.

At our 94 operating reactors, the radioactive waste produced is stored right at these facilities, many of which have been known to leak this waste. In 2017 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission released a list of 43 leaks at 65 nuclear power plants, but it includes only tritium leaks. In 2024 the commission put out a second such list in which the number of known tritium leaks dropped to 37 without clear explanation. Since then leaks have been reported state by state, in the absence of a comprehensive list.

What we do know that there is no safe, permanent radioactive-waste storage site in the country — despite the prolonged effort to establish one at Yucca Mountain, Nevada — nor will there ever be a 100% safe way to transport this waste.

Any nuclear reactors operating today — or soon to be built — will become permanent additions to the landscape. It’s not possible to truly “shut down” nuclear reactors after an accident or after they have run their projected life spans. They remain radioactive indefinitely and will always require flawless maintenance of containment domes — assuming we design domes that can function indefinitely. For example, iodine-129 and cesium-135, both produced by nuclear plants and found in nuclear waste, have half-lives of 15.7 million years and 2.3 million years respectively.

While We Build New Nuclear Plants We Waste Energy

Proponents claim we need energy output from these new reactors, but we could achieve the same goals by using energy more efficiently — something we’re still not very good at. Here are some key sources of wasted energy:

Cars and trucks: According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, in 2022 there were a total of 278,870,463 trucks and cars — mostly occupied by a single individual — registered to drivers. Most of these vehicles are bigger and heavier than those in other parts of the world, thus consume more energy according to The Economist.

Electricity: Lights that burn all night, including in empty buildings, are a well-known phenomenon in this country and the problem is increasing at the rate of almost 10% a year. This can be traced to a number of problems: Indifference and ignorance are high on the list, as are inadequate policy and insufficient coverage in the press about the damage done.

Food: The Food and Drug Administration estimates that between 30% and 40% of our food supply becomes waste. In 2010 FDA research found that 133 billion pounds of food worth $161 billion turned into garbage.

Artificial intelligence: AI is extremely energy consuming, and our skyrocketing commitment to it will send energy demand soaring. Power consumption for AI data centers here is anticipated to amount to almost half of the growth in electricity demand by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. The IEA finds that “Driven by AI use, the US economy is set to consume more electricity in 2030 for processing data than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined…”

Trump Betrumps

As Trump plans to reboot the nuclear power industry, relaunching the Indian Point plant is on the agenda. It shut down in 2021 after 59 years in operation. From 1973 to 2016 there were at least 14 accidents — radioactive leaks, fire, and equipment failures — as well as numerous incidents of sending contaminated water into the Hudson River. This is the plant that’s 25 miles from New York City. If a disaster were to strike Indian Point, there is no safe way to evacuate the city’s millions of residents and the millions more that live nearby.

The Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, about 170 miles from Manhattan, is also set to reboot as early as 2027. The plant’s 1979 meltdown, caused in large part by human error, brought about the shutdown of one of its two reactors just three months after it launched. Two million people were exposed to low-level radiation — insufficient to harm them, due only to good luck. The cleanup took from 1979 to 1993 and cost $2 billion.

In his enthusiasm for nuclear power, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from participation in the United Nation’s international Paris Agreement climate accord on the first day of his second term. With this move he retracted our promised $4 billion contribution to that effort. Trump’s EPA also halted $7 billion in federal grants for solar panels allocated to low- and moderate-income families.

Meanwhile Trump makes frequent claims that climate change is a “hoax.” At the recent U.N. General Assembly convening, in a speech before 150 world leaders, he called the wind energy and solar power alternatives to nuclear a “scam” and “con job.”

His alternatives are anything but clean: Trump has issued numerous executive orders to expedite oil (which can cause spills), natural gas (well known for its explosions), and coal mining (a major cause of air pollution).

As the president aggressively abandons renewable energy, both the Ukraine and Japan calamities raise a question: Can one such calamitous nuclear power plant accident wipe out all the savings allegedly cheap nuclear power has brought to the damaged country?

In light of the decades-long — and for some elements millennia long — recuperation process, the question is unanswered.

And unanswerable.

Source: XCF Global, Inc.","XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX); Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (""Southern""); and DevvStream Corp. (""DevvStream"") (Nasdaq:DEVS) (together ""the parties"") today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform and Strategic Integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, said:

""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream, said:

""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential Multi-Pathway SAF Collaboration and Offtake Framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern, added:

""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF Facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added:

""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.

DOE News:

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Assistant Secretary Tim Walsh welcomed U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to the Hanford Site last week.

“I was honored to show U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright the tremendous progress on full display at Hanford,” Assistant Secretary Walsh said. “I congratulate Ray Geimer and his team, our contractor partners and hardworking craftworkers for advancing our critical missions at Hanford. I look forward to building relationships across Hanford, regulators, Congress, tribes, and the community to advance cleanup solutions, unleash economic vitality and unlock potential in the Tri-Cities.”

Secretary Wright and Assistant Secretary Walsh participated in a comprehensive tour of the Direct-Feed Low-Activity (DFLAW) system that has turned over 36,000 gallons of tank waste into glass since October.

Should the mandate hold, dealers will be navigating a market where EV expectations rise faster than consumer confidence.","A new national survey suggests the federal zero-emissions vehicle mandate is struggling to win over Canadians, raising questions about how quickly consumers are prepared to shift to electric vehicles as sales targets tighten.

The Leger poll, commissioned by the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association (CVMA), Global Automakers of Canada (GAC) and the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA), found that only 31 per cent of respondents support the policy, while nearly half (46 per cent) would like to see it scaled back or scrapped.

Industry leaders say the findings reflect a gap between government ambitions and consumer readiness. “Canadians want support to transition to electric vehicles, not unrealistic government mandates that can’t be met,” said Brian Kingston, CVMA president and CEO, in a statement.

The federal mandate requires ZEVs to make up 20 per cent of new light-duty vehicle sales in 2026, 60 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Plug-in hybrids, battery-electric vehicles and fuel-cell models all qualify.

The results of the poll arrive at a moment of cooling momentum for EV sales. ZEVs represented 10.2 per cent of new-vehicle sales in September, down 43.3 per cent from a year earlier.

The poll also suggests that vehicle availability at dealerships, once a prominent concern, is no longer viewed as a major barrier, with only 11 per cent citing it. Instead, Canadians continue to flag affordability, driving range and charging access as the factors limiting adoption.

The persistence of these concerns since 2021 underscores how little progress has been made on core infrastructure and cost challenges.

Why it matters: Nissan is betting on U.S.-built hybrids to compete with Toyota while tariffs reshape the industry.

The Details

Meunier took over as Americas chairman in January 2025 during a company-wide crisis that included 9,000 job cuts and a failed merger with Honda.

The company’s U.S. market share has inched up from 4% to 5% this year by tailoring production to dealer demand rather than bulk output.

Nissan plans to bring its e-Power hybrid technology to the U.S. in 2026 with the Rogue, initially importing from Japan before ramping up Tennessee production in 2027.

Meunier met with U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn last week to discuss accelerating e-Power localization at the Decherd engine plant, according to The Tennessean.

“We need to start selling cars, make money, take care of the customer, forget the rest,” Meunier said. “Cut the bureaucracy, cut the things that don’t add value.”

By the Numbers

FY 2024-25 Operating Loss: 215.9 billion yen ($1.39 billion)

U.S. Market Share: 5% (up from 4%)

Pre-Billing Rate: 60% (up from 30% six months ago)

Rogue Sales Growth (Jul-Sep): +8.9% year-over-year

Pathfinder Sales Growth: +33.2%

Frontier Sales Growth: +19.2%

e-Power Rogue Production Goal (2027): 300,000 units annually in Smyrna

EVXL’s Take

Meunier’s back-to-basics approach shows early traction, but Nissan remains years behind Toyota on hybrids. While Toyota opened its $14 billion North Carolina battery plant last month and doubled down on the hybrid strategy it never abandoned, Nissan is scrambling to bring e-Power technology that debuted in Japan back in 2016. The timing is brutal: Nissan missed the hybrid boom that Toyota rode to record profits.

Tariffs are forcing Nissan’s hand. By localizing e-Power production in Tennessee, Meunier can sidestep import duties while positioning the company for a market that has decisively shifted away from pure EVs. The question is whether Nissan can execute fast enough. As we documented when Nissan posted its record $5.26 billion loss earlier this year, the company’s financial runway is shrinking.

The sweeping legislation signed into law on July 4 phases out the credit starting in 2031 and eliminates it in 2034, removing what had been a permanent incentive under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

The change is forcing companies to reassess project viability and make difficult operational decisions as they compete with lower-cost foreign suppliers, particularly from China and Russia. The 45X credit provides up to 10% of production costs for US-based producers of critical minerals including cobalt, graphite, palladium and platinum — materials essential for renewable energy infrastructure, advanced electronics and defense systems.

Removing the 45X tax credit ""was a huge hit to us,"" said Heather McDowell, senior vice president and general counsel for legal and external affairs, Americas, at Sibanye Stillwater Ltd. ""Having that tax credit indefinitely is really what we expected.""

The company, whose Montana operations include the only US-based palladium, platinum and rhodium mine, has cut approximately 40% of its workforce in recent months, McDowell said.

Operational impacts

Matthew Lengerich, president and executive general manager at Jervois Mining USA Ltd., said his company expanded its Finland project into the US specifically because of the 45X tax credit and other incentives. Jervois operates the only US-based cobalt mine in Idaho, though it has faced operational challenges due to price volatility.

""The project doesn't work without that tax credit,"" Lengerich said, highlighting the fundamental role the incentive played in making US critical mineral projects economically viable.

The discussion reflects broader challenges facing the US critical minerals sector as it attempts to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers while competing against state-subsidized operations. Price support mechanisms are a topic of increasing debate among business leaders and policymakers, with some arguing that Western projects cannot survive without effective government backing.

Perhaps the most obvious of those other diminishing safety nets is groundwater. Data on groundwater reserves throughout the basin is spotty at best. One approximation of a truly regional assessment comes from a creative use of satellite-based tools—namely NASA’s GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) system that can detect tiny changes in gravitational forces associated with the fluctuating mass of aquifers losing (or gaining) storage. Those findings paint a truly disturbing picture. Despite the familiar (and troubling) images of bathtub rings emerging at Mead and Powell, researchers using GRACE data now estimate that, from 2002 to 2024, nearly two-thirds of storage—both surface and groundwater—lost in the Colorado River Basin actually came from groundwater depletions.2 Significant groundwater losses have occurred throughout the basin, but the problem is particularly acute in Arizona and is likely to accelerate as shortages in Central Arizona Project (CAP) deliveries are likely offset by groundwater pumping—an ironic outcome given that CAP was originally proposed as the solution to groundwater mining in the region. Simply shifting unsustainable surface water uses to unsustainable groundwater uses does nothing to address the core mismatch of supplies and demands.

A very different and multi-faceted trend undercutting the regional safety nets is happening within the federal government, where federal agencies, programs and science programs are being systematically dismantled under the guise of “efficiency.” It’s hard to understate the significance of these actions, as it is the federal government that, presumably, has the scope, mandate and resources to oversee the entirety of the River and the full diversity of its roles and values. Interior Department agencies in 2025, like much of the overall federal bureaucracy, have been tasked to achieve significant staffing reductions, and to eliminate (or significantly scale back) spending on key water conservation programs—including programs under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and WaterSMART.3

Additionally, agencies across the federal landscape have mobilized to coerce and shut down climate-related science and scientists, despite the nearly universal acknowledgment among water managers of the central role of climate change in the unfolding crisis.4 Collectively these efforts constitute a systematic effort to discredit and hide the primary cause of the broken water budget, while sabotaging the most effective coping mechanisms available. As members of the research community, the Colorado River Research Group (CRRG)unfortunately has a front-row seat to this culling of the people and programs essential to long-term data collection and analysis. It defies logic, and is dangerous.

Unfortunately, hostility toward the people and programs essential to responding to the Colorado River crisis is not the full extent of federal obstruction. One largely unappreciated threat to the water budget resulting from federal policy shifts comes from efforts to “re-carbonize” (and accelerate) water-intensive energy generation, in part to meet the demands of AI, a particularly troubling trend given that the previous emphasis on renewable energy generation and enhanced energy conservation was one of the few positive trends working to repair the regional water budget.5 Attempts to weaken or dismantle bedrock environmental laws, such as NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, are an additional wildcard likely to inflict irreparable harm on already strained species and ecosystems.6

Given the turmoil at the federal level, it’s tempting to absolve the States for stubbornly clinging to a policy making system reliant on 7-state dealmaking, but that would ignore the reality that the governance of the river has been a problem for decades. A seemingly never-ending series of crisis-inspired negotiations, held in largely secretive forums without direct tribal involvement or tools for meaningful public or scientific engagement, is an uninspired way to manage and protect the economic, cultural and environmental heart of the American Southwest. The river is too big and too important to govern in such an ad hoc and primitive manner. [ed. emphasis mine]

That this approach mostly ”worked” to keep deliveries flowing for so long—except, of course, for the tribes and the environment—rested, in part, on the accepted norm that decisions would emerge collaboratively from the States and would not spill over to the federal courts. But even that governance safety net is eroding, as the States seem to be increasingly resigned—and almost “comfortable”—with the notion that the resolution of existing conflicts may not emerge from a negotiated 7-state agreement. For those parties and viewpoints that have historically been left out of the state-dominated processes and the resulting agreements, then maybe this prospect is welcome. But all would concede that would be a stunning outcome with ramifications that are difficult to predict.

Ever since the Arizona v. California experience, the use of litigation to resolve interstate (and/or interbasin) conflicts in the basin has been a third rail issue, and for very good reasons. As shown by the basin’s earlier foray into Supreme Court action, the process would undoubtedly be lengthy, expensive, and likely to create as many issues and questions as it resolves. It certainly wouldn’t reduce risk, as the states, and the water management community more broadly, would lose control over the process of managing the shared resource. In fact, judicial intervention might be the impetus to trigger yet another traditionally feared decision pathway to be invoked—a Congressional rewrite of river allocation and management—either before or after the litigation concludes. In this setting, the extreme disparity in political influence—as measured by the number of Congressional representatives—between the Upper and Lower Basin is an obvious concern, as is the realization that congressional involvement means the future of the Colorado now becomes a national issue and, potentially, a bargaining chip to be used in the political logrolling necessary to enact legislation in dozens of otherwise unrelated areas.

In Colorado, as in most of the West, older water rights take priority over newer ones when there’s not enough water to satisfy everyone’s claims. On the Colorado River, the Shoshone Hydropower rights limit the amount of water that can be taken out of the river upstream by junior rights that divert water from the river’s headwaters through tunnels under the Continental Divide to cities and farms on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. The new deal to enable the Shoshone rights to be used for environmental flows would preserve those limitations on transmountain diversions in perpetuity.

Upstream from the power plant, near the ranching town of Kremmling, Colorado, the river carries less than half the water it would without the existing transmountain diversions. This stresses fish populations and the iconic cottonwood groves that line the river. The Shoshone rights downstream prevent these diversions from being even larger. Because the power plant returns all the water it uses to the river without consuming it, the water continues to provide benefits downstream from the plant to rafters, farms, cities and four species of endangered fish that exist only in the Colorado River Basin. Securing these flows for the future is particularly important as climate change continues to reduce the river’s flow, which has already declined by roughly 20% over the past two decades.

The people cheering in the hearing room represented cities, towns, counties and irrigation districts from up and down the Colorado River. Their entities had pledged ratepayer and taxpayer dollars to help secure the rights in the complex transaction spearheaded by the Colorado River Water Conservation District. Environmental organizations, including American Rivers, Audubon, Trout Unlimited and Western Resource Advocates, were also parties to the hearing and supportive of the deal, but were vastly outnumbered.

The Coloradans cheering in that room were there because their constituents’ livelihoods, clean drinking water and quality of life depend on a living Colorado River.

For the first time ever, and after decades of failure, the world’s countries agreed to a single international climate treaty — one that applied to developed and developing countries alike.

Since then, international climate diplomacy has played out on what is, more or less, the Paris Agreement’s calendar. The quasi-quinquennial rhythm of countries setting goals, reviewing them, and then making new ones has held since 2015. A global pandemic has killed millions of people; Russia has invaded Ukraine; coups and revolutions have begun and ended — and the United States has joined and left and rejoined the treaty, then left again — yet its basic framework has remained.

Perhaps you can tell: I am not among those who believe that the treaty has been a failure, although it would be difficult — in this politically arid moment — to call it a complete success. Yet the ensuing decade has seen real progress in limiting global temperature rise. When negotiators gathered to finalize the agreement, it seemed likely that global average temperatures could rise by 4 degrees Celsius by 2100, as compared to their pre-industrial level. Today, a rise from 2.5 to 3 degrees Celsius seems more likely.

And for a document that is often described as non-binding, or even as hortatory, Paris has had a surprisingly material influence on global politics in the ensuing years. During the negotiations, the small-island states — the three dozen or so countries most affected by near-term sea-level rise — successfully got the final text to recognize a “stretch goal” of limiting warming to just 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. They also tasked the United Nations’ advisory scientific body to prepare a special report on the virtues of avoiding 1.5 degrees of warming. When that report was released in 2018, it catalyzed a new wave of global climate action, spawning the European Green Deal — and eventually the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.

Yet there is at least one way that Paris did not go as imagined.

Cast your mind back to Paris 10 years ago, right as diplomats filed in and began to applaud the final text’s completion. “This is a tremendous victory for all of our citizens — not for any one country or any one bloc, but for everybody here who has worked so hard to bring us across the finish line,” John Kerry, then the U.S. secretary of state, declared to his fellow diplomats.

It was a strange kind of victory. After decades in which western liberals had attempted to secure a globally binding climate treaty — an agreement that would limit each country’s greenhouse gas emissions — the world finally won a non-binding alternative. Under the Paris Agreement, each country would pledge to cut its emissions by as much as it could manage. Countries would then meet regularly to review these pledges, encourage each other to get more ambitious, and gradually ratchet the world into a lower-carbon future.

Kerry was reasonably direct about how such a mechanism would work: capital markets. “We are sending literally a critical message to the global marketplace,” he said. “Many of us here know that it won’t be governments that actually make the decision or find the product, the new technology, the saving grace of this challenge. It will be the genius of the American spirit.”

He was right, in a way: The Paris Agreement did send a signal to the global marketplace— and it did so in part because governments did shape policy and investment outcomes, not because they resisted doing so. But it did not reveal the genius of the American spirit, per se.

In the years running up to and following the Paris Agreement, China rolled out a series of important policies to boost its new energy sectors — a roadmap encouraging “new energy vehicle” sales in 2012, billions of consumer subsidies beginning in 2014, and a domestic content mandate for electric-vehicle batteries in 2015. These programs — along with canny decisions made by Chinese entrepreneurs and engineers, and no small amount of demand pull from companies and policies in the West — have transformed the world’s approach to decarbonization. They have begun to change even what decarbonization means — in the United States, in the western democracies, and around the world.

Ten years ago, Kerry could assume that any eventual solution to climate change would be geopolitically neutral, if not advantageous to the United States. But in 2025, to a degree that commentators still hesitate to describe, the climate story has become the China story. Across a range of sectors, how a country approaches its near-term decarbonization goals depends on how it understands and relates to the Chinese government and Chinese companies.

Consider the power sector, which generates just under a third of all greenhouse gas emissions globally. For many countries, the best way to cut carbon pollution — and to add more power generation to the grid — will be to build new utility-scale solar and battery projects. That will all but require working with Chinese firms, which dominate 80% of the solar supply chain. (They command up to 98% market share for some pieces of equipment, according to the International Energy Agency.)

It is much the same story in the grid-scale battery industry. China produces more than three-quarters of the world’s batteries, and it refines most of the minerals that go into those batteries. Its batteries are at least 20% cheaper than those made in Europe or North America. Most of the world’s top battery firms are Chinese — in part because they have more experience than anyone else; the country’s firms have manufactured 70% of all lithium-ion batteries ever produced. Nearly two dozen countries have bought at least $500 million in Chinese-made batteries this year, according to the think tank Ember.

What if a country wants to build wind turbines, not batteries? Even then, it will have to work to buy non-Chinese products. Although European and American firms have long led among turbine makers, six of the top 10 wind turbine manufacturers are now in mainland China, according to BloombergNEF. And for the first time since analysts’ rankings began in 2013, none of the world’s top three turbine makers are North American or European.

Transportation generates another 13% of global climate emissions. If a country wants to tackle that sector, then it will find itself (again) working with China — which made more than 70% of the world’s EVs in 2024. Thanks to the country’s sprawling battery and electronics-making ecosystem, its home-grown automakers — BYD, Geely, Xiaomi, and others — can produce more affordable, innovative, and desirable EVs at greater scale and at lower cost than automakers anywhere else. “The competitive reality is that the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry,” Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, said recently. As the scholar Ilaria Mazzocco put it in a recent report: “Chinese companies are ubiquitous in the value chain for EVs and battery components, meaning that for most countries, climate policy is now at least in part linked to policy toward China, and more specifically trade with China.”

That insight — that climate policy is now linked to policy toward China — will apply more and more, even when countries wish to tackle the remaining third of emissions that come from energy-related sources. Earlier this year, China approved a plan to build roughly 100 low-carbon industrial parks by 2030, where its firms will develop new ways to capture carbon, make steel, and refine chemicals without carbon pollution. (The Trump administration revoked funding for similar low-carbon projects in the U.S. earlier this year.) At the same time, China is building more conventional nuclear reactors than the rest of the world combined, and it may be pulling ahead of the United States in the race to develop commercial fusion.

This wasn’t inevitable. It happened because Chinese politicians, executives, and engineers decided to make it happen — choices owing as much to the government’s focus on energy security as to its concern for the global environmental commons. But it was also the result of American business leaders and politicians squandering this country’s leadership in climate technologies — and especially the result of choices made by Trump administration officials, who at nearly every opportunity have regarded batteries and electric vehicles as a technological sideshow to the more profitable oil and gas sector.

It was the Trump administration, after all, that licensed and then eventually gave U.S.-funded research on flow batteries to a Chinese company in 2017. It was the Trump administration that gutted fuel economy and clean car rules in 2018 and 2019, setting the American car industry back compared to its Chinese and European competitors. And it was the Trump administration and congressional Republicans that killed electric vehicle tax credits earlier this year, further choking off investment.

For progressives, this all might suggest a pleasant parable: China embraced the energy transition, and America didn’t, and now America is paying for it. Nowadays, commentators often invoke China’s clean energy dominance to inspire awe at its accomplishments. And how can you not, in truth, be impressed? China’s industrial miracle — its move to the frontier of global technological development — is the most important story of the past quarter century. The scale of the Chinese consumer market and the success of Chinese industrial policy (or, at least, its success so far) has wrenched world history in new directions. And Chinese companies have done humanity a great service by bringing down the cost of solar panels, batteries, and EVs on the supply side, even if they did so at first with demand-side assistance from policies in California or Europe.

But climate advocates in North America and Europe cannot be completely sanguine about what this development means globally. For environmentalists and other western liberals who have worked in decarbonization for decades, it will in particular require some rhetorical and political adjustment. We cannot pretend that we are playing by the 1990s’ rules, nor that environmental activism is but one part of a post-1970s progressive coalition, which is free to make demands and ignore inconvenient trade-offs. Basic questions of decarbonization policy now have patent geopolitical significance, which environmental groups attempt to side-step at their own peril.

Yet it isn’t only Americans or Europeans who must answer these questions. China’s dominance of decarbonization technology means that for the time being, every country on Earth must address this dynamic. When the scholar Mazzocco looked at how six countries around the world are approaching Chinese EVs, she found an uneven landscape, she told me on a recent podcast. Costa Rica, which has long embraced climate policy, has welcomed Chinese-made EVs; Brazil opened its doors to them but has now begun to close it.

Most major countries have some form of domestic automaking industry; no country will be able to sit back and passively allow Chinese exports to drive their local automakers out of business. At the same time, China’s manufacturing primacy is already making conventional export-driven growth less attractive for countries. And that will only be the beginning of the dilemmas to come. As long as going green requires buying and integrating Chinese technologies into critical infrastructure, environmental policymakers will be wagering decarbonization’s success on some of the world’s highest stakes geopolitical bets.

Environmentalists have long insisted climate change is a national security issue, but are we ready to think and act like it is? Do Western anxieties about a large and globalized war — either a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a Russian invasion of the EU, or both — reflect a reasonable response to a real and growing menace, or an elite panic driven by our declining economic primacy? If China were to invade Taiwan, what would that mean for climate and energy policy — not only in the West, but around the world? Would American or European environmentalists even get a vote on that question — and if they do, how would they balance emissions reduction against other goals? If the unthinkable happens, we will all be called to account.

A decade ago, I remember watching the live stream of the world’s diplomats applauding their own success in Paris and realizing that I would be seeing that video in documentaries and news reels for the rest of my life. How will I see it then? I wondered. Would it strike me as the naivete of a simpler time, an era when liberal internationalism still seemed possible? Or would it really reflect a turning point, the moment when the world took the climate challenge seriously, pragmatically, and began to decarbonize in earnest? A decade later, I still don’t know. Perhaps the answer is both.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjM0NTA4Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDM4OTY5OX0.eedqTiD2E1YHyRgnRHgQq28I74lf7ahVhGlpcoSeNEM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:37.545558

The new capital, approved under a Hawai‘i Public Utilities Commission order, will enable more households, nonprofits, and small businesses in the Hawaiian Electric service area to install renewable energy systems and efficiency upgrades. The commission’s order recognizes the urgency of expanding affordable financing options as federal tax credit rules evolve and national policy changes reshape the solar market.

This additional funding comes at a critical time. federal Solar for All funds are tied up in litigation, and the federal solar Investment tax credit for homeowner-owned systems is set to expire Dec. 31. Although commercial tax credits remain available through 2027, many projects face shortened timelines due to new federal legislation.

Authority Executive Director Gwen Yamamoto-Lau said the agency is moving quickly to fill that gap for local customers.

“We are thrilled with the PUC’s approval to modify Order No. 34930, allowing us to make $18 million in additional loan capital immediately available,” Yamamoto-Lau said. “With Hawai‘i’s high electricity costs, this support will help nonprofits, small businesses, and low- and moderate-income households reduce their energy burden and improve resiliency.”

Through the authority’s Green Energy Money $aver on-bill repayment program, customers can finance clean energy improvements — including solar photovoltaic systems, battery storage, solar water heaters, heat pump water heaters, and commercial energy-efficiency retrofits — without the need for traditional tax incentives. Loan eligibility and projected savings are calculated independently of federal tax credits.

The GEMS program, established by Act 211 (2013), was designed to make clean energy financing more inclusive by providing below-market rates and flexible loan terms for those who may not qualify for conventional financing.

The rare joint effort between the factions — factions that fought tooth-and-nail during the 2025 legislative session over labor’s attempt to make it easier for Colorado workers to unionize and take union negotiating fees directly from paychecks — was meant to call attention to the range of leaders concerned about this issue. In six panel discussions at the north Denver headquarters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union, speakers detailed rising costs linked to environmental restrictions, lost job opportunities and a declining business atmosphere in the state.

If Black Hills Energy were forced to implement Colorado’s newly approved Clean Heat Plan immediately, it would increase customers’ bills by $215 per month, said Maria Garduna, sustainability and climate senior manager for the utility. Meanwhile, the state’s focus on boosting renewable energy sources is limiting job opportunities and making it harder to attract jobs in fields like manufacturing, said Gary Arnold, business manager for the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters.

“We came together out of a simple idea — Colorado can meet the state’s climate and energy goals while balancing that with affordability. Our mission is to bring practical, real-world solutions to those goals,” said Ray Rivera, coalition director for the newly formed Colorado Energy Crossroads. “The challenges we’re facing aren’t theoretical. They’re here now. They’re real. This is happening.”

State has passed numerous laws to cut emissions

Gov. Jared Polis and Democratic legislators have worked since 2019 to reduce emissions through new mandates, pointing repeatedly to the northern Front Range’s noncompliance with federal ozone standards. Air pollution leads to increased respiratory and cardiovascular afflictions and has left leaders in some communities near industrial sites complaining they are subject to constant dirty air that triggers asthma attacks and forces residents to stay inside.

Since the Democratic governor took office six years ago, the state has enacted emissions-reduction rules on the oil-and-gas industry, manufacturing sites, large commercial buildings and even users of gas-powered lawn-and-garden equipment. Several representatives of environmental groups and Polis’ administration, as well as legislators who supported the new laws, attended Friday’s event but did not speak on any panels.

Over that time, however, it also has gotten prohibitively expensive to live and do business in Colorado and has led to the loss of numerous job-expansion opportunities that the state used to win, several business leaders on the panels said. Colorado Chamber of Commerce President/CEO Loren Furman noted Colorado has the third-highest housing costs, the fifth-highest cost of living and the 13th-highest cost of doing business. according to sources like CNBC and U.S. News & World Report — in no small part due to it having the 6th-most regulations nationally.

Limiting sources of energy a shared problem for groups

The Clean Heat Plan, a proposal approved last week by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission that calls for a 41% reduction in home-heating emissions in 10 years and 100% electrification of homes by 2050, took significant criticism from panel participants. Garduna noted natural gas cost four times less in 2024 than a similar amount of electricity, and Sara Espinoza Blackhurst, president/CEO of the Action 22 group representing union-heavy southeast Colorado, said the decision shows a “disregard for labor.”

Melissa Shatler — assistant director of labor outreach and workforce equity for Climate Jobs, an organization trying to bridge the gap between unions and environmental activists — said such decisions show the need for labor representatives on deliberative panels. Dan Hendricks, apprenticeship training director for the Joint Electrical Apprenticeship and Training Committee, decried the state’s focus on getting people trained to install solar panels or build windmills and said it should adopt an “all-of-the-above” approach to preparing Coloradans to work in fields using both traditional and renewable energy.

“If you’re going to train a wind tech, shame on you. If you’re going to train a solar tech, shame on you. We need to train electricians,” said Hendricks, a longtime labor leader. “You need an agile, well-trained workforce that can work anywhere, not just one pigeonholed job that you believe you need right now.”

Further emissions-reduction mandates under consideration

Friday’s event came two days after Polis released a report arguing that the state needs to streamline its workforce-development programs under one new state agency, in order to give students and employers easier access to a wide range of job-training programs.

And the event comes as some Democratic legislators have discussed running a bill in 2026 that would speed up by 10 years, to 2040, the deadline for utilities to get to net-zero carbon emissions. The status of the bill is uncertain, as it’s received significant pushback from utility, business and labor leaders — largely the same coalition that came together at IBEW HQ — because of its costs and potential impacts on jobs of gasline-maintenance workers and others.

A survey commissioned by the coalition and done by Searchlight Research and Impact Research, found that state residents generally backed the current goals but pulled back on support when asked about speeding up the deadline and potentially increasing utility costs. The same poll found that two-thirds of respondents support a mix of energy that involves natural gas, wind, solar, geothermal and nascent nuclear resources rather than a renewable-energy-only approach and that 54% of likely voters said they would be less likely to support a candidate wanting to speed up the 2050 deadline.

Coalition to keep raising voices on energy issues

“The primacy of economic concerns, the affordability concerns … was one of my most important takeaways,” Impact Research partner Jeff Liszt said.

Coalition members didn’t announce a next step following the Friday summit but said they are planning to continue to press the message that Colorado needs to consider affordability, as well as resiliency of its electric grid, as it considers climate actions. And they hope that by bringing together partners who don’t always see eye to eye, Polis and other leaders will consider the message as one that comes from a wide swath of people.

“What we heard today is that Coloradans have a deep focus and a bent to doing the right thing environmentally — but at the same time, a big focus on affordability,” said Dave Davia, president/CEO of business group Colorado Concern.",https://tsscolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Energy-Summit-Davia-Panel-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:45.332334

The state Legislature would need to pass another law to allow PG&E to operate the power plant past 2030.","PG&E is one step closer to keeping Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant open until 2030.

On Thursday, the California Coastal Commission voted 9-3 to give PG&E a coastal development permit that will extend the power plant’s life.

The permit requires PG&E to dedicate thousands of acres of surrounding land to conservation to offset the negative environmental impacts of plant’s seawater once-through cooling system.

The nuclear power plant still needs two more approvals to continue operating.

PG&E presented a smaller mitigation package to the commission in November, which was rejected. After pushback from state legislators and the public, the commission told PG&E to go back to the drawing board and return with a more expansive land conservation plan.

On Thursday, the majority of the commissioners accepted PG&E’s proposal.

“The increased mitigations will be of significant benefit for the state of California for years to come,” commissioner Megan Harmon said.

The commission also took a vote that’s a step toward extending the plant’s life an additional 15 years, to 2045.

Why does PG&E need to offer a land conservation package?

The power pant’s cooling system sucks in about 2.5 billion gallons of seawater per day, which could fill almost 3,800 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The system also inhales small marine organisms, which are often killed by the change in water pressure and temperature, the staff report said.

Operating the plant for another five years would kill billions of those marine organisms, which would negatively impact about 14 square miles of nearshore waters, the staff report said.

Such a significant environmental impact does not comply with the California Coastal Management Program or the California Coastal Act.

However, the commission can approve permits for coastal-dependent industrial facilities like the power plant if it can prove that the project won’t harm the public and the environmental impacts are mitigated to the “maximum extent feasible,” the staff report said.

Commission staff determined that building replacement marine habitat, like an artificial reef, was not a feasible option, because such projects have inconsistent success rates.

Instead, PG&E offered a land conservation package.

A more expansive mitigation package

After the November meeting, PG&E and commission staff revised the mitigation package.

“This collaboration has led to the chance to preserve these 14 miles of coastline,” PG&E representative Tom Jones said at the meeting.

The updated mitigation package includes the following:

A 4,500-acre conservation easement to be placed on the North Ranch property, which is 3,400 acres larger than the conservation easement PG&E originally proposed. PG&E will also attempt to dedicate the fee title of the North Ranch to a public agency, a nonprofit land conservation organization or a Native American tribe.

Conservation easements for 25 miles of trails on the property, including a trail that connects Montaña de Oro State Park to Port San Luis. Previously, PG&E only offered 10 miles of new trails in the mitigation package.

A $10 million endowment for the design, planning, construction and maintenance of those trails. This is $4.4 million larger than the original proposal.

The option to sell the fee title for the 2,400-acre Wild Cherry Canyon property to a state agency, a nonprofit conservation organization or a Native American tribe that also obtains an agreement to purchase the lease from HomeFed Corp. at fair market value.

A prohibition on the sale of the South Ranch property for purposes other than conservation until 2040. Originally, PG&E offered only a first right of refusal for the property’s purchase to state agencies and nonprofit conservation organizations.

“These six elements would provide a pathway to the permanent conservation of nearly all of the 12,000 acres of the Diablo Canyon lands in order to offset the project’s effects on marine life,” commission deputy director Cassidy Teufel said.

PG&E offered additional mitigations if the state Legislature extends the plant’s operating life beyond 2030, which include:

A deed restriction on almost 2,500 acres of the South Ranch, which would require a conservation easement as part of the purchase of the property.

An 18-month first right of refusal for government agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations and Native American tribes for the South Ranch property.

An 18-month first right of refusal for government agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations and Native American tribes for the underlying fee title of Wild Cherry Canyon. Starting on Oct. 31, 2030, the buyer of the fee title would not need to have an agreement to purchase the lease from HomeFed.

State Sen. John Laird led lobbying efforts to expand the mitigation package. While he would have preferred direct, immediate conservation of the South Ranch, he was pleased with the rest of the proposal, calling it “a monumental victory.”

“This is remarkable progress, and I think generations of people will thank us,” he said at the meeting.

State Assemblymember Dawn Addis, however, urged the commission to require PG&E to preserve the entirety of the South Ranch immediately.

“I think today is a real opportunity to restore accountability and to restore trust when it comes to potential continued operations of the nuclear power plant,” she said.

Still, both legislators celebrated the expansion of the proposal.

Tribal co-management of the land

Multiple leaders from Indigenous tribes urged the commission to include tribal co-management of the land as part of the mitigation package, but they suggested different approaches.

Mona Olivas Tucker, the tribal chair of the yak titʸu titʸu yak tiłhini Northern Chumash Tribe of San Luis Obispo County, said her tribe is the only nation that has been “definitively established as the indigenous people of this territory.”

“We have family stories, archaeological, genealogical and anthropological evidence to substantiate our claim,” she said.

She said the mitigation package should offer the first right of refusal for the South Ranch to the ytt Tribe.

“The proposed mitigation fails to prioritize tribal land-back efforts and instead places barriers between ytt and Diablo lands,” she said.

Michael Khus-Zarate, the vice chair of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, said his tribe also claims lineage to the Diablo lands.

The Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation stayed on-site to protect their ancestors while they were removed from their graves during construction of the power plant, he said.

“Later, over a four-year period, I led solstice ceremonies with our people in the shadow of the nuclear containment structures, praying that there would be no nuclear accidents and that someday the place would be returned to its natural state of peace and beauty once the plant was gone,” he said.

He advised the commission to consult with all tribes associated with the land.

“You must be as inclusive and expansive as possible,” he said.

Northern Chumash Tribal Council Chairwoman Violet Sage Walker also said that all tribes affiliated with the land should be consulted and have an opportunity to manage the property.

“While we support the preservation of the lands around Diablo Canyon, we do not support the inclusion of public access without having developed a robust tribal co-management plan, tribal stewardship program, which includes all tribes culturally affiliated with the lands, including North Ranch, South Ranch, Wild Cherry Canyon,” she said.

What is the vision for Wild Cherry Canyon?

Wild Cherry Canyon is about 2,400 acres of idyllic, undeveloped land behind Avila Beach.

PG&E’s subsidiary, Eureka Energy, owns the underlying fee title to the property, while the development company HomeFed Corp. owns a 141-year lease on the land. Multiple rounds of litigation determined that HomeFed’s lease is valid.

The mitigation package will give a state agency, nonprofit conservation organization or Native American tribe the chance to purchase the underlying fee title to the property if they can strike a deal to purchase the lease from HomeFed.

At the meeting, HomeFed’s attorney Robert Shoecraft said the corporation is willing to sell the lease for fair market value.

An Oct. 26, 2020, appraisal showed that the lease was worth $39 million, though that number could have changed over the past five years, he said.

Meanwhile, the state Legislature allocated $40 million to the purchase of Wild Cherry Canyon. That money just needs to get into the hands of an organization that wishes to manage the property.

During public comment, The Wildlands Conservancy executive director Frazier Haney said his organization would be interested in the property. The Wildlands Conservancy is a nonprofit that protects land in California, managing it for conservation, habitat restoration and public access.

“I’m really excited that we can now see a clear path forward,” commissioner Caryl Hart said of Wild Cherry Canyon at the meeting.

What’s next on the Diablo Canyon permit?

On Thursday, the commission also voted 9-3 to certify that extending the power plant’s operating life another 20 years complies with the California Coastal Management Program.

This allows the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to approve PG&E’s application for a 20-year license to operate the power plant.

However, even if the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves a 20-year license, PG&E can only run the power plant for five years under current state law. The state Legislature would need to pass another law to allow PG&E to operate the power plant past 2030.

The commission reviewed two timelines because PG&E applied for a five-year permit at the state level and a 20-year license at the federal level. The NRC license would allow Diablo to operate until 2044 and 2045 — but only with the state Legislature’s permission and an amendment to the five-year coastal development permit.

After securing a coastal development permit from the California Coastal Commission, PG&E must get a permit to operate the once-through cooling system in February from the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board and a license next year from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

If PG&E is successful in all of those steps, Unit 1 can operate until Oct. 31, 2029, and Unit 2 can operate until Oct. 31, 2030.",https://www.sanluisobispo.com/public/latest-news/t5udi6/picture251849773/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/BIZ-ENV-NUKES-CALIF-1-LA.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 23:58:05.167271

Hill, M L (2025), “Anna Paulina Luna pushes for vote on congressional stock trading ban”, Politico, 2 December.","The debate over whether US members of Congress should be allowed to trade individual stocks has moved from a niche ethics topic to a mainstream policy concern. Media investigations have documented pandemic-era sell-offs following closed-door COVID-19 briefings, widespread trading in industries overseen by members’ own committees, and dozens of apparent violations of the 2012 Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act. Against this backdrop, proposals to ban stock trading by lawmakers are gaining traction in Washington. In the latest development, on 2 December 2025, Representative Anna Paulina Luna filed a discharge petition to force a House vote on banning individual stock trading by members of Congress (Hill 2025).

Economists have been trying to assess whether legislators’ portfolios actually earn abnormal returns, and if so, why. Early work by Ziobrowski et al. (2004, 2011) suggested that House and Senate members outperformed the market. Later studies reversed the verdict: Eggers and Hainmueller (2013) and Belmont et al. (2022) find that, on average, members would have been better off in index funds. Cherry et al. (2017) highlight that some senators earned significant sell-side gains around key legislative events, while Huang and Xuan (2023) show that abnormal performance largely disappeared after the STOCK Act. Related work on investors documents that access to policymakers can confer an informational advantage in capital markets, as evidenced by Fons-Rosen et al. (2020) on trading related to the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program.

Taken together, this literature paints a mixed picture: there are pockets of advantage, but not a simple story in which ‘Congress always beats the market’. Our contribution is to zoom in on a small but crucial group: congressional leaders. Rather than treating all lawmakers as alike, we ask whether gaining formal leadership power – Speaker, floor leader, whip, or caucus chair – changes how well a member’s personal investments perform.

Leadership and trading performance

Our study uses transaction-level data on every US congressional stock trade from 1995 to 2021 and links them to firm characteristics, regulatory actions, procurement contracts, and corporate news. We identify all individuals who ever held a leadership position and match each of them to a ‘regular’ member with similar tenure, party, chamber, age, and gender. We then follow both groups over time and compare their risk-adjusted buy-and-hold returns before and after leadership ascension.

Before entering leadership, future leaders and their matched peers underperform the market by similar amounts. After ascension, however, their trajectories diverge sharply: leaders’ trades outperform those of their matched peers by up to roughly 40–50 percentage points per year. The control group shows no comparable improvement. Calendar-time portfolio regressions using standard factor models confirm that leaders’ daily alphas rise markedly post-ascension, while non-leaders’ alphas remain flat.

Leadership positions are few – only 20 lawmakers in our sample trade both before and after ascension – so the results are not about ‘typical’ members of Congress. But leadership roles are exactly where agenda-setting power, regulatory influence, and corporate attention are concentrated. If one wants to know whether public power can be monetised in financial markets, this is where one should look.

We then ask: how do leaders manage to earn such outsized returns?

Channel 1: Political information and influence

The first mechanism is what we call the political information and influence channel. Leaders have privileged information about what legislation will be scheduled, which regulatory priorities are advancing, and which industries are likely to come under pressure. In majority leadership roles, they often help decide those outcomes. We implement several tests related to this channel.

Partisan control. When leaders’ own party controls the chamber they sit in, their trades are significantly more profitable than when they are in the minority. Returns rise with control over the legislative agenda.

Regulatory actions. We track regulatory events – investigations, enforcement actions, and congressional hearings – affecting firms whose stocks are traded. Leaders’ stock sales are followed by a marked increase in adverse regulatory events over the subsequent 3–12 months, while their purchases are not followed by a corresponding decline. This suggests that leaders sell ahead of bad political or regulatory news.

These tests show that leaders benefit from anticipatory trades around political developments. But are they merely informed observers, or do they also help shape outcomes in ways that enrich their portfolios?

Legislative voting. Using bill-level data on all measures reaching the floor, we identify those with meaningful implications for the economy or businesses. For each leader trade, we look at relevant bills introduced in the following months and classify whether each bill is likely to benefit or harm the traded firm. We find that, following stock purchases, the leader’s party is significantly more likely to vote for bills deemed beneficial to the firm and against bills deemed harmful. The number of such ‘aligned’ bills rises substantially relative to matched non-leaders over medium-term windows.

Procurement contracts. Drawing on the Federal Procurement Data System, we examine whether firms whose shares leaders buy subsequently receive more government contracts. They do: purchases are followed by significant increases in contract value and in the share of sole-source contracts. Given that the federal government awards millions of contracts each year but leaders only invest in a narrow subset of firms, it is hard to attribute this pattern solely to passive foresight. It is more consistent with selective influence over the allocation of public business. These procurement-related findings resonate with broader evidence that discretion in public procurement can foster favouritism and rent extraction (Bosio et al. 2020), and that close ties between politicians and firms can raise the cost of public contracts (Baránek and Titl 2024).

Taken together, these tests point to a political channel in which leaders both foresee and shape the policy and regulatory environment in ways that overlap with their personal portfolios.

Channel 2: Corporate access

The second mechanism is a corporate access channel. Firms have strong incentives to cultivate influential lawmakers, particularly those who control legislative calendars or command committee agendas. Sharing sensitive information is risky. If firms must choose which politicians to trust, giving an informational edge to leaders is a natural, if troubling, strategy. We again bring two pieces of evidence to bear.

Connections pay. After ascension, leaders earn significantly higher abnormal returns when trading in firms that either have contributed to their recent campaigns or are headquartered in their home states. The same patterns do not appear for otherwise similar non-leaders.

Predicting corporate news. Leaders’ purchases are followed by more positive news; their sales are followed by more negative news. This predictive power is concentrated in executive-controlled events (e.g. dividend changes, guidance revisions, or earnings delays). Leaders do not anticipate outside shocks better than others (e.g. lawsuits). Moreover, the same individuals did not display this ability before becoming leaders. This pattern strongly suggests that corporate insiders appear to selectively share material non-public information with lawmakers whose political clout makes them valuable allies.

Did the STOCK Act fix the problem?

The 2012 STOCK Act was passed amid bipartisan promises to ‘stop trading on congressional knowledge’. Subsequent work has found that, on average, members’ abnormal returns declined after its passage, and politically connected hedge funds also lost some of their edge (Gao and Huang 2016, Huang and Xuan 2023). For the median legislator, the law may indeed have narrowed opportunities for exploiting inside information.

For leaders, the story is less reassuring. In our data, their trade frequency falls after 2012 – consistent with greater scrutiny – but their average trade size and risk-adjusted returns remain largely intact. Calendar-time portfolio regressions show that post-ascension alphas stay positive and economically meaningful even when portfolios are constructed using public disclosure dates rather than actual execution dates.

Policy implications: Focusing on the top of the pyramid

Our findings concern a narrow but highly consequential slice of Congress: the small group of leaders at the top of the political hierarchy. We do not imply that every lawmaker is quietly beating the market – if anything, the broader literature points to underperformance for rank-and-file members. But they do show that when political power is highly concentrated, so too is the capacity to turn public office into a trading advantage.

This concentration makes enforcement difficult. Traditional insider-trading laws and transparency rules are poorly suited to a world in which decision-makers both receive and generate price-sensitive information, and where conflicted actions may be legal yet still corrosive to trust. So, what can be done?

One response, increasingly advocated by reformers, is a blanket ban on individual stock ownership for sitting members, with assets limited to broad index funds or genuinely blind trusts. Short of that, lawmakers could tighten disclosure windows, raise penalties, and create independent oversight for trades by those in leadership roles, alongside stricter rules on procurement conflicts and legislative recusal.

Ultimately, the question is not whether some members of Congress are ‘smart investors’, but whether a healthy democracy should allow its most powerful officials to hold concentrated positions in the companies whose fortunes they help shape. Our evidence suggests that, at least for congressional leaders, political power and private portfolios are uncomfortably intertwined.

The power station is important to Yorkshire’s economy, supporting local businesses through our operations and supply chains and giving multiple generations the opportunity to build their skills and develop their careers in the county.

The new agreement we have made with the UK Government provides certainty that Drax can continue to support UK energy security as well as helping drive economic growth into the 2030s. It is also underpinned by strengthened sustainability criteria, which has been updated in line with the latest science and best practice.

Under the agreement, when the UK does not have enough electricity Drax can step in to increase generation, avoiding the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity Drax can turn down and help to balance the system.

Baringa’s analysis of the new deal says it will result in a net saving for consumers of up to £3.1bn over its term. This is because the deal avoids the need to produce additional capacity and reduces the country’s reliance on fossil fuels and interconnectors.

In line with the policies of successive Governments, we invested hundreds of millions in converting Drax Power Station to sustainable biomass generation as well as maintaining it so that it is available when the country needs it – particularly when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.

This investment has meant, unlike every single other former coal fired power station in Yorkshire, Drax Power Station remains operational and continues to play its vital role.

Critically the new deal also provides us with a foundation to progress options for the power station so it can remain operational well into the future.

One long-standing opportunity is to install the carbon removals and renewable power technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), at the power station which we continue to consider. But this project requires the right support from UK Government, including the development of a business model and importantly a regional carbon transport and storage network to connect to.

We are also exploring the options of hosting a data centre at Drax Power Station, which could be complementary to our BECCS plans and potentially attract billions in investment into the region.

With a grid connection, 24/7 power availability, significant amounts of development land, cooling infrastructure and a high-skilled and dedicated workforce the site has all the key requirements a large hyperscale data centre would need to be developed.

As part of this, we are proud to be participating in York & North Yorkshire’s AI Growth Zone bid, and we continue to have conversations with developers on how a data centre could be deployed at the power station.

With projections that data centres could account for up to 14 per cent of the UKs power demand by 2035, ensuring there is sufficient generation capacity for them is a critical security of supply question.

In the future, once we have fulfilled our obligations to the UK Government, we could provide power to a data centre generated at Drax and paid for by data centre users.

This would help the site move away from a bill payer supported model while continuing to help meet national energy demand.",https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Will-Gardiner_Sept25_terrace-14.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:59.416167

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit the following comments in response to the administration’s Request for Information for a National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing. ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

1. a. Which emerging science and technology areas (e.g., artificial intelligence) will be key to the next generation of innovative advanced manufacturing technologies, and how will they impact advanced manufacturing?

A wide suite of digital manufacturing technologies—including artificial intelligence (AI) (and individual AI applications such as AR/VR, computer vision, expert systems, digital twins, and robotic process automation), big data, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, sensors, robots/cobots, advanced wireless communications, and computer-aided design (CAD) and engineering (CAE) software—tools are poised to transform modern manufacturing. In fact, digital services now account for 25 percent of manufacturing inputs.[1] And electronic inputs account for 40 percent of the value of a modern vehicle.[2]

The application of digital manufacturing technologies will be significant. Analysts expect manufacturing digitalization to boost overall global factory productivity up to 25 percent.[3] One assessment finds manufacturing digitalization could produce a 10 percent improvement in overall operating efficiency; 25 percent improvement in energy efficiency; 25 percent reduction in consumer packaging; 25 percent reduction in safety accidents; 40 percent reduction in cycle times; and 40 percent reduction in water usage.[4] Overall, economists estimate manufacturing digitalization could boost annual U.S. productivity growth by 1 to 1.5 percentage points and add $10 to $15 trillion to global GDP over the next 20 years.[5]

Manufacturers stand at differing levels of implementing smart manufacturing solutions. One March 2025 study of over 800 large multinational manufacturers found that 98 percent have at least initiated digital transformation efforts seeking to improve their customer experience and operational efficiency, optimize costs, or enhance products.[6] However, implementation of digital manufacturing solutions is decidedly lower among small- to medium-sized (SME) manufacturers. A 2024 survey conducted by the Interdisciplinary Center for Advanced Manufacturing Systems (ICAMS) at Auburn University found that 56 percent of U.S. SME manufacturers were either currently using or now implementing automation tools and 49 percent using additive manufacturing, but that only 38 percent were using big data, only 28 percent AI, and only 27 percent data analytics.[7]

The United States significantly trails in the deployment of robotics—a cross-cutting automation tool that will be vital to the competitiveness of myriad U.S. manufacturing industries. In fact, China has installed more industrial robots than the rest of the world combined in each of the past five years. When nations are assessed by their deployment of industrial robots per 10,000 workers, the United States ranks tenth, while China ranks third.[8] The United States needs to significantly scale up its deployment of industrial robots, and ITIF laid out a strategy to do so in its recent report “A Time to Act: Policies to Strengthen the US Robotics Industry.” Several recommendations which stood out from the report include that the United States should develop a national strategy for robotics, the Department of Commerce should convene a robotics industry advisory group to advise the U.S. government on robotics industry needs and how to increase adoption and procurement, and the United States should expand its investments in commercially oriented robotics research and development (R&D).[9] Further, president Trump should issue an annual award at the White House to firms that have done the best job of installing robots, and use his bully pulpit to shame other executives who have gone capital-light and failed to invest in automation.[10]

1. b. What are the primary challenges and barriers that need to be addressed to ensure the successful integration and widespread adoption of emerging technology in manufacturing?

A litany of supply and demand challenges continue to inhibit the wider adoption of emerging technologies in U.S. manufacturing. One challenge is that the technologies are still evolving and not yet fully mature. As Industry Week’s Jessica Davis notes, “Implementing an Internet of Things program isn’t exactly like flipping a switch. There’s a lot involved, from sensors where the data is initially collected to the network the data travels, to the analytics systems that figure out what it all means.”[11] A lack of interoperable standards between vendor solutions represents another significant challenge. As the report “Industrie 4.0 in a Global Context: Strategies for Cooperating with International Partners” explains, “individual modules, components, devices, production lines, robots, machines, sensors, catalogues, directories, systems, databases, and applications will need common standards for the connections among them and for the overall semantics, or how data gets seamlessly passed from one device to another.”[12] Thus, standardization of architectures, data-exchange formats, vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies, and interfaces will be key to creating interoperability between different digital manufacturing solutions, and the U.S. National Institute of Standards (NIST) can play an important role in facilitating this.

Recent research from the Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey has found that 70 percent of digital transformation initiatives fail to meet their objectives.[13] A significant reason why pertains to lagging employee skills and competencies to effectively implement digital solutions and to a lack of clarity regarding the value proposition behind digital implementations. This is why many countries inventory and describe discrete, specific manufacturing digitalization use cases and processes. For example, Germany has documented over 300 specific use cases/sample instantiations of SME manufacturing digitalization.[14] Further, as the subsequent section on small manufacturers will document, they often lack the capital to invest in modernized plant and equipment.

A second challenge is that too many U.S. companies seek to go “asset light,” limiting investment in capital assets to make their balance sheets more favorable to investors. It is beyond the scope of this submission to address this issue, but a task force led by Treasury and including other major financial agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and banking regulators, should seek solutions to this.

2. a. Which disruptive manufacturing technologies (e.g., additive, nanotechnology, biotechnology) hold the potential to eliminate reliance on foreign sources for critical minerals and materials, and how will they do that?

b. What are the technical challenges and barriers associated with implementing these technologies at an industrial scale, and how can they be addressed?

The United States must make it a national imperative to decrease dependence on China for key critical minerals. For instance, for rare earths used in magnets—notably neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium—China accounted for about 60 percent of their global mining and 90 percent of their refining and processing in 2024.[15] Overall, China accounts for around 60 percent of the global supply of battery-grade lithium, 65 percent of nickel, 70 percent of cobalt, and 90 percent of rare-earth elements such as neodymium.[16] China is also the primary global supplier for many key active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). For instance, approximately 70 percent of the world’s paracetamol (acetaminophen) originates from Chinese firms and over 80 percent of key antibiotic actives (e.g., doxycycline and amoxicillin) are produced in China.[17]

The only way the United States can restore its capacities in critical mineral/rare earths processing and refining in a manner that’s cost-competitive with Chinese production while still being environmentally friendly is through innovation. This will require novel, innovative, new-to-the-world refining processes to address China’s lead in this field. This will require ample R&D funding from both the public and private sectors and also the funding of Ph.D. researchers to develop these new processes. As such, the United States should establish a new National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERC) for critical minerals refining and processing.

4. a. What are examples of U.S. manufacturing-related technological, market, or business challenges that may best be addressed by public-private partnerships and are likely to attract both participation and primary funding from industry?

b. How can public-private partnerships be structured to overcome potential hurdles and foster successful collaboration?

The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft represents Europe’s largest application-oriented research organization, comprised of 67 institutes. One of the historically great strengths of Germany’s Fraunhofer system is that it brings German industry and academia together in a structured manner to develop new technologies with specific industrial relevance.[18] Each Fraunhofer is co-led by a representative from industry and academia. The Fraunhofers work with specific German industrial sectors to develop 10-year technology roadmaps for industry, identifying specific technical hurdles or challenges that need to be addressed, and then through the associated universities they fund Ph.D.s to solve those technological problems and then diffuse that knowledge back throughout Germany’s industrial ecosystem. The German government at the federal and state levels co-invest in the effort, covering about 30 percent of program costs.

America’s Manufacturing USA network is somewhat modeled after this approach. But what it really points to is that the United States should be developing manufacturing-sector-specific competitiveness and innovation strategies. The semiconductor industry has long done this well, and even now the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) has articulated a Decadal Plan for Semiconductors, which has defined specific research challenges such as energy management, storage density, security-on-chip, etc.[19] Similarly, ITIF has called for the Trump administration to encourage the creation of the biopharma equivalent of the SRC.[20] Here, industry could collaborate on such a production technology innovation roadmap, and the federal government could match their funding to research institutes and universities on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For example, some life-sciences firms have their own roadmaps (e.g., GlaxoSmithKline’s manufacturing technology roadmap is focused on the use of continuous techniques).[21]

Beyond biotechnology and semiconductors, the United States should be developing similar decadal competitiveness strategies/technology roadmaps for key manufacturing industries including aerospace, automotive, chemicals, robotics, machine tools, shipbuilding, etc. The U.S. government should be a partner with American academia and industry in helping develop these strategies, but unfortunately it lacks not just the resources but also the key data to undertake the analytics necessary. For this reason, ITIF has laid out a comprehensive assessment of what are the federal statistical needs that would underpin a comprehensive “National Advanced Industry and Technology Strategy.”[22]

Ensuring that small manufacturers can tap into the technological expertise being developed by the Manufacturing USA Institutes is important. A following section discussed improving Manufacturing USA/Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) coordination. While each of the Manufacturing USA Institutes have different business models/value propositions, some have created unique pathways for SMEs to engage with them, such as how MxD (focused on digital manufacturing) offered $500 subscriptions for a low-tier set of outputs. Each Manufacturing USA Institute should have an SME engagement strategy.

5. a. How can Federal agencies and federally funded R&D centers supporting advanced manufacturing R&D facilitate the transfer of research results, intellectual property, and technology scale-up into commercialization and manufacturing.

5.b. What are the key challenges in translating research findings into commercially viable manufacturing processes and products, and how can they be overcome?

First and foremost, America needs to adopt and maintain a supportive, and non-disruptive, approach to the effective technology and intellectual property (IP) transfer system the United States has already developed, and to the extent it reforms this approach it should focus on value-adding improvements on the margins. The administration should also recognize that the process of IP/technology commercialization is already risky, difficult, expensive, and fraught with many valleys of death.

The Trump administration should further recognize that the United States has already built the world’s most effective system for technology commercialization, especially when it pertains to IP/technologies derived from federally funded R&D conducted at U.S. universities and research institutions. However, as late as 1978, the federal government had licensed less than 5 percent of the as many as 30,000 patents it owned.[23] Most of them languished on the shelves of government offices or labs. Congress transformed the situation by passing the bipartisan 1980 Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, better known as the “Bayh-Dole Act.” The legislation both created a uniform patent policy among the many federal agencies funding research and allowed universities to retain ownership of the IP and inventions made as a result of federally funded research.[24] The Bayh-Dole Act has transformed U.S. universities into engines of innovation, spawning robust academic technology transfer and commercialization capabilities and activities at hundreds of universities across the United States that have led to the launch of over 18,000 start-up companies.[25]

The Trump administration should focus first on preserving the effective operation of the Bayh-Dole framework. When Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act it included so-called “march-in right” provisions, which permit the government, in specified circumstances, to require patent holders to grant a “nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license” to a “responsible applicant or applicants.”[26]

The Bayh-Dole Act specifies only four instances in which the government is permitted to exercise march-in rights, and reasonable prices isn’t one. Yet some have called for the government to use Bayh-Dole march-in rights to control the price of resulting products, such as pharmaceutical drugs. This despite the fact that lower prices are not one of the rationales laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act. In fact, as senators Bayh and Dole have themselves noted, the Bayh-Dole Act’s march-in rights were never intended to control or ensure “reasonable prices.”[27] As the senators wrote in a 2002 Washington Post op-ed titled, “Our Law Helps Patients Get New Drugs Sooner,” the Bayh-Dole Act: “Did not intend that government set prices on resulting products. The law makes no reference to a reasonable price that should be dictated by the government. This omission was intentional.”[28]

The Trump administration should return to an initiative undertaken in its first iteration, when it had directed NIST to undertake a review of federal policies that could bolster the return of federal investments in R&D. The final 2018 report NIST produced, the “Return on Investment Initiative: Draft Green Paper,” concluded, “The use of march-in is typically regarded as a last resort, and has never been exercised since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980.”[29] The report further noted, “NIH determined that that use of march-in to control drug prices was not within the scope and intent of the authority.”[30] The Trump administration should build upon the findings of the 2018 NIST Green Paper and affirmatively declare that price is not a legitimate basis for the exercise of Bayh-Dole march-in rights.

As ITIF has argued, the biggest difficulty for Bayh-Dole licensees to manufacture in the United States has been the evisceration of America’s manufacturing base has denuded their ability to find manufacturing options in the United States—and so the best way to deal with this challenge is by thoroughly revitalizing American manufacturing, as this RFI helps seek to accomplish. The legislation does include some useful proposals, including directing NIST to identify and maintain a database of domestic manufacturers that commercialize products and services developed from federally funded research. The bill would also require NIST to report to Congress on the commercialization of federal research by domestic manufacturers within 18 months (of the bill’s passage).[31] One improvement ITIF has called for the legislation to make (and for NIST to implement) is for the U.S. government to develop a similar database of manufacturers in key allied nations; which could make it easier for licensees to identify alternative-to-China manufacturers when options are unavailable in the United States.

As noted, a significant strength of the U.S. innovation system is that it has turned America’s universities into engines of innovation, thanks in large part to the Bayh-Dole Act. In fact, the impact of academic technology transfer from U.S. universities has been so extensive that, from 1996 to 2020, it resulted in 554,000 inventions disclosed, 141,000 U.S. patents granted, and 18,000 start-ups formed.[32] Moreover, academic technology transfer has bolstered U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by up to $1 trillion, contributed to $1.9 trillion in gross U.S. industrial output, and supported 6.5 million jobs over that time.[33]

In September 2025, in an Axios interview, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called for the federal government to claim half the patent earnings from university inventions derived in part from federal R&D, erroneously asserting that “the U.S. government is getting no return on the money it invests in federal research.”[34] Yet the reality is the U.S. taxpayer—and the government—benefits greatly from this R&D funding. They benefit first from the extensive innovations produced from the academic tech transfer process, which alone has produced hundreds of life-saving drugs and vaccines, including treatments for breast, ovarian, prostate, and skin cancer, not to mention other breakthroughs in everything from Honeycrisp apples and neoprene to cloud and quantum computing. Second, university IP licensing revenues help fund key innovation-enabling infrastructure at U.S. universities, such as labs, incubators, or innovation accelerators that keep the innovation flywheel churning. Third, the government benefits from the taxes produced by the trillions in industrial output and millions of jobs created as a result of university tech transfer.[35] For instance, university research parks alone generated $33 billion in federal tax revenue in 2024.[36] The administration should refrain from imposing a claim or a tax on IP licensing revenues earned by U.S. universities.

6.a. What are the main challenges in attracting, training, and retraining a skilled workforce for advanced manufacturing, and how can they be addressed?

If the United States is to achieve its ambition to significantly revitalize American manufacturing, it needs to take further steps to ensure that it possesses the manufacturing workforce to support expanded U.S. manufacturing output. That’s especially the case as analysts expect the demand for tech talent to grow to 7.1 million tech jobs by 2034 in the United States, from an estimated six million in 2023.[37] Another report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) finds that, by the end of 2030, an estimated 3.85 million additional jobs requiring proficiency in technical fields will be created in the United States, but that, “Of those, 1.4 million jobs risk going unfilled unless we can expand the pipeline for such workers in fields such as skilled technicians, engineering, and computer science.”[38] For the semiconductor industry, the report estimates that roughly 67,000—or 58 percent of projected new jobs (and 80 percent of projected new technical jobs)—risk going unfilled at current degree completion rates.[39] The administration should lead in several efforts to enhance U.S. manufacturing workforce skilling, including:

Expand Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program funding. Skilled technicians are a key component of the traded sector workforce. One highly successful program designed to build technician skills is NSF’s Advanced Technological Education program, which supports community colleges working in partnership with industry, economic development agencies, workforce investment boards, and secondary and other higher education institutions.[40] ATE projects and centers are educating technicians in a range of fields, including nanotechnologies and microtechnologies, rapid prototyping, biomanufacturing, logistics, and alternative fuel automobiles. Notwithstanding this, ATE funding is quite small, at approximately $74 million in FY 2025.[41] The Trump administration should work with Congress to double ATE funding to at least $150 million per year.

Expand the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP). The engineering curricula at too many American universities is overly academic as opposed to industry focused. Indeed, university engineering programs have evolved in two troubling directions over the past several decades. First, the focus on “engineering as a science” has increasingly moved university engineering education away from a focus on real problem solving toward more abstract engineering science. Second, this focus on “engineering as a science” has left university engineering departments more concerned with producing pure knowledge than working with industry to help them solve real problems.

That’s why ITIF has argued that the United States needs more “manufacturing universities,” which would revamp their engineering programs and focus much more on manufacturing engineering and in particular work that is more relevant to industry. This would include more joint industry-university research projects, more student training that incorporates manufacturing experiences through co-ops or other programs, and a Ph.D. education program focused on turning out more engineering graduates who work in industry. These universities would view Ph.D.s as akin to high-level apprenticeships (as they often are in Germany), where industry experience is required as part of the degree. Likewise, criteria for faculty tenure would consider professors’ work with and/or in industry as much as their number of scholarly publications. In addition, these universities’ business schools would integrate closely with engineering and focus on manufacturing issues, including management of production.

One model for these manufacturing universities is the Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts, which reimagined engineering education and curriculum to prepare students “to become exemplary engineering innovators who recognize needs, design solutions, and engage in creative enterprises for the good of the world.”[42]

Congress implemented a form of these proposals when it passed the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program into law in December 2016 as part of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), authorizing the Department of Defense to support industry-relevant, manufacturing-focused, engineering training at U.S. institutions of higher education, universities, industry, and not-for-profit institutions. With its $48 million in initial funding, MEEP made awards to 13 educational and industry partners to bring educational opportunities to Americans interested in learning manufacturing skills critical to sustaining the U.S. defense innovation base.[43] In 2023, MEEP issued additional three-year funding grants “that establish programs or enhance existing programs to better position the manufacturing workforce to produce military systems and components that assure technological superiority for DoD.”[44]

MEEP can be a powerful initiative, but it is underfunded and has become too solely focused on engineering in the national defense context. Therefore, the Administration should work with Congress to broaden the MEEP remit to refocus it more on supporting industry-relevant, applied engineering programs at leading universities. Congress should allocate $150 million annually to a revitalized MEEP program that would make grants to 20 engineering programs at leading U.S. universities to redirect them toward more hands-on, industrially relevant engineering activities.

6.b. How can Federal agencies and federally funded R&D centers develop, align, and strengthen all levels of advanced manufacturing training, certification, registered apprenticeships, and credentialing programs.

Each Manufacturing USA Institute should develop workforce training workstreams associated with their focal technology area. For instance, MxD’s “Digital Manufacturing and Design Roles Taxonomy” identified 165 distinct digital manufacturing and design roles, describing the responsibilities of each of those roles and the skills individuals needed to accrue to fulfill them.[45] Beyond identifying new roles and occupations, each of the Manufacturing USA Institutes should work with their affiliated academic partners to build and deliver educational curricula for these positions.

The National Skill Standards Act of 1994 created a National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) responsible for supporting voluntary partnerships in each economic sector that would establish industry-defined national standards leading to industry-recognized, nationally portable certifications. But this vision has yet to be fulfilled. Therefore, Congress and the Administration should work to increase credentialing for the manufacturing and the closely related logistics industry workforce members by expanding the use of standards-based, nationally portable, industry-recognized certifications specifically designed for specific manufacturing and logistics sectors.[46]

The United States significantly underinvests in workforce training programs, dedicating just 0.1 percent of GDP in active labor market programs compared with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 0.6 percent of GDP, meaning America’s OECD peers such as Austria and Germany invest six or more times more in their workforce training and support programs.[47] Moreover, the United States now invests less than half of what it did in such programs 30 years ago, as a share of GDP.[48]

One way the Trump administration and Congress could address this challenge would be by expanding Section 127 tax benefits for employer-provided tuition assistance. Section 127 of the federal tax code allows employers to provide employees up to $5,250 per year in tuition assistance; the employer deducts the cost of the benefit but the employee doesn’t have to report it as income.[49] Congress should increase Section 127 to at least $8,700 (per the rate of inflation since 1996) and index the amount to the annual rate of inflation going forward.[50]

7. a. In what ways can the federal government assist in the development of advanced manufacturing clusters and technology hubs nationwide, beyond funding needs?

b. Is there a need for new or expanded advanced manufacturing clusters or technology hubs for the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers, and if so, in what sectors or technologies?

c. Should Federal incentives prioritize industry-specific advanced manufacturing clusters or instead focus on technology hubs centered on advanced technologies, critical components, and materials? If so, why?

In a 2019 report, “The Case for Growth Centers” ITIF examined where innovation jobs are found in the U.S. economy, defining these as jobs that in industries that have a specified level of R&D intensity and that employ a certain share of STEM workers. ITIF found that fully one-third of U.S. innovation jobs are concentrated in just 14 U.S. counties, and one-half in 40 counties.[51] This insight was part of the inspiration behind Congressional creation of the Economic Development Adminsitration’s (EDA) Regional Tech Hubs program. EDA has designated 31 Tech Hubs and in July 2024 released $504 million in Implementation awards for 12 of the 31 designated Tech Hubs.[52]

Besides Congress not appropriating enough money, the program was poorly implemented. The Biden administration allowed NSF and the Department of Commerce (along with the Department of War and the Small Business Administration) to develop their own regional hub programs with no coordination, essentially spreading limited reasou4ces far too wide and thin. Moreover, many of the EDA awards are weak and likely to never become self-sufficient hubs once federal funding ends. The Trump administration should redo the competition, but this time fund fewer centers, make NSF and EDA develop a joint program, and ensure that winners could be self-sufficient and targeted on what ITIF calls “national power” industries (as subsequently explained).

9a. What are the biggest obstacles faced by small and medium-sized manufacturing companies in adopting advanced technologies to increase efficiency and productivity?

SMEs lag in adopting new technologies that would make them more productive, especially with regard to incorporating digital technologies.[53] SME manufacturers often lack the knowhow to implement advanced technologies or are uncertain about the value proposition behind doing so. As noted previously, this is why it’s important to describe discrete, specific manufacturing digitalization use cases and processes and to provide benchmark assessment tools so SMEs can understand where they are in their digital manufacturing journey. Another significant challenge pertains to the lack of digital workforce skills to implement digital manufacturing solutions.

SMEs often lack the capital to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies. This challenge is amplified by pressure from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to cut costs, which further limits their ability to invest in modernized capital equipment. In fact, studies estimate that the inability of small firms to invest in equipment and plant upgrades contributes to a stark 40 percent productivity gap with large manufacturers.[54] SMEs often lack the available capital to invest in modernized plant and equipment; for instance, McKinsey research found that fully one-quarter of SMEs in the mid-Atlantic region lack the capital even to meet their weekly working-capital needs.[55] The OECD finds that access to capital has generally been tighter for SMEs in the United States than in other OECD countries ever since the Great Recession.[56]

Regarding this challenge, federal capital support (such as through upfront grants or repayable loans) could help them meet upfront investment costs (with the upgraded equipment delivering significant return on investment subsequently). This was the insight behind Congress allocating $50 million to the Department of Energy’s Office of Manufacturing and Supply Chain Resilience (MSRC) to be distributed to states for smart manufacturing pilot implementation programs.

In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed bipartisan Congressional legislation in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, which, among other initiatives, launched the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program. Congress originally envisioned the program—which is managed by the Department of Commerce’s NIST and which operates in all 50 U.S. states as well as Puerto Rico—as delivering expertise on quality manufacturing practices to America’s SMEs, but since then the remit of the program has broadened to be about enhancing the productivity and technological performance of U.S. manufacturing. The MEP network consists of approximately 475 service locations across its 51 centers. NIST asserts that, in FY 2024, the MEP National Network helped manufacturers achieve $15 billion in new and retained sales, $5 billion in new client investments, $2.6 billion in cost savings and over 108,000 jobs created or retained.[57] Since 2000, the MEP National Network has worked with 77,409 manufacturers, leading to $60 billion in new sales and $26.2 billion in cost savings, and has helped create and retain 1,456,889 jobs, according to NIST.[58] Elsewhere, a report from Summit Consulting and the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research found that the program generated a financial return of more than 17:1 on the $175 million in federal funds it received in fiscal year 2023.[59]

Unfortunately, the MEP program has been targeted for zeroing-out since the first Trump administration and was one of the programs designated for elimination in the Project 2025 initiative.[60] Yet the MEP program plays an important role in America’s SME manufacturer support ecosystem, and while it may merit significant reforms, the program should not be wholesale terminated.

When MEP was established in 1982, it made sense to have a network of state-focused centers working with manufacturers in each state. But a state-by-state focus presents difficulties when modern manufacturing challenges are increasingly horizontal in nature—e.g., artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, manufacturing digitalization, supply chain integration, etc.—and it makes less sense for each MEP center to develop its own capabilities in these areas independently. MEP should develop a centralized “Center of Excellence” to develop education/training/implementation modules regarding these cross-cutting manufacturing challenges and distribute them through the regional MEP delivery system.

Here, it’s imperative that the MEP program works closely with the Manufacturing USA network. America’s 18 Institutes of Manufacturing Innovation—spanning manufacturing domains from bio-manufacturing, digital/automation, electronics, and energy/environment to materials—should be viewed as “the tip of the spear” for developing advanced manufacturing product and process technologies in the United States. But MEP should be the channel through which these novel manufacturing product/process technologies get diffused to America’s SME manufacturer base. As such, each Manufacturing USA Institute should have an ongoing MEP “embedded representative” attached to it, with a mandate to develop a strategy for diffusing technologies being developed out of the Institutes across the MEP network.

Another avenue of MEP reform should be recognizing that, because supply chains cross state boundaries, MEP needs many more cross-state, sector-based MEP initiatives (e.g., autos in the U.S. Midwest and South, semiconductors in the Southwest). In other words, MEP should take on more of a supply-chain and sector-based focus. One can envision other regional/sectoral MEPs focused on wood/paper products in the Northwest, semiconductors in the Southwest, medical devices in the upper Midwest, maritime/shipbuilding in the Northeast, defense manufacturing in California or Texas, etc. If MEP departs from a predominantly state-based delivery model, it should reorient its approach to a regional/industrial delivery of SME services with a greater supply chain orientation.

A significant challenge for the MEP program has been that MEP centers often undertake small projects (average project size is about $15,000), so the engagements often don’t prove truly transformative for the customer (in part because MEP engagements often aren’t at the CEO level), and tend to engage line managers or a business unit. MEP needs to focus on transformation projects with customers, something it could better accomplish if it had longer-term, more stable funding that permitted centers to hire and retain more sophisticated staff that can build longer-term expertise.

Another way to strengthen MEP would be to emphasize assignments not just with the SME, but also their OEM customers, such as by defining joint grants (matched by the larger firm) for customers and suppliers that apply together. The larger firm’s support would demonstrate that it is committed to these suppliers and believes these suppliers are viable and strategic. It would also ease a key problem that small firms face: providing them with crucial demand-side certainty would greatly reduce the danger they face in making investments in new products or processes since they don’t have the profits to place bets that might not pay off.

For instance, ITIF has long argued the United States needs to introduce mechanisms to encourage OEMs to take more ownership of manufacturing supply chain digitalization. Large U.S. manufacturers have tended to keep their suppliers at arm’s length, too often treating them on a transactional basis with cost as the principal concern. But as the McKinsey Global Institute notes, “this approach can affect the bottom line. One McKinsey study found that inefficiencies in OEM-supplier interactions add up to roughly 5 percent of development, tooling, and product costs in the auto industry.”[61] Put simply, U.S. OEMs need to take more ownership for driving digital transformation within their supply chains. To this end, ITIF has previously argued that the U.S. government should provide incentives for U.S. OEMs to help 10,000 SMEs to become smart-manufacturing enabled within 10 years.[62]

Another potential OEM-SME partnership opportunity pertains to accumulating shared data that could help AI-based systems such as digital twins operate more effectively. Manufacturing generates more data than any other sector of the economy, yet few companies are harnessing it.[63] Yet AI systems become more effective when they have more data to train on, such as if they have data about the operating performance of production equipment or machine tools that they can learn from to predict failure modes in advance (i.e., predictive maintenance). Many companies own similar or the same machines or tools, yet the data is siloed internally and others can’t learn from it. NIST could lead a voluntary initiative where companies would share anonymized data into a shared data lake that could create new data sets against which novel AI algorithms could be developed.

10. What are examples of public-private partnership models (at the international, national, state, and/or local level) that could be expanded to facilitate manufacturing technology development, technology transition to market, and workforce development?

Two programs are here worth highlighting and targeting for expansion. The Trump administration should work with Congress to expand manufacturing-focused Engineering Research Center (ERC) programs. The U.S. National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Engineering Research Center program supports a network of 17 strategic university-industry partnerships that pursue high-risk, high-payoff research across almost the entire spectrum of technology fields—including advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, clean energy and sustainability, microelectronics and information technology.[64] Since 1985, NSF has funded 83 ERCs that have led to more than 1,400 invention licenses, 920 patents, and 250 spinoff companies.[65]

Unfortunately, NSF currently only supports three ERCs explicitly focused on advanced manufacturing activities: the NSF ERC for Cell Manufacturing Technologies (CMaT), the NSF ERC for Hybrid Autonomous Manufacturing Moving from Evolution to Revolution (ERC-HAMMER), and the NSF Engineering Research Center for Transformation of American Rubber through Domestic Innovation for Supply Security (NSF TARDISS ERC).[66] In August 2024, NSF announced a five-year investment of $104 million, with a potential 10-year investment of up to $208 million, in four new ERCs, including a new one focused on biomanufacturing-empowered decarbonization.[67] This represents progress, but it’s not enough; the administration should work with Congress to ensure at least $150 million in annual funding for the NSF ERC program, supporting both existing and new manufacturing-focused ERCs. Further, the ERCs should be required to have their federal funding matched at least half by industry in cash.

NSF should have more of its budget allocated to its Technology, Innovation, and Partnership (TIP) program, which focuses on translating use-inspired research into societal impact. An essential aspect of the TIP program is that it requires every project it funds to have an industry partner. Despite minimal appropriated resources, in just two years TIP has launched regional innovation programs, funded workforce development, improved U.S. competitiveness in two key technologies, and established partnerships with federal agencies and allies like India and Japan. Yet the program’s workforce has shrunk 45 percent since the start of the year due to cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency and a hiring freeze. The Trump administration should work with Congress to boost TIP appropriations to at least $1 billion annually.[68]

The Industry University Cooperative Research (IUCRC) program forges partnerships between universities and industry, featuring industrially relevant fundamental research, industrial support of and collaboration in research and education, and direct transfer of university-developed ideas, research results, and technology to U.S. industry to improve its competitive posture in global markets.[69] NSF currently operates nine IUCRCs focused on advanced manufacturing innovation, with the newest one, the Center for Integrated Material Science and Engineering of Pharmaceutical Products (CIMSEPP) launched in 2022.[70] As with the ERC program, the United States could get more out of the IUCRC program to support U.S. advanced manufacturing. The Trump administration should work with Congress to provide annual funding for the IUCRC program that supports at least 15 ongoing advanced-manufacturing focused IUCRCs.

Innovation vouchers can serve as effective instruments to bring small businesses closer to local universities to collaborate on proof of concept testing or technology development. For the past several years, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have provided technical assistance to the recipients of Department of Energy (DOE) -funded voucher programs, namely American-Made Challenges (AMC), the Incubator Program, and the Small Business Vouchers Program. This effort should be fully built out into a national program across the clean energy focused federal labs to drive strong relationships between entrepreneurs and the national labs to accelerate the roll-out of new technologies in U.S. clean energy sectors such as electric vehicle (EV) batteries and solar cells.[71]And, here, given that the United States is trailing so badly in EV battery technology to China, the Trump administration should launch such a “BatteryShot Initiative” with the goal of producing a battery with a total system cost of less than $200/kWh and a range of at least 1,000 miles per charge.[72]

11. The current 2022–2026 National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing has three top-level goals, each with objectives and priorities: (1) Develop and implement advanced manufacturing technologies; (2) Grow the advanced manufacturing workforce; and (3) Build resilience into manufacturing supply chains and ecosystems.

11a. Are these goals appropriate for the next 4–5 years? Why or why not?

These are appropriate starting goals, but the foremost goal of the National Advanced Manufacturing Strategy over the upcoming five-year period should be documented improvements in the health of what ITIF calls America’s “national power” industries.

The stark reality is that the kind of reforms and adjustments proposed above will help, but we shouldn’t fool ourselves that they will stop China from dominating advanced manufacturing. To stop that America needs much more and that will cost money and political capital. Congress needs to at least triple the R&D tax credit, something from which manufacturers are the principal beneficiary. We need a new and large source of patient capital to allow manufacturers to invest in machinery. We need to block Chinese imports of advanced manufacturing goods when they are unfairly produced and traded. We need the DOW to significantly expand its efforts beyond defense firms per se to a broad array of dual use firms and industries.

In short, U.S. manufacturing strategy should concern itself not with non-strategic industries (i.e., baseball gloves and ballpoint pens) but on enabling industries, dual-use industries, and defense industries, which collectively constitute national power industries.[73] (See figure 1.)

At one end of the continuum are defense industries. Clearly industries such as ammunition, guided missiles, military aircraft and ships, tanks, drones, defense satellites, and others are strategic. Not having world class innovation and production capabilities in these industries means a weakened military capability. Policymakers across the aisle generally agree that these industries are strategic and that market forces alone will not produce the needed results.

At the other end of the spectrum are industries in which the United States has no real strategic interests. These include furniture, coffee and tea manufacturing, bicycles, carpet and rug mills, window and door production, plastic bottle manufacturing, wind turbine production, lawn and garden equipment, sporting goods, jewelry, caskets, toys, toiletries, running shoes, etc. If worst came to worst and our adversaries (e.g., China) gained dominance in any of these industries and decided to cut America off, America would survive—in part, because none of these are critical to the running of the U.S. economy, as many are final goods that might inconvenience consumers but wouldn’t cripple any industries, and also because, in most cases, domestic production could be started or expanded relatively easily because none of these products are all that technological complex from either a product or process concern and the barriers to entry are relatively low.

Next to defense industries dual-use industries are critical to American strength. Losing aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, semiconductors, displays, advanced software, fiber optic cable, telecom equipment, machine tools, motors, measuring devices, and other dual-use sectors would give our adversaries incredible leverage over America. Just the threat to cut these off (assuming that they have also deindustrialized our allies in these sectors) would immediately bring U.S. policymakers to the bargaining table. National power industries tend to also need global scale in order to complete. Moreover, many are intermediate goods such as semiconductors and chemicals, where a cutoff would cripple many other industries. Finally, these industries are hard to stand up once they’re lost because of the complexity of the production process, product knowledge, and the importance of the industrial commons that support them. In other words, barriers to entry are high and, if lost, would be very difficult and expensive to reconstitute.

Finally, there are enabling industries. These are industries wherein, if the United States were cut off, the immediate effects on military readiness would be small. And the U.S. economy could survive for at least a while without production. America could survive for many years without an auto sector, as we would all just drive cars longer. But because of the nature of these industries—including technology development, process innovation, skills, and supporting institutions—their loss would harm both dual-use and defense industries. That is because enabling industries contribute to the industrial commons that support dual-use defense industries. A severely weakened motor vehicle sector would weaken the tank and military vehicle ecosystem. Similarly, a weakened commercial shipbuilding sector has weakened military shipbuilding. A weakened consumer electronics sector weakens military electronics.

The industries that ITIF defines as national power industries represent about 22 percent of the total 970 industries delineated by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Of these 22 percent, 13 percent are dual-use industries, 8 percent are enabling, and just 0.5 percent are defense industries. (See figure 2.) In terms of employment, just 9.5 percent of workers were employed in power industries, with 6.4 percent employed in dual-use industries, 2.9 percent in enabling industries, and the remaining 0.2 percent employed in defense industries.[74]

An analysis of several quantitative indicators of manufacturing inputs and outputs indicates that dual-use and enabling manufacturing industries have declined more than nonstrategic and defense industries over the past several years, from 2007 to 2022.

Dual-use and enabling industries have seen the steepest declines in employment among the four classifications, with declines of 17 percent and 19 percent, respectively, compared to a 10 percent decline in nonstrategic and defense industries. Additionally, capital investment in productivity-enhancing capital, such as machinery and equipment, fell by 34 percent in enabling industries, while dual-use industries saw no change, and nonstrategic and defense industries increased investment by 7 percent and 32 percent, respectively.[75]

Nominal value added grew across all classifications, yet growth was weakest among the core manufacturing base of enabling and dual-use industries. Nonstrategic industries saw the highest growth of 26 percent, followed by defense industries (16 percent), then enabling and dual-use industries, which grew by just 11 percent and 4 percent, respectively.[76] When considering inflation, which has grown approximately 41 percent economy-wide, value added in enabling and dual-use industries declined significantly.[77]

The decline in enabling and dual-use industry output indicates a hollowing out of the U.S. industrial base, and the consequences of this are severe. These industries are most critical to U.S. national security and support domestic supply chains and national power, and they are losing ground to international competitors, namely China. China has followed a predictable playbook across industry after industry, with significant state financial backing, forced technology transfer, and IP theft, leaving American firms unable to compete and contributing to the decline of U.S. advanced manufacturing. To combat this decline and push back against Chinese economic mercantilism, the United States must implement a national power industry strategy in which the most critical industries for national power are prioritized in policymaking. As noted previously, the first step in achieving this is the crafting of industry-specific strategies.[78]

While general industrial support, such as R&D credits and full expensing for capital equipment, are valuable tools in industrial development, their impacts are limited. All national power industries differ in their structure, key players, competitive forces, and technological needs, meaning each requires curated, individualized strategic support to help firms in the United States compete in global markets. Critical industries should be highlighted and strategies developed, including a national semiconductor strategy, a national aerospace strategy, a national robotics strategy, and more. Creating these strategies will require in-depth industry research, identifying unique strengths and weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in each industry, and analyzing how federal, state, and local policy support will impact global power and competitiveness.[79]

Conclusion

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation commends the Trump administration for working to develop an up-to-date, coherent National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing. The success of this effort will be vital to enhancing the global competitiveness of U.S. advanced manufacturing over the coming decade.

Thank you for your consideration.

By Ruth Liao, Liam Vaughan, and Jim Wyss

For 20 minutes, Wes Edens barely pauses as he talks about the sunny prospects for his beleaguered liquefied natural gas company, New Fortress Energy. Dressed in an open-collar blue shirt, his once-blond hair down to his neck, the effervescent 64-year-old billionaire from Montana appears relaxed, flicking through a printout of a PowerPoint presentation he says he prepared himself. It outlines NFE’s operations in Brazil, Mexico and Nicaragua, as well as the global growth potential of liquefied natural gas, or LNG.

It’s a cloudless November morning in Puerto Rico, where NFE supplies more than a third of the island’s natural gas and operates a handful of power plants. Edens, who made his fortune in private equity and co-owns both the Premier League team Aston Villa and the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks, has invited Bloomberg Businessweek to his company’s facility at the Port of San Juan to explain why, in spite of evidence to the contrary, NFE’s future is bright. “This is an amazing constellation of assets,” he says, waving the presentation. “We’ve invested $7 billion, millions of hours. But public markets aren’t always the most patient.”

Seven years ago, when NFE listed on the Nasdaq, it promised to shake up the staid market for LNG, a cheaper, cleaner alternative to the oil and diesel that are still in widespread use to generate electricity in poorer countries. LNG is made by cooling natural gas to -260F (-162C), which compresses it to a 600th of its original volume. Edens and his colleagues had come up with a new method for building the hulking terminals where the liquefaction and export take place, which they pledged would be quicker and cheaper than how everyone else did it. They gave their process the snappy moniker “Fast LNG.” Investors and lenders lapped it up, pouring billions of dollars into the business. By 2022, NFE had a market cap of $9.5 billion.

Since then the stock price has plummeted from $60 to around $1 as the company has lurched from one problem to the next. The first Fast LNG export site, off the coast of Altamira, Mexico, was beset by construction issues, leading to long delays and ballooning costs. It’s now operational, but last year investors sued NFE and its executives for allegedly misleading them over how much progress they were making, claims the defendants have denied. The case is ongoing.

Meanwhile, NFE’s Nicaragua import terminal, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2021, has yet to be switched on; the company just sold its facility in Jamaica to pay down debt; one of its new import facilities in Brazil doesn’t have any customers lined up; and in Puerto Rico, even after securing a new deal to supply the island with LNG, Edens is still scrambling to patch up his relationship with the government.

In Edens’ telling, the difficult part—building the export and import terminals and power plants underpinning NFE’s business—is largely complete, paving the way for cash to finally start flooding in. He acknowledges it all took longer and cost more than anticipated, but he says the market is seriously undervaluing the company. Edens attributes many of NFE’s difficulties to the decision to go public too early, leading to unnecessary external pressure. Markets “often struggle to properly value projects until they’re turned on and generating revenue,” he says.

Some former employees (there’s no shortage: Two-thirds of NFE’s staff have left or been laid off in the past year), however, describe a company in perpetual crisis, run by a gifted salesman who’s proved more adept at attracting capital and winning contracts than at delivering on those commitments. Holders of NFE’s $9 billion of distressed debt are certainly running out of patience—some have taken to calling the company No F—ing Exit. With some NFE bonds currently trading at roughly 30¢ on the dollar, Edens is talking to creditors about the possibility of restructuring the company through a UK process known as a scheme of arrangement, which would involve converting some of the debt into equity and slashing the interest on what remains. That would allow NFE to continue as a going concern, though bondholders could decide they no longer want Edens at the helm. Another alternative would be declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy and selling off the assets.

“It’s a very important time for the company,” Edens says, before donning a hard hat and leading a tour of the facility. If he manages to turn NFE’s fortunes around, it will be up there with the Bucks’ 2021 NBA championship, its first in 50 years, in terms of professional achievements. If he doesn’t, it will go down as one of the biggest corporate failures in recent history.

Natural gas provides about a third of the world’s energy. ​​Once extracted from underground or beneath a seabed, the gas is delivered to consumers via high-pressure steel pipelines. But the pipe network doesn’t cover everywhere, and there are limits to how far the fuel can be pumped. Liquefying it allows it to be transported on massive ships equipped with specially built cryogenic tanks. The US is the world’s largest LNG exporter (a result of the fracking and shale explosion of the 2000s), followed by Australia, Qatar and Russia. When it reaches its destination, LNG is heated up and brought back to a gaseous state—“regasified.” The gas is given an odor to make it detectable in case of leaks and pumped into the local transmission system.

The industry’s biggest challenge is building the facilities that convert gas into LNG. These vast export plants, which in the US dot the coast of Texas and Louisiana, are constructed by armies of specialist workers over a period of years and can cost tens of billions of dollars. The cooling takes place in what’s known as a cold box, which relies on a heat exchanger system not dissimilar to that found in a home’s HVAC unit, at thousands of times the size. Once liquefied, the fuel is stored in tanks as tall as a 15-story building at a constant -260F, requiring around-the-clock monitoring. Shutdowns and accidents aren’t uncommon; many facilities have their own fire department. All this helps explain why the market has traditionally been dominated by nation-states and oil majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell Plc. Companies that build LNG plants tend to sell the fuel via generationally long contracts—as long as 20 years—to persuade financiers to commit the capital required. Barriers to entry, in economics parlance, are high.

The idea for NFE struck Edens after Fortress Investment Group LLC, the private equity firm he co-founded, bought a train line in Florida in 2007. (The current iteration of the train, which runs between Orlando and Miami, is called Brightline.) When the firm settled on LNG as the train’s fuel source—briefly; it now runs on biodiesel—he saw the potential for a new business. “We’ve had lots of success in managing money, making investments,” Edens says. “I wanted to do something that had a meaningful and tangible impact on the world.”

NFE built a micro liquefaction facility in 2015 and the next year started exporting surplus fuel not used by the railway to Caribbean markets. Then it built import terminals—where LNG is heated and turned back into gas—in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Jamaica, and also acquired an existing facility in Brazil. It hired traders in London to buy cargoes of LNG in the market and leased tankers to ship it. LNG tankers can be almost a thousand feet long, and shipments are typically worth tens of millions of dollars. In the early stages of the war in Ukraine, when Europe was looking to rapidly replace Russian natural gas, a shipment could fetch as much as $100 million.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, when demand plummeted for energy of all kinds, NFE announced an investment in a green hydrogen business. Later the company pivoted to data centers. Edens can be demanding and mercurial, say former NFE employees, who requested anonymity owing to the company’s difficulties. They recount executives being dispatched at short notice to Sri Lanka, Mauritania and Ireland to win business, then berated when nothing came of it. One former executive recalls dreading being summoned to the boss’s Manhattan office—a situation not helped by the large painting of a wolf devouring its prey hanging on the wall.

“The media loves to elevate the voices of former employees,” Edens wrote in an email response to questions. “But those who quit and walked away should not drive the narrative or define our story.”

It was during the pandemic that Edens and his team struck upon the Fast LNG concept that would propel NFE to the status of investor darling. At the time, a large majority of LNG terminals were based on land, but some forward-looking companies had started putting them offshore, on huge vessels, removing the hassle and cost of acquiring real estate. NFE proposed to slot liquefaction terminals onto disused oil rigs, which could be picked up for next to nothing. Terminals would be identical, essentially interchangeable; cost efficiencies would follow.

Some in the LNG world were skeptical. Edens insisted Fast LNG would change the industry and made it the company’s primary focus, saying he hoped to get the first facility operational by 2022. The plan was to locate the maiden plant off the coast of Louisiana. When no permit was forthcoming after a year, Edens changed tack. In July 2022, NFE announced it had struck a deal with Mexico’s state utility to locate its first export facility off Altamira, with gas arriving through a 500-mile-long undersea pipeline from Texas. The terminal, spread over three separate rigs, would be built at a shipyard in Corpus Christi, Texas, then towed down the Gulf of Mexico.

In September, NFE issued a press release saying it hoped to complete the project by the next March. The plan was to follow that with four additional Fast LNG units in quick succession. “Utilizing a highly skilled workforce,” NFE had “developed an efficient and repeatable construction process—essentially an FLNG factory—that substantially reduces the cost and time to build incremental liquefaction capacity,” the company wrote. Two months later, NFE held an investor day at the shipyard, where two dozen or so finance types were given hard hats and shown around industrial-scale machinery by a long-haired engineer in coveralls. It was a hit, as was NFE’s announcement the same week that progress was so good the company was increasing its earnings guidance for 2023 to $2.5 billion, from $1.5 billion.

“We urge investors (who may have been waiting on the sidelines before) to take a serious look at NFE now because Fast LNG, we believe, is coming soon and the broader market doesn’t likely fully appreciate the potential upside,” one analyst wrote. Another said he’d come away from the site visit with “increased confidence” in NFE’s ability to meet its construction targets. He increased his target price for the stock by $10.

By the following week, NFE’s shares had risen 7%, almost to their historical peak. NFE then borrowed an additional $700 million and announced a bonus dividend worth $630 million. “Our business is now generating significant, stable, and growing cash, which we believe affords us the ability to both retain capital necessary to grow and return excess capital to shareholders,” Edens said in a December 2022 press release. As the biggest shareholders, he and his family received $217 million, more than the company’s profit for the previous year.

Behind the scenes, though, NFE was starting to flounder. Construction of the Altamira export terminal was taking longer and costing more than anticipated. (The final cost was about $3.5 billion, more than three times the original estimate.) NFE pushed the expected completion date from March to May 2023, then October, then early 2024. Similar delays were occurring at the import terminals in Nicaragua and Brazil. As for developments in Angola and Mauritania that were announced enthusiastically in press releases, they never got going.

Former executives say Edens had a habit of telling investors and prospective customers what they wanted to hear without consulting engineers and project managers on the ground. On earnings calls he’d talk about how he had “tremendous visibility,” and how his estimates of future income were “not really forward-looking” because they were based on “the business flows and the transactions that we have in hand.” Then, the following quarter, he’d move the goalposts, and the share price would tumble.

“There’s a saying we live by—it’s literally on our office wall: nothing exceptional comes from reasonable expectations,” Edens wrote in an email by way of explanation. “It’s simply a way to motivate others to suspend disbelief and get big things built.”

With pressure mounting, Edens and his team took the decision in the summer of 2023 to transport the Fast LNG plant from Corpus Christi to Altamira before it had undergone commissioning, the rigorous final testing of systems and equipment. NFE marked the milestone with a video showing a rig as tall as an office block, complete with living quarters and a helipad, being pulled across the ocean by five tugboats that looked minuscule by comparison. It was an arresting image, but commissioning on the water rather than onshore created logistical headaches and ended up adding to the delays. In February 2024, after another disappointing set of earnings, Edens pushed the timetable back once more. “While it’s been a little bit delayed,” he said on an earnings call, “it’s important to note that it still would be the fastest LNG installation in the history of the planet.”

Around midday on April 26, an aluminum pipe inside the cold box exploded during a pressure test. The site was evacuated, and several workers were hospitalized. Repairs dragged on. Finally the first LNG cargo ship set sail from Altamira on Aug. 12. It should have been a moment of celebration for Edens and his team. But earlier that week the company had put out a press release slashing its earnings guidance in half, leading NFE’s shares to fall 24%. There was more bad news to come.

On Sept. 17, 2024, investors filed the class-action lawsuit in New York, alleging that New Fortress and its executives intentionally and repeatedly misled the market about progress at Altamira and other locations, a form of securities fraud. The suit contrasted Edens’ and his executives’ upbeat public statements with a damning picture of what was happening on the ground, drawn from interviews with a dozen unnamed former NFE employees who’d worked on the project. Pipeworkers, project managers and engineers reported “endemic” delays, hazardous working conditions, “poor planning” and “chaotic” mismanagement. One described Edens’ decision to commission the facility on the water as “insane.”

The most shocking allegation related to the November 2022 investor day in Texas. According to the manager responsible for commissioning at the time, NFE had “pulled the main turbines from the manufacturer’s (Siemens) factory early—three months before they were done—just to make it look like Defendants were further along to attendees at the investor day presentation.” The whole event was “staged to create an illusion of progress,” the former manager said. (Edens denies this happened, describing the allegation as “ridiculous.”)

NFE rejected the allegations in the lawsuit, writing in a filing that Edens and his colleagues “expressly and continuously disclosed that its projected milestones were simply estimates.” (Corporate officials who make forward-looking statements in good faith are protected from prosecution by so-called safe harbor provisions.) NFE added that the Altamira facility was “successfully built and continues to drive value for the Company’s stockholders.” A motion by NFE’s lawyers to dismiss the case is being considered by the judge. “I’ve never sold a share!” adds Edens, refuting the suggestion that he profited from his overoptimism. As for the decision to pay a large dividend when most of the assets were unbuilt, he says that was consistent with his understanding of the business’s prospects at the time.

Earlier this month, after some to-ing and fro-ing, NFE announced it had secured a seven-year contract worth $3.2 billion to supply Puerto Rico with gas from Altamira. It was a welcome development but smaller than the 20-year deal originally mooted, and the news barely made a ripple in the markets. Next up, there’s the matter of finding long-term buyers for the power produced by the Brazilian terminal in Santa Catarina and getting Nicaragua operational. Both of those efforts, Edens says, are “nearly complete.” Soon, he says, gas will finally start flowing, along with NFE’s profits.

As for the plan to build more Fast LNG export terminals, that’s been shelved, at least for now. According to Edens, that’s a natural consequence of changes in market fundamentals: LNG prices are now so low that it’s just as cheap to buy cargoes in the markets as it is to produce it at export terminals like Altamira. Others see it as more of a capitulation. “The fact is that NFE’s ambition was not matched with technical and execution capabilities,” says Richard Pratt of the consulting firm Precision LNG. Pratt describes the whole Fast LNG concept as a “white elephant.”

If the business is to have any kind of future, Edens and his bankers must first reach an agreement with NFE’s various creditor groups. On Nov. 15 bondholders agreed to hold off receiving their latest interest payments for a month, buying Edens a little more time to build consensus around a restructuring plan and save the company. Adding to his stress, Brightline, the Florida train operation, is undergoing its own restructuring after failing to service its debts. Considering the stakes, Edens seems relaxed about it. “Obviously it’s not ideal, but this is a circumstance that many companies have been through before in one way or the other,” he says of NFE’s predicament. “There’s a tremendous amount of asset value. The company is literally on the 1-yard line.”

HUNTINGTON, NY — Huntington Supervisor Ed Smyth and the Huntington Town Board unveiled a new electric vehicle (EV) initiative Friday that expands the town’s municipal EV fleet and installs multiple charging stations across the community.

The initiative, launched in partnership with several EV technology providers and utility partners, is aimed at reducing emissions, lowering operating costs, and increasing public access to EV charging throughout Huntington.

“Giving environmentally sound options to drivers throughout Huntington is critically important for the entire town and the communities we serve,” Smyth said. “We are already experiencing significant benefits by introducing EVs to our fleet and providing strategically located charging stations for town vehicles and the community at large. Overall, this project will be a win for the town, a win for the community, and a win for the environment.”

Over the past several months, the town has begun deploying new electric vehicles in departments that require frequent daily travel, including Public Safety, General Services, Information Technology, and Parks and Recreation.

To date, the town’s EV fleet includes three Ford F-150 Lightning trucks and four Chevrolet Equinox electric SUVs. Fleet charging stations have been installed at Town Hall and the General Services Facility on Boxer Court to support the new vehicles. The Raymond T. Cavanagh Maintenance Facility on Pulaski Road will also feature charging stations accessible to both municipal vehicles and the general public.

Town officials said the initiative is also designed to ease “range anxiety” for EV drivers while providing convenient charging options for apartment residents, shoppers, park visitors, and commuters.

New public EV charging stations are located at: General Services Facility, Boxer Court (6 ports), Pulaski Road facility (4 ports), Town Hall (4 ports), Veterans Park (4 ports), Otsego Park (4 ports)

These additions supplement existing charging ports already installed at the Huntington LIRR station and Town Hall.

The EV rollout was fast-tracked through a combination of state, federal, and utility grants and rebates totaling $730,500, town officials said.

Funding sources included: $250,000 — NYSERDA Clean Energy Community Grant, $233,500 — Energy Efficiency & Conservation Block Grant (EECBG), $137,750 — PSEG Long Island EV Make Ready Rebates, $27,500 — State and Municipal (SAM) Facilities Grants, $62,000 — Environmental Open Space and Parks (EOSPA) Fund, and an Additional $63,000 from EOSPA funding

A key partner in the initiative was PSEG Long Island, whose EV Make Ready Program provides infrastructure incentives of up to $65,000 per port for DC fast chargers and up to $6,500 per port for Level 2 chargers.

“Kudos to the Town of Huntington for installing public EV charging stations around the town and replacing some gas-powered fleet vehicles with money- and energy-saving electric vehicles,” said Paul DiBenedetto, PSEG Long Island’s Electric Vehicle Program manager. “The chargers will help reduce range anxiety and encourage drivers to choose EVs.”

Growing EV Use in Huntington

Electric vehicle ownership continues to rise statewide. According to NYSERDA, there were 320,362 registered EVs in New York as of November 2025. Suffolk County accounted for 41,154 of those vehicles, with 8,657 registered in the Town of Huntington — representing roughly 21 percent of the county’s total EVs.

Town officials said the initiative also supports Huntington’s effort to become a Climate Smart Silver Community while reducing fuel and maintenance costs, lowering carbon emissions, and improving employee and customer satisfaction.

Future EV Projects Planned

The Town Board has already approved additional EV infrastructure projects supported by grant funding, including:

Overall, the rate of EV adoption around the world is slowing down compared to just a few years ago.","The automotive industry's transition to electric vehicles is taking another hit. This time, it's happening in Europe.

What's happening?

Reuters reported on a successful challenge to the European Union's 2035 ban on internal combustion engines led by German automakers and stakeholders. That campaign cited increased competition by Chinese EV automakers, like BYD, and U.S. tariffs as factors in the push.

""Next Tuesday, the European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines,"" declared Manfred Weber, a prominent EU politician, at a press conference in Heidelberg, Germany.

Instead of the 2035 ban, a new measure will tentatively set a target of 90% reduction in carbon pollution over automakers' fleets beginning in 2035. Weber defended the about-face by calling it a push for market-driven solutions and consumer choice in achieving climate targets.

At the press conference, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized EVs' importance to hitting decarbonization goals. He stated that those goals must be met while advocating for alternatives like synthetic fuels as part of ""technological openness.""

Why is Europe's backpedaling on EV adoption important?

This decision could slow progress toward a cleaner future, maintaining reliance on gas-powered vehicles that contribute significantly to carbon pollution. It also doesn't exist in a vacuum.

Moves in the U.S. led by the Trump administration are discouraging EV adoption. Those include the end of EV tax credits for consumers and, more recently, lowered targets for fuel efficiency for U.S. automakers' fleets.

Overall, the rate of EV adoption around the world is slowing down compared to just a few years ago. While lawmakers should take into account how domestic automakers are faring in the increasingly competitive landscape, they should also balance the environmental consequences.

The world is facing increasingly devastating weather events. There is more variability in the production of farming and other industries due to record-setting temperatures and unpredictable weather. It remains vital to assess how such decisions affect progress toward a sustainable future and a healthier environment.

What's being done about EV adoption in Europe?

In spite of this gloomy piece of news for EVs, it's necessary to look at the greater context. After all, a huge justification for the move is the assortment of competitive options that China is bringing to the market.

That's bad news for German auto brands trying to keep up. Consumers, however, benefit from the price pressure brought along by a competitive market. It's also clear that EVs are in demand in Europe with Tesla finding large success there and BYD overtaking them recently.

According to a press release, Air products is working on the Louisiana Clean Energy Complex to become the world’s largest low-carbon energy complex. The complex is designed to produce around 750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen, capturing 95% of the carbon dioxide generated during normal operation.

Air Products is the project developer and once the ammonia plant has achieved agreed upon performance levels, Yara would acquire the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities for approximately 25% of the total project cost, which is estimated between $8 billion and $9 billion.

Yara would then assume responsibility for related operations and integrate the entire ammonia output into its global distribution network.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tons of low-carbon ammonia per year.

The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products’ customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products’ 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system. About five million tons per year of high purity CO₂ captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

The effort will also include the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia, which is more than 90% complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tons per year of renewable ammonia.

On December 5, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) issued a Memorandum emphasizing a “compliance first” policy in all existing and future compliance and enforcement matters. A summary of the Memorandum follows our analysis.

What Does the Memorandum Do?

The Memorandum directs EPA civil enforcement staff to prioritize compliance over prolonged negotiations, with early compliance emphasized while leaving the Superfund early action approach unchanged. The Memorandum outlines six guiding factors: (1) use of a compliance assistance toolkit (outreach, training, “find and fix” self-audits) to encourage voluntary compliance; (2) coordination with state partners to ensure consistency and allow states to join civil judicial actions; (3) open communication to avoid duplication and build trust with regulated entities; (4) clear, nationally consistent findings of violation based on the “best reading” of law and regulation; (5) efficient, economical compliance requirements and injunctive relief tied directly to governing statutes, with OECA approval required for SEPs and other remedies; and (6) reasoned decision-making under the “LEAPS” model (law, evidence, analysis, programmatic impact, stakeholder impact) to ensure sound enforcement outcomes.

Who Is Impacted

The Memorandum impacts any regulated entity engaging with EPA or DOJ in its representation of EPA in compliance or enforcement activities, especially for those defending some of EPA’s most novel or aggressive interpretations to form the basis for their alleged violations.

What Industry Should Do

The objectives of the Memorandum are to compel more streamlined enforcement, findings of violation based on the best reading of a regulation, less burdensome injunctive provisions, and fewer unexpected compliance assurance activities. Below are several steps companies should take to align with this Administration’s “compliance-first” orientation:

Compliance Programs: Because this Administration encourages proactive compliance, continue to ensure environmental compliance programs and related protocols are up to date, diligently implemented, and have the appropriate resources. In that regard, see recent U.S. Department of Justice Corporate Compliance Guidelines.

Find and Fix: The concept of “compliance first” refers not only to prioritization, but also to the timeline of when a company should come into compliance. Therefore, employ a “find and fix” approach by conducting confidential riskassessment audits and reviewing them to evaluate potential avenues for self-reporting and other voluntary compliance options, while protecting attorney-client privilege.

Be Communicative: Because this framework emphasizes open communication, consider staying in touch more regularly with relevant agencies at both the federal and state levels to maintain strong, trusting relationships with regulators. The Administration will expect to see the “no surprises” policy going both ways.

Finding of Violation: If your company receives a finding of violation that is uncertain or ambiguous, consult with counsel about raising and possibly elevating concerns with EPA. Under this framework, EPA must elevate such concerns to regional counsel or the Office of General Counsel.

Settlements: If enforcement settlements involve third-party audits, monitoring, or any other mitigation or stipulated remedy, ensure EPA personnel have obtained appropriate approval from the OECA Assistant Administrator, as is required under this framework. Also, do not expect settlements to involve SEPs until additional guidance is issued.

Analysis

Craig Pritzlaff, Acting Assistant Administrator of EPA’s OECA, issued the Memorandum, entitled “Reinforcing a ‘Compliance First’ Orientation for Compliance Assurance and Civil Enforcement Activities,” to OECA personnel. Pritzlaff advanced a similar “compliance first” policy during his tenure as Director of the Office of Compliance and Enforcement at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). Beveridge & Diamond’s Texas office has direct experience with the policy’s implementation in Texas and anticipated the roll out of a “compliance first” orientation nationwide.

While “compliance first” has long been EPA’s stated approach, the Memorandum calls for more frequent national elevation of regional violations and emphasizes open communication with regulated entities and coordination with state partners. The Memorandum could have significant impacts, potentially limiting the scope of EPA enforcement actions and reducing the agency’s utilization of novel theories or overbroad interpretations of the law in lieu of creating new rules.

The Memorandum should not be interpreted as a directive to reduce inspections or reduce enforcement generally. If implemented as it was at TCEQ, “compliance first” is not simply an Agency enforcement policy, but a view that the Agency intends for industry to embrace as well and well ahead of an inspection and enforcement. Companies should continue to prepare for inspections and regularly evaluate compliance status.

The Memorandum does not guarantee widespread change in environmental enforcement as a whole, and holding the Agency accountable to similar fair-play and best-reading-of-law concepts espoused in multiple Executive Orders has proved to be slow and often unsuccessful. However, the Memorandum will undoubtedly impact some cases and overall, and may shift emphasis to compliance actions and resolutions over more formal enforcement actions – that could mean more emphasis on administrative resolutions, more no-penalty Administrative Orders on Consent, and fewer judicial referrals. This may be especially true for regulated entities defending alleged violations based on novel or overreaching EPA legal interpretations that deviate substantially from years of past interpretive positions.

The Memorandum also elevates legal interpretations to Agency leadership, emphasizing that inspectors and enforcement staff, including attorneys, are not responsible for resolving ambiguity in federal environmental laws, but only for identifying and elevating such ambiguity when raised by a regulated entity. While this may expedite some resolution in some cases, in other instances, it may result in longer delays while leadership considers arguments and positions.

How much impact the Memorandum can have remains to be seen. The “find-it-fix-it” approach at TCEQ had strong legal support in the Texas Audit Act, which incentivizes industry self-audits and disclosures in ways that EPA’s own Audit Policy has failed to achieve. TCEQ also has an administrative Penalty Policy that, under Pritzlaff’s leadership, was updated regularly to make penalty calculations more transparent and more consistently applied. This is in contrast to EPA’s current discrete and inconsistent programmatic penalty policies, many of which are decades old and can result in enormous swings in penalty ranges.

And while the focus on administrative enforcement has benefits, industry should keep in mind that administrative orders often do not satisfy the diligent prosecution bars in defending citizen suits that civil judicial enforcement does. And, how Jarkesy (see B&D’s July 2024 alert here) will play out for EPA administrative actions is an issue to watch. All this means, of course, is that embracing “compliance first” cultures is the best first course of action.

Summary of the Memorandum

The Memorandum states that, effective immediately, all EPA personnel responsible for civil enforcement and compliance assurance activities must prioritize ensuring compliance when addressing ongoing and future potential non-compliance with federal environmental laws. This framework intends to streamline early compliance, rather than divert unnecessary resources into prolonged negotiations. The Memorandum also notes that it will not impact the established early action approach to Superfund enforcement. Below is a summary of the six factors relied upon in the Memorandum.

1. Compliance Assistance Toolkit

The first factor—the compliance assistance toolkit—is driven by OECA’s assertion that enforcement should not be the only means for achieving compliance. Instead, the Memorandum urges EPA personnel to use compliance assistance tools such as outreach, technical assistance, and training, including employing a “find and fix” approach to voluntary compliance through self-reporting and self-audits, to proactively encourage regulated entities to comply, rather than retroactively addressing compliance issues in enforcement. This approach is consistent with the first Trump administration’s efforts to prioritize compliance assistance rather than a standard “nail and hammer” enforcement approach that can occur once EPA identifies potential violations.

2. State Partner Coordination

Because most federal environmental laws delegate state authority for environmental compliance and enforcement, the Memorandum re-emphasizes the Trump administration’s priority of having OECA and EPA enforcement personnel work with states to ensure consistency and state input in compliance assurance and enforcement activities.

It should be noted that if a state is a co-plaintiff in a civil judicial action, then those actions may continue even during this push for “compliance first.” There is an incentive for states to join these actions to share in the penalty and coordinate on the implementation of injunctive relief. Additionally, at least in the RCRA context, states cannot join as a party in administrative actions.

3. Open Communication

Building on further coordination with state partners, the Memorandum also emphasizes open communication between all interested parties to ensure further clarity regarding required compliance. By strengthening communication, OECA seeks to avoid unnecessary or duplicative compliance assurance activities, which waste time and money. EPA emphasizes that more open communication will also help ensure there are “no surprises” for regulated entities and build trust between the parties, including encouraging voluntary compliance through self-reporting.

4. Finding of Violation

To avoid uncertainty, findings of violation must be “clear and unambiguous, well-tailored, and based on the ‘best reading’ of the relevant statute and regulation.” The “best reading” of a statute or regulation must consider statutory construction canons, past practice, and current litigation. The Memorandum contemplates regulated entities raising concerns about how EPA has applied a statute or regulation to their case, such as asserting potentially controversial or novel enforcement theories. When a regulated entity raises a concern, inspectors and enforcement staff, including attorneys, are expected to elevate it, including to OECA as needed. Any decision is to be made at the national level to ensure national consistency. Lastly, OECA plans to create consolidated criteria to more clearly define specific categories of violations, which will allow for more consistent findings of violations across all EPA programs and regions.

5. Compliance Requirements and Injunctive Relief

Recognizing that rapid compliance may not always be possible and that formal enforcement will be necessary, the Memorandum emphasizes, in such cases, that EPA must take the most efficient, economical, and swift strategy possible in its negotiations and litigation (if needed). An important addition is their requirement that any injunctive relief provisions shall be based on “the best, most defensible interpretation of the law” to quickly achieve compliance. Furthermore, settlements and orders must reflect a “clear nexus to the governing statute and implementing regulations.”

Additionally, the Memorandum rescinds EPA’s April 2021 memorandum, which set forth expansive injunctive relief tools for civil enforcement settlements, such as third-party audits or monitoring. The OECA Assistant Administrator must now approve the use of these tools prior to negotiation. This includes supplemental environmental projects (SEPs), a historically controversial remedy, which are not to be included in any settlement until EPA issues additional guidance (see B&D’s 2024 alert on SEPs here). Lastly, the OECA Assistant Administrator must approve the use of any other mitigation or stipulated remedy before negotiation. The Memorandum defines stipulated remedies as a settlement term that requires the implementation of a specified project in the event of any future violation of the settlement agreement but does not include stipulated penalties in this definition.

6. Reasoned Decision Making

The last factor requires OECA to use reasoned decision-making when determining non-compliance and enforcement remedies. This may be self-evident, but the Memorandum clarifies that decision-making must now follow the “LEAPS” model, using law, evidence, analysis, programmatic impact, and stakeholder impact to reach a sound, logical conclusion in compliance and enforcement actions.

Ionic Minerals Technology, or Ionic MT, found its Silicon Ridge mine is chock-full of critical minerals and rare earth elements. According to Andre Zeitoun, Ionic MT’s CEO and founder, the newly discovered supply could support initiatives to electrify transportation and bolster defense, all while reducing dependence on foreign markets.

Silicon Ridge’s deposit of critical and rare earth minerals is suspended in clay, not hard rock, making it easier to extract. The clay holds 16 critical minerals, Zeitoun said, including gallium and germanium, used in electronics, fiber-optic cables, and lasers. The mine holds a large supply of halloysite, a mineral used to build better batteries. China by far produces the lion’s share of critical minerals, and when it recently restricted exports on them, U.S. companies were sent scrambling for new supplies.

“Over the last 20 years, [we’ve] kind of put ourselves in a situation,” Zeitoun said, “where we’ve allowed ourselves to be solely reliant on imports of these metals that power our lives.”

The discovery at Silicon Ridge could open the door to finding more rare earths throughout Utah, said Katie Potter, a professional geologist and professor of practice at Utah State University.

“It may kick off a halloysite gold rush,” Potter said.

Zeitoun said his company can extract the materials with virtually zero waste and that it will use no explosives or chemicals at the site. “We really view ourselves as kind of a next generation of mining,” he said, “and of responsible mining.”

The Silicon Ridge mine lies west of Utah Lake, the heart of Utah County, about an hour’s drive south of Salt Lake City. Ionic MT leases the site from the State Trust Lands Administration. The company also holds a permit with the Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining, the terms of which remain confidential, state officials confirmed.

“We are excited about the ongoing progress on the project,” the agency’s director Mick Thomas said in a statement, “and the potential it represents.”

Rare earths are crucial for green technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, along with batteries and motors. Ionic MT launched in 2020 by mining halloysite from clay deposits in Juab County, near the town of Eureka. Halloysite is an aluminum-silicon mineral that electric vehicle manufacturers are tapping to help batteries charge faster and last longer.

“You can charge a vehicle as quickly as it takes to fill up a tank of gas,” Zeitoun said, “which is considered one of the key enablers of EV mass adoption.”

The company processes the mineral through a patented procedure at its 74,000 square-foot manufacturing plant in Provo. In search of more supplies, Ionic MT began exploring Silicon Ridge, but was surprised to find much more than halloysite.

“Our machine came back showing, in every single sample that we looked at, the same distribution of these metals,” Zeitoun said. “We first thought … maybe there’s a mistake.”

Third-party testing, however, revealed an abundance of metals, the CEO said. The Silicon Ridge deposit came from the same type of ancient volcanic formation that created rich deposits in China. That country currently produces around 60 percent of the planet’s supply of rare earths, and commands 90 percent of processing.

Similar deposits lie in Brazil and Australia, Zeitoun said, but Silicon Ridge is the only known analogue in the United States.

Utah’s halloysite formed from a volcanic flare up around 30 million years ago, Potter said. The ash settled near hot springs that created unique clays with tube structures.

“Those tubes can suck in rare earth elements and other critical metals, like lithium,” she said, “and prevent it from being leached or weathered away.”

Silicon Ridge’s proximity to roads, power lines, and a workforce make it favorable for mineral development as well, Potter said. “We also have climate change and a need to shift away from carbon-emitting energy resources,” she said. “If it’s not extracted here, where we have stronger environmental regulations … it’s going to be done by offloading those effects” to other countries.

Ionic MT initially leased 4,053 acres on Silicon Ridge from the Trust Lands Administration in 2023. They returned to that agency’s board in August seeking another 3,700 acres after more than 100 boreholes and trenches revealed ample rare earth and critical mineral concentrations in the clay.

The state will earn $13 per acre per year as part of the lease, and $1.60 per ton, or 10 percent of the gross value of the mined clay, whichever is greater, Trust Land documents show. All the revenue will go to Utah schools.

With state permits and a processing facility already in place, Zeitoun said his company is ready to move rapidly to begin harvesting the minerals. The mine could create hundreds of local jobs, he said.

The federal government has expressed interest in supporting the mine as well, according to Zeitoun, but he declined to disclose any details. The Trump administration has moved to secure more diverse supplies of rare earths in recent weeks after trade disputes with China.

State leaders, meanwhile, are having their own eureka moment over Ionic MT’s discovery. State Senate President Stuart Adams and House Speaker Mike Schultz, both Republicans, cited Silicon Ridge as a sign that Utah could be a powerhouse for clean energy. “Our state is uniquely positioned to lead the transition to cleaner energy,” Adams said in a news release Thursday, “by developing next-generation resources right in our own backyard.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Silicon-Ridge-Aerial-View.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:54.934253

Today marks 10 years since the ParisAgreement, when for the first time world leaders agreed to limit global warming to 1.5°C and to drive a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. And it feels like the world is turning a page, with some of it finally being in the right direction.

Exactly a month ago, world leaders gathered in Belém, Brazil for #COP30 the annual UN climate summit where governments make important decisions on climate action While the talks were far from perfect, something major happened. People powers shone through. From organizers, Indigenous and Traditional Peoples to youth and workers, everyday people showed up to put pressure on leaders and this led to some pretty historic progress:

In Colombia, the government declared its entire Amazon a fossil-free zone, a monumental step for Indigenous rights, forest protection, and global climate justice. The country will also host the world’s first International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels next year – a space that simply didn’t exist until climate movements and frontline communities demanded it.

COP30 host, Brazil, too took its first official step a few days ago, towards developing a national roadmap to phase out fossil fuels and open the door for communities to finally shape the country’s energy future.

You’ll read more about the impact people and our movement had inside and outside the COP30 negotiations, in the next section. But for now, I want to say this: These are not small shifts. They’re signs that the world is finally beginning to move in the direction people have been pushing for decades: a future where forests are protected, polluters are held accountable, and clean energy becomes a right, not a privilege.

So as 2025 ends, we’re feeling something rare: momentum. Real, global momentum led by everyday people who refuse to give up.

And for 2026? We have big, exciting work ahead and we’re glad you’re in this with us.

Movement Updates Discover our latest actions demanding climate solutions & energy justice

People power set the climate agenda at COP30

At this COP, it was the people, not politicians, who shaped the talks. For two weeks, Belém, pulsed with marches, music, and creativity as civil society turned this host city into a living call for climate justice. More than 70,000 people joined the People’s March for Climate Justice, carrying a symbolic funeral for fossil fuels, while over 200 boats transformed the Amazon River into a moving protest. Inside the UN “Blue Zone,” banner drops and our capybara action kept pressure high, reminding leaders of a simple truth: communities want rivers, not pipelines and a transition that serves people, not polluters.

Indigenous voices, stories, and solidarity took center stage

For the first time in years, COP felt rooted in land, culture, and lived experience with one of the largest Indigenous delegations in history of 3,000 representatives. We helped lift frontline leadership through powerful marches and story-driven actions like Amazon Free of Oil and Gas ritual and the premiere of the documentary Dear Ancestors from the Amazon, the Pacific, and so-called Canada — reminding leaders that climate action is about memory, identity, and protection of home. This surge of movement power helped secure the demarcation of ten Indigenous territories, a historic step for land rights and forest protection, strengthening the push for community-led renewable energy and Indigenous participation in every climate decision.

We pushed governments toward real and inclusive climate action

We worked tirelessly with partners to shift negotiations toward justice: demanding climate finance that protects people, not polluters and exposing the harm of fossil fuels. We drove momentum for the Transition Away From Fossil Fuels roadmap (TAFF), laying out how countries can wind down coal, oil, and gas in line with climate science, which gained support from almost 90 countries, although did not make it to the final text. Our advocacy did secure a major win: the Belém Action Mechanism (BAM)—a new just-transition framework centering workers, Indigenous Peoples, and frontline communities, now sits in the final CO30 text.

People’s power also met the G20 in South Africa

Alongside COP, the G20, a forum where the world’s biggest economies set global priorities, gathered in South Africa, meeting for the first time on African soil. So under We The 99%, we united workers, students, activists, and artists (the 99%) to demand climate justice, debt relief, and a fast, fair shift to renewables. Through town halls, workshops, open letters, a People’s Summit, and a mass uprising festival, we put civil society at the centre of this moment. While leaders launched the Africa Engagement Framework, a plan to deepen cooperation between the G20 and African governments on development and finance, they failed to commit to a fossil fuel phase-out, meaningful debt cancellation, or real climate finance. But we stand unwavering in our demands: Africa needs resources and justice to shape its own renewable future.

Climate Jargon Unpack the terms & concepts being used by climate activists & experts

BAM! (Belém Action Mechanism)

BAM is a new UN climate framework that makes sure the shift away from fossil fuels is fair by protecting workers, Indigenous Peoples, and frontline communities as the world transitions to clean energy.

Everyone at COP30 was talking about it. From badges to banners, “BAM!” became the rallying cry across the UN climate talks, a demand led by workers, Indigenous leaders, and climate justice groups who insisted that the energy transition must be fair, not harmful. Halfway through COP, countries representing about 80% of the world’s population signaled support for a just transition mechanism, building huge momentum.

The win: COP30 delivered and BAM was officially included in the final text. It means the UN now recognizes that climate action must center fairness, decent jobs, community protection, and Indigenous rights, alongside emissions numbers.

Why it matters: Until now, a “just transition” was mostly a promise on paper. Everyone agreed it was important, but no one was required to track progress or support communities through the shift. BAM changes that. It creates a formal space within the UN climate system to:

coordinate global action on just transition,

share best practices,

track whether countries are keeping their promises, and

help ensure support goes to those who need it most.

BAM turns justice from a slogan into a system. It’s a major step toward a transition that is fast and fair, and one of the biggest victories won by people at COP30.

No fossil fuel growth in 2025

For the first time in history, the world is on track for zero growth in fossil fuel generated electricity this year. Not because demand for electricity is falling, but because renewable energy is growing fast enough to meet all new electricity needs.

Two new, major reports explain this shift. The first, from Ember, a global energy think tank, shows solar grew an astonishing 31%, with wind close behind. Together, they covered the world’s soaring power demand, leaving no space for fossil expansion. Even in China and India, usually the biggest fossil users, fossil generation fell, replaced by record clean energy growth.

The second comes from the International Energy Agency (IEA), one of the world’s most influential energy bodies. Its latest outlook shows solar and wind rapidly outpacing fossil fuels, with clean power now cheaper, more reliable, and expanding fastest in emerging economies.

The message is clear: the fossil fuel era has peaked, and the renewable era is accelerating.

“The global race to harness the power of artificial intelligence and build data centers is underway,” Zeldin said in a press release Thursday.
“EPA is diligently working to eliminate burdensome regulations and ensure data centers and related facilities can be built in the U.S. as we Power the Great American Comeback.","The Environmental Protection Agency is following through on its commitment to tear down regulatory barriers in the name of artificial intelligence, unveiling a new webpage Thursday aimed at guiding industry on Clean Air Act rules to more quickly build data centers.

The Clean Air Act Resource for Data Centers page provides infrastructure developers with a host of information about the 1970 federal law. “Looking exclusively through the lens of the CAA, EPA’s specific new resources provide state and private sector partners with regulatory information, guidance and technical tools that can assist with modeling, air quality permitting, and regulatory interpretations relevant for data centers and AI facility development,” the agency’s press office said in response to a FedScoop request for comment Friday.

The page also shares information on how to “legally avoid requirements” of a Clean Air Act provision known as Limiting the Potential to Emit. The press office said the agency “is committed to following its statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act and helping our state partners do the same.”

The regulatory maneuvering is part of a broader Trump administration push under EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to cut red tape and speed up permitting.

“The global race to harness the power of artificial intelligence and build data centers is underway,” Zeldin said in a press release Thursday. “EPA is diligently working to eliminate burdensome regulations and ensure data centers and related facilities can be built in the U.S. as we Power the Great American Comeback. Developers, local communities and Tribes will now have easy access to the tools they need to build big, beautiful data centers and AI facilities.”

Zeldin’s statement and the webpage itself referenced President Donald Trump’s AI Action Plan and his January AI executive order as reasons for launching the resource, which also details how the agency has previously handled permitting and previews for data-center developers “what permitting requirements they may face.”

The energy agenda for Trump’s AI Action Plan leaned heavily on pared-down clean air and water regulations as a means to expedite permitting. The document specifically called for reduced regulations under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as well as any “related laws.”

Proponents of the plan argued that the “environmental tradeoffs” for accelerating AI and data center construction were worth it, a point that Zeldin also attempted to make in a July op-ed for Fox News. The former Republican congressman from New York wrote that many of the Clean Air Act requirements for building data centers traced back to the 1990s, “when technology was practically prehistoric compared to modern advancements.”

“These rules require companies to install pollution control equipment when they build new facilities or make a change that increases emissions significantly,” Zeldin continued. “The digital revolution has ushered in new needs and new industries which demand new permitting rules that help, not hamper development.”

The new webpage claims that by speeding up the ability to build data centers “and the necessary backup generation,” the cost of new facilities will go down along with electricity rates. “This ultimately will reduce the cost-of-living for Americans who rely on data centers and AI for their daily lives — from ensuring food at the grocery store to photos on their phones,” the website states.

Whether those assertions pan out remains to be seen, but there’s been a bubbling public rejection of the nationwide data-center buildout amid spiking energy demand and skyrocketing utility costs. On Capitol Hill, bipartisan groups of lawmakers have introduced legislation tiptoeing around the issues, including one bill on liquid cooling technologies to potentially address high facility costs and another to study the impact data centers are having on rural America.

Nevertheless, the EPA’s new website signals that the administration intends to move full steam ahead with its plans to streamline permitting and quicken data-center construction. Aaron Szabo, the EPA’s assistant administrator for air, said in the press release that the webpage demonstrates the agency’s commitment to “following the law and helping Americans do the same.”

“Good rulemaking and policies must be coupled with sound public knowledge regarding regulations,” Szabo said. “As EPA works to enact policy that helps make America the AI capital of the world, our new webpage provides an essential resource to those looking to understand the current regulations,” adding that his office “is pleased to be able to respond directly to the request from developers, local communities and Tribes who have been asking for these resources since day one.”",https://fedscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/12/GettyImages-2216114246.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:01:10.272331

The EPA published the draft formaldehyde risk assessment on December 3 and is asking for feedback on it through February 2.","WASHINGTON – The Environmental Protection Agency is again putting public health at risk: almost doubling the amount of formaldehyde, the cancer-causing chemical, it considers safe to inhale.

It’s the latest in a string of EPA actions that clash with the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, movement. Instead of pursuing MAHA’s goal of tackling health harms from toxic chemicals, the agency is opening the door to more exposure.

The EPA’s revised assessment of formaldehyde’s risks(link is external), released last week, would overturn a Biden EPA finding(link is external) that effectively states there is no safe level of exposure to the chemical. At the time, some critics said even that finding did not go far enough in acknowledging formaldehyde’s risks.

The chemical is widely used in building materials and many consumer goods, such as clothing, bedding, furniture and toys, among others. Science links the chemical to cancer, leukemia, respiratory illness, reproductive damage and other serious health harms.

Several federal agencies and international governing bodies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(link is external), the National Institutes of Health(link is external) and the World Health Organization(link is external), classify formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen.

Scientists agree carcinogens like formaldehyde pose health risks, even at very low doses.

Risking more pollution

“This new EPA action opens the door to more pollution and may fundamentally change the agency’s framework for chemical risk assessment, said David Andrews, Ph.D., the Environmental Working Group’s acting chief science officer.

“This change will enable chemical companies to profit further at the expense of public health.”

Not surprisingly, the revised risk assessment was heavily influenced by former chemical industry officials now leading the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, according to reports by the New York Times(link is external) and ProPublica(link is external).

Those officials, Nancy Beck and Lynn Dekleva, are both former senior directors at the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry’s main trade group. They played a key role in pushing the agency’s new industry-backed stance, which abandons the long-standing EPA scientific principle (link is external)that even low-level exposure to known carcinogens poses risks.

""This decision shows just how far the Trump EPA is willing to go to put industry interests above public health,” said EWG Vice President for Government Affairs Melanie Benesh.

“Doubling the so-called ‘safe’ level of formaldehyde isn’t science – it’s a gift to industry. The public deserves an EPA that protects them, not one that treats exposure of dangerous chemicals as an acceptable risk,” she added.

Undermining MAHA

This regulatory rollback is part of a broader effort by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Beck and Dekleva to weaken chemical safety standards.

That effort directly undermines the goals of the MAHA movement by exposing workers, families and communities to a well-documented carcinogen at levels the EPA’s own scientists have warned are unsafe.

It’s the latest in a string of EPA and other federal agency actions that conflict with MAHA’s goals of reducing exposure to harmful chemicals, including pesticides.

The EPA published the draft formaldehyde risk assessment on December 3 and is asking for feedback on it through February 2.

In cities, in particular, their work is vital to mitigating environmental challenges like the urban heat island effect, stormwater management and ecological restoration. As cities strive to become climate resilient, landscape architecture faculty and students at SEAS are laser-focused on finding sustainable solutions that benefit the public.

Cooling Urban Heat Islands

People don’t realize it, but on average, cities are 14 to 20 degrees hotter than rural areas. This is due in large part to the urban heat island effect caused by building materials, asphalt, dark surfaces and perhaps most notably, a lack of trees. Keenan Gibbons, a lecturer at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) and a landscape architect with SmithGroup, is using infrared drones to find hot spots in cities and cool them down, which is crucial for public health, energy conservation and sustainability.

This nationwide work, which began in 2018, started in Ann Arbor on Huron Street, where Gibbons was hired to redesign the landscape, including the planting of 130 shade trees.

“It was a pretty big transformation from that barren sidewalk,” says Gibbons. “We established a baseline temperature and have measured it in the years since, and by year five, we measured a reduction in surface temperatures by about 12 degrees.”

Gibbons, whose work is mostly based in Detroit, where he’s currently working on the Corktown Greenway, a community-centered project that will span multiple streets and integrate green spaces and bike lanes, says that reducing surface temperatures is essential as we learn to live on a warming planet.

“While some of my work is mitigating the issues working with what’s already there, adding green spaces, water, shade and brightly colored materials, the ultimate goal is to help inform better design decisions in the future,” says Gibbons.

Green Stormwater Solutions

Following her groundbreaking work in Minnesota in the mid-1990s, which included design and implementation of rainwater gardens, now commonly seen in cities throughout the U.S., SEAS Professor Joan Nassauer says that her interest in green stormwater infrastructure, a method of managing stormwater runoff using systems that mimic natural processes to absorb, filter and store water, is part of the reason she came to U-M.

“It was obvious to me that there were enormous opportunities for green stormwater infrastructure in Detroit. Even when I started working with community partners there in 1999, there were 10,000 vacant properties in the city, and it was clear they could be selectively employed as part of neighborhood green stormwater infrastructure,” says Nassauer.

With a focus on urban design that incorporates the stormwater management potentials of vacant property, Nassauer has built partnerships in Detroit that have allowed her and her students to contribute to a shift from skepticism about green infrastructure to understanding its importance for limiting downstream pollution and climate-induced localized flooding, with profound impacts on people and ecosystems.

Nassauer says that the landscape characteristics of different cities, with varying local community aesthetics, are essential to the successful implementation of green infrastructure.

“Detroit is a relatively flat landscape with clayey soils and many vacant lots and existing green spaces, so green infrastructure should be designed differently than in Seattle or Los Angeles,” says Nassauer. “For every city, local community aesthetics matter. People are more likely to want it in their own neighborhood if it looks attractive to their eye rather than neglected.”

Mapping for Ecological Restoration

Making decisions about land use, ecological restoration and climate resilience in cities means having clear and up-to-date information. This can be harder than it seems, which is why Lisa DuRussel (BS ’02, MLA ’06), SEAS associate professor of practice and engagement, and her students recently worked on affordable and accessible ways to gather the visual and spatial context needed to ensure the successful restoration and future planning for Eliza Howell Park in Detroit, a capstone project supported by the Detroit Sustainability Clinic.

“Last spring, we collaborated with Sidewalk Detroit, a nonprofit that engages with residents to improve public spaces, and the City of Detroit, to connect our ecological and design expertise with geographic information systems mapping to offer a low-cost way to map out lots and properties at the park rather than hiring a costly surveyor,” says DuRussel.

Using a drone, the project team was able to evaluate landscape-scale ecological conditions that are often difficult to assess quickly and affordably, such as canopy cover, drainage analysis, vegetation health and erosion, and provide high-resolution data to inform restoration, design and planning.

The project resulted in ecological management recommendations for the 250-acre mostly undeveloped park, and a strategy for climate-resilient and biodiverse landscapes that can be replicated across all of Detroit’s parks.

“The impact of this work can reach multiple communities throughout Detroit as the city strives for holistic management, ecological resilience and accessibility of its parks for years to come,” says DuRussel",https://seas.umich.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hero/public/2025-12/urban-heat-island%202.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 21:59:51.639468

Many climate experts believe that new technologies are needed to achieve deep electric sector decarbonization, whether carbon capture and storage, new nuclear, advanced geothermal, long-duration energy storage or other emerging sources.

In particular, CCS-equipped power plants may be an appealing decarbonization option, given their dispatchable nature, support from federal incentives like the 45Q tax credit and ability to scale. The recently announced Broadwing project in Decatur, Illinois, as well as those in Baytown, Texas, and southeastern Wyoming are among those that could usher in a wave of new CCS generation. Given projections for AI-related demand growth, this would be a welcome development.

In the absence of regulatory mandates, CCS projects will only advance if they are able to secure additional funding for their low emissions output to offset the cost of carbon capture and disposal. While federal 45Q tax credits provide significant contributions toward CCS project economics, to date this has not proven sufficient to spur widespread adoption of CCS. Clean energy buyers who are willing to pay a premium for low-carbon, firm electricity may be a key force in enabling the viability of CCS projects, but these buyers will need a way to claim the low-carbon attributes of this electric supply.

Clean energy buyers use renewable energy credits and zero-emissions credits to claim that their energy use is associated with an emissions-free resource. A similar energy attribute certificate could be issued for CCS-backed generation, although not necessarily conveying a zero-emissions attribute. EACs are commonly used in Scope 2 emissions accounting under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard.

When CCS applications at power plants intersect with greenhouse gas accounting, two fundamental questions arise: What greenhouse gas emissions reductions should be attributed to these projects, and how should these be claimed by consumers of their electricity?

Behind these questions are many more:

What components of the capture and storage process should be measured and tracked?

How should different fuels and different CO2 end uses be treated?

How should projects that achieve different levels of capture be differentiated?

What verification methods are needed to ensure a credible emissions claim?

Establishing a consistent answer to all these questions, and more, will help ensure there is a uniform attribute for CCS generation and promote market confidence on the integrity of emissions claims. NorthBridge Group conducted broad outreach to climate-focused nongovernmental organizations, attribute registries, clean energy buyers, CCS project developers and other emissions accounting experts. We used that input in developing a standards document that proposes how registries can issue, track and retire energy attribute certificates for electricity generated with CCS. In it, we define a methodology for calculating emissions from CCS-backed electricity generators, set requirements for data reporting and verification, and propose required and recommended features. Energy tracking registries that currently issue and track RECs or other EACs can use this document for guidance.

Several key issues we address include:

Attribute structure. An EAC is issued for each megawatt-hour of generation. The EAC is minted with an associated emission rate measured in pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per MWh. When retired, the attribute holder may claim the pounds of CO2e listed on the attribute in its market-based Scope 2 inventory. The emission rate will reflect the performance of the project during the period the EAC covers.

Eligibility. The calculation methodology applies to multiple fuel types, generation technologies and post-capture CO2 pathways. Registries may elect to issue EACs only to certain fuel types or post-capture pathways. To aid buyers, the EAC may designate the fuel source and CO2 pathway.

Processes considered. The emission rate calculation methodology includes emissions from electricity generation, CO2 capture, transportation and storage so that the EAC represents emissions from all activities required to ensure permanent CO2 storage. Emissions from on-site activities as well as purchased energy are included. Though the standard acknowledges the potential for the EAC to reflect the carbon intensity of the upstream fuel supply, it does not propose how to do so or recommend doing so at this time.

Monitoring and verification. All project data is subject to independent third-party verification. There is a requirement to submit monitoring and reporting plans, which can be met through other regulatory documentation.

Leakage. To protect an attribute holder’s emissions claims against the potential impact of post-injection leakage, all projects will be required to hold some form of self-insurance. The standard recommends a menu of options that registries may offer and from which projects can choose, such as private insurance, credit reserves or holdbacks, and issuing EACs with built-in leakage estimates.

We acknowledge that the work is not done. An EAC that bears an emission rate may represent a new frontier for many energy-tracking registries that will undoubtedly take work and time to implement. More revisions may be necessary, especially if technical working groups in the GHG Protocol standards update process offer new guidance. And some questions, such as how or if upstream fuel considerations should be folded into the attribute, are acknowledged but not answered.

Nonetheless, a standardized attribute for CCS-equipped electricity generation will allow clean energy buyers to engage with new forms of low-carbon, dispatchable electricity, and developers can monetize these attributes in support of project economics. We are hopeful that this work can meaningfully advance the viability of projects that contribute to the deep decarbonization of an electric grid.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xeDhr5lxGJaRE_xF6sx3i2U0nYJYU-Gkg4NYmKBzogk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTc2MTM5NzlfaUdWNURJdC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-12 20:00:07.694538

While the year is rapidly coming to a close, my Senate Democratic colleagues and I are using every moment we have to deliver solutions to the issues facing our state. From passing legislation on budget transparency and permanently expanding the bipartisan Michigan Reconnect program to holding committee hearings on human trafficking and suicide prevention, we’re laser-focused on getting things done for the people of Michigan.

In the past week, we’ve sent several letters advocating for Michiganders facing deportation and expressing concern about inhumane conditions in ICE facilities across the nation.

Read on to learn more about those actions, the progress we’ve achieved in 2025, and our continued efforts to keep moving Michigan forward in the new year. Also, we hope you can join us tomorrow at my coffee hour in Detroit!

No-Fee PPO Service Bills Pass Senate Unanimously

This week, I was pleased that Senate Bills 611 and 612 passed the Senate unanimously. Sponsored by myself and Senator Ruth Johnson, these bills will make a big difference for victims of stalking and domestic violence who are seeking a Personal Protection Order. These bills now await hearings and a vote in the House. If enacted, Michigan would join 43 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories that already require PPO services to be provided free of charge.

Currently, the cost to serve a PPO can include a service fee plus mileage traveled, which can easily cost almost $100 — an amount that could be especially tough for someone fleeing domestic violence to afford. This legislation would not only make it less financially burdensome for victims but also safer by ensuring the PPO is served by a member of law enforcement rather than a friend or family member of the victim, which is allowed under current law. When someone has gathered the courage to share what has happened to them and secure a PPO, our state should not put up financial barriers to their safety.

Senate Acts to Deliver Relief for Michiganders Facing UIA Benefit Recovery

During the chaos of the pandemic, thousands of Michiganders turned to their government for help, tapping into the unemployment system to put food on the table, pay their bills, and ensure their families could weather a once-in-a-lifetime global health crisis. Since then, the Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) has been attempting to claw back overpayments it mistakenly made to these same individuals — causing stress for many across the state at an already financially tough time.

Let’s be clear: these families did nothing wrong. That’s why, earlier this week, alongside every single Senator, both Democratic and Republican, I voted to pass legislation that would provide a clean slate for these folks by waiving any overpayments the UIA is currently attempting to collect from this pandemic-era timeframe. Senate Bill 700 now heads to the Michigan House, where I’m hopeful they will act quickly, so we can deliver relief to those who need it most.

Expanding Opportunity, Lowering Costs, & Protecting Michigan: Senate Democrats Reflect on Progress From 2025

As we approach the end of 2025 and wrap up our legislative work for the year, I’d like to take a moment to reflect on the progress we’ve delivered for the people of Michigan. Together, my Senate Democratic colleagues and I:

Saved Medicaid in Michigan, protecting access to accessible, affordable health care;

Expanded the widely successful Rx Kids program to improve maternal and infant health outcomes;

Delivered another bipartisan budget that continues the universal free school meals program, implements a long-term road solution, and lowers costs for seniors and families;

Advanced commonsense gun safety policies to keep our communities safe;

Fought back against federal chaos and safeguarded our state from the worst effects of Trump’s disastrous budget plan;

Strengthened protections and benefits for Michigan veterans and their families;

Championed legislation to improve government accountability, tackle racial and ethnic maternal health disparities, lower prescription drug costs, expand transparency in the state budget process, and so much more.

I’m proud of the work we’ve accomplished this year, despite the many obstacles and unprecedented setbacks we faced at both the state and federal levels of government. While we’ll be working in Lansing until the end of the month, I’m already planning ahead for 2026 and looking forward to another productive year advocating for our communities and our state. I also encourage you to stay informed about the legislation moving through the Senate in the coming weeks. Feel free to track the legislation we’re working on here.

Fighting Food Insecurity This Holiday Season and Beyond

Everyone deserves access to quality, nutritious food, full stop — but this year, the demand for food assistance is higher than ever as grocery costs soar and federal Republicans have disrupted Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and restricted eligibility. Approximately 1.5 million Michiganders face food insecurity, including over 402,000 children.

My Senate Democratic colleagues and I have worked hard to ensure that every Michigan family has access to food not only during the holidays, but year-round. From proposing $71 million in relief funding to support food banks and continue SNAP benefits during the federal shutdown to delivering another year of free school meals for every Michigan student, we’ve made significant progress in combating food insecurity here in our state. Learn more about our efforts to tackle food insecurity here, and explore food assistance resources below.

I joined residents and lawmakers at a press conference hosted by the Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments on December 1 to advocate for the shutdown of US Ecology Detroit South due to environmental harm and harm to residents. Neighbors discussed the negative impact the facility has on their bodies and home lives, citing a constant smell and taste of chemicals. The lawmakers who spoke at the press conference included Rep. Tonya Myers Phillips (D-7) and Rep. Donavan McKinny (D-11), both of whom emphasized the right to breathe clean air and quality of life. Rev. Sharon Buttry, community leader of the DHCAHE, called on the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (BSEED) to shut down the hazardous waste treatment plant and not renew its permit. Earlier this year, I submitted public comment to EGLE expressing my strong concern about the facility’s proposed renewal permit and the related odor and air quality violations.

Standing up for Communities

This week, I, along with several other Michigan elected officials, sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) urging the immediate release of Ernesto Cuevas Enciso on bond pending his upcoming immigration hearing. Ernesto is the husband of a United States citizen and the father of a one-year-old child. He is a former DACA recipient with legal work authorization and a pending application for legal permanent residency. We are advocating for his release home to his family, not held at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin. Here is a link to the letter.

We also joined a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field directors in Michigan and Texas, urging them to release four Western International High School students and their families: Kerly Mariangel Sosa Rivero and her father, Gleiner Jose Sosa Mujica; Antony Janier Peña Sosa and his mother, Maryeli Antonieta Sosa Marquina; Mor Ba; and Santiago Jesus Zamora Perez and his mother, Evelin Josefina Perez. These young people and their parents arrived in the United States from Venezuela or Senegal, and all have pending asylum cases. The students are all following the immigration process and are not considered a risk to public safety. Here is a link to the letter.

In a letter sent last week, several Michigan legislators and I called on ICE to address the concerning living conditions for people held in custody in its facilities. We would like to ensure that Alee Vang and others receive the proper required medication and are asking ICE to reduce overcrowding, implement emergency improvements to sanitation and nutrition, ensure adequate on-site medical staffing, and increase oversight and transparency.

Filing smart lawsuits remains the first and best way to counter assaults on the environment and preserve essential protections.

A deliberate barrage of federal attacks requires us to be equally relentless in our response. We are growing our bench of expert litigators, policy experts, and communicators so that we can challenge our opponents in Washington at every turn. The fights ahead are not new, but their volume and intensity are unprecedented. Taking the government to court — along with their allies in polluting industries — has never been more important or more labor-intensive.

Shape the Law

If left unchecked, this Supreme Court could eviscerate the authority of any future president or Congress to address environmental crises.

It took polluters and their allies 40 years to elect politicians and seat judges friendly to their interests. Now, they are pursuing the most aggressive agenda in modern history to dismantle environmental laws and regulations.

In the face of disruptive Supreme Court rulings, such as the Sackett v. EPA decision gutting federal protections for clean water and wetlands, Earthjustice is investing heavily in our Strategic Legal Advocacy team to navigate the changing legal landscape and secure wins in other legal venues, such as lower and state courts.

Force Progress

We know that defense will not be enough.

States and cities have the ability to advance environmental progress on their own, and when they do, they can raise the bar for everyone. We are growing our work with clients and partners to create legal and political pressure to keep moving forward, accelerating clean energy, climate resilience, and toxics regulation at the state and local level.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/stu-gillespie_spenser-heaps.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:02:56.782263

“New York is leading the clean energy revolution, and NYPA is powering that progress with bold investments in workforce development,” Hochul said.
Since 2024, NYPA has obligated more than $41 million for clean energy training programs, supporting more than 1,700 trainees and more than 30 workforce training organizations statewide.
NYPA’s collaboration with the skills-training organizations include input on the classroom and hands-on technology experiences of the enrollees for promoting the requisite clean energy skills to ensure statewide reach of the awards.
In September, Governor Hochul announced the convening of an advanced nuclear energy workforce roundtable in New York City.","New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently announced $40 million in new annual workforce development funding over the next four years from the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop the workforce needed to support advanced nuclear energy in Upstate New York.

The funding, approved today by the NYPA Board of Trustees, will directly support the Governor’s call in June for the Power Authority to develop at least one gigawatt of advanced nuclear power in Upstate New York.

The Power Authority board also awarded a total of $4 million to universities and organizations to develop and expand programs that prepare New Yorkers for high-demand careers in artificial intelligence, electromechanical trades, and advanced power systems to meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

“New York is leading the clean energy revolution, and NYPA is powering that progress with bold investments in workforce development,” Hochul said. “By investing in the advanced nuclear workforce and expanding access to affordable, hands-on training in AI and advanced energy systems, we’re preparing New Yorkers for the high-quality, high-demand jobs of tomorrow — and ensuring every community can share in the benefits of a cleaner, more equitable energy future.”

Beginning next year, NYPA will partner with qualified workforce development providers, including technical high schools, community colleges, universities, labor unions, and others to utilize the $40 million over a four-year period to develop nuclear energy technical training, retraining, coursework and apprenticeship programs to prepare workers for employment in the advanced nuclear energy field.

NYPA President and CEO Justin Driscoll said, “New York’s clean-energy transition only works if it comes with real career opportunities for the people who live in our communities. Building on the success of our annual investment of up to $25 million for clean energy training to support the renewable energy sector, the Power Authority will add up to $40 million over four years to develop and retrain the workforce necessary to support advanced nuclear power, providing more opportunities for New Yorkers to pursue careers in this high-demand industry.”

The Power Authority’s approval of $4 million for clean energy workforce training stems from a commitment of up to $25 million annually, as outlined in the 2023-24 Enacted State Budget.

The budget legislation also directed NYPA to advance renewable energy projects that will strengthen New York’s electric grid with a portfolio of diversified energy resources. Since 2024, NYPA has obligated more than $41 million for clean energy training programs, supporting more than 1,700 trainees and more than 30 workforce training organizations statewide.

The NYPA Board of Trustees approved the awards to the following organizations and institutions:

The Healthy Home Academy – Brewster, NY - $911,000

Resources will be directed to support classroom and hands-on learning experiences in home performance, high efficiency heating, ventilation, air conditioning and heat pumps.

The State University of New York at Buffalo - $832,000

The funding will be used to establish an AI fellowship program with the New York Power Authority and UB’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (IAD) to build a workforce pipeline and allow students to work alongside NYPA experts to address key challenges for the state in the clean energy industry.

The Green Launchpad – Statewide - $734,000

The funding award will expand a comprehensive program that includes clean energy building fundamentals, hands-on labs, advanced technical training, and career services.

Genesee Valley BOCES – Mount Morris, NY - $677,000

The funding will create an electro-mechanical trades program at the Charles G. May Center and to expand an existing program at its Batavia campus.

The State University of New York at Stony Brook – $644,000

The award will be leveraged to launch the University’s inaugural Power Pathways Workforce Readiness program, which will train students in both trade-based and advanced technology disciplines. The program will provide certification and training in areas including solar, drone inspections, geothermal heat pumps, and HVDC power systems.

The State University of New York at Binghamton – $203,000

The funds will be used to support the development and instruction of two new courses- Systems Dynamics and Simulation and Fundamentals of Power Systems as well as expand experiential learning opportunities and paid industry internships.

NYPA Chairman and Western New York Resident John R. Koelmel said, “Building on NYPA’s long history of strengthening the Western New York workforce and advancing statewide training programs, the Board's action today will prepare New Yorkers to thrive in the clean energy economy. The new AI fellowship pairs University at Buffalo students with NYPA's technical experts to advance clean energy solutions while equipping students to succeed in the classroom, on the job, and throughout their careers.”

The NYPA clean energy workforce development funding awards largely support the efforts of the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) to connect workers to job opportunities in the clean energy economy. Many of the upskilling and training initiatives have a focus on serving those who are traditionally underrepresented, especially within disadvantaged communities. This fall, Hochul announced the NYPA Board of Trustees’ approval of $12 million for electric vehicle training programs and support for trainees’ childcare, transportation, student fees and books through the NYSDOL Support Services Fund.

NYPA actively engages with each community training organization to ensure skills training is matched with needed positions and participant success through supportive wraparound services. NYPA’s collaboration with the skills-training organizations include input on the classroom and hands-on technology experiences of the enrollees for promoting the requisite clean energy skills to ensure statewide reach of the awards.

In September, Governor Hochul announced the convening of an advanced nuclear energy workforce roundtable in New York City.

But a few thousand feet underground is a hidden source of abundant clean energy — and it was discovered in an unusual way.

Utah-headquartered startup Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals announced last week it had used artificial intelligence to locate a 250-degree Fahrenheit geothermal reservoir under this stretch of land. They named it “Big Blind,” because this kind of site — which has no visual indication of its existence, no hot springs or geysers above ground, and no history of geothermal exploration — is known as a “blind” system.

It’s the first industry-discovered blind site in more than three decades, said Carl Hoiland, co-founder and CEO of Zanskar. “The idea that geothermal is tapped out has been the narrative for decades,” but that’s far from the case, he told CNN. He believes there are many more hidden sites across the Western US.

Geothermal energy is a potential gamechanger. It offers the tantalizing prospect of a huge source of clean energy to meet burgeoning demand. It’s near limitless, produces scarcely any climate pollution, and is constantly available, unlike wind and solar, which are cheap but rely on the sun shining and the wind blowing.

The problem, however, has been how to find and scale it.

It requires a specific geology: underground reservoirs of hot water or steam, along with porous rocks that allow the water to move through them, heat up, and be brought to the surface where it can power turbines.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were high levels of excitement around geothermal, with oil and gas giants spending huge amounts drilling to find hidden systems, Hoiland said. By the mid-80s, however, many had started to give up, put off by high costs and low success rates.

It’s a “classic needle in the haystack problem,” said Joel Edwards, co-founder and CTO of Zanskar. “There’s no one type of data that tells you that a system is below you, even if you’re right on top of it.” Instead, there are multiple indicators which are really hard for humans to put together to figure out if a system exists.

That’s where AI comes in.

The AI models Zanskar uses are fed information on where blind systems already exist. This data is plentiful as, over the last century and more, humans have accidentally stumbled on many around the world while drilling for other resources such as oil and gas.

The models then scour huge amounts of data — everything from rock composition to magnetic fields — to find patterns that point to the existence of geothermal reserves. AI models have “gotten really good over the last 10 years at being able to pull those types of signals out of noise,” Hoiland said.

Once a potential location has been found, the next step for the company is to drill down to confirm the reserve exists and is hot enough to produce utility-scale power.

That’s exactly what they did at Big Blind over the summer, drilling wells to depths of around 2,700 feet where they found porous rock at 250 degrees Fahrenheit. They know the site is at least the minimum size needed to support a power plant, but don’t yet have a sense of how big it could be.

There is also work to be done to navigate permitting processes and grid interconnection, but the company estimates the first electricity could be produced here in three to five years’ time.

Zanskar’s discovery “is very significant,” said James Faulds, a professor of geosciences at Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology. (Faulds does not work with the company, but two of his former graduate students do.)

Estimates suggest over three-quarters of US geothermal resources are blind, Faulds told CNN. “Refining methods to find such systems has the potential to unleash many tens and perhaps hundreds of gigawatts in the western US alone,” he said.

An oft-cited government analysis from 2008 estimated undiscovered geothermal reserves in the US could provide around 30 gigawatts of power, enough to power around 25 million homes. Hoiland thinks the real figure could be at least 10 times higher.

Over the last three years of scouring the Western US, Zanskar has identified many “hotspots” with the same characteristics as Big Blind, Hoiland said.

Big Blind is the company’s first blind site discovery, but it’s the third site it has drilled and hit commercial resources. “We expect dozens, to eventually hundreds, of new sites to be coming to market,” Hoiland said.

If Zanskar can keep its costs down, “that will go a long way in attracting investment,” said Sophia Bauer, geothermal project manager at Global Energy Monitor, a non-profit. Geothermal has a big advantage because it can harness drilling techniques already fine-tuned by the oil and gas industry, she told CNN.

Another advantage is political. “In the United States right now, the atmosphere is quite friendly to geothermal,” Bauer said. While the Trump administration has taken an ax to solar and wind, geothermal has gone under the radar and is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, according to a March report from Global Energy Monitor, authored by Bauer.

There’s plenty of scope to grow. The US leads the world in geothermal energy, accounting for about 24% of global installed capacity, but geothermal accounts for only 0.4% of the country’s electricity mix.

Some experts hope geothermal will help fulfill the soaring electricity demand from data centers, many of which are used for AI. “Perhaps we have a close future of AI powered by geothermal discovering more geothermal!” Bauer said.

Zanskar’s discovery is the latest development in what some are calling a geothermal renaissance. Much of the recent buzz has been around next-gen geothermal techniques, which use advanced tools of the oil and gas industry — including fracking — to drill very deep wells and artificially create the conditions needed to harness geothermal energy.

But Hoiland says Zanskar’s work shows conventional geothermal still has huge untapped potential.

Joseph Moore, a University of Utah geologist, said AI could be a “gamechanger” for the industry, provided its success at finding hidden geothermal systems can be replicated multiple times.

“It’s the latest advancement for this benign, renewable energy source,” he told CNN. “Frankly, it’s all very exciting to see.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/pmc-5520.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-12 18:01:37.903363

When paired with anaerobic or catalytic methanation systems, this syngas can be upgraded to pipeline-quality RNG.
Alexander Skorokhodov, director of technology at CETY, stated, “Anaerobic digestion is a proven pathway for renewable gas, but digestibility limits and digestate handling costs restrict its full potential.” HTAP unlocks the remaining energy in hard-to-digest biomass and converts digestate into clean energy and biochar.","Clean Energy Technologies Inc. (CETY), a clean energy technology company delivering scalable solutions in power generation, storage, waste-to-energy, and heat-to-power, on Dec. 10 announced a dedicated HTAP based platform designed for integration with existing and planned anaerobic digestion (AD) and renewable natural gas (RNG) facilities. The solution enables AD operators to convert hard-to-digest biomass and AD digestate into additional renewable energy and carbon-rich biochar, improving the overall efficiency and economics of RNG production.

Many AD plants face biogas-output limitations due to the low biodegradability of certain organic feedstocks. CETY’s High Temperature Ablative Pyrolysis (HTAP) technology thermochemically converts forestry residues, agricultural waste, and other non-food biomass inputs into clean syngas. When paired with anaerobic or catalytic methanation systems, this syngas can be upgraded to pipeline-quality RNG.

A single HTAP unit producing 1,500 Nm³/hour of syngas can support production equivalent to approximately 13 MMBtu/hour of additional RNG, placing one HTAP system between a medium- and large-scale AD facility in terms of incremental RNG output.

The platform also addresses a growing industry challenge: digestate management. Digestate can contain more than 55% of unprocessed volatile solids, requiring long composting periods and incurring handling costs. HTAP thermochemically converts digestate into syngas—supporting up to 1.3–1.6 MW of onsite power or up to 8 MMBtu/hour of supplementary RNG—and into biochar that can be tested and certified for agricultural or industrial applications. Biochar can offer carbon stability, pathogen elimination, improved soil conditioning characteristics, and eligibility for carbon sequestration credits, subject to certification.

Alexander Skorokhodov, director of technology at CETY, stated, “Anaerobic digestion is a proven pathway for renewable gas, but digestibility limits and digestate handling costs restrict its full potential.” HTAP unlocks the remaining energy in hard-to-digest biomass and converts digestate into clean energy and biochar. This enables AD operators to potentially expand RNG output while improving environmental and economic performance.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CETY_Dec25_75dc8648e2.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:00:51.857717

Iron–sodium batteries, a high-temperature sodium metal chloride chemistry that incorporates iron to reduce cost and reliance on constrained metals, are among the most promising contenders. The question isn’t whether they will replace lithium-ion in every market, but where they can take the lead.

Market momentum for non‑lithium chemistries

Lithium-ion remains the workhorse for electric vehicles (EVs), portable devices, and short- to medium-duration grid applications thanks to its energy density, fast response, and mature manufacturing. Yet the industry’s rapid growth and the need to diversify supply chains have increased interest in chemistries based on abundant elements such as sodium and iron. These systems avoid flammable liquid electrolytes, offer robust safety characteristics, and aim to deliver utility‑scale capacity without the cost volatility tied to lithium, nickel, and cobalt. As market volumes rise, portfolio thinking—matching technology to task—becomes a commercial imperative, not just a technical preference.

Bridging the long-duration gap

Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is where iron–sodium can credibly shift the balance. The U.S. Department of Energy projects the future U.S. grid will need more than 225 gigawatts of LDES by 2050. Lithium-ion batteries perform well for one to four hours, often up to six, but their economic viability and temperature control become more difficult as the duration extends to eight, twelve, or twenty-four hours.

Iron–sodium batteries are engineered for multi-hour to multi-day output, leveraging a solid electrolyte and elevated operating temperatures to deliver steady performance with strong safety margins. They’re designed to firm variable renewables, improve resilience during extreme weather, and help defer costly transmission and distribution upgrades—exactly the roles LDES must play to make a clean grid reliable and affordable.

Utility‑observed progress: Inlyte’s Milestone

The transition from lab promise to grid reality depends on utility-grade validation, and Inlyte Energy’s recent advance is a clear example. The company completed a factory acceptance test of its first field-ready iron–sodium battery system at its facility near Derby, UK, witnessed by representatives from Southern Company, one of the largest U.S. energy providers.

According to the company, the integrated systems (cells, inverter, and controls) achieved 83% round-trip efficiency, including auxiliaries, competitive with high-performance lithium-ion and notably above the 40–70% typical for other LDES approaches. Inlyte claims that the tested system represents the world's largest sodium metal chloride battery cells and modules ever constructed, capable of storing over 300 kilowatt-hours of energy each.

Inlyte’s CEO, Antonio Baclig, states: “To win the future, we need abundant and secure supplies of energy in the U.S., and at the same time, we need to make costs go down, not up. We can’t do that by building the same thing as China. We need to make better technologies, with batteries that are fundamentally lower cost, safer, and longer lasting. By leveraging a breakthrough in the use of iron in the proven sodium metal chloride battery, Inlyte can scale rapidly.”

Iron–sodium isn’t a universal replacement for lithium-ion. Instead, it can improve grid performance by allowing lithium-ion to lead in mobility and short peaks, while iron–sodium covers longer durations.

Clients come to him with their problems: a high electric bill, cold floors, a broken water heater. Then, he walks around their homes looking for clues that may not be apparent to the naked eye, like an incandescent lightbulb or a gap in the insulation. To crack a case, he has to figure out where energy is escaping.

“You try to make recommendations based on what they want to do,” Richter said. “And we might discover things that they didn't know they could do, which is the fun part.”

Richter volunteers as a coach with the Monadnock Sustainability Hub, helping people figure out how to save money and cut fossil fuel emissions with home upgrades.

With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest federal climate policy in American history, suddenly there was a lot more money behind those recommendations. Households could use thousands of dollars in expanded tax credits to pay for things like solar panels and heat pumps.

Those tax credits were supposed to last for seven more years. Now, they’re going away at the end of this month, as a result of provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law over the summer.

In response, the Monadnock Sustainability Hub hatched a new plan. If the group was going to meet its goal — to transition their 800-square-mile corner of New Hampshire off fossil fuels — it needed to raise money to help people get electric appliances and switch to renewable energy. The hub started a program called Electrify Monadnock.

“We want to keep the momentum going. People have this bottled up interest in doing all this stuff. They just need to fund it and finance it,” Richter said.

Rachel Ranelli, the hub’s sole employee and a recent college graduate, is the main person responsible for creating this DIY local version of federal climate policy. Since incentives were rolled back, she says there has been less interest in the coaching program.

“We can't rely on the federal government to be making progress towards that goal of reducing our emissions, so we really look at, how can we make change on a local level,” she said.

Scaling down to meet climate goals

The hub has raised more than $350,000 dollars from private donors to create a program that could replace the federal tax credits people had been expecting.

Ranelli has been working on a structure for the program, including how to divvy up the funds, how to process applications, and how to funnel the benefits towards low-income residents. Households will be able to get up to $7,000 in rebates for all kinds of home projects, such as installing solar panels or switching to heat pumps.

Raising money from local donors to address climate change house-by-house might seem like the opposite of efficiency. But Ranelli says even though the hub cannot offer as much money as the federal government did, she’s hoping the fund will make a difference.

“That's, you know, 40 or 50 more houses who are not burning fossil fuels,” she said.

Dori Drachman, the chair of the hub’s board, says one reason she thinks a fund like this will work is because she saw how federal incentives encouraged people to make climate-friendly home upgrades.

The efforts of small communities add up, Drachman says, and can serve as models for other parts of the country.

“We don't have time to wait. We really don't. We have to do something now, which is why we're doing this fund,” she said. “The climate is changing.”

About 30% of the nation’s total greenhouse gas emissions come from heating, cooling, cooking, and keeping the lights on in homes and businesses. Another roughly 30% comes from transportation, including gas-powered cars.

There are some other incentives for homeowners to cut their emissions that aren’t disappearing, like the federally funded rebate programs New Hampshire state officials are still working to stand up. New Hampshire Saves, a program run by the state’s utility companies, also offers incentives for energy-saving upgrades.

But the Trump administration is turning support away from renewable energy and other programs aimed at cutting emissions, in favor of supporting fossil fuel resources like gas, coal, and oil.

“Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth, and the fiscal health of the Nation,” the administration said in a July executive order.

Research shows transitioning to energy efficient electric systems can both cut costs for households and reduce the emissions driving human-caused climate change. According to the International Monetary Fund, subsidies for fossil fuels can have harmful effects on economic growth by inefficiently allocating resources and encouraging pollution.

'A toasty treat'

For Janet Altobello, a client of the hub’s coaching program, having financial and logistical assistance helped her kick-start a transition off fossil fuels she’d been thinking about for a long time.

“We were really excited about the Inflation Reduction Act, of course, and then kind of had to rush to take advantage of the incentives there,” she said. “We have really modest incomes, and we just really have to look at the cash incentives for all these different programs and kind of pace it out gradually.”

Altobello has been working to keep the heat in since the 1970s, when insulation meant wrapping the foundation of a house in black tar paper and piling evergreens on top to keep the wind out. Now, her home exemplifies the many electrification upgrades a house can get.

She added insulation, upgraded the electric panel, and replaced her gas stove with an induction range, which only works with magnetic pots and pans.

“I had this name tag with a magnet on it. And so, I would go to rummage sales and just test pots to see if they were magnetic on the bottom. So, I got some great pots for like $2 each,” she said.

She bought a plug-in hybrid car, and Frank Richter helped her figure out how to charge it — even taking her on a field trip to a public charging station. And she installed heat pumps.

“That is a toasty treat. It's like about a seven minute experience of warming it up and then feeling like, ‘Oh, this is really a luxury,’” she said.

Now, she’s become the go-to person for many of her neighbors who are looking to make changes to their own homes.

Altobello says the whole process of slowly transitioning her home has been relatively painless, but it has been a stretch. She took out a six-year, zero percent interest loan from New Hampshire Saves for part of the work.

“I just feel lucky to be able to do it. I feel like, wow, I have help. I can do this,” she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b086a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+545/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F7a%2F0c25b6e2444ea59780f77ea0b450%2Fimg-7540.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:13.379164

And 31 states cut staff totals at their environmental agencies, collectively eliminating 3,725 roles in that same period.
“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” she said.
Meanwhile, both houses of Congress are recommending much less severe EPA cuts.
“This report is a warning,” said Jennifer Walling, chief executive officer for the Illinois Environmental Council.","Massive cuts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have hampered state-level regulators’ ability to rein in pollution, according to a new report. And now, with the Trump administration pushing for even deeper cuts at the agency in 2026, many states across the country may be in a dire position.

“If EPA’s capacity to do its job is further diminished, how prepared are our states to shoulder more responsibility for protecting us from these threats? Unfortunately, not well,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP), the nonprofit behind the report, said in a Wednesday press conference on the findings.

The report found that 27 state governments have cut environmental agency funding over the past 15 years, including seven states — Texas, Wyoming, Iowa, Alabama, Connecticut, South Dakota, and Mississippi — that have cut budgets by a third or more. And 31 states cut staff totals at their environmental agencies, collectively eliminating 3,725 roles in that same period.

That leaves them vulnerable to Trump administration changes at the EPA, which has already seen its budget cut 40 percent between 2010 and 2025. In 2025 alone, EPA staffers have left in droves, thanks to mass firings, layoffs, and resignations — as much as 33 percent of its total staff, according to some estimates. Meanwhile, the White House has proposed cutting the agency’s budget by 55 percent in 2026 to $4.2 billion, its lowest level of funding in four decades.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has suggested that states will be able to pick up the slack, describing a vision for the agency that involves giving “power back to states to make their own decisions.” In a March press conference announcing a major deregulation initiative — what he called “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen” — Zeldin fundamentally recast EPA’s mission, outlining a new mandate to “unleash American energy” and “revitalize the American auto industry.”

Protecting Americans from the impacts of industry pollution, he suggested, would instead fall to state agencies, which are “best positioned to work with unique communities and implement laws.”

“In too many instances and across too many administrations, EPA has retained control of implementing many laws from its perch in the nation’s capital,” he said, in an address to the Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit organization representing environmental agency leaders, later that month. “It’s this kind of common sense reform I want to partner with states to achieve.”

In its report, EIP argues that this stance ignores EPA’s statutorily defined mission to protect the health and well-being of Americans, while downplaying the crucial role it plays in outlining national standards and coordinating efforts related to complex, multi-state problems. Even more significantly, though, according to the report, many states are simply not equipped to address their challenges without a strong federal partner.

“This kind of handoff — from federal to state — can only work if the teammate receiving the baton has not been hobbled, as many state environmental agencies have been, by budget cuts,” the report’s authors write.

Twenty three states have in fact worked to increase environmental funding since 2010 — with California (364 percent increase), Colorado (111 percent increase), and Vermont (109 percent increase) leading the way. Which means future cuts to the EPA would likely have a disproportionate impact on states like Mississippi and South Dakota, which have cut agency funding by 71 percent and 61 percent, respectively.

In the Wednesday press conference convened by EIP, environmental advocates painted a broad picture of state-level regulatory dysfunction that would only be made worse by further federal cuts.

The proposed cuts are “a recipe for disaster in states like ours, where the state agency is already stretched thin,” Drew Ball, southeast campaigns director for the National Resources Defense Council of North Carolina, where environmental agency funding had already declined 32 percent since 2010, said at EIP’s news conference.

“It’s like dismantling the fire department while the house is already burning.”

States depend on a variety of EPA grants to help fund their compliance efforts, ensuring that standards under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other laws are met. The Trump administration has proposed cutting EPA “categorical grants” by approximately $1 billion, eliminating nearly all federal funding for a range of issues, from air quality management and pollution control to brownfield management and lead abatement.

That recommendation would “devastate economic development, critical infrastructure, and environmental protections across the nation,” representatives from the Environmental Council of the States wrote in an open letter to Zeldin in May.

In the Wednesday press conference, Kathryn Guerra of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, said her state of Texas already suffers from widespread regulatory noncompliance. According to its own enforcement reports, she said, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) never investigates many of the environmental complaints it receives, while its backlog of unresolved enforcement cases has grown to over 1,400.

“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” she said.

Meanwhile, both houses of Congress are recommending much less severe EPA cuts. The House Appropriations Committee has recommended cutting the agency’s budget by 23 percent in 2026, while its counterpart in the Senate has voted for just a 5 percent reduction. But the advocates convened by EIP argued that current levels of funding are already critically low.

“This report is a warning,” said Jennifer Walling, chief executive officer for the Illinois Environmental Council. “If both lines of defense, our state agencies and the U.S. EPA are weakened at the same time, pollution enforcement will falter, emergencies will happen, and public health will suffer. We cannot pretend that states are prepared to shoulder this burden alone.”",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2.-CorpusChristie-1024x655-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:06.367569

As of Dec. 1, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. has secured company commitments to add 10,600 new jobs, leaders said.

Those roles are expected to pay an average of $40.59 hourly, up from last year’s $36.09. Incentive spending per job, meanwhile, dropped to $15,485 from the $46,850 expended last year, according to the IEDC.

“Our strategic focus on increasing wages and jobs in Indiana is working,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a news release. “By supporting Indiana companies and the Main Street economy, we’re helping businesses to grow, encouraging more high-wage career opportunities, and creating the next generation of entrepreneurs. All in all, these results will deliver a more robust economy.”

Braun leads the quasi-public agency’s board of directors, which convened Thursday afternoon for its first meeting since releasing the results of a forensic analysis into the activities of IEDC and several partners.

It was also new Chief Administration Officer Alison Grand’s first meeting. She’ll have general counsel duties and serve as one of IEDC’s two ethics officers.

Her role is among changes prompted by the findings, which included lackluster oversight and questionable spending.

IEDC’s nonprofit arm, which previously funneled largely anonymous donations into economic development travel, hasn’t accepted contributions in months. The $1.9 million left in the account will be used to support the agency’s initiatives, said David Fagan, the board’s audit and finance committee chair.

The board has also revamped its conflict of interest policies — with screened members exiting the room for certain projects — and investment policies. Only the full board makes binding votes now, with committees offering recommendations.

“The foundation is firmly in place; 2026 is all going to be about execution,” Commerce Secretary and CEO David Adams said.

That includes a renewed focus on regional economic development.

IEDC has contracted McKinsey & Company to create the guidelines for regional strategic plans. That’s expected to be done this year, Adams said.

The 15 regions will create and submit their plans in the first quarter of next year, and then execute them with state support, according to a slide deck for the meeting.

The agenda also included the approval of changes to investment policies and loans with the Indiana Angel Network Fund. It’s part of Elevate Ventures, one of the “entities of interest” examined in the forensic analysis.

One loan amendment lets IEDC convert the remaining outstanding balance into ownership of the Indiana Angel Network Fund since the loan’s maturity date has passed. The board also approved a new, $5 million loan for the group.

Consumers Energy argues that large customers will actually help reduce costs for everyone by spreading the utility's fixed expenses across more users.","LANSING, Mich. — A dispute is brewing over how much protection Michigan residents need as the state attracts large data centers and other energy-intensive businesses.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a petition Monday asking state regulators to reconsider rules they approved last month for serving data centers. She argues the terms are too weak and could stick ordinary customers with the bill if these massive energy users don't cover their costs.

Consumers Energy responded Thursday, calling Nessel's challenge baseless and accusing her of opposing economic growth that would bring jobs and tax revenue to Michigan.

The clash stems from a November order from the Michigan Public Service Commission that set guidelines for businesses using at least 100 megawatts of electricity, roughly enough to power 80,000 homes. Currently, Consumers Energy only serves one customer of that magnitude. However, with a boom in data centers across the country as artificial intelligence (AI) grows, many officials are hoping to bring them here.

What Nessel Wants Changed

Nessel is asking regulators to require stricter terms for the businesses:

Longer contracts: 20 years instead of 15 years

Higher guaranteed payments: 90% minimum billing instead of 80%

Lower size threshold: 50 megawatts instead of 100 megawatts

Public review process: Contested hearings instead of private applications

In her 17-page petition, Nessel argues the commission ignored her cost analysis showing that under current terms, a 100-megawatt customer could leave other ratepayers with an $80 million shortfall.

""The Commission's Order presents arbitrary and capricious analysis,"" Nessel wrote, adding that the approved terms set ""unnecessarily less-protective"" standards that other utilities are already copying.

She also wants explicit requirements that large customers cover their share of Michigan's renewable energy mandates, which currently require utilities to get 60% of their power from clean sources by 2035.

Consumers Energy's Response

The utility fired back Wednesday, saying the commission's order already protects customers while allowing Michigan to compete for business investment.

""The attorney general's challenge has no merit,"" said Kelly Hall, Consumers Energy's senior vice president of regulatory and legal affairs. ""The MPSC's order last month creates a useful framework as Michigan grows and attracts new jobs and tax revenue for local communities.""

Lauren Snyder, the company's senior vice president and chief customer officer, went further, calling Nessel's position ""anti-investment.""

""When businesses grow, families have more choices — better jobs, stronger schools, and thriving communities where people want to live and stay,"" Snyder said.

Consumers Energy argues that large customers will actually help reduce costs for everyone by spreading the utility's fixed expenses across more users. The company said these customers will ""pay their full cost of service.""

What the Current Rules Require

Under the commission's November order, large energy users must:

Sign 15-year contracts with automatic five-year extensions

Pay for at least 80% of their contracted energy regardless of actual use

Pay exit fees if they leave early

Post collateral equal to half their potential exit fee

The commission also said it would review applications for new large customers individually to ensure they don't shift costs to other ratepayers.

What Happens Next

The Michigan Public Service Commission will decide whether to grant Nessel's request for a rehearing. The dispute comes as Michigan competes with other states to attract data centers, which require massive amounts of electricity to power servers that store and process digital information.

Nessel is also currently opposing the speed at which a proposed data center project in Saline Township is being moved forward. In early December, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced her support of the proposed data center, saying ""time is of the essence."" Nessel responded to the proposal as well, urging the MPSC to slow down and hold full, contested hearings on the project.",https://media.wzzm13.com/assets/WZZM/images/c743c916-6394-40f8-baa6-dbfcda98aa89/20251211T221944/c743c916-6394-40f8-baa6-dbfcda98aa89_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:02:46.335559

To hope that if you stand still enough, maybe the world won’t notice you.
Under the previous Trump administration, my mother lived undocumented in rural North Carolina, and every knock at the door felt like a threat that could change our lives forever.
And across North Carolina, that power is growing.
I see that same fire burning across North Carolina right now.","(Raleigh, NC – December 12, 2025) For many advocates across North Carolina, this year, and especially these last few weeks, has been emotionally shattering. ICE raids have returned to communities that have already lived through a decade of fear. Families are once again creating emergency plans for the worst-case scenario. Communities are canceling medical appointments, skipping work, and not taking their children to school. The fear is loud. And the silence is even louder.

As the daughter of immigrants, the scapegoating we are witnessing is not new. History is repeating itself, again, and the familiar narrative has returned: blame immigrants for every systemic failure in this country. I have spent these weeks supporting families who remind me so much of my own, and the weight of memory sits heavy. I know too well what it means to live in the shadows. To move in silence. To hope that if you stand still enough, maybe the world won’t notice you.

My own family’s journey is a reminder of how fragile safety can be. Under the previous Trump administration, my mother lived undocumented in rural North Carolina, and every knock at the door felt like a threat that could change our lives forever. Today, she is a U.S. citizen. That transformation should feel like a triumph. But the truth is, even citizenship does not erase the trauma, exhaustion, and vigilance that immigrant families carry. Right now, the fear persists for one painful, clear reason: it does not matter if you are a U.S. citizen. ICE has shown, repeatedly, that citizenship does not protect you from racial profiling. We’ve seen them target anyone with brown skin, arresting first and asking questions later.

But, in the past three weeks, I have seen something extraordinary, something beautiful rising out of the chaos. The raids have awakened a sleeping giant. People who once felt untouched by policy decisions are realizing that no one is far beyond reach. From public education to Medicaid access to the rising cost of living, people across North Carolina are feeling the consequences of policy choices they were told would “restore order.” But instead of shrinking back, people, especially young people, are standing up.

What gives me hope?

It’s the walkouts spreading across the country. It’s the teenagers in Wilson County who are making protest signs on a Tuesday afternoon. It’s the look on their faces when they realize they are fighting for something bigger than themselves. As I watched them, one of them asked me, “Are you okay? You look uncomfortable.” And, at that moment, I understood why.

When I was their age, I held my first protest sign begging this country to see my undocumented mother as a human being. I begged for safety. For acceptance. For the right to exist in the only home I had ever known. I never imagined I would see young people, almost a decade later, fighting a different version of the same battle.

It was like watching a circle close, one I never wanted them to inherit. And yet… they are lifting their voices. They are demanding change. They are refusing to disappear.

Their courage gives me hope because they are not just protesting; they are organizing. They understand something powerful: real safety is not created by fear-based policies. It is built by community power. And across North Carolina, that power is growing.

From rural towns to urban centers, we are seeing neighbors step up to learn their rights, volunteers joining rapid response networks, families challenging unjust detentions, and local leaders pushing back on policies that make our communities less safe. We are also watching coalitions deepen between immigrant communities, Black-led organizations, educators, and faith leaders. These relationships, these bridges, are the true infrastructure of collective safety.

The work ahead is hard. The gaps exposed by the raids: legal support, language access, transportation, mutual aid, childcare, accurate information, crisis response, trauma-informed care, among many others require more resources, deeper coordination, and political courage from those in power. We need policies that invest in community well-being rather than criminalization: expanded funding for legal defense, true sanctuary policies at the local level, higher wages so people can afford the basics, stronger protections for tenants, and access to healthcare regardless of immigration status. These are not radical ideas. They are necessary ones.

But despite the uncertainty, I remain hopeful, not because things are easy, but because I’m watching the next generation rise with clarity and conviction.

They remind me of the fire I once carried before too many defeats dimmed it.

I see that same fire burning across North Carolina right now. In Wilson, where history is shifting as we elect our first Latine leader to public office. In rural towns, where local leaders are mobilizing to build the infrastructure their communities need, not just for this moment, but for the future they deserve. In the coalitions of solidarity forming across counties and cultures. In the families who refuse to disappear. And in the young people who refuse to inherit silence.

Hope lives there.

And as long as we keep building power, across communities, across languages, across counties, the shadows will never be able to swallow us again.",https://www.ncjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7193.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 20:00:30.978573

Complementing the Atlantic Growth Strategy, entrepreneurs in Atlantic Canada received more than $140 million in financing in the first year of a two-year $280 million financing package.","Executive Summary of year 2 accomplishments

Between July 2017 and April 2018, the Atlantic economy created more than 16,000 jobs. Employment grew 1.5 per cent, better than the national average of 0.9 per cent. During this period, almost 11,000 jobs were created in services producing sectors, mainly in accommodation and food services, and over 5,000 in goods-producing sectors, mainly in the construction sector. Jobs created in Atlantic Canada during this period were full-time jobs, which grew by 2.4 per cent in the region, compared to 1.7 per cent nationally. Part-time jobs in the region have decreased by 2.9 per cent since July 2017. The region has also welcomed over 9,000 permanent residents and their families in 2017 under economic programs. With new dedicated support for businesses offered by the Atlantic Immigration Pilot, regional employers made nearly 1,800 job offers since 2017 to fill job vacancies using the Pilot Program, compared to over 250 job offers in the previous year. Through the Student Work Placement Program, a partnership between Venture for Canada, governments, post-secondary institutions and employers was created to provide more than 500 Canadian students across Atlantic Canada with valuable work experience and work-ready skills in business and entrepreneurial fields.

A new Ocean Supercluster, under development, will support growth of the ocean economy in Atlantic Canada and across the country. This initiative is projected to create more than 3,000 jobs and add more than $14 billion to Canada's economy over 10 years. Enrolment in the Accelerated Growth Service nearly doubled in the past year, with 29 new Atlantic Canadian high-growth companies signing up to receive customized support to grow their market potential - increasing total enrolment in the service to 68 companies. Through the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), more than $140 million has been invested in innovative companies working in information and communication technology, agri-food, ocean technology and tourism. With new training tools developed by not-for-profits and governments, Atlantic Canadian companies can access more market intelligence and resources to better use data, as well as participate in workshops to create healthy business cultures.

The Atlantic Growth Strategy's initiatives are making companies and communities more sustainable and able to mitigate climate change. Initiatives under the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change support efforts to meet emissions reduction targets, grow the economy, and build resilience to a changing climate. These initiatives include $185 million allocated to Atlantic Canadian provinces through the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund and the creation of the new Clean Growth Hub, launched in January 2018, which has already helped 30 Atlantic Canadian companies to access federal clean technology programs, funding and services. Innovative projects such as smart electricity grids in the City of Summerside and the University of New Brunswick are demonstrating new ways to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and improve reliability of energy sources.

Trade and tourism are a vital part of the Atlantic Canadian economy and both have experienced growth over the past few years. There were nearly 70 more exporters in our region in 2017 compared to 2016Footnote 1. Exports from Atlantic Canada were valued at $30 billion in 2017, an increase of 16 per cent between 2016 and 2017Footnote 2. Since the launch of the Atlantic Trade and Investment Growth Strategy in July 2017, partners have been organizing pan-Atlantic initiatives dedicated to international market engagement, including 17 trade missions involving more than 300 participants to countries like China, Europe and the United States. Tourism, meanwhile, is estimated to contribute more than $5 billion annually to the Atlantic Canadian economy. A new pan-Atlantic tourism approach, also announced in July 2017, provides new tools for hundreds of exporters in the tourism industry and promotes the region as a world-class tourism destination. This approach includes the region's largest ever media campaign in China, which builds on the 2018 Canada-China Year of Tourism. Indigenous tourism experiences offer a unique opportunity to showcase and share the rich history, culture and tradition of communities across the East Coast. An Atlantic chapter of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada was created, which creates a framework for future development in the region.

The federal government, along with the four provincial governments, is supporting the region's infrastructure in an effort to foster long-term economic growth and make communities more inclusive. In July 2017, the Government of Canada announced that over $2.4 billion would be allocated through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to the Atlantic provinces over the next decade for infrastructure projects, a record level of investment. Funding will be provided through integrated bilateral agreements between Infrastructure Canada and each province. This funding builds on $339 million for short-term investments to maintain and repair local infrastructure through Phase 1 of the Investing in Canada Plan, outlined in last year's report.

More than 130 communities across two Atlantic provinces will benefit from upwards of $66 million invested through the federal Connect to Innovate and provincial funding programs, with further investments expected throughout 2018. In addition, the Connecting Canadians Program completed eight of 13 projects across Atlantic Canada. These projects will help Atlantic Canadians take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the digital age.

The Atlantic Growth Strategy's accomplishments have required a high level of collaboration from all partners, coordinated and targeted investments and a clear vision for Atlantic Canada. Through the Strategy, the governments of Canada and the Atlantic provinces are committed to keep working collaboratively to advance common priorities for the long-term benefit of the Atlantic economy, including on broadband, skills and immigration in the near-term.

What have we done so far?

Strong federal-provincial collaboration is the hallmark of the Atlantic Growth Strategy as it continues to help create stable, good-paying jobs for Atlantic Canadians. The Strategy helps provide businesses with the tools they need to increase exports, innovate in traditional industries vital to the region's communities, as well as attract and retain skilled workers.

Thanks to the Atlantic Growth Strategy's initiatives to date, a strong foundation has been laid to enable established industries like agriculture, agri-food, fisheries, aquaculture and tourism – as well as emerging industries like clean technology – to innovate and successfully compete in global markets. At the same time, small- and medium-sized businesses are getting the support they need to capitalize on new technologies, attract skilled workers, scale up operations and pursue new export opportunities.

We are also deepening our understanding of the issues facing the region through consultations, best practices and research, including the final report from the Atlantic Growth Advisory Group. The Advisory Group provided their strategic advice and recommendations to help guide the region's collaborative approaches and actions moving forward. New collaborative work has been identified in important areas such as broadband, Indigenous tourism and the development of an export accelerator to help small and medium enterprises access the essential skills, competencies and connections they need to compete on the global stage. Using these tools, the governments of Canada and the Atlantic provinces are tailoring their approaches to maximize benefits for the region.

Together these actions have helped the Strategy's longer-term outcomes for each of the five strategic priorities for the region.

Since the July 2017 report on results, the Atlantic Growth Strategy has made progress on the following priorities:

Skilled Workforce and Immigration

Longer-Term Outcome: Admit up to 7,000 additional newcomers to the region by 2020

We are seeing positive results under the three-year Atlantic Immigration Pilot.

This federal and provincial pilot program is helping to attract and retain skilled workers and international graduates in Atlantic Canada. All partners have worked diligently to promote the pilot across the region with more than 700 outreach activities completed, targeting a variety of audiences.

Since the Pilot began accepting applications in March 2017, more Atlantic employers are seeing the potential of immigration to fill labour market needs that cannot be met locally. Atlantic employers have made nearly 1,800 job offers to applicants under the Atlantic Intermediate-Skilled Program, the Atlantic High-Skilled Program, and the Atlantic International Graduate Program to fill job vacancies. That's a considerable increase from the 250 job offers made at this time last year.

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada launched the Dedicated Service Channel.

Since July 2017, designated employers under the Atlantic Immigration Pilot are receiving personalized support from the Dedicated Service Channel in navigating the process of hiring foreign talent as well as receiving tips and associated guidance on strategies for success following recruitment. More than 200 employers are currently benefitting from these services.

We increased support to Settlement Service Provider Organizations.

Settlement Service Provider Organizations have provided more than 2,100 needs assessments and settlement plans to the Atlantic Immigration Pilot's principal applicants and their accompanying family members in an effort to help families settle in communities across the Atlantic region.

We are promoting the region as a destination of choice for international students and graduates.

The Atlantic provincial governments, with support from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), are expanding the model of EduNova's Study and Stay Program throughout the region to attract and retain international students. The model is being adapted to meet the specific needs of each province and complement existing service offerings. EduNova's Study and Stay program attracted close to 50 international students from China, India and the Philippines and is helping integrate them into their communities and transition to the workforce.

We are providing youth with work integrated learning opportunities.

In Atlantic Canada, a $4.4 million partnership was announced with Venture for Canada, in collaboration with post-secondary institutions and employers, to provide 505 Canadian students across the region with valuable work experience and work-ready skills in business and entrepreneurial fields. Students who participate in these opportunities develop technical and work-ready skills sought after by employers; they are more likely to benefit from greater employment opportunities, be employed in fields more closely related to their studies, and receive higher earnings.

We are helping address skill shortages.

Led by the Council of Atlantic Premiers' Atlantic Workforce Partnership and supported by Employment and Social Development Canada, the Atlantic Apprenticeship Harmonization Project (AAHP) is helping increase apprenticeship completion rates and keeping apprentices in Atlantic Canada. To date, the AAHP has enabled the harmonization of 10 trade occupations and the development and implementation of a new common information technology (IT) system to track apprenticeship certification. By February 2019, an additional six trades will be harmonized and the IT system will be completed.

Once completed, provinces will begin to migrate information from their current IT systems to the new platform. In total, 16 Red Seal trades will be harmonized across Atlantic provinces, thanks to new federal and provincial investments. There are currently approximately 15,000 apprentices in Atlantic Canada and it is expected that all apprentices will be registered in the new IT system by 2020.

Skilled Workforce and Immigration: Real-life Results

I would absolutely recommend the AIP to other employers.

Metamaterial Technologies Inc. (NS) uses innovative technology and advanced manufacturing to develop smart protective materials. The company's Canadian workforce includes global talent representing 15 countries and speaking more than 20 different languages. Metamaterial Technologies is using the Atlantic Immigration Pilot to hire highly skilled experts from around the world. The company is also part of the Accelerated Growth Service and housed at Innovacorp, a Nova Scotia business incubator and accelerator.

Metamaterials are a relatively new scientific field and the work we are doing in laser protection has never been done before. These are exciting times for science and this funding will help us as we move to the next stage of growth, allowing us to advance our manufacturing capacity to produce these new smart material products.

Dr. George Palikaras, Founder and CEO, Metamaterial Technologies Inc.

The Association for New Canadians (NL) helps employers and newcomers and their families through the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program's designation, endorsement and post-arrival processes. Increased settlement services in rural regions will support economic growth, as well as improve retention rates and address persistent and emerging labour market needs. More than $1.2 million was invested in this initiative by the Government of Canada and the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

We have a very close relationship with the (provincial) Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism as well as with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. We want to help both governments make Atlantic Canada a destination of choice for newcomers and immigrants, and make them comfortable by letting them know that they can set up roots here in the province, and that we will be there to help them make a go of it.

Kip Bonnell, Association for New Canadians

The New Conversations Tour (NB), organized by the New Brunswick Multicultural Council, is a series of 15 community events with two prominent New Brunswick economists. The New Conversations Tour was established to promote awareness of emerging shortages of skilled workers. It is also designed to facilitate more inclusive communities by providing the impetus for discussions on how to attract and keep workers. Events engage local stakeholders in discussions of labour force trends in New Brunswick and the critical need to address population decline through retention, repatriation, and immigration. The events have gathered more than 1,200 individuals so far.

Somru Bioscience (PEI) is a biotechnology company founded in 2012 that develops antibody technology to accelerate the drug development process. The company's vice-president and co-founder, Mohammed Moin, immigrated to PEI on a student visa in 2000. The company currently exports to more than 20 countries and is in the midst of a major expansion. A new joint venture for a diagnostic laboratory in Bangladesh is expected to generate $50 million in export sales over the next five years and add 100 new employees to the company's PEI operations. Somru is hiring two senior scientists using the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program to augment local recruiting.

A number of our employees do come through an immigration process. The AIP has been a benefit in a number of ways for us. Having the support at the provincial and the federal levels for permanent residency has been great. Diversity is something that we value here. We seek out opportunities to look at things differently, to approach things in a different way and diversity really allows us to do that.

Marcia Snow, Citco

Without the AIP, there would be no potential growth for us here. I would absolutely recommend the AIP to other employers, because finding skilled workers in many industries in Canada is getting more difficult and it is a way for our nation to grow its economic development. Without immigration it seems like a lot of industries are going to find challenges in getting new employees.

Mike Albert, Cirrus Garments

I am so pleased that I was told about IRCC's Dedicated Service Channel. My account manager has been instrumental in helping me understand the confusing aspects of hiring foreign workers. I frequently call or email him, and he's always friendly and answers my questions in a timely fashion. Knowing I can reach my account manager at any time, with any question or concern is a big relief for me and my employees.

Shaun McBride, The Learning Bar

We support newcomers by making sure that we work out a settlement plan with them based on their needs. Then we supply the employers with that settlement plan. We're also there for the follow up, so if the employer calls with questions or situations that they're not quite sure how to deal with, we can provide them with some advice and assistance.

Craig Mackie, PEI Association for Newcomers to Canada

Innovation

Longer-Term Outcome: Double the number of high-growth firms in Atlantic Canada by 2025

We are promoting innovation, technology adoption and advanced manufacturing.

With support from partners, Atlantic Canadian companies are investing in advanced equipment, in part to cope with a tightening labour supply. This trend supports productivity improvement and greater export competitiveness.

We are supporting regional clusters of innovation.

In February 2018, the Ocean Supercluster, led by the Atlantic region, was successful in its bid under ISED's Innovative Supercluster Initiative. This initiative will leverage the combined strengths of the industries operating in Canada's oceans. It is projected that this supercluster will create more than 3,000 jobs and add more than $14 billion to Canada's gross domestic product over 10 years. Governments, industries and stakeholders in Atlantic Canada continue to find ways to enhance collaboration in strategic sectors of our economy, including oceans, food and our clean technology companies.

We are enhancing the Accelerated Growth Service in Atlantic Canada.

This service provides customized support in areas such as financing, exporting, and advisory and innovation services to Atlantic companies with high-growth potential. The Atlantic provinces and the Government of Canada signed an agreement to enhance collaboration and create a more streamlined process for companies.

Between July 2017 and July 2018, 29 new Atlantic Canadian companies signed up for the service - nearly double the number that had signed up in the previous year. The total enrolment of 68 companies exceeds the region's target of 60 companies after two years. Ninety companies are expected to go through the service by 2019.

We are helping business incubators and accelerators launch and grow new start-ups.

Atlantic Canadian firms drive innovation activity in the region to promote long-term economic growth. There are more than 400 start-ups across the region, an increase of nearly 60 per cent since 2014. A number of regional incubators and accelerators are supporting this dynamic start-up culture. In an effort to grow employment and revenues, partners are developing a new strategy that builds on success factors and identifies investment priorities.

We are supporting research and innovation in areas such as biosciences, aquaculture, ocean technology, renewable energy, fisheries, agriculture and forestry.

Complementing the Atlantic Growth Strategy, entrepreneurs in Atlantic Canada received more than $140 million in financing in the first year of a two-year $280 million financing package. This package, launched by the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), aims to assist the region's small and mid-sized businesses pursuing growth in information and communication technology, agri-food, ocean technology and tourism.

BDC's $280 million financing commitment for Atlantic Canada represented a $100 million increase in the bank's normal lending volume for the targeted industries.

We are investing more than $400 million through the Atlantic Fisheries Fund to strengthen our fish and seafood sector.

Open for applications since August 2017, the Atlantic Fisheries Fund is helping advance a more sustainable and prosperous fish and seafood sector focused on innovation, infrastructure and science partnerships. This fund is driving innovation in Atlantic Canada's fish and seafood sector to better meet market demands for sustainably sourced, high quality fish and seafood products, and to address the challenges posed by changing oceanographic conditions.

We are finding new ways to support Atlantic Canada's food sector.

Through a federal-provincial working group on food, the governments of Canada and the Atlantic provinces are working with industry to identify ways to leverage strategic opportunities in our region's food sector. The region is ripe with opportunities to share its high quality and sustainable goods with the country and the rest of the world.

We are building awareness of the potential of big data analytics.

We trained 100 federal and provincial staff on big data analytics, which will help staff work with clients to identify opportunities for the use of data analytics in their businesses. These opportunities could include enhancing productivity, making better decisions and/or developing new products and markets. This training will also help staff to refer clients to the appropriate support services for their big data analytics projects.

As a result of this work, 15 Atlantic companies to date have been linked to the National Research Council Data Analytics Centre.

We are working with stakeholders to determine the cultural dimensions of success.

Our partners have conducted an in-depth analysis of business culture and organized an intensive Innovation Lab with business leaders and other key representatives from government, academia and the not-for-profit community. These insights will help tailor our support for Atlantic businesses. We explored attitudes, behaviours and perceptions that affect business growth, innovation and productivity in Atlantic Canada.

We are encouraging opportunities for youth to learn digital skills.

The CanCode Program will invest $50 million across Canada over two years to support initiatives providing opportunities for coding and digital skills development to Canadian youth from kindergarten to grade 12, including $2 million for two Atlantic-led projects. The program helps students and teachers acquire skills and knowledge through coding and digital skills experiences.

Innovation: Real-life Results

VoltaCohort competitions led by Volta Labs of Halifax, Nova Scotia, have led to $250,000 in strategic investments for 10 early-stage high-calibre Atlantic Canadian start-ups to fuel their growth and success.

VoltaCohort (NS), launched by Volta Labs in conjunction with ACOA, BDC and Innovacorp, is a two-year pilot program that was created to help early stage, high calibre companies from across Atlantic Canada find investment. The program has already awarded $250,000 to ten start-ups through its two competitions in November 2017 and May 2018, where 31 start-ups presented their companies for funding. The winners of VoltaCohort's most recent competition included Sydney's Talem Health Analytics and UAV Control Tower of St. John's.

Together with our partners, we look forward to helping these early-stage companies grow and succeed from their home base in Atlantic Canada.

Jesse Rodgers, CEO, Volta Labs

Superior Glove Works Limited (NL) manufactures more than 3,000 styles of work gloves and sleeves with applications in aerospace, agriculture, automotive, construction and other sectors. The growing demand in export markets was driving the need to increase production, which was addressed through the company's participation in the Accelerated Growth Service.

Our industry is considered commodity based. Our company competes with low-cost countries like China and India. We know we won't have the lowest price going in, so we have to add value and innovate.

Tony Geng, President, Superior Glove Works

LuminUltra (NB) is a clean tech solutions company that expanded and modernized its operations in order to accommodate recent rapid growth, along with an anticipated increase in sales volume and research and development projects. This includes the acquisition of new lab equipment as well as leasehold improvements.

Rollo Bay Holdings (PEI) is the largest agriculture entity in Eastern PEI specializing in red, yellow and russet potatoes for consumer and food service industries. The company is one of the first in North America to invest in specialized advanced manufacturing equipment and technology to improve output, efficiency and reduce waste. Rollo Bay is still employing the same number of people but the jobs are now more technical, translating into better pay and improved retention rates. The company is part of the Accelerated Growth Service.

Clean Growth and Climate Change

Longer-Term Outcome: Reduce GHG emissions

We covered a lot of ground since launching the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change.

The Pan-Canadian Framework outlines more than 50 concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, help the region adapt and become more resilient to the impacts of a changing climate, foster clean technology solutions, and create good jobs that contribute to a stronger economy.

In its first year of implementation, federal, provincial and territorial governments have made good progress in starting to put the framework into action. Work is underway to ensure that carbon pricing systems are in place across Canada by January 1, 2019. Governments are also implementing new policies, programs and regulations to reduce emissions in every sector of the economy, support communities in adapting to a changing climate, and invest in clean technologies.

We are investing more than $185 million in Atlantic Canada through the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund.

Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have each leveraged at least $50 million in federal funding to support energy efficiency upgrades in buildings across their provinces. In particular, programming in both provinces is being expanded to allow homeowners who heat their homes with fuel oil to access funding for home retrofits. In Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, several significant opportunities to support clean growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, will be funded with support from the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund.

We are investing in Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure, across Canada.

For example in 2017, the federal government provided $1.6 million for the installation of electric vehicle fast charging stations in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, through phase 1 of the Electric Vehicle and Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Deployment initiative.

We are serving companies and other stakeholders through the Clean Growth Hub.

The newly created Clean Growth Hub is connecting Atlantic-based companies and other stakeholders to the various supports for clean technology across government. So far, more than 500 companies and industry stakeholders have worked with the Hub, including 30 Atlantic Canadian organizations working to advance their clean technologies.

In addition to the Hub, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, which provides funding for Canadian clean technology projects, also has a presence in Atlantic Canada to provide expertise in the fields of sustainable development, finance and technology investment to help Atlantic Canadian companies move their ground-breaking technologies to market.

We are continuing to advance work on regional electricity grids and renewable power generation.

Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), working together with the Governments of the Atlantic Provinces and their electric utilities, and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, finalized an initial study under the Regional Electricity Cooperation and Strategic Infrastructure initiative that identifies the most promising electricity infrastructure projects that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Atlantic Canada. The study identifies reinforcement of the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick transmission intertie as a promising project for transitioning Atlantic Canada to clean electricity.

NRCan is currently working with the governments of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and their electric utilities to assess the costs and benefits of the project to the two jurisdictions, with a view toward advancing this important infrastructure project.

We are protecting Atlantic Canada's forests from the damaging effects of a spruce budworm outbreak.

Through Budget 2018, the Government of Canada proposed to take action alongside the Governments of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the forest industry, by providing up to $74 million over four years and $750,000 ongoing, to prevent the spread of spruce budworm and the associated socio-economic and environmental impacts of an outbreak.

Co-sponsored by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Phase II of the Early Intervention Strategy for Spruce Budworm research program supports the Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, as tree mortality caused by an outbreak will negatively affect greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts. Preventing an outbreak and protecting Atlantic Canada's forest resource will also ensure that forestry remains a vital driver of the region's economy and a source of jobs and opportunities.

Clean Growth and Climate Change: Real-Life Results

The City of Summerside, Prince Edward Island, has integrated wind, solar and battery power with smart grids to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and improve reliability, while reducing dependence on traditional sources of energy such as diesel and heating oil.

The City of Summerside (PEI), with support from partners including Samsung Canada, has integrated wind, solar and battery power with smart grids to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and improve reliability, while reducing dependence on traditional sources of energy such as diesel and heating oil. In 2015, Summerside achieved the highest level of wind power integration in North America, and PEI was the first North American jurisdiction to generate more than 30 per cent of its electricity from wind energy.

Trade and Investment

Longer-Term Outcome: Double the number of exporters in Atlantic Canada by 2025

We are implementing the multi-year, international Atlantic Trade and Investment Growth Strategy, supported by a $20 million funding agreement.

The Atlantic Trade and Investment Growth Strategy, announced in July 2017, supports joint trade and investment initiatives that are coordinated, firm-focused, and built on the region's sector capabilities and capacity.

Since 2017, pan-Atlantic initiatives (in addition to bilateral and unilateral initiatives) dedicated to international market engagements included 17 trade missions, involving more than 300 participants.

We are growing awareness of export opportunities to Europe.

The recent Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement is creating significant opportunities for our region.

To prepare for these opportunities, we organized two multi-sector trade missions to the European Union with Atlantic Canadian companies in June and November 2017. These trade missions resulted in more than 139 qualified sales leads and 63 potential sales deals reported by participants.

Partners also held a Canada-Europe Trade Agreement Roadshow to generate awareness of the European market. These sessions drew in approximately 320 business participants from across all four Atlantic provinces.

We are providing the tools to support our current and future exporters.

LearnSphere's bilingual Export Market Access Program (EMAP) and E-Tools for Exporting (E for E), which saw investments of $3 million, help firms develop and expand their sales to international markets.

As of April 30, 2018, these programs provided support for nearly 130 companies and almost half of them were new exporters. LearnSphere will help more than 180 companies across Atlantic Canada reach their export goals by the end of 2018 through the EMAP and E for E programs.

We are preparing an Atlantic Growth Strategy joint trade mission to China.

China is Canada's second largest trading partner after the United States.

This multi-sectoral trade and investment mission will take place in November 2018. It will support Atlantic Canadian businesses and organizations in the food, clean growth, education and tourism sectors that are looking to create new partnerships and build business-to-business relationships in China. It will also capitalize on the 2018 Canada-China Year of Tourism.

We hosted Rendez-Vous Canada, Canada's premier international tourism marketplace.

Held in Halifax, Nova Scotia over four days, it brought together more than 1,900 tourism professionals to promote or discover unique Canadian experiences, particularly those showcasing national priority products such as Indigenous and culinary tourism. The event has the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for Canadian tourism businesses and was supported by the new Atlantic Canada Tourism Strategy, announced in July 2017.

We are implementing a strategic and collaborative approach to tourism.

The strategy includes $24.5 million in federal-provincial-industry investments for three initiatives aimed at positioning Atlantic Canada as a top destination in the global tourism sector, creating more jobs for Atlantic Canadians and giving a boost to small businesses. More than 120 Atlantic Canada tourism stakeholders were trained through the Atlantic Growth Strategy Travel Trade Market Readiness Program with a series of webinars and workshops on how to work with international travel trade. The Tourism International Market Expansion Program is supporting the Government of Canada's target of doubling Chinese visitation to Canada by 2021.

We are supporting Indigenous tourism in Atlantic Canada.

The Atlantic chapter of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada was created in June 2017 to build a framework for future development in the region.

We are also supporting the development of tourism strategies and products in communities that wish to pursue tourism as an economic driver. For example, a delegation of Nova Scotia First Nations participated in Edge of the Wedge in November 2017, Canada's premier experiential travel training program led by the Gros Morne Institute of Sustainable Tourism. The program is hosted at the Gros Morne National Park in Newfoundland and Labrador, a leading center of expertise in experiential tourism.

We continue to implement the Collaborative Procurement Initiative across all four Atlantic Provinces with over 20 Municipalities, Academic Institutions and School Boards now participating in Atlantic Canada.

The initiative enables partners, including provincial governments, municipalities, academic institutions, school boards, and hospitals, to leverage Public Services and Procurement Canada's federal instruments and buying power to procure goods and services to obtain better value for money.

With over $200 billion spent annually on public procurement in Canada, this initiative provides opportunities to save taxpayers' money, negotiate better terms and conditions, reduce administrative costs, simplify processes, make it easier for businesses to sell to multiple levels of government, and to expand their market. In addition to reducing costs, federal procurement instruments help to support the use of clean and sustainable goods and services.

So far, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have been able to save more than 30 per cent on the cost of emergency radios and environmental office paper when using federal tools, while negotiating better terms and conditions from suppliers. For example, a locally owned business (Covey Basics) is providing office supplies to the Province of Prince Edward Island, who is receiving better value.

With the introduction of a Canadian Collaborative Procurement Plan in December 2017, more of these success stories are expected.

Trade and Investment: Real-life Results

95 Atlantic Canadian tourism stakeholders took part in TIME's China Readiness initiative to help prepare a great experience for Chinese visitors during the 2018 Canada-China Year of Tourism - and beyond.

G.E. Barbours currently reports a significant increase in anticipated export sales with strong potential to break into the European market.

Infrastructure

Longer-Term Outcome: Bring rural and remote areas online by 2025

We are building better infrastructure in Atlantic Canada that will support growth, and engage and connect people.

Building on nearly $339 million from Budget 2016 for short-term investments to maintain and repair local infrastructure in the region, the Atlantic provinces will see more than $2.4 billion over the next decade for infrastructure projects.

In addition, 28 municipalities across Atlantic Canada applied to the Smart Cities Challenge. These municipalities proposed innovative solutions addressing local issues by leveraging new partnerships, data and connected technology. The Saint Mary's First Nation, the City of Fredericton and the Town of Bridgewater are among the 20 Smart Cities Challenge finalists.

Additional opportunities to spur innovation will be offered by the Canada Infrastructure Bank, to help build projects based on public-private sector partnerships.

We are helping enhance broadband access across the region.

Together, the Atlantic provinces and the Government of Canada announced total investments of more than $66 million through the federal Connect to Innovate and provincial funding programs in two Atlantic provinces. More than 130 communities will benefit from these announcements, which are expected to continue throughout 2018.

In addition, the Connecting Canadians Program completed eight of 13 projects across Atlantic Canada. These projects will help residents connect with family and friends, do business online, participate in distance education and take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the digital age.

We are enhancing and modernizing research and commercialization facilities.

The Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund is supporting 27 projects in Atlantic Canada, with a $152.5 million federal investment, to enhance and modernize facilities for research, commercialization and training at post-secondary institutions.

,Clean Energy ,2025-12-12 20:09:28+00:00,news.asu.edu,ASU's LEAPS lab marks a decade of energy impact - ASU News,Kelly deVos,,,,,https://news.asu.edu/20251212-science-and-technology-asus-leaps-lab-marks-decade-energy-impact,"That’s exactly the work ASU’s Laboratory for Energy And Power Solutions, or LEAPS, has been dedicated to for the last decade.
The LEAPS project portfolio reads like a field guide to practical energy solutions.
In Arizona, the broad partnership with the Hopi Tribe is an exemplar of locally led, culturally aware electrification that is supported by LEAPS technical assistance.
“It equips people with the skills and leadership needed to deliver the energy solutions where they’re needed most.” Johnson is blunt about the scale and urgency required to meet future energy needs.
As LEAPS turns 10, its message is part technical, part civic: Clean, resilient energy is possible when universities turn ideas into solutions.","Nathan Johnson doesn't mince words when it comes to Earth's energy requirements.

“The world needs every electron it can get to match the accelerated pace of economic development and electrification,” says Johnson, a professor of engineering in The Polytechnic School, part of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University. “In the United States, meeting that surge won’t come from a single technology, business model or policy.”

That insight is both the organizing idea and the challenge facing the next decade. With data-center growth, the electrification of industry, the rise of artificial intelligence and onshoring of manufacturing, U.S. electricity demand is set to climb steeply in the next 10 years. This trend is advancing even faster in other countries.

The future will require practical, scalable solutions that knit together power generation, storage, smarter grids, workforce development and finance. That’s exactly the work ASU’s Laboratory for Energy And Power Solutions, or LEAPS, has been dedicated to for the last decade.

The LEAPS pitch is simple and urgent: translate university innovations into real infrastructure and the workforce at scale. The lab’s 10-year report shows $332 million mobilized, 161 megawatts of clean capacity-enabled and reliable power for over 100,000 people. The team also also trained thousands of workers across the energy sector and government.

Those headline numbers aren’t theory. They are evidence that the lab’s solutions and extension services model can deliver infrastructure, policy advice and trained people where it matters most.

The LEAPS project portfolio reads like a field guide to practical energy solutions. In Arizona, the broad partnership with the Hopi Tribe is an exemplar of locally led, culturally aware electrification that is supported by LEAPS technical assistance.

The Hopi face a persistent lack of access to energy. Even grid-connected homes experience a higher-than-normal number of outages due to dated infrastructure. LEAPS is working with the tribe and local partners to change that by bringing solar energy to homes and community spaces, strengthening power lines to make them more reliable, installing microgrids and training Hopi residents to maintain and manage these new systems. The project also builds lasting partnerships between the tribe, utilities, universities and local businesses to support energy independence and create long-term jobs for Hopi people.

The partnership encompasses several projects with technical and community-driven design. James Nelson, director of technology and innovation for LEAPS, notes that the work explicitly links energy access to job creation for a community hit hard by the closure of coal facilities.

“The project delivers cost-effective, reliable and locally managed power to Hopi households,” Nelson says. “By bringing electricity where no other options exist, we’re supporting energy sovereignty, economic opportunity and long-term resilience for the Hopi Tribe.”

Globally, LEAPS applies the same modular, partnership-driven playbook. In Fiji, the LEAPS team worked with the government to assess and prepare 75 sites for mini-grid power systems. Their work laid the foundation for about $40 million in upcoming construction projects and created new training opportunities to build a skilled clean energy workforce across the South Pacific.

In Madagascar, LEAPS helped produce an integrated energy plan that maps clean cooking and electrification pathways with prioritized investments that can reach universal access by 2030.

In Kenya, technical assistance and business coaching helped women-led energy firms scale, producing an estimated 14,000 new systems and a 48-fold multiplier of private follow-on capital. Across refugee relief, microgrid pilot projects, military resilience programs and municipal microgrid studies, LEAPS emphasizes deployable designs, local ownership models and measurable returns on capital.

What distinguishes LEAPS is a focus on scalable project development and a technical assistance model that amplifies finance.

“We’ve built a model where every dollar LEAPS spends attracts $10 to $50 more,” Johnson says. “That’s how you turn good ideas into large-scale impact.”

The lab’s teams do the engineering, shape business models, work with regulators and utilities, and then test systems — often using the lab’s Grid Modernization Proving Grounds and a mobile training trailer — so private and public partners can move quickly from pilot to procurement to construction.

This is how LEAPS turns pilots into programs: standardize the technical solution, reduce procurement risk, train operators and managers locally, and create financing structures that make projects investable.

One project paid for itself in just 18 months by using smart energy management to make better use of existing infrastructure instead of installing new capital assets.

LEAPS is also a campus-to-community engine. The lab has engaged over 300 students directly in projects and provided hands-on training and internships that translate classroom curiosity into career paths.

“Our microgrid proving grounds give people hands-on experience with real power assets,” Johnson says. “Most students come in with curiosity and passion. Our job is to pair that energy with opportunity and give them options to explore where they want to best fit in the energy economy.”

Alexander Mobley, associate director of technology evaluation and workforce development, explains that LEAPS runs professional courses that reach utility executives, U.S. Department of War personnel and frontline technicians, building the human capital needed to implement the technical solutions they design.

“Training isn’t an afterthought; it’s the foundation of our work,” Mobley says. “It equips people with the skills and leadership needed to deliver the energy solutions where they’re needed most.”

Johnson is blunt about the scale and urgency required to meet future energy needs.

“What the U.S. built in the last 100 years needs to be built again in the next 10. But we don’t have the people, materials or policies to do it the same way.”

The implication is not nostalgia for old infrastructure, but a call to do more with smarter designs, match demand to clean generation, tighten asset utilization and avoid the inefficiencies of overbuilding. That’s the pragmatic, all-of-the-above stance LEAPS brings to policymakers and communities.

As LEAPS turns 10, its message is part technical, part civic: Clean, resilient energy is possible when universities turn ideas into solutions.

The LEAPS portfolio — Hopi electrification, multi-island mini-grids, national energy planning, refugee clinics with solar power, women-led business support, technology transfer, technical consulting and military resilience programs — shows how a single lab can move ideas into durable projects by combining engineering, finance, policy and training.

If the next decade is defined by an intensifying energy demand curve, then institutions that can translate innovation into infrastructure and training at scale will define success.

“We want to formalize our approach to solutions and extension services and expand it beyond energy into other sectors of the economy,” Johnson says. “I think that’s emblematic of ASU’s spirit in the New American University.”

Where do I find a qualified third-party to inspect my project or approve plans?
The Texas Solar Energy Society (TXSES) is the residential rooftop solar industry’s nonprofit statewide organization that can help identify qualified third-parties for installers.
The third-party is liable for damages resulting from their own negligent acts or omissions in conducting the review or inspection.","The adoption of solar energy in Texas is getting a major boost! Thanks to Senate Bill 1202, which passed in the 89th Texas legislative session and is now in effect, the time-consuming process of getting permits and inspections for residential solar and battery storage systems can now be streamlined. This new law gives both homeowners and solar installers a powerful new tool to bypass long delays from local authorities, making the path to clean, resilient home power much faster and more predictable.

This article breaks down how this new, optional permitting path works, what it covers, and the steps installers must follow.

What is SB 1202 and What Does It Cover?

SB 1202 creates an alternative path for the review and inspection of residential backup power systems—installations designed to provide power to a single- or two-family home and connected at 600 volts or less. This includes:

Rooftop Solar

Battery Energy Storage Systems

Generators

Other electricity generation or storage 600 volts or less

The bill allows installers to utilize qualified third-parties to perform the plan reviews and inspections that were historically done only by the local municipality, or the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). While cities are not required to speed up their own processes, installers can now choose this third-party option to accelerate their projects.

The Third-Party Permitting Process

Step 1: Choosing the Third-Party Path

The process begins with the installer deciding whether to use the AHJ (the city) or a qualified third-party for either the plan review, the project inspection, or both.If the installer chooses the AHJ, the process remains the same as before, with no mandated deadline for the city to complete the review or inspection.

If the installer chooses a qualified third party, the third party will then need the AHJ’s applicable code and regulations. The AHJ must publish their applicable code and regulations online or provide them upon request within 2 business days. If the AHJ does not publish or provide the code and regulations within this timeframe, the third party may use the applicable section of the International Residential Code.

Step 2: Review and Inspection by the Qualified Third-Party

Once the third-party has the necessary code information, they conduct the required plan review and/or inspection. While the third-party is not required to conduct the plan review or inspection within a certain timeframe, they will be paid for this service by the installer so they are expected to be timely. It is also important to note that virtual inspections and using automated rooftop solar permitting tools like SolarAPP+ are explicitly allowed in the legislation.

Step 3: Notification and Beginning Construction

Whenever the third party has completed the plan review and/or inspection, they must submit the documents and a notice to the AHJ within 15 days of it being completed.

Once the third party has notified the AHJ that this installation is utilizing a third party under SB1202 and provides the documentation of plan review and/or inspection, the installer may begin construction of the project. The AHJ may not require a fee for the plan review or inspection that was done by the third party.

Step 4: Final Permit Issuance

Within three business days of receiving the notice and documents from the qualified third-party, the AHJ must issue the appropriate final approval, permit, or certification for the project.

Frequently asked questions:

Who is a qualified third-party?

Third parties for permit review and/or inspection include:

Master electricians

Certified electrical inspectors

Individuals employed by a Texas AHJ to review development documents

Licensed engineers

The third party may not be the homeowner or installer.

Does this apply to permits or fees for interconnection with transmission and distribution utilities (TDUs), utility co-ops, or municipally owned utilities?

This law does not apply to interactions with transmission and distribution utilities, however many TDUs do require a permit from the AHJ, which is provided in the third-party process within 3 business days of the AHJ receiving notice from the third-party that the project has been approved.

Where do I find a qualified third-party to inspect my project or approve plans?

The Texas Solar Energy Society (TXSES) is the residential rooftop solar industry’s nonprofit statewide organization that can help identify qualified third-parties for installers.

If the inspection or plan permit results in damage, who is liable?

The third-party is liable for damages resulting from their own negligent acts or omissions in conducting the review or inspection. The AHJ is not liable for damage resulting from third-party reviews or inspections.",https://environmentamerica.org/texas/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/131017-F-PB776-001.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:30.877180

Round 7 Awardees:

Village of Maybrook, Orange County – $25.48 million: This infrastructure improvement project will allow for the development of the Switchyard Terminal for Economic and Advanced Manufacturing (STEAM) Rail & Business Park at the long- vacant Maybrook Rail Yard. The grant will fund infrastructure installation, improvements and expansions set to benefit roads, water, sewer, and drainage infrastructure. The result will be six building-pad sites accessible via the existing Middletown, New Jersey, rail line. Strategically located just 75 miles from New York City, these infrastructure upgrades will present the Village with the opportunity to catalyze the regional economy by attracting strategic industries and achieve the goal of establishing an economic hub to become a key facet of the New York manufacturing ecosystem.

Fulton County Industrial Development Agency – $8.99 million: This infrastructure improvement project will allow for adaptive reuse and revitalization of Tryon Technology Park, a former NYS Juvenile Correctional Facility in Perth. Funding for this project will be used for upgrades to the water pump station and mains, upgrades to the wastewater pumps and force mains, demolition and earthwork. The project will prepare the 220-acre site for further development of up to four buildings ranging in size from 150,000 to 1.3 million square feet for manufacturing companies looking to locate in the area. Infrastructure upgrades included in this project will allow the Tryon Technology Park to tap into abundant water and wastewater capacities, making this site uniquely positioned to attract strategic agribusiness, food processing, and life science investment.

Herkimer County Industrial Development Agency – $7.9 million: This infrastructure improvement project will allow for key infrastructure upgrades needed at the Central New York Business Center to offer a shovel-ready industrial site for advanced manufacturing. Funds will be used to upgrade 2,000 feet of the Higby Road gas main, construction of an onsite water tank for fire protection, new turn lanes and traffic signals, plus demolition, grading, stormwater, and utility extensions. The site offers access to two million gallons per day in excess water capacity and 2.6 million gallons per day in excess wastewater capacity available in the district. Central New York Business Center is strategically located in the Town of Frankfort, near major highways and other industrial development and, once complete, it will deliver an industry-ready site that will attract advanced manufacturers, create jobs, and expand New York’s manufacturing economy.

Advance Albany County Alliance Local Development Corporation – $500,000: This pre-development project will allow for shovel-ready advancement of the Al Tech Advanced Manufacturing Campus.

Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.
An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program.","California’s last nuclear power plant overcame a regulatory hurdle on Thursday when the California Coastal Commission voted to approve keeping the plant open for at least five years.

It was one of the final obstacles the controversial Diablo Canyon Power Plant had to clear to continue operating amid renewed opposition. The decision was conditioned on a plan that would require Pacific Gas & Electric, which owns the plant, to conserve about 4,000 acres of land on its property. That would prevent it from ever being developed for commercial or residential use.

The plant, located along the San Luis Obispo shoreline, now awaits federal approval for a 20-year relicensing permit.

“I don’t think, unfortunately, that anything will be happening to Diablo Canyon soon,” due to the growing energy demands of artificial intelligence, Commissioner Jaime Lee said before voting to approve the permit. Nine of the 12 voting members approved the plan.

The deliberations reignited decades-old concerns about the dangers of nuclear power and its place in the state’s portfolio of renewable energy sources. Diablo Canyon is the state’s single-largest energy source, providing nearly 10% of all California electricity.

Defeated in their earlier attempts to shut the plant, critics of Diablo Canyon used months of Coastal Commission hearings as one of their last opportunities to vocalize their disdain for the facility. Some Democratic lawmakers supported the plant but pushed for PG&E to find more ways to protect the environment.

Sen. John Laird, Democrat of San Luis Obispo County and former secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, said on Thursday he approved of the new plan but pushed the commission to require the utility to conserve even more of its total 12,000 surrounding acres.

“If what comes out of this is the path for preservation for 8,000 acres of land, that is a remarkable victory,” Laird said.

Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis, whose district encompasses the plant, had also urged the commission in a letter to approve a permit “once it contains strong mitigation measures that reflect the values and needs of the surrounding tribal and local communities who depend on our coastal regions for environmental health, biodiversity and economic vitality.”

A long history of controversy

Founded in 1985, the plant’s striking concrete domes sit along the Pacific coast 200 miles north of Los Angeles. The facility draws in 2 million gallons of water from the ocean every day to cool its systems

And it has remained shrouded in controversy since its construction 40 years ago. Environmentalists point to the damage it causes to marine life, killing what the Coastal Commission estimates are 2 billion larval fish a year.

The commissioners on Thursday were not deciding whether to allow the plant to stay open but were weighing how best to lessen the environmental impacts of its operation. A 2022 state law forced the plant to stay open for five more years past its planned 2025 closure date, which could have led to significant political blowback against the Coastal Commission if it had rejected the permit.

Gov. Gavin Newsom reversed a 2016 agreement made between environmental groups and worker unions to close the plant after the state faced a series of climate disasters that spurred energy blackouts. Popular sentiment toward nuclear energy has also continued to grow more supportive as states across the country consider revitalizing dormant and aging nuclear plants to fulfill ever-increasing energy demand needs.

The 2022 law authorized a $1.4 billion loan to be paid back with federal loans or profits.

Groups such as the Environmental Defense Center and Mothers for Peace opposed the permit outright, citing concerns about radioactive waste, which can persist for centuries, and its cost to taxpayers.

“We maintain that any extension of Diablo is unnecessary,” and that its continued operations could slow the development of solar and wind energy, Jeremy Frankel, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Center told the commission Thursday.

The California Public Utilities Commission last year approved $723 million in ratepayer funds toward Diablo Canyon’s operating costs this year. It was the first time rate hikes were spread to ratepayers of other utilities such as Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric and was authorized by lawmakers because the plant provides energy to the entire state.

How the plant will be funded has also garnered scrutiny in the years since Newsom worked to keep it open. Last year, the Legislature nearly canceled a $400 million loan to help finance it.

As much as $588 million is unlikely to come back due to insufficient federal funding and projected profits, CalMatters has reported.

Proponents of the plant pointed to its reliability, carbon-free pollution and the thousands of jobs it has created.

Business advocacy groups emphasized their support for the plant as boosting the economy.

“It is an economic lifeline that helps keep our communities strong and competitive,” Dora Westerlund, president of the Fresno Area Hispanic Foundation, said at a November meeting.

The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.

Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.

The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.

Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute will categorize cancer patients as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.

Registries currently specify whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.

President Donald Trump in January issued an executive order stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.

“In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.

Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.

Missing the Big Picture

Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.

“When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.

“The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”

For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.

Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents 97% of the U.S. population. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering nearly half the U.S. population.

The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.

For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying rising rates of colorectal cancer among people younger than 50. As a result, U.S. guidelines now recommend that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.

States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women. The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas initiated a statewide effort aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.

“Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”

The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.

For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.

The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.

In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”

‘Backwards’ Progress

NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.

According to an analysis of CDC data by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.

Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.

“Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.

A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were two to three times as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.

A Canadian study concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a 2023 study from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.

Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.

There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”

The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.

Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and stopping specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.

Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”

There is a new cost to hiring an international worker to fill a vital but otherwise vacant position in a California classroom: $100,000.

In September, the Trump administration began requiring American employers to pay a $100,000 sponsorship fee for new H-1B visas, on top of already required visa application fees that amount to $9,500 to $18,800, depending on various factors. These visas allow skilled and credentialed workers in multiple job sectors to stay in the U.S.

Most foreign workers on H-1Bs in California work in the tech sector. But California also relies on H-1B visas to address another issue: a nationwide teacher shortage and a high demand for staff in dual-language education and special education in K-12 districts.

Data from the California Department of Education shows school districts filed more than 300 visa applications for the 2023-24 school year, double the amount from just two years earlier. Educators and school officials say its overseas workers on visas are highly skilled, instrumental in multilingual education, and fill historically understaffed positions in special education.

Now education leaders are sounding the alarm that the high additional fee for overseas workers will worsen the strain on California’s public education system.

International employees fill a much-needed gap for school districts

California continues to face an ongoing teacher shortage. In 2023, California K-12 schools staffed 46,982 positions with employees whose credentials did not align with their job assignments, according to data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Another 22,012 educator positions were left vacant that year. Of total misassignments and vacancies, around 28% were in English language development and 11.9% were in special education.

California school districts have also resorted to hiring teachers who haven’t yet obtained certain credentials, according to a study by the nonprofit Learning Policy Institute. Facing a need for teachers, school districts have found that trained professionals from other countries are willing — and qualified — to take classroom jobs that would otherwise go unfilled.

In 2023, in the Bay Area east of San Francisco, West Contra Costa Unified School District had 381 misassigned positions and 711 vacancies, according to the commission. So the district turned to foreign educators, hiring about 88 teachers on H-1B visas — a majority from the Philippines, Spain and Mexico — to teach in mostly dual-language and special education programs, said Sylvia Greenwood, the assistant superintendent for human resources at the district.

“With our shortages in special ed, they were a good fit for our district. And so, therefore, we kept that pipeline open and brought teachers here from the Philippines to support our students and our students with special needs,” Greenwood said.

The decline in the number of credentialed special education teachers continues to worsen. Between 2020 and 2024, the number of credentials earned to teach special education decreased by almost 600 across California, according to data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. The number of temporary permits and waivers granted by the commission increased by about 300 during the same period.

Francisco Ortiz, the president of United Teachers of Richmond and a teacher at Ford Elementary School in West Contra Costa, said the workload for teachers in the district will increase if West Contra Costa Unified is unable to bring in new international teachers.

This would create “greater instability” for students, he said, adding, “It's going to have a great impact in special education, which is already on fire.”

California school district officials say they are unsure they can pay the new fee to fill hiring gaps with international employees. West Contra Costa officials said they do not know yet who will be responsible for paying the new fee: the district, international teachers themselves or another party.

“We are a district that is dealing with a structural deficit as well, and so that cost, in a lot of ways, is going to be very difficult for our district or really any school district, to be able to take that on,” said Cheryl Cotton, the superintendent for West Contra Costa.

It’s essentially a giant ‘Keep Out’ sign.

— Laura Flores-Perilla, an attorney with L.A.-based Justice Action Center

Pasadena Unified, in Southern California, filed about a dozen applications for H-1B visa sponsorships in 2024. Now the district, facing a $27 million budget deficit, will require those applying for H-1B visas to pay for it themselves, according to district spokesperson Hilda Ramirez Horvath. She said foreign employees will also no longer receive other types of financial support, including legal or filing fees related to immigration processing.

Language programs benefit from international teachers

District officials are also worried about the cultural costs of losing international educators. Educators on H-1B visas make dual-language public schools possible, giving families in California a unique multicultural education that sticks with their children for life.

Kelleen Peckham, a mother to two children in West Contra Costa, said she chose to transfer her daughter to Washington Elementary School in Richmond because it has a dual-language immersion program that teaches students to speak and read Spanish.

Peckham also plans to send her son, who will start kindergarten next year, to the same school even though it takes the family an extra 15 minutes to drive there.

“My husband's family is from Mexico, and so [their] grandmother, on one side, only speaks Spanish,” Peckham said. “It's important for [them] to be able to communicate with [their] family and extended family.”

She said if the dual-language immersion program at Washington Elementary doesn’t survive, she would consider transferring her children back to the school in their neighborhood.

Fee spells ‘Keep Out’ to foreign workers

Within weeks of the fee’s announcement, a coalition of international worker groups, unions and religious organizations sued the Trump administration, alleging the fee would inhibit staffing in education, medicine and ministry services.

“It’s essentially a giant ‘Keep Out’ sign for prospective individuals looking to utilize the visa process to be able to come to the United States and fill these roles and provide these services,” said Laura Flores-Perilla, an attorney with the Justice Action Center, a Los Angeles-based immigration litigation group representing the coalition in its lawsuit.

“It's not just going to hurt these individuals who have this pathway to do this, but it's also going to hurt employers within the United States,” Flores-Perilla said.

Although the fee only applies to new visa applicants, many international teachers are feeling less welcomed to work and live in the states. A.F., an international elementary school teacher in the West Contra Costa Unified School District, said many teachers are still concerned the federal government will announce new policy changes that could force them to leave the U.S.

“I feel like it's a form of discrimination to impose [a] $100,000 fee for teachers,” A.F. said.

A.F., who is currently on an H-1B visa, asked to only give his initials because he fears speaking publicly will affect his ability to receive a green card in the future. He immigrated from the Philippines to California five years ago on a J-1 visa before transferring to an H-1B visa at the beginning of 2025. J-1 visas allow visitors to temporarily stay in the U.S. to participate in certain programs, including teaching, studying, conducting research and more, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

A.F. said the district previously paid for all of his immigration costs for his H-1B visa, which amounted to more than $3,700 for processing fees and an immigration attorney.

The future is uncertain for H-1B visa hopefuls

H.R., a physical education teacher in West Contra Costa who works on a short-term J-1 visa, said he moved his family from Mexico to the U.S. three years ago to work at one of the district’s high schools because he felt it would be safer to raise his daughter in the U.S. H.R. requested to use only his initials because he doesn’t want to jeopardize his ability to apply for the H-1B visa in the future.

“My biggest reason [for moving] is my daughter,” he said. “Me and my wife decided that it would be a good chance for her [and] a big opportunity to learn the language and to grow up in a different environment.”

H.R. can’t apply for the H-1B visa because he missed the deadline and West Contra Costa Unified is now unlikely to pay for his immigration fees. After his visa expires in June 2026, H.R. will move back to Mexico with his family and reapply for the J-1 visa in hopes of returning to California.

“Everybody says here that they need teachers in California … but they don't want to do anything to [help us stay] here,” H.R. said.

At the Los Angeles Unified School District, spokesperson Christy Hagen said in an email to CalMatters that the recent visa changes have not yet impacted the school’s hiring of educators on H-1B visas. Hagen said the district’s immigration experts were “still evaluating the effect of this order.”

Maria Miranda, a representative for United Teachers Los Angeles — the union for Los Angeles Unified teachers — said the district had, as of mid-November, not provided any guidance to its educators or schools on how H-1B visa hopefuls would be supported.

Flores-Perilla, the attorney bringing the lawsuit against the Trump administration, says no hearings have been set in their case yet. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has now also brought a lawsuit over the $100,000 fee, arguing that the proclamation overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and harms U.S. employers.

For now, districts will have to wait on the results of either lawsuit to potentially see some relief in immigration costs.

“It's absolutely unfeasible to be able to pay this fee [and] to be able to actually bring in prospective employees in their fields and industries, so it's going to hurt everyone,” Flores-Perilla said.

The Trump administration is proposing new rules that would further tighten its grip on who's allowed into the U.S., asking visitors from several dozen countries that benefit from visa-free travel to hand over their social media history and other personal information.

The new conditions were unveiled in a notice from the Department of Homeland Security earlier this week and are open for public comment and review for 60 days before going into effect.

The proposed measure applies to citizens from the 42 countries that belong to the visa waiver program and currently don't require visas for tourist or business visits to the U.S. Those foreign citizens would now have to submit five years' worth of their social media activity to be considered for entry.

They'd also have to provide emails they have used for the past 10 years, as well as phone numbers and home addresses of immediate family members. Officials would also be able to scrutinize IP addresses and metadata from electronically submitted photos.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the mandatory social media requirement is designed to comply with President Donald Trump's January executive order ""to protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes."" However, they have not defined what type of online activity may constitute a threat.

Under the current visa waiver program, tourists can bypass the visa application process, which can take months to years. Instead, they pay $40 and submit an online application using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA. It's accessible to citizens of U.S. allied countries, including Australia, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. But that system may also get an overhaul if the latest changes take effect. The notice proposes eliminating online applications, moving to a mobile-only platform.

This is the latest step in the Trump administration's escalation of restrictions and surveillance of international travelers, foreign students and immigrants. In June, the State Department announced it will begin reviewing the social media accounts of foreign students. Earlier this month, the department instructed its staff to reject visa applications — primarily H-1B — from people who worked on fact-checking, content moderation or other activities, citing it as ""censorship"" of Americans' speech.

These latest proposed changes are not that different from those already in place for visa applicants, Marissa Montes, a professor at Loyola Law School, and director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic, told NPR.

""It's always been something that the government can ask for and has asked for in the past,"" Montes said. ""The question is, how will [ESTA applicants] be screened by CPB? Will it be something they have to submit ahead of time or will it be an officer at a point of entry? We still don't know how the administration expects to implement this.""

In the past, she said, such screenings occurred at the point of entry and that ""it's always been discretionary if the officer wants to ask for it or not.""

What is most troubling, Montes added, is that there are no explicit guidelines defining what qualifies as harmful to the United States.

""The problem is that when it comes to immigration policy and directives like this is that it's very broad and discretionary, meaning that the agent that is receiving this order has a lot of discretion to then interpret what can be viewed as anti-American,"" she said. ""But we have seen that be interpreted as anything that goes against the Trump administration or is going against a value of the Trump administration.""

Montes said she advises her clients to be mindful of not just their own online posts, but also posts they've liked, commented on and re-posted, which can be grounds for a denial or even a permanent ban from the U.S. For example, if someone has posts regarding casual drug use, or pictures of firearms, they can be viewed as a potential threat to the government. She said agents are also on the look out for posts that can be construed as pro-socialist or communist.

She cautions people not to eliminate their social media presence entirely, saying it's ""become a red flag"" for officials.

""Our immigration laws bar certain types of conduct because of immigration bias … so you really have to be careful about what you put out there,"" she warned. ""As I always tell my clients, if I can find the information, the government certainly can.""

Chop suey was once a classic Chinese American dish enjoyed on December 25 — a day when most other restaurants were closed — by Jews and other non-Christians.

These days, we tend to think of chop suey as a mishmash of stir-fried ingredients that emerged from immigrant communities in the United States. But its roots run deep, says Miranda Brown, a professor of Chinese history at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She wrote a 2021 article called ""The Hidden, Magnificent History of Chop Suey"" for the website Atlas Obscura.

""It's a dish that is chopped offal,"" she says. ""Lung, liver, tripe, kidneys.""

Yes, originally chop suey was primarily made of organ meats. Brown is quick to note that offal is flavorful, rich in nutrients, and was enjoyed widely until a few generations ago, thanks, in part to industrial meat packaging processes.

""It can be chewy, it can be buttery, it can be kind of rubbery,"" Brown says of offal's distinctive textures. ""For some people, that's really kind of exciting. Bouncy!""

The origins of the dish itself bounces back hundreds of years, she says, to imperial China.

""We have references to chop suey in Ming Dynasty texts,"" she notes. ""The Journey to the West, which is a famous novel [from the 16th century], has a reference to chop suey. You will find it on fancy banquet menus. A version of the dish was even eaten at the Qing court.""

When Chinese immigrants to the U.S. in the mid-1800s wanted to impress local officials, Brown says, they held banquets similar to ones back home, with 300-course meals that would get written up in local newspapers, in articles marveling over delicacies such as Peking duck, chop suey and bird's nest soup.

""All the bling foods that were popular when you had to [build] a good relationship with a person who had a lot of say about your life,"" Brown says.

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 restricted immigration heavily, but Chinese restaurants still spread rapidly across the United States. By the early 1900s, chop suey had become a cultural phenomenon, a beloved ambassador dish to what had been an unfamiliar cuisine to many Americans.

Louis Armstrong recorded a song in 1926 called ""Cornet Chop Suey."" The 1958 musical Flower Drum Song dedicated an entire number to it. And in the movie A Christmas Story, set in the 1940s and based on the writings of Jean Shepherd, a white, Midwestern, working-class family celebrates Christmas at a Chinese restaurant called the Bo Ling Chop Suey Palace.

""It was exotic,"" Brown says. ""It involves a little bit of adventure, and it is a name that people can pronounce.""

But by the late 20th century, chop suey had fallen out of fashion. Brown says she never saw it on menus in her home city of San Francisco in the 1980s, when she was growing up. By then, Americans had deepened their appreciation of Chinese food, thanks in large part to popular cookbook author, PBS host and restaurateur Cecilia Chiang.

Before she died in 2020 at the age of 100, Chiang told NPR she thought it was hilarious how so many Americans had believed that the contemporary versions of chop suey were authentic. ""They think, oh, chop suey is the only thing we have in China,"" she said in a 2017 NPR interview. ""What a shame!""

""I think for her, it had just evolved to the point where it was no longer recognizable,"" says Miranda Brown, whose own mixed heritage is half white, half Chinese. ""Foods evolve. I always think, if I met my great-great-grandparents, would they recognize me? Would they see elements of their faces in mine or my daughter's? And I would guess not. Something similar happened with Chinese food in America. When a dish leaves, a hundred years later it has evolved, a lot.""

And perhaps it's about time, Brown says, for chop suey's next evolution: to make a comeback.

You can see it in the skyline, the neighborhoods and the factories reborn as tech hubs. But under that grit lies unseen problems — polluted air, contaminated water, aging infrastructure and a city still dealing with the long-term effects of its industrial history.

Wayne State University's Grand Challenges initiative directly confronts these problems, serving as a call to action for researchers committed to making actual progress.

“We wanted themes that matter to Detroiters,” said Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation. “These challenges had to be connected to what communities tell us they’re living with every day — air quality, water, health and the environment.”

Among the four themes in the initiative, one stands out in a city defined by the Great Lakes, auto exhaust and environmental justice: How do we build sustainable environments that improve both quality of life and length of life?

Across Midtown, Wayne State researchers are seeking answers grounded in Detroit’s realities.

If there’s one message Dr. Carol Miller keeps coming back to, it’s this: water connects everything.

Miller, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, is a long-time leader in Great Lakes research. Her work shows how chemicals from everyday products — medicines, cleaners, cosmetics — move through wastewater systems before winding up in rivers and lakes. But when asked about the most important step toward a sustainable environment, she didn’t start with labs or technology. She started with people.

“To improve quality of life in Detroit,” she said, “the most immediate impact comes from raising people out of poverty and supporting the needs of their communities.”

When Dr. Miller focuses strictly on environmental factors, she points to issues that have haunted the Motor City for decades. “I would say the removal or mitigation of legacy environmental pollutants,” she said. “These cause a long-term impact on health and quality of life.”

That includes cleaning up chemicals left behind by old gas stations, dry cleaners and factories.

Air pollution is another priority.

“Transportation exhaust continues to be a huge concern in pockets of the city,” she said. “I’m confident that if that air pollution could be reduced, the length of life and the quality of life of people in those areas would be improved.”

Her research also includes identifying and tracking contaminants below our feet — in the soil, groundwater and the myriad of water infrastructure piping under Southeast Michigan. Dr. Miller’s group studies sustainable remediation that includes approaches to harvest energy from polluting sources. But her message never strays far: science only matters if it improves lives.

“One of the critical steps is greater use of the One Health approach,” she said. “We need to break down the silos between human health, animal health, environmental health and economic health.”

Dr. Kishore Gopalakrishnan, a research scientist in the Department of Biological Sciences in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, sees wastewater differently than most people.

Where many see something that’s thrown away, he sees nutrients, carbon and possibilities. “Our aim is to grow microalgae in wastewater so we can remove the nitrogen and phosphorus before it reaches rivers or lakes,” he explained. Those nutrients are exactly what fuel harmful algal blooms.

Then the algae become a resource.

“We can harvest these algae, and it’s rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids,” he said. “It can be used as a feed in aquaculture instead of relying on fish oil from wild-caught fish.”

His guiding principle is simple: “We need to rethink waste as part of a circular system. What leaves one process should be the input of another.”

Dr. Gopalakrishnan’s work also tackles microplastics and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS, and how contaminants move through the food chain. He believes the most promising solutions are the ones that follow nature’s lead.

“The most promising solution would be nature-based and circular. Systems that work with biology instead of against it.”",https://news.wayne.edu/storage/files/gc1-69371b2149558.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:21.256431
,North Carolina Environment,2025-12-12 19:23:37+00:00,BPR,"For Helene survivors, a stalled federal buyout program could spell financial trouble","Laura Hackett, www.bpr.org, laura-hackett",,,,,https://www.bpr.org/helene-recovery/2025-12-12/for-helene-survivors-a-stalled-federal-buyout-program-could-spell-financial-trouble,"“And the land's completely gone now.” Scenarios like these are why FEMA started the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.
Over the last few months, state officials have raised concerns about FEMA’s response time and its commitment to moving the program forward.
The North Carolina Emergency Management department has also been awarded roughly $19 million to manage and implement the Hazard Mitigation Program, but nothing can move forward without the agency’s final approval.
The agency also said it would be “factually incorrect” to report that the program has stalled.
“What I have seen and what I've heard from my colleagues is there seems to be a general hesitation, a slow down, related to hazard mitigation nationally,” Ray said.","Mary Lynn Manns’ two-bedroom home sits on a tranquil patch of land near the Swannanoa River.

When she moved in a decade ago, she expected to live the rest of her life in the house. Then, Hurricane Helene caused the river to swell nearly 30 feet high, flooding the foundation. Since then, Manns, along with many of her peers in East Asheville’s River Knolls neighborhood, have been unable to return to their homes.

“The foundations are in bad shape,” Manns said. “You can't just put up a house. And plus, we've had the discussion, should we do this? We're clearly now in a floodplain. Would it be right to rebuild that house? The idea of rebuilding in an area that's clearly a problem just doesn't seem like the proper ethical thing to do.”

When she purchased the home a decade ago, the location was not designated as a high-risk flood zone by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and her mortgage did not require flood insurance, she said. Now, the river bank has widened, encroaching further into the neighborhood.

One house just down the road from Manns now sits right on the edge of the bank. The floodwaters swept away the land, leaving a precipitous slope in place of the backyard.

“People had little gardens back here. There was land,” Manns said. “And the land's completely gone now.”

Scenarios like these are why FEMA started the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. The agency doesn’t want people to rebuild homes in a floodplain, where they're likely to flood again, so it offers homeowners the option to sell their property at pre-storm values, rebuild the home on stilts or relocate it.

But Manns, who applied for the program last November, is growing increasingly concerned about when – or even if – she’ll receive money for her property. Over the last few months, state officials have raised concerns about FEMA’s response time and its commitment to moving the program forward. The agency has not approved any buyouts yet, though the first batch of applications was submitted nearly 10 months ago. More than 500 applications, totaling more than $240 million in property value, sit stagnant, awaiting a sign-off from FEMA, according to multiple officials from the state’s emergency management office.

“We're trying to be as communicative as we can to homeowners who may be waiting,” Matt Calabria, the director of Grown NC, said at a November meeting. “The reality is we've submitted the information for so many of those folks and we don't have a whole lot of information to share other than to affirm, yes, we have submitted them.”

FEMA has awarded some of the $1.5 billion dollars it set aside as part of the Hazard Mitigation Program, but none of the money has gone towards home buyouts. The agency has awarded $466,000 to Clyde and $600,000 to Greenville. The money will support the engineering and planning costs for flood mitigation in both communities. The North Carolina Emergency Management department has also been awarded roughly $19 million to manage and implement the Hazard Mitigation Program, but nothing can move forward without the agency’s final approval.

State presses FEMA to move forward

This month, Governor Josh Stein wrote a letter to the new FEMA Administrator Karen Evans, urging the agency to “be responsive to the needs of North Carolinians.”

Stein’s letter also criticized the agency’s delays with its Public Assistance program, which provides reimbursements to local governments for Helene recovery projects like debris removal and road repair.

“Further delay of these approvals keeps communities and families in limbo, in some cases paying expenses on homes they cannot live in while they await word from FEMA,” Stein wrote, of the buyout delays. “Your efforts to begin and accelerate the program would greatly benefit the people of western North Carolina.”

FEMA declined an interview request with BPR, but wrote in an email that the majority of the applications “are currently ineligible” because they don’t meet certain program requirements. The agency also said it would be “factually incorrect” to report that the program has stalled.

William Ray, the Director of the North Carolina Department of Emergency Management, disputed some of FEMA’s claims in an interview with BPR.

“We do not have anything in hand that says that officially things are ineligible,” he said, adding that FEMA’s operations are moving slower than normal.

“What I have seen and what I've heard from my colleagues is there seems to be a general hesitation, a slow down, related to hazard mitigation nationally,” Ray said. He pointed to FEMA’s recent decision not to approve hazard mitigation funding in North Carolina’s Triangle after Tropical Storm Chantal damaged more than 200 homes and apartments as an example.

In the case of Helene funding, FEMA contends the majority of applications for buyouts are not meeting the “open space” requirement, which mandates that any property obtained through the Hazard Mitigation program remains as an open green space in perpetuity, with a “clear title, no deed restrictions, and assurances the property will stay undeveloped.”

On some applications, the state has asked for an exemption on this “open space” requirement. That’s because in the places where Helene caused roads to crumble away, the only way to rebuild the road is through additional land use, Ray said.

“That, fundamentally, is one of the challenges we're navigating right now. DOT may need a portion of a parcel of property for repair or reconstruction of a roadway that was existing due to a river change or landscape change,” Ray said. “There are areas where there's not a whole lot of options of where to put the roadway.”

Ray added that typically the state doesn’t face significant delays when trying to move projects forward.

“In past events, we have had much different interaction with our regional office and their ability to make decisions and kind of move things forward. So this has been a different experience,” he said.

Justin Graney, a spokesperson for the state's Emergency Management department, maintained that many of the pending applications are not asking for an “open space” exemption.

“Many of the applications pending approval either do not include properties caught between two Federal policies or a portion of properties that can be approved. The State continues to advocate for quick approval of these vital projects,” Graney wrote.

Meanwhile, rent and mortgage bills stack up

As this back and forth between the state government and FEMA continues, more than 500 damaged properties in Western North Carolina remain in limbo.

Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said he’s never seen anything like this.

“It is unfathomable to me that we're at the place where the federal government is dragging its feet so much and that we don't have any answers,” he said.

He’s worried about the impact this will have on disaster survivors.

“I fear for the homeowner that [are] waiting on these grants,” he said. “At some point, are they going to have to declare bankruptcy because they waited on the federal government?”

Mary Lynn Manns is worried, too. Right now, she’s on the hook for three monthly payments – a $900 mortgage, a $500 HOA fee and a $1,500 dollar monthly rent on an apartment.

“We're watching our savings just dwindle and dwindle and dwindle and we're going, ""Oh my God, how much longer can we do this?” she said.

The only reprieve in sight is coming from her HOA. Right now the association is in discussions about reducing the monthly by $300 a month",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/006bf74/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2Fe1%2Fd78d9b2c44b1b3060e58553b0d8f%2Fimg-4482.JPG,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:35.412510

David Stevenson stood in a circle of friends and colleagues in an Orlando, Florida, hotel lobby. Everyone but him wore a lapel pin that read ​“I ♥ Fossil Fuels.”

“You want one?” asked a conference attendee, offering me the pin with a smirk. ​“It can be a souvenir.”

Stevenson, with a soft wave, gestured to the man to leave me alone. I was the only credentialed member of a legacy news organization attending this gathering, covering it for South Carolina’s largest newspaper, The Post and Courier, where I worked at the time. One organizer of the meeting, the Heartland Institute’s 2023 International Conference on Climate Change, blamed the media’s ​“constant lies” for the ban on some members of the press.

But Stevenson, then a policy director for the conservative think tank the Caesar Rodney Institute, had personally advocated for me to cover the event. He favored transparency and had no problem talking to me for hours about his primary political cause: making sure no offshore wind farms were ever built in US waters.

The conference drew luminaries from the world of climate skepticism, from Alex Epstein, author of ​The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, to Judith Curry and Ross McKitrick, a cherry-picking duo of marginal researchers more recently known for authoring a controversial 141-page government report downplaying the effects of human-caused climate change for the Trump administration. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) gave a keynote speech, mocking Democrats’ climate concerns. She held court next to the hotel pool that night, smoking a cigar with leaders from major conservative think tanks underneath palm fronds swaying in the breeze.

Stevenson saw himself as an outlier there. He leaned over during one session to tell me, cheekily, that he might be the ​“only person here who believes in climate change.”

And yet, despite that belief, Stevenson has dedicated the better part of a decade to obstructing a source of clean energy that can help replace the fossil fuels that are baking the planet. In fact, that’s why he was at the Heartland Institute’s conference: to rail against offshore wind farms.

The following day, Stevenson laid out his case in an expansive and mostly empty ballroom. It’s too expensive, he argued from a lectern, and the United States was not effectively assessing its environmental impact. He suggested a plan to get the public to care about this issue: putting whales front and center.

Stevenson stopped short of blaming wind companies for the spate of whale carcasses that had washed up on New Jersey and New York beaches just weeks prior. He agreed with the scientific evidence that ​“vessel strikes”—not wind development—were the biggest threat in that region. Still, the potential for harm to whales could be a powerful tool in federal court, he speculated, as well as in the court of public opinion.

At the time, Biden officials were approving new offshore wind projects at ​“breakneck speed.” Republican opposition was somewhat scant; GOP lawmakers in deep-red South Carolina had just put forth a pro–offshore wind bill. However, nuclear power—the energy sector Stevenson wanted to see advance—appeared to be on the downswing, with many US facilities having recently shuttered.

We parted ways after two days together at the conference, and I ultimately decided not to write a story about Stevenson. He seemed like little more than a gadfly to an increasingly powerful, multibillion-dollar offshore wind industry. I didn’t think much of it when he told me at the time that the industry would ​“crumble” before it even reached South Carolina.

I should have believed him; Stevenson was right.

The once high-flying offshore wind industry has been brought to its knees this year by President Donald Trump. In just the past few months, the Trump administration halted a nearly finished wind farm, clawed back $679 million in offshore wind grants, and moved to cancel permits for three other massive wind farms. Multiple fully permitted projects have been shelved. New development in the US seems impossible.

The stakes are high, particularly for the Northeast, where offshore wind was meant to not only slash emissions but also lower power bills, shore up grid reliability, and revitalize down-on-their-luck port towns with well-paying jobs. Strangling the sector for four years will be a devastating blow to these hopes.

Trump himself has a deep disdain for offshore wind, sparked by his failure to block a project from being built within view of his Scotland golf course a decade ago. But there is perhaps no other single person more responsible for watering the seeds of offshore wind opposition than Stevenson.

A January 2025 study by a Brown University research group placed Stevenson at the center of the network of activists and political operators driving America’s anti–offshore wind movement. The data showed he had an outsize influence in galvanizing lawsuits and public protests against wind farms. The analysis also tied Stevenson to a larger web of ​“dark money” networks that are financially backed by the fossil-fuel industry.

“The Brown study actually was fairly accurate about writing down all the people involved.…I was probably the common denominator for those groups,” Stevenson told me earlier this year.

Stevenson doesn’t fit into the neat box of being a climate denier. He doesn’t think we should continue burning fossil fuels forever. Instead, he’s someone who seeks to block certain solutions that address climate change, for reasons of his own—namely, ​“affordable and reliable” energy sources like nuclear and solar are better options, in his view. But scholars I spoke to about this discordance weren’t surprised at all.

“Outright climate denying seems to be decreasing,” said Alaina Kinol, a PhD candidate at Northeastern University who studies resistance to climate policy. ​“What we’re seeing more is obstruction,” she added, “and tactics that delay action.”

Stevenson, now 75, describes himself as ​“a lifelong conservationist.”

In the driveway of his Lewes, Delaware, home sits the hybrid vehicle he often drives to a nearby beach. Solar panels glint atop the roof, which Stevenson custom-designed in 2013 to be at the ​“optimum angle” to soak up the sun. A framed newspaper article about one of his cross-country bike rides hangs on the wall of his home office, nestled alongside photos of his seven children and 19 grandchildren.

His career has intersected with clean energy—and even wind—at various points.

While working for DuPont in the 1980s, Stevenson helped the chemical giant develop the long-lasting coatings used to make first-generation solar panels and wind turbine blades. In 1999, after leaving the company, he started his own construction business and acquired certifications in energy efficiency and home weatherization. He said he eventually co-founded the Delaware Green Building Council to promote this kind of work.

But despite Stevenson’s environmentally minded career and interests, he’s built a reputation as someone dedicated to preventing, rather than enabling, renewable energy.

After selling his construction business to one of his sons, Stevenson became interested in shaping state policies. A self-described libertarian, he found a home around 2010 at the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Delaware affiliate of the State Policy Network, which the Brown University researchers call ​“the nation’s most prominent network of conservative state-level think tanks.”

According to the DC-based research firm Energy Policy Institute, CRI is among a half dozen ​“front groups” backed by fossil-fuel interests that regularly attack renewable energy in their local regions.

For a few years, Stevenson worked on a variety of issues at CRI, from data centers and solid-state fuel cells to pipeline infrastructure and Delaware’s carbon-emissions fee. His initial brush with offshore wind came in 2010, when he sent a measured letter to the Obama administration regarding Bluewater Wind, the first proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware. He voiced opposition to wind tax credits but acknowledged ​“one of the benefits of windmills” is how quickly they can be built.

It wasn’t until 2017 that he focused deeply on offshore wind, and by then his stance on the energy source was more firmly negative.

Plans for Skipjack Wind Farm—a 966-megawatt Danish-led project slated for waters off Maryland’s coastline with onshore stations in Delaware—were advancing quickly. They took Stevenson by surprise. ​“My initial response was just the high cost,” he recalled, though he also worried about the turbines ruining the ​“pristine view.”

The project was led by Ørsted, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind, which had bought the lease from the developers of Bluewater Wind. Stevenson said he tried to enlist help to fight the company, turning to Washington connections he’d forged during his time serving on Trump’s first transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.

“I knew a lot of people; we had a lot of conversations,” Stevenson recalled. ​“They told me that I was nuts for taking on offshore wind.”

At the time, Trump officials were actively backing the sector. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke described himself as ​“very bullish on offshore wind” and executed key lease auctions put forth by the Obama administration—first near North Carolina, then near Massachusetts. Anti-wind policies wouldn’t emerge until the latter half of Trump 1.0, when Zinke’s successor, David Bernhardt, began slow-walking federal permits for offshore projects.

Stevenson received little response from his Washington connections. Undeterred, he simply led an anti-wind campaign on his own.

He attended town hall meetings and submitted public comments. He and fellow residents of local coastal communities organized against the wind project under the name Save Our Beach View, mailing over 35,000 letters and posting constantly to Facebook.

The messages contained several misleading statements. Independent journalist Michael Thomas reported that the letters, for example, ​“falsely claimed that the project could cause coastal residents’ property values to drop by between 20% and 30%; power costs could rise by 400%; key industries like tourism could see their revenues fall by 50%.”

Nevertheless, Stevenson’s efforts delayed the permitting process for an onshore substation, which in turn delayed wind turbine construction off the Delmarva coast from a planned 2022 start date to 2026 at the earliest. In January of this year, days after Trump took office for his second term, Ørsted moved to refinance the project, likely kicking it even further down the road.

Ultimately, Stevenson said, he ​“won the battle.”

In 2019, emboldened by his win against Skipjack Wind, Stevenson started searching on social media platforms and in news articles for the names of other residents across the Northeast who were resisting offshore wind farms. He reached out to some of them by phone—“just cold-called them,” he said with a laugh.

He found that there were plenty of individuals, as well as some small groups, protesting with little experience. For example, a handful of activists known as Protect Our Coast NJ didn’t know how to establish themselves as a nonprofit entity. Stevenson said he helped them do it.

Stevenson also started to organize monthly calls among activists from different states. His reach slowly grew from Massachusetts down to North Carolina, with the idea of spreading the tactics he honed in Delaware to other states. What Stevenson would bring them—as the Brown University researchers put it—was ​“political power.” Filings show that Stevenson’s employer, the Caesar Rodney Institute, also accepted donations from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in both 2019 and 2020.

His network of grassroots activists evolved into the American Coalition for Ocean Protection, which made its public debut in 2021 with a press conference in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse. Four other State Policy Network think tanks had also joined by then.

There, wearing a blue sport coat and flanked by maps of planned wind farms, Stevenson announced that the Caesar Rodney Institute had set up a $75,000 legal fund to support residents along the East Coast who wanted to sue to halt offshore wind development. He publicly set a goal of raising $500,000 for the campaign.

Stevenson would later admit that while the coalition’s fundraising ​“did pretty well,” it never reached anywhere close to his financial goal. No matter. It was the coalition’s relentless messaging and coordination, not so much the money, that would become its greatest weapon.

In January 2023, right-wing media took an interest in whales. There had been a slew of marine mammal deaths along the East Coast in prior weeks, and conservative media put the blame on seismic surveys for the future offshore wind developments ramping up along the New Jersey coast. Fox News host Jesse Watters interviewed a leader of Protect Our Coasts NJ, a founding coalition member that Stevenson had helped become a nonprofit.

This wasn’t the first time the media had amplified baseless speculation about wind power killing whales. The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, had run a similar story in 2017. But in early 2023, the claims were getting attention from Fox, local news, and even the Associated Press.

Stevenson was in near disbelief when he heard Tucker Carlson, then a commentator on Fox News, mention offshore wind and whales in multiple segments.

Still, even then, Stevenson refused to repeat blatantly false claims about the sector’s impact on whales. He posted statements on CRI’s website that the exact harm to the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales by wind development was still ​“unknown” and told me that his official position was to ​“wait and see” what federal scientists find after investigating the recently washed-up whale carcasses.

I asked at the time if he thought the explosion of attention on whales and wind power would peter out. He replied that it would, adding that eventually all these newcomers would oppose wind farms because of ​“the economics.”

But if Stevenson didn’t personally amplify the message, he didn’t swear it off. Nor did he discourage the groups he collaborated with from peddling it. In fact, he nearly won an award for elevating the issue: In June 2023, his campaign against offshore wind was a finalist for the ​Best Issue Campaign award presented at State Policy Network’s annual meeting. (The nomination highlighted the fact that the campaign had prompted a US General Accountability Office report into the matter. That analysis, released earlier this year, found no evidence that the wind industry harms whales.)

Over time, the whale issue metastasized, coming to define political debate over offshore wind farms. Eventually, Stevenson himself embraced some of its more conspiratorial claims. In a statement posted to the Cesar Rodney Institute website in summer 2024, he wrote: ​“We have patiently waited for indisputable evidence that offshore wind is killing whales despite federal agencies repeatedly stating that no such evidence exists. It does now.”

The ​“evidence” was two documents posted online, neither of which had been peer-reviewed. One report, by the consultant Robert Rand, looked at the acoustic output of wind vessels in the US—during both seabed surveys and pile-driving activities—and claimed that the underwater noise levels were much higher than federal scientists had estimated and could result in hearing loss and ​“harassment” of whales. The second report, by a retired computer science professor, used correlation alone to link the timing of New Jersey whale deaths to local wind farm survey work.

Douglas Nowacek, a professor at Duke University leading a multiyear investigation of wind farm impacts on wildlife, discredited these conclusions.

As it stands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ​“there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause whale deaths. There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”

In fact, government data overwhelmingly links whales’ deaths to other causes. For nearly a decade, agencies have carefully documented humpbacks in the North Atlantic washing ashore at an increasing rate. The species is not endangered, but in 2016, its plummeting population warranted a government-assigned designation: an ​“unusual mortality event.”

In this ongoing phenomena, 40 percent of the dead humpback whales autopsied by experts revealed injuries that only vessels or fishing gear could inflict. The rest, according to government data, were too decomposed to determine the cause of death. Scientists generally agree that climate change, which is driving up ocean temperatures and pushing whale prey farther north, could also be playing a role in the die-off. The whales are expending more energy than ever just to catch a meal. Some juveniles have washed up emaciated.

I asked Stevenson, soon after Trump’s second inauguration, if he still trusted NOAA’s ability to objectively assess the impact of turbine development on whales, and he was clear: ​“No.”

Trump wasted no time coming after offshore wind when he took office in January 2025. On day one, he issued an anti-wind executive order that paused all permitting activity, and derided the installations as ​“big” and ​“ugly” to an indoor stadium full of supporters.

For Stevenson and a dozen others in his influential cohort, the executive order was a good step—but it wasn’t enough to simply block new projects from advancing. In February, they petitioned Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to issue stop-work orders to the installations already being built, alleging that the projects posed a risk to whales. This piggybacked off legal complaints guided by Stevenson and coalition members against Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, South Fork Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1.

And it wasn’t long before the Trump administration tried to give the Stevenson-led coalition what it wanted. All five of the offshore wind projects under construction in US waters either have been delayed by recent stop-work orders or are reportedly under threat of receiving one.

Some in the coalition opposed such moves, recognizing that stopping projects already underway would raise energy costs. Steve Haner, a senior fellow at the Virginia-based conservative think tank Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, refused to endorse Stevenson’s petition to pause the five projects under construction—objecting especially to halting America’s largest project, a 2.5-gigawatt wind farm being built off the Virginia coast.

Under a hypothetical cancellation, according to Haner, ​“the ratepayers are on the hook” for the billions in sunk costs.

Empire Wind, one of the two projects ordered to pause this year, has since resumed construction—but only after the developer, Norwegian energy firm Equinor, launched a monthlong lobbying blitz. According to Norway’s largest newspaper, the company mobilized ​“500 phone calls and meetings”—an effort employees dubbed ​“Operation Gandalf”—which helped secure a reversal from Trump.

Still, Stevenson pushed for more wins, advocating for a complete overhaul of the Interior Department’s approval process for wind. In May, he penned another letter with some coalition members to Burgum requesting those changes.

At the time Trump was reelected, BloombergNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 gigawatts if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term.

Today, with tax credits already sent to an early grave and no new permits issued, that prediction has fallen off a cliff. BNEF downgraded its projection two months ago to just 6 gigawatts. In other words, Trump’s assault has been so effective that it’s likely no new offshore wind farms will be built here for the next decade—save for the five already under construction.

Opponents of the sector have won the war on wind in the near term. “They are clearly feeling emboldened by Donald Trump,” said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University who led the study that placed Stevenson at the heart of America’s anti-wind movement.

It’s not just Trump: Over the past year, more Republicans have grown verbally hostile to offshore wind. Burgum has played up reliability concerns, which lack evidence, and raised alarm bells about the impact to tourism and fishing, while peddling false claims that climate change predictions were overblown. This fall, the defeated Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, Jack Ciattarelli, made banishing wind farms a core agenda item, selling anti-wind tote bags and koozies on his campaign website.

Under Trump, government officials are rolling out more eyebrow-raising narratives—ones that go beyond whales—for halting wind projects. Some defy science and logic, like Burgum’s claims that New England’s Revolution Wind, the other project paused by Trump, makes the US vulnerable to underwater drone attacks. (A federal judge has since lifted the stop work order.)

Kinol, the Northeastern University researcher, says these kinds of narratives fit under the umbrella of ​“climate obstruction.” The term, she said, describes ​“the intentional use of misleading, misinforming, or misdirecting narratives to slow or prevent climate action.”

The concept has been around since the 1990s, when scholars first investigated the American Petroleum Institute’s downplaying of climate change. But as the debate about climate change—and what to do about it—evolved, so did the opposition. Kinol said talking points that preach wind farms as bad news for whales or national security are ​“a known and studied strategy.”

“This is an example of ​‘downside emphasis.’…A wind farm opponent emphasizes the downsides of renewable energy,” said Kinol. ​“The reason why it’s a well-known tactic of obstruction is because the same emphasis on protecting species is not present for the same groups when they’re talking about fossil-fuel build-out.”

These kinds of arguments are ​“disingenuous,” said Kinol, and ultimately in service of a phenomena she and her colleagues call ​“climate delay.”

Stevenson is one example of what is now a clear trend: The denial of climate change is being steadily replaced by attacks on solutions to address it. This twist is detailed in a new book written and edited by Roberts and three colleagues titled ​Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment. The book came out in early fall, just in time for its authors to witness their ideas play out in real life, with a decade-long delay of US offshore wind farm development now becoming reality.

Nowadays, Stevenson seems to have mixed emotions about his achievements. On two of our most recent phone calls, his tenor had changed.

“​Well, I think it was the right move,” he said in early fall, referring to the Trump administration’s stop-work order pausing the building of Revolution Wind, which was still in effect when we spoke. ​“But it is not something I’m going to dance around the table happy about, because there are people that get hurt by this, that are losing their jobs.”

All his efforts have ​“paid off,” he said. America’s elevated reliance on cheap natural gas—which, when burned, releases fewer carbon emissions than coal—was ​“better policy” for now. He views gas as an essential bridge fuel until nuclear, geothermal, and solar can be built. But he expressed some ​“disappointment” that Trump has increasingly gone after solar and wants to now expand coal production.

Republican moderates in Washington have expressed similar sentiments. Meanwhile, utility bills, which Stevenson called his ​“primary motivation” for his anti-wind work, have skyrocketed in the Northeast and are projected to only climb higher if Trump’s policies continue to strangle the offshore wind sector.

Stevenson has increasingly drifted from the direction that other coalition members are taking. Protect Our Coast NJ—which first fanned the flames of misleading claims about whales—has embarked on a different disinformation campaign: spreading the false idea that offshore wind cables cause cancer. Embracing outlandish claims, whether it’s whale-killing ​“windmills” or cancer-causing cables, is a broader trend among Republicans who buy into conspiracy theories with their party’s rise to power.

Conspiratorial sentiments are plaguing other clean energy sectors, too, from exaggerated claims of bird-killing onshore turbines to markedly false statements about toxic solar panels. Anti-renewables talking points circulate online, penetrate town hall meetings, and are taken up by groups pushing back against renewables now more than ever. A June study released by Columbia University identified 498 contested wind and solar projects across 49 states in 2024, marking a 32 percent jump in opposed projects, compared to just one year prior.

“You want a healthy amount of skepticism in a democracy…You don’t want 100 percent believers,” said Dietram Scheufele, a social scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies public perspectives on science and technology. But he warned that skepticism in the US is ​“on steroids,” pushing people from the middle into polarized political camps and toward conspiratorial thinking.

Stevenson, for his part, is stepping away from his work in the anti–offshore wind movement, and seems relieved to be doing so.

On our most recent call, in late November, he told me that he had resigned from CRI and that his anti–offshore wind coalition was, for all practical purposes, disbanded. (He remains a named plaintiff in four lawsuits opposing wind development.)

He’d rather be ​“solving the nuclear waste problem,” he told me. The energy source has long had a toxic-byproduct issue, not to mention cost overruns, which, to be sure, eclipse any expense associated with offshore wind over the long run. The Trump administration is looking to revive America’s nuclear industry, and that’s where Stevenson wants to build his legacy.

Even this work advocating for nuclear power could be seen as a form of ​“climate delay,” according to a popular research framework used by Kinol and Roberts. Nuclear plants put forth today can take a decade or more to start providing power; many of the proposed wind projects that Stevenson’s coalition targeted would have come online well before then.

Stevenson also told me that he is starting a new position. Soon, he’ll become the director for energy and environmental policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy. This think tank, like CRI, is part of the State Policy Network. ExxonMobil and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation are among the center’s funders.

I congratulated Stevenson on his new job. He thanked me. His tone warmed as he reminded me that we’d probably had a dozen phone calls over the years.

I said it was quite possible that his legacy would be as the man who helped crush a renewable energy sector that could have done much to address the planet’s biggest problem. I asked Stevenson what he thought about that view—that readers might see it that way.

“I don’t care if people hate me or not,” he said. ​“I’m doing what I think is right.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Stevenson-hero-uncropped.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:42.204864

To alleviate the pressure, many nations, like Romania, are turning to the renewable energy sector to bring emissions down while still providing the essential energy that the populace needs for everyday life. Europe has been a welcome destination for the sector, and new data reveals the astonishing turbine orders for wind projects across the continent.

Romania is the latest European nation to express its wind energy generation ambitions

The former Soviet nation has been developing two new wind projects that will provide remarkable amounts of clean energy to the nation’s grid in the near future. Data has revealed that wind turbine orders are increasing in Europe, with GE Vernova, a US-based renewable energy company that produces turbines for the international wind market, reporting substantial increases in turbine orders.

Romania’s clean energy mix has been growing at a steady rate over the past few years. In 2023, the renewable energy mix accounted for approximately 25% of energy consumption, and the government hopes to increase that to around 30% by 2030. Romania’s two new wind farm projects will certainly play a role in the planned expansion of renewable energy usage.

GE Vernova secures substantial turbine orders for two new wind farms in Romania

The US-based energy company has entered into an agreement with Greenvolt International Power to construct, supply, and, most importantly, install 42 6.1 MW wind turbines at the Ialomiţa wind farm. The new deal also calls for an order of the same number of turbines for the all-new Gurbanesti wind farm in Călărași county, positioning Romania as the latest European nation to drastically boost wind energy production on the continent.

GE Vernova is set to provide the essential wind turbines to power Romania’s renewable energy ambitions

Through the agreement with Greenvolt, GE Vernova will install and maintain the wind turbines at the Gurbanesti and Ialomiţa wind farms in Romania. The Ialomiţa wind farm will be capable of generating upwards of 252 MW of clean energy, while the Gurbanesti wind farm will add a further estimated 250 MW to the national grid.

Together, the wind farms will contribute 500 MW of clean wind energy to the national grid, accelerating Romania’s clean energy targets set for 2030. Both wind farms will provide thousands of ordinary Romanians with employment during peak construction, and generate enough electricity to power up to 110,000 Romanian homes and businesses every year. Europe’s proclivity for wind power has led to several nations embracing the sector, some for the first time.

“We appreciate the confidence that Greenvolt has shown in GE Vernova’s teams and our technology. This project reinforces the value of our workhorse product strategy and demonstrates our ability to add value for customers in Romania and across Europe.” – Gilan Sabatier, Chief Commercial Officer for GE Vernova’s Onshore Wind business in International Markets

Europe is aiming to increase reliance on the wind energy market in the new year

2026 is shaping up to be the best year in recent memory for the wind power sector. Europe has been embracing the clean energy potential of the wind power sector at a remarkable pace in recent months, as evidenced by the new Dogger Bank wind project in the United Kingdom, which recently reported that the foundation work for the project has been completed. A new year brings with it a renewed sense of optimism for the international energy industry, as the vast majority of nations, particularly in Europe, have big plans to increase investments in clean energy production.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/43-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:16.793660

The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, grant program funds infrastructure projects for communities vulnerable to natural disasters.

“Our towns spent years doing everything FEMA asked them to do to qualify for this funding, and they were in the middle of building real protections against storms when FEMA suddenly broke its word,” wrote Attorney General Jeff Jackson in a press release. “Keeping water systems working and keeping homes out of floodwater isn’t politics – it’s basic safety. This ruling puts the money back where it was promised so these communities can be ready for the next storm.”

In April, FEMA abruptly canceled the program, leaving many projects in North Carolina — including sewer upgrades, river bank maintenance and wastewater projects — to an uncertain fate. In response, North Carolina, along with 19 other states, sued the agency in July.

This week, the court sided with the states and ruled that the termination of the BRIC program is “unlawful.” The reprogramming or withholding of funds already committed to projects also violates the law, it said.

“This is a case about unlawful Executive encroachment on the prerogative of Congress to appropriate funds for a specific and compelling purpose, and no more than that,” the summary judgement stated.

In North Carolina, some of the reinstated grants include:

A $22.5 million grant to relocate a sewage station out of the floodplain in Salisbury

A $5.9 million riverbank restoration in Gastonia

A $5.4 million grant for flood protection in Hickory

A $7.6 million Resilient Wastewater Treatment Infrastructure project in Forest City

A $1.1 million sewer system relocation in Leland

A $200,000 watershed vulnerability assessment in Buncombe County

These firms produce most of the world’s solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles, and they are investing in complete supply chains that cover mining, manufacturing, and recycling. By helping other countries build renewable energy systems, China is not only boosting green power adoption but also shaping trade and industrial flows across the globe.

China leads this change with large factories, low costs, and careful planning. The government encourages companies to expand abroad, focusing on countries with high energy needs and supporting agreements to share technology. From 2018 to 2024, China controlled 80% of new solar, wind, battery, and hydrogen plants worldwide. Companies such as CATL and BYD dominate production, exporting billions in technology each year. Chinese firms cover entire supply chains, from mines to factories, battery plants, recycling centers, and renewable energy projects, ensuring efficiency and long-term influence. Trade agreements and political partnerships help these companies expand quickly, while technology sharing and faster approvals support large-scale projects.

The Global South is a major focus of China’s investments. Over 75% of projects are in developing countries, often aligned with the Belt and Road Initiative. China selects locations with clear policies, strict rules, and high energy demand. Many projects are joint ventures with local partners, sharing jobs, skills, and technology. Governments support these efforts with loans and incentives, while private firms lead development. These investments help lower energy costs, create thousands of jobs, upgrade grids, and promote industrial growth. China also adapts to local regulations, meeting requirements for labor, content, or training, which ensures contracts move forward smoothly.

In Southeast Asia, the growth is notable. Indonesia is seeing a $6 billion battery plant by CATL in West Java, producing 6.9 GWh annually and creating over 10,000 jobs. Malaysia has investments from EVE Energy and BYD in energy storage and EV manufacturing, while solar farms expand with GCL Technology’s support. Thailand benefits from Sunwoda’s $1 billion battery plant and Changan’s EV research partnerships. Tax breaks, fast permits, and local content rules accelerate projects, boost trade with China, and strengthen regional energy systems.

The Middle East is also transforming. Saudi Arabia has a $1.1 billion solar farm with Shanghai Electric, Morocco hosts a $5.6 billion battery plant by Gotion, and Oman produces solar cells at JA Solar’s $564 million plant. Egypt and Nigeria are pursuing hydrogen and clean energy projects. These initiatives reduce energy costs, generate employment, and advance national energy goals.

Europe is part of this expansion as well. Hungary’s Debrecen plant by CATL aims to produce 100 GWh of batteries annually, Spain hosts a $4.1 billion battery factory in Zaragoza, and France’s Douai plant targets 40 GWh by 2030. These facilities help meet EV electrification goals and provide local training and research opportunities, supporting regional industrial growth.

Latin America is seeing similar trends. Brazil’s BYD converts a Ford plant into an EV hub, producing 150,000 cars in the first phase, while Envision develops a net-zero industrial park. Chinese firms support wind, solar, and hydro projects, upgrade grids, and lower energy costs by around 20%, speeding the transition to renewable energy.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/10-4.png,N,,2025-12-12 19:01:06.849896
