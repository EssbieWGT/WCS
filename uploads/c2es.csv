Mexico’s updated NDC commits to a 50% GHG reduction by 2035 and reaffirms the 30% methane reduction by 2030, underscoring the critical role of PEMEX and the oil & gas sector.

Methane mitigation offers energy, climate, and public-health benefits and demands rapid deployment of technologies such as vapor recovery systems, advanced monitoring and the phase-out of routine flaring.

This month as negotiators met in the Brazilian rain forest for COP 30, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration announced a new emissions target under the Paris Agreement, called a Nationally Determined Contribution, to cut Mexico’s greenhouse gas emissions by 50% below the trend scenario levels by 2035. Importantly, the NDC also reaffirms Mexico’s goal of reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030 compared with 2020 levels, in accordance with national oil company PEMEX’s 2024 Sustainability Plan.

Mexico’s methane ambition on display at COP 30 Share on X

This move demonstrates Mexico’s firm commitment under President Sheinbaum to climate action, particularly methane reduction— one of the fastest and most cost-effective pathways to slow global warming. The oil and gas sector plays a decisive role in meeting these goals, contributing 8% of Mexico’s national emissions in 2024. These emissions stem mainly from hydrocarbon extraction, refining and transportation, where gas flaring and venting, leaks in pipelines and facilities, and the high energy consumption of refineries and processing centers remain critical pollution sources.

Methane reduction offers Mexico a triple benefit:

Energy efficiency: Capturing methane allows the recovery of natural gas currently being lost, improving the country’s energy performance.

Climate mitigation: Reducing methane emissions significantly contributes to slowing global warming.

Public health: Lower methane emissions help prevent respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, avoiding hundreds of thousands of premature deaths and reducing cases of asthma, lung cancer and heart-related illnesses.

In addition to an aggressive target, the NDC also lays out concrete actions to reduce fugitive methane emissions, curb natural gas venting and move toward eliminating routine flaring. The plan also promotes the adoption of key technologies such as vapor recovery systems, advanced monitoring and efficient flaring equipment, enabling faster, measurable and cost-effective mitigation.

The next steps will be critical to making these reductions a reality and nothing is more important than helping PEMEX access funding to implement solutions. Achieving these goals will require financial mechanisms that facilitate the adoption of technologies to reduce and capture methane emissions. Today, there are many sustainable finance alternatives form international markets and from multilateral banks that PEMEX can leverage to reduce emissions in line with its commitments. EDF is committed to working closely with leaders at PEMEX to help access this needed funding.

Realizing these methane reductions will take work but, through science, innovative solutions, and collaboration with organizations like EDF, Mexico can realize a safer climate and a more efficient energy sector.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//Offshore-gas-flare-GettyImages-1282961342-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 16:00:20.611180

The funding was announced along with New York State‘s plan to provide $40 million in new annual workforce development funding over the next four years to support advanced nuclear energy in upstate New York.
The NYPA funding will support Stony Brook’s inaugural Power Pathways Workforce Readiness program, which is designed to train students in both trade-based and advanced technology disciplines.
NYPA’s investment in clean energy workforce training is part of a commitment of up to $25 million annually, outlined in the 2023-24 state budget.
“Stony Brook’s mission centers on driving innovation, economic growth, and workforce development across Long Island, and throughout our great state of New York,” Stony Brook University President Andrea Goldsmith said in the news release.","Stony Brook University was awarded $644,000 as part of a $4 million funding initiative from the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to support the development and expansion of programs that prepare for careers in artificial intelligence, electromechanical trades and advanced power systems.

The NYPA funding will support Stony Brook’s inaugural Power Pathways Workforce Readiness program, which is designed to train students in both trade-based and advanced technology disciplines. The program is designed to offer certification and training in areas such as solar energy, drone inspections, geothermal heat pumps and high-voltage direct current power systems.

“By investing in the advanced nuclear workforce and expanding access to affordable, hands-on training in AI and advanced energy systems, we’re preparing New Yorkers for the high-quality, high-demand jobs of tomorrow – and ensuring every community can share in the benefits of a cleaner, more equitable energy future,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a news release about the funding.

NYPA’s investment in clean energy workforce training is part of a commitment of up to $25 million annually, outlined in the 2023-24 state budget. The legislation directs NYPA to advance renewable energy projects that strengthen New York’s electric grid with a mix of diversified energy resources.

Clean energy jobs expanded at more than three times the pace of the overall U.S. economy last year, according to a September report by Economy + Environment, an environmental advocacy group. Still, uncertainty about policy and the economy has slowed that pace, although clean energy jobs remain critical to the U.S. economy, according to the organization.

In New York, beginning in 2026, the state’s power authority will partner with technical high schools, community colleges, universities, labor unions and other workforce development providers to use the $40 million over four years to create training, retraining, coursework and apprenticeship programs for workers in the advanced nuclear energy field.

That includes efforts at Stony Brook.

“Stony Brook’s mission centers on driving innovation, economic growth, and workforce development across Long Island, and throughout our great state of New York,” Stony Brook University President Andrea Goldsmith said in the news release.

The following are two different lists. The first is a list of some of the most important regulatory developments and the second list details some of the most important legislation.

Regulations to watch

Rule: Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards

Agency: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Status: The agency is reviewing comments. The final rule will likely be published in early 2026.

Comments: This will be one of the most important regulatory actions this administration and in recent memory. There are numerous legal arguments to undo the 2009 endangerment finding and to conclude that the EPA doesn’t have authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. Hopefully, the EPA will include many of these arguments in its final rule. To learn more about the endangerment finding, please visit our endangerment finding web page. Here is CEI’s comment to the EPA.

Rule: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (would repeal aspects of the Biden 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule)

Agency: EPA

Status: The agency is reviewing comments. The final rule will likely be published in early 2026. Here is CEI’s comment to the EPA.

Rule: Repeal of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units

Agency: EPA

Status: The agency is reviewing comments. The final rule will likely be published in early 2026.

Comments: The EPA will likely finalize a rule that will make it clear that the agency doesn’t have authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. This would help put an end to the agency acting like the nation’s grid manager. Here is CEI’s comment to the EPA.

Rule: Updated Definition of “Waters of the United States”

Agencies: EPA and US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)

Status: The comment period is open for the proposed rule. Comments are due by January 5, 2026.

Comments: For decades, the EPA and Corps have tried to expand federal regulatory power to the point of regulating almost every water imaginable. In 2023, the US Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA finally helped to provide much-needed clarity on what waters are regulated under the Clean Water Act (what are “Waters of the United States” or WOTUS). The Trump administration must now develop a rule that is consistent with Sackett. Fortunately, the Sackett opinion, and the plurality opinion in Rapanos v. United States(2006)that the Sackett court embraced, helps to provide some clear guidance for what a rule needs to look like. The current proposed rule is a decent step forward, but changes are needed to make it consistent with Sackett.

See my recent piece “Some minimum requirements for a proper WOTUS rule” and CEI’s comment to the EPA and Corps when they sought initial public feedback on how to define WOTUS.

Rule: Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification Improvement Rule

Agency: EPA

Status: A proposed rule is currently under review at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

Comments: The Clean Water Act gives a voice to states and tribes when it comes to protecting water quality. Before the federal government can issue certain permits and licenses, a state (or tribe) must either issue a certification or waive the certification requirement. Some states though have abused this process known as Section 401 certification by looking at issues that go well beyond water quality and other issues beyond the focus of the Clean Water Act. Any new proposed Section 401 rule should undo the Biden Section 401 rule and help to address Section 401 abuse. See CEI’s and the Pacific Legal Foundation’s comment to the EPA in response to the agency seeking public feedback prior to the pending proposed rule.

Rule: Visibility Protection: Regional Haze State Plan Requirements Rule Revision

Agency: EPA

Status: The agency is reviewing comments from this Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.

Comments: The EPA was seeking comment on its Regional Haze Program. As CEI pointed out in our comments, “the Regional Haze Program, like most other decades-old programs administered by EPA, is now in need of significant course corrections if not outright repeal… No longer is the focus on improving visibility but rather to mandate the installation of costly control technologies on industrial facilities.” We concluded that the agency “should restore state primacy over the program as envisioned in the statute – up to and including respecting state determinations that no additional control measures are needed to address visibility” and urged it to “fully acknowledge the changed circumstances since 1977, and especially the declining emissions trends that undercut the case for further costly constraints under the program.”

Rule: The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule III for Model Years 2022 to 2031 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks

Agency: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (Transportation)

Status: The comment period is open for the proposed rule. Comments are due by January 20, 2026.

Comments:The following comes from my colleague Marlo Lewis’s statement on the proposed rule, “CEI strongly supports the Department of Transportation’s proposal to reset the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program. Under the Biden administration, industrial policy czar wannabes, regulatory rent seekers, and climate campaigners carjacked the CAFE program, turning it into a power boost for California and the Environmental Protection Agency’s unlawful agenda to ban gas-powered cars, restrict Americans’ freedom of vehicle choice, and price millions of consumers out of the new-car market.”

Rule: Notice of Availability of the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Draft Proposed Program: 1st Analysis and Proposal MAA104000

Agency: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (Interior)

Status: The comment period is open for the proposal. Comments are due by January 23, 2026.

Comments: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued a Secretary Order that would replace the Biden administration’s 2024–2029 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program with a new five-year offshore drilling plan that would greatly expand the number of lease sales. This new proposed 2026-2031 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program could include as many as 34 lease sales covering approximately 1.27 billion acres. Interior published its proposal on November 24 in the Federal Register. Here are CEI expert statements on this proposed plan.

Rules: Endangered Species Act rules

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations Pertaining to Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Interagency Cooperation Regulations

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Designating Critical Habitat

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat

Agencies: US Fish and Wildlife Service (Interior); National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Commerce)

Status: The comment period is open for these proposed rules. Comments are due by December 22, 2025.

Comments: These suite of rules would help with species conservation. Among the rules is the proposed repeal of the Fish and Wildlife Service’s blanket 4(d) rule. This misguided policy treats threatened species as if they are endangered. Here are some PERC resources on problems with the blanket 4(d) rule.

Legislation to watch

Bill: SPEED Act (HR 4776)

Status: This bill was favorably reported out of the House Natural Resources Committee and is likely to be voted on by the full House this year.

Comments: This is a bipartisan National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reform bill. The bill codifies aspects of the Supreme Court case Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County. Among other things, the bill clarifies that NEPA is purely a procedural statute, states that when preparing an environmental document, an agency“may not consider effects that are speculative, attenuated from the project or action, separate in time or place from the project or action, or in relation to separate existing or potential future projects or actions,” and as explained by the Committee, “the bill requires that NEPA claims be filed within 150 days after the action is made public and must be filed by claimants who submitted a comment during the public comment period, have a claim related to their comment, and have been, or imminently will be, harmed by the proposed action.”

Bill: PERMIT Act (HR 3898)

Status: The bill is in the House Rules Committee. The bill could be voted on as early as this week.

Comments: This bill includes numerous Clean Water Act reforms, including reforms to the Section 401 process discussed earlier and eliminating what are known as preemptive and retroactive vetoes of Section 404 permits by the EPA. These issues are discussed in my piece “The PERMIT Act is an important step for permitting reform.”

Bill: State Planning for Reliability & Affordability Act (HR 3628)

Status: This bill will likely be considered in the House as early as this week.

Comments: This legislation would require state regulated electric utilities to ensure the availability of reliable electricity in their integrated resource planning. This entails getting electricity from reliable generation facilities. Central to the definition of such facilities is “the generation of electric energy on a continuous basis for a period of not fewer than 30 days.”

Big picture on legislation

In 2026, Congress will hopefully enact numerous energy and environmental reforms. One issue that is already getting attention and will continue to do so: permitting reform.

This year, the House will likely pass two permitting bills, the SPEED Act and PERMIT Act. This will help to get even more momentum for permitting reform.

Permitting reform could be sabotaged though if there are efforts to package misguided transmission reform into permitting reform efforts. Transmission reform shouldn’t be a way to connect unreliable electricity sources to the grid at the expense of consumers or the reliability and resilience of the grid.

Proper permitting reform will need to cover multiple statutes beyond just NEPA and the Clean Water Act. Some other statutes that need to be amended include the Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act. My recent piece with my colleague Paige Lambermont “What permitting reform should and shouldn’t include” provides more perspective on permitting reform.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1413290008-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 15:02:18.072106

This gap in measurement practice matters because marsh elevation directly affects wetland survival as sea levels rise.
Overestimating carbon storage not only skews the performance of blue carbon credits but can also undermine the credibility of climate claims made by project developers or investors.
The study suggests incorporating correction factors that differentiate between organic matter that adds to sediment structure and that which doesn’t.
Their cross-disciplinary approach, involving geologists, ecologists, and modelers, offers a scalable model for refining blue carbon science without starting from scratch.","Coastal wetlands are often highlighted for their role in carbon sequestration and flood protection, but recent research suggests the tools we use to measure their performance may be oversimplifying the science. A new study led by researchers from the University of Rhode Island and University of North Florida has found that a significant portion of the organic matter measured in marsh sediments may not actually contribute to either long-term carbon storage or marsh elevation gain.

The core issue? Standard blue carbon accounting methods often treat all organic material in sediment samples as if it has the same impact on carbon storage and marsh stability. But according to the researchers, some organic matter—especially material dissolved in sediment porewater or bound within mineral structures—has negligible volume and does not help marshes build up elevation over time.

This gap in measurement practice matters because marsh elevation directly affects wetland survival as sea levels rise. If elevation is overestimated, the projected resilience of these ecosystems—and the climate mitigation projects built around them—may not match reality. That has downstream implications for restoration project planning, credit valuations in carbon markets, and climate adaptation investments.

Impacts on Carbon Markets, Project Risk, and Coastal Infrastructure

For sectors involved in carbon finance, coastal engineering, and environmental risk analytics, these findings point to a need for more precise carbon modeling. Overestimating carbon storage not only skews the performance of blue carbon credits but can also undermine the credibility of climate claims made by project developers or investors.

Models used in wetland restoration, offset crediting, and risk forecasting often rely on assumptions that now appear incomplete. If dissolved or non-volume-contributing organic matter is included in sediment data without correction, projections of marsh resilience and storage capacity may be inflated. The study suggests incorporating correction factors that differentiate between organic matter that adds to sediment structure and that which doesn’t.

This nuance could drive the next generation of verification protocols, monitoring technologies, and restoration strategies. It also opens new ground for service providers in consulting, measurement tech, and regulatory compliance to deliver more accurate, science-aligned solutions.

Rather than discard past datasets, the researchers advocate recalibrating them with updated methods—a path forward that balances scientific integrity with continuity for ongoing projects.

“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter concludes.
A bipartisan House bill, meanwhile, calls for a study from the departments of Energy, Interior and Agriculture into the impact AI data centers are having on rural areas.
The energy-focused agenda of the White House’s AI Action Plan focuses on cutting clean air and water regulations to accelerate permitting for the construction of data centers.","Environmental groups across the country are urging Congress to enact a nationwide pause on the approval and construction of data centers, writing in a letter to lawmakers Monday that a moratorium is needed to address the “massive” harms linked to building and operating the facilities.

The letter, which was led by Food & Water Watch and signed by more than 230 organizations, rails against the expansion of data centers across the country, fueled by a corporate-backed push for generative artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency products.

The organizations make the case that the “well-established” downsides of data-center expansion amount to “one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation,” demanding immediate regulatory action.

“This expansion is rapidly increasing demand for energy, driving more fossil fuel pollution, straining water resources and raising electricity prices across the country,” it continues. “All this compounds the significant and concerning impacts AI is having on society, including lost jobs, social instability and economic concentration.”

The letter lists a litany of staggering environmental statistics linked to the U.S. data-center buildout, including skyrocketing electricity costs, the exacerbation of climate change and the “enormous” and “unsustainable” consumption of electricity and water.

According to the groups, a tripling of data centers over the next five years could lead to the equivalent electricity usage of 30 million households and as much water as 18.5 million households consume.

The letter also nods to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s prediction in an Axios interview that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next five years, and lead to a 10-20% jump in unemployment levels.

“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter concludes. “We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.”

Congress has made some recent moves to address what appears to be a brewing public rejection of data centers due to surging energy demand and rising electricity bills. Last month, Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Dave McCormick, R-Pa., introduced a bill that would task the Government Accountability Office with assessing the efficacy of liquid cooling systems for AI compute clusters and high-performance computing facilities. A bipartisan House bill, meanwhile, calls for a study from the departments of Energy, Interior and Agriculture into the impact AI data centers are having on rural areas.

Still, the modest progress Congress has taken to get a handle on the data-center movement pales in comparison to the Trump administration’s full-throated embrace of the facilities. The energy-focused agenda of the White House’s AI Action Plan focuses on cutting clean air and water regulations to accelerate permitting for the construction of data centers.

Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch, said in a press release that the “sudden explosion of the Big Data industry” poses an “existential threat” to communities already grappling with “soaring utility costs.”

“The only prudent action,” she continued, “is to halt the unfettered expansion of this dangerous industry in order to properly examine all manner of potential harm before it’s too late.”",https://fedscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/12/GettyImages-2249621657.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 15:02:20.876819

TRENTON – The Rutgers University Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation (CAIT) in the School of Engineering is preparing to deploy and demonstrate hydrogen fuel cell technology as part of an innovative pilot project funded by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA).

Joined by project partners Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), the Center for Transportation and the Environment (CTE), Hyundai Motor Company, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Rutgers CAIT will lead this initiative that has the potential to enhance supply chain efficiency, invest in American infrastructure and jobs, and position New Jersey as a hub for advanced transportation technologies.

“Under Governor Murphy’s leadership, New Jersey continues to make impactful investments into proven clean energy technologies like hydrogen, promoting innovation, creating jobs, and improving quality of life for New Jerseyans,” said NJEDA CEO Tim Sullivan. “With support from the NJEDA, this pilot project will leverage expertise from academia, government, and the private sector to explore the potential of hydrogen-powered trucks, keeping New Jersey on the forefront of innovation and strengthening our long-term economic competitiveness.”

Hyundai’s XCIENT Fuel Cell Trucks will be used for this demonstration. The trucks will operate at Port Newark, a significant component of the Port of New York and New Jersey and the principal container ship facility for goods entering and leaving the Northeastern United States. The facility is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

“This pilot is another step in the Port Authority’s broader effort to look at every viable pathway toward a cleaner future for our critical infrastructure and operations,” said Christopher Diamond, Director of the Office of Sustainability at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. “Our ambitious commitment to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 brings with it a responsibility to help chart the course toward greater sustainability across our vast network, including the East Coast’s busiest seaport. We’re eager to take advantage of the region’s innovative spirit to examine emerging technology and accelerate the transition to a more sustainable future.”

Supporting existing drayage operations and supply chain logistics, the trucks will transport shipping containers short distances from the port to warehouses, rail yards, and the next leg of the longer freight journey. Today, this drayage, or short-distance transport of goods, is conducted by fuel-intensive, combustion engine trucks that are typically single-purpose for drayage, serving the same short distance for their useful life.

The project will proceed in phases, beginning with procurement of the trucks and hydrogen supply and the design of the fueling site.

Truck deployment and testing are expected to start in the beginning of 2026.

“It’s about making New Jersey an R&D and workforce training hub for hydrogen-powered transportation,” said Ali Maher, director of Rutgers CAIT and principal investigator. “We’re demonstrating how hydrogen can be integrated into real-world transportation and logistics operations, and we will investigate its potential to drive down costs, improve performance, and support long-term economic growth. This type of applied research is critical to proving the use cases of innovative technology and paving the way for its implementation.”

Rutgers University will manage the project and lead the research, workforce development, and performance validation efforts. CAIT will engage experts from the Rutgers School of Engineering and the Office for Research to identify and document opportunities to build on the successes and lessons learned from this pilot.

PSEG will manage the fueling operations of the six hydrogen-powered trucks.

“PSEG’s expertise in hydrogen across industrial settings well positions us to partner in this initiative at Port Newark,” said Jeffrey Stokes, Senior Director of Renewables Engineering & Technical Support at PSEG. “We’re proud to bring that experience to the forefront as we support truck fueling operations for the project. PSEG aims to drive reliable energy infrastructure while also supporting the state’s efforts to drive economic development.”

The technology works by capturing carbon dioxide from industrial facilities and injecting it deep underground for long-term storage.

Energy and petrochemical firms say Louisiana is particularly well suited for rapid CCS expansion and Louisiana Economic Development (LED) has positioned the technology as a pillar of the state’s industrial strategy, arguing it will attract major investment and diversify the economy. Several of the state’s largest planned industrial expansions, backed by ExxonMobil, CF Industries and Air Products, utilize carbon sequestration.

Safety Record Raises Local Alarm

Louisiana and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are currently in court over whether the state should be allowed to take over permitting authority for Class VI wells — the federally regulated injection wells used for long-term underground storage of captured carbon dioxide. The lawsuit centers on whether the state’s proposed oversight program meets federal safety and environmental standards, a requirement before EPA can transfer that authority.

Separately, Livingston Parish residents, including members of the community group Save Our Water, have sued to block Air Products’ proposed Class VI injection wells there, arguing that the parish and state approved early stages of the project without adequate environmental review or public notice.

These legal battles reflect a wider concern about whether Louisiana’s CCS framework can protect public safety. Critics often point to two recent high-profile failures as evidence that CCS infrastructure is unsafe, but both incidents stem from the nation’s legacy CO₂ pipeline network—a system that spans roughly 5,000 miles and was built decades ago for enhanced oil recovery. In Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, companies such as Denbury and ExxonMobil operate more than 900 miles of these older lines.

In 2020, a pipeline rupture near Satartia, Mississippi released an estimated 31,000 barrels of compressed CO₂ after heavy rains triggered a landslide that stressed the buried line. Roughly 300 residents were evacuated and dozens were hospitalized. Federal investigators later found that pipeline modeling failed to predict how dense CO₂ could accumulate in low-lying areas, and regulators issued one of the largest civil penalties in the history of the federal pipeline safety agency.

A similar alarm sounded in Southwest Louisiana on April 3, 2024, when an ExxonMobil-owned CO₂ pipeline leaked near Sulphur in Calcasieu Parish. Residents, not company sensors, first reported a dense white plume of CO₂ and water vapor, prompting a shelter-in-place advisory. Analysts estimated the release at just over 2,500 barrels, and it took more than two hours to fully shut down the line.

Supporters of CCS argue that these failures reflect the age and design of older pipelines and methods, not the safety of modern climate-oriented CCS projects.

Community Pushback Intensifies

The rapid pace of CCS development is also prompting vocal community opposition. Although a Dec. 3 LED rules hearing was not convened specifically to address carbon capture, residents used the public-comment session to press for transparency and stronger safeguards.

“This is moving too fast for me,” said one Ascension Parish attendee. “All I see now is pipes, pipes, pipes. It’s something we’ve never had before. My question is, who is going to be the one to ensure the safety of this? Who is going to let the people know what is going on? How is this going to be safe when y’all are rushing CCS?”

Louisiana’s Expanding CCS Network

Even with the pushback, Louisiana is advancing one of the country’s most aggressive CCS buildouts. More than 40 CCS or carbon-removal projects have been announced statewide since 2024, including ammonia and hydrogen plants, LNG facilities, power-sector projects and emerging direct-air-capture systems.

CF Industries

CF Industries has begun capturing CO₂ at its Donaldsonville complex. In Ascension Parish, an Air Products–led $4 billion joint venture aims to build what developers describe as the world’s largest low-carbon ammonia plant, with millions of tons of emissions routed for permanent storage.

Air Products

Air Products has also proposed a major blue hydrogen and ammonia complex in Ascension Parish designed to capture most of its CO₂ output, though the company has since indicated it may restructure parts of the project. Occidental’s 1PointFive subsidiary and Enbridge are advancing a regional sequestration hub north of Lake Pontchartrain to receive CO₂ from multiple industrial sites.

In a separate initiative, Air Products is developing an $8–9 billion low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia complex in Louisiana capable of producing more than 750 million standard cubic feet of hydrogen per day while capturing up to 95 percent of the CO₂ generated. Yara International plans to acquire and operate the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities, integrating them into its global distribution system. Air Products estimates the project would store approximately five million tons of CO₂ per year through a third-party sequestration agreement. Final investment decisions are expected by mid-2026.

Sempra Infrastructure

In Cameron Parish, the state approved Louisiana’s first Class VI carbon-storage well this year for Sempra Infrastructure, which plans to inject CO₂ beneath Black Lake near Hackberry. Meanwhile, Denbury—one of the region’s largest CO₂ pipeline operators—is developing storage sites in St. Charles Parish and proposing a multibasin transport network linking emitters across the state.

Heirloom Carbon Technologies

Heirloom Carbon Technologies, part of the federally supported Project Cypress direct-air-capture hub, is building two facilities in Northwest Louisiana designed to remove CO₂ directly from the atmosphere.

Woodland Biofuels

At the Port of South Louisiana, Canada-based Woodland Biofuels plans a carbon-negative renewable gas and hydrogen plant projected to remove up to 660,000 tons of CO₂ annually when fully built.

At a time when rising protectionism and national-security concerns are reshaping global supply chains – often away from Chinese suppliers – this may turn out to be a serious vulnerability.
But China’s “electro-state” strategy also gives it considerable leverage over other countries, which, as its recent imposition of export restrictions on rare-earth minerals showed, it may weaponize.","Chinese workers check solar panels on a hillside in Anhui province.

Another great transformation is underway in China. The world’s factory is fast becoming its first electro-state, with an economy increasingly built on clean energy, AI, advanced manufacturing, and control of key strategic materials. This new model is full of promise, though it faces major challenges.

China has established itself as the world’s undisputed leader in clean-tech manufacturing. It now controls roughly 60% of all solar, wind, and battery-equipment manufacturing capacity, and over 80% of global solar-module output. The scale of these activities has contributed to a sharp decline in costs, with solar-module prices, for example, falling by around 80% in the past decade.

Reinforcing this dominance, China has also gained a stranglehold over rare-earth minerals – vital to the manufacture of a wide range of high-tech products, such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, and AI-enabled sensors. Today, China controls over 40-50% of global rare-earth reserves and almost 70% of rare-earth production and refinement.

Meanwhile, China’s massive investments in strengthening its innovation capacity, particularly in AI, are paying off. China now boasts more than half the world’s AI researchers and some 70% of its AI patents, and has cracked the top ten in global innovation indices, such as that produced by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

All of this amounts to an astonishing feat of long-term strategic positioning. Every element of the unfolding global economic transition – from the supply of key inputs to the manufacture of high-tech goods to the design and financing of new industrial and energy systems – now depends significantly on China. Whether you are the United States seeking access to rare earths, or a developing economy in need of clean-energy infrastructure, you turn to China.

At least that is the plan. As powerful as China may seem as a leading exporter of critical minerals and technologies, its position perpetuates the dependence on external demand from which it has been trying to escape. At a time when rising protectionism and national-security concerns are reshaping global supply chains – often away from Chinese suppliers – this may turn out to be a serious vulnerability.

China’s looming demographic crisis compounds the risks. The working‐age population is shrinking, the old-age dependency ratio is rising, and the fertility rate has fallen to well below replacement levels. With fewer workers, income and consumption growth may slow, undercutting the government’s efforts to shift the economy to a consumption-led growth model.

Recent housing-sector developments do not help matters. In recent decades, real-estate prices soared in China, owing to factors like rapid urbanization, local governments’ dependence on land sales for revenue, and robust growth expectations. Housing thus became the primary engine whereby Chinese households increased their wealth.

But a combination of weak demand, overcapacity, and high leverage has caused China’s real-estate sector to tumble, destroying household wealth and eroding consumer confidence. The decline in prices may have resulted in more than CN¥3 trillion ($424 billion) in foregone household spending since 2021. Add to that slowing productivity growth and high youth unemployment (around 17.5% for people aged 16-24), and China’s middle class may struggle to serve as the consumer base and innovation engine the country needs.

China has thus reached an inflection point. It has built the machinery of an innovative, low-carbon industrial economy – one that could lead the global net-zero transition and the unfolding AI revolution. But if this electro-state is to be sustainable, China must make progress in three critical areas.

First, productivity must increase, not through more robots or factories, but through continued innovation, skills-building, effective management, and service-sector upgrading. Research-and-development intensity matters here: a 10% increase in R&D expenditure as a share of GDP could deliver a 7% boost to manufacturing productivity.

Second, China must find ways to accelerate the economy’s rebalancing toward domestic demand. To this end, efforts must be made to bolster household incomes and wealth, consumer confidence, and job creation, such as by fostering service industries – including care activities (elder-care, health) – and shifting labor from manufacturing and real estate into consumption-oriented sectors.

Lastly, China must manage external dependencies wisely. While greater self-reliance is essential, so are strategic partnerships, predictable trade relationships, and transparent frameworks for cooperation.

Whatever happens next, the implications for the rest of the world will be far-reaching. On the upside, China’s transformation is lowering the cost of renewables, expanding the supply of clean tech, and delivering new infrastructure investment across Asia and Africa. Already, China is playing a critical role in helping developing economies to leap-frog fossil fuel-based systems.

But China’s “electro-state” strategy also gives it considerable leverage over other countries, which, as its recent imposition of export restrictions on rare-earth minerals showed, it may weaponize. China’s techno-industrial advancement will always be viewed through a geostrategic lens. As the country tightens its grip on raw materials and high-tech manufacturing, others must decide whether to double down on cooperation with China, diversify their supply chains away from it, or risk being locked out altogether.

For Hong Kong and the wider Asia-Pacific, the message is clear: the era of low-cost manufacturing arbitrage is ending, and AI, green infrastructure, and digital hardware are the new frontiers of economic growth and prosperity. With China positioning itself as a supplier, designer, and powerhouse of this new economy, countries across Asia and beyond will need to adapt, engaging with China, hedging against bottlenecks, and re-working their own industrial models.",https://www.chinausfocus.com/d/file/202512/a204872865f76d6cce4b12102898bd14.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 16:00:16.714564

(AP) — South Carolina’s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.

The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.

The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.

Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper's costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.

Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.

The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) up the Broad River from Columbia.

Four executives ended up in prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.

If the $2.7 billion payment goes through, most of Santee Cooper's debt from the nuclear debacle would be erased, utility CEO Jimmy Staton said at Monday's board meeting where the proposal was unanimously approved.

“Our customers have been paying for these assets since 2017. It’s time they get some value out of that,” Staton said.

The deal terms include $2.7 billion in cash to Santee Cooper should the parties reach a Final Investment Decision (FID) and commit to constructing the nuclear units, plus a targeted 25% ownership share for Santee Cooper, with proportional capacity, once the units begin commercial operation. The ownership benefits could be adjusted depending on the final cost of completing the units.

Santee Cooper is the state-owned public power utility in South Carolina.

“Santee Cooper has negotiated a strong deal for our customers, including a cash payment that will significantly reduce the debt our customers have been paying, and future electric capacity they will receive from these units at no additional capital cost,” said Santee Cooper President and CEO Jimmy Staton. “Customer relief was one of two top goals when we began this process in January, with the second being optimized value to South Carolina. In addition to enabling completion of units that will generate over 2,000 megawatts in reliable, carbon-free electricity here, this deal also puts South Carolina at the front of the nation’s nuclear resurgence.”

Santee Cooper and Brookfield have been negotiating the MOU terms in accordance with a letter of intent approved by the Santee Cooper Board on Oct. 24, providing a six-week initial project feasibility period.

The MOU establishes a path to FID, estimated to take 18 to 24 months.

Additional provisions in the MOU are:

• A Feasibility Committee, comprised of two members each from Santee Cooper and Brookfield with Santee Cooper appointing the chair, will oversee the diligence process.

• Brookfield will meet certain milestones throughout the feasibility period and will provide monthly progress reports to Santee Cooper during this period.

• By June 26, 2026, Brookfield must determine initial feasibility and establish a target date for its FID.

• Brookfield will develop a draft economic development plan, also by June 26, that considers a commitment to using South Carolina companies and labor force, partnerships with K-12 and higher educational institutions, investment in workforce development, working with Veterans Affairs to provide opportunities, and engagement with communities and stakeholders, including Fairfield County.

• Santee Cooper will work with Brookfield on actions needed to evaluate feasibility, as well as actions related to detailed construction planning and analysis, needed to reach FID.

With surging residential and industrial customer demand, and with the support of state leaders, last year Santee Cooper recognized a potential opportunity to identify a third party who would complete the unfinished nuclear units.

The utility launched a competitive bidding process in January 2025, receiving initial expressions of interest from over 70 potential bidders and 15 formal proposals. Working with industry experts, Santee Cooper developed key financial, risk mitigation and execution criteria by which the final proposals were measured.

Completion of the two units could generate thousands of temporary construction jobs and hundreds of highly skilled, permanent operational jobs.

Michael Bennet wins his campaign for Colorado governor, his administration would support a climate strategy that’s struggled to gain traction under Gov. Jared Polis:

A statewide “cap-and-invest” program.

Bennet released the brief policy outline through his gubernatorial campaign on Monday. The platform calls for a market-based policy built around a declining cap on climate-warming emissions. Colorado already has established climate targets, which require the state to eliminate its contribution to global warming by 2050.

The state would then issue or sell a limited number of permits each year, allowing companies to release a certain amount of planet-warming pollution. Revenue generated in the process could help cut utility bills and support clean energy technology, priorities specifically cited in the platform published by the Bennet campaign.

“I believe Colorado can be a leader in building a future that protects our environment, makes life more affordable for our families and supports our businesses,” Bennet said in a new statement announcing the proposal. “To do that, we need to move beyond the status quo and embrace new, proven and innovative strategies.”

A potential shift in Colorado’s climate strategy

The platform hints at how Bennet could harness climate policy as one part of an affordability agenda, offering discounts on energy bills with revenue generated through a cap-and-invest program.

Along with other parts of the country, Colorado residents could soon face rapidly rising energy costs as AI data centers, all-electric buildings and electric vehicles contribute to skyrocketing electricity demand. The dynamic could lead utilities to rush to reinforce the electricity grid — and pass the costs along to households.

Meanwhile, Colorado power providers like Xcel Energy are already moving forward with a rapid transition to wind and solar. Those investments could improve air quality and insulate ratepayers from volatile fossil fuel markets, but they also set the stage for repeated rate hikes for residential customers over the next decade.

Bennet’s new climate plan also offers a sharp contrast with Gov. Polis, who has pushed back against a “cap-and-trade” or “cap-and-invest” strategy as governor. In 2021, for example, Polis issued an executive order claiming the approach could work on a federal or international scale, but insisted Colorado should focus on incentives, voluntary agreements and tailored regulations to cut emissions.

Since then, his administration has approved a limited carbon trading program to cut climate-warming emissions from the state’s biggest industrial polluters. Meanwhile, it’s attempted to shift other parts of Colorado’s economy away from fossil fuels with incentives, such as generous tax credits to cut the cost of EVs and all-electric home heating systems.

“They’ve tried to keep it at arm’s length,” said Pam Kiely, an associate vice president for the Environmental Defense Fund who’s pushed Colorado to enact a cap-and-invest policy. “We think that’s been a missed opportunity.”

Kiely said she’s glad Sen. Bennet has adopted a different view of the policy scheme. Her organization, however, hasn't endorsed any candidate in the Colorado governor’s race.

The official announcement included supportive quotes from Kiley as well as the owners of a solar-powered Pueblo steel mill and the business manager for IBEW Local 68, a union representing electrical workers in metro Denver.

It’s unclear if the broader business community supports the policy outline. Cynthia Eveleth-Havens, a spokesperson for the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, said her organization needed more time to review the proposal before offering an official comment.

An initial play for Colorado climate voters

Bennet faces Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser in the upcoming Democratic primary for governor.

Weiser’s climate platform doesn’t specifically endorse cap-and invest, but calls to continue aggressive efforts to invest in low-carbon energy sources like wind, solar and geothermal.

In a written statement, Anna Huck, Weiser’s campaign manager, said Bennet’s plan leaves a lot of “open questions.” She also honed in on the senator’s support for nominees now leading President Trump’s efforts to roll back federal climate policies, such as Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, a former fossil fuel executive who insists climate change doesn't amount to a global crisis.

""Any plan to address our climate challenges does not justify his votes to confirm Trump cabinet picks like Doug Burgum, Chris Wright, Sean Duffy, and Brooke Rollins, who are now dismantling climate protections and threatening our public lands,” Huck said.

The expansion will further revitalize the former GM facility.

Construction is expected to begin January 2026.

SHREVEPORT, La. – SLB announced it will invest $30 million to expand its operations in Caddo Parish, building on its transformation of the former GM assembly plant into a modern, climate-controlled advanced manufacturing hub. The project underscores the company’s role in the hyperscaler supply chain and its long-term commitment to Louisiana’s advanced manufacturing sector.

In addition to its 660 current employees, the company is expected to create 600 direct new jobs. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 744 indirect new jobs, for a total of 1,344 potential new job opportunities in the Northwest Region.

“Across the country, companies are searching for places that can deliver the industrial capacity and skilled workforce needed to compete in today’s economy, and Louisiana is answering that call,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “SLB’s continued investment in Northwest Louisiana reinforces that Louisiana is a place where global companies grow, succeed, and choose to compete at the highest level.”

The expansion will add new manufacturing space at SLB’s technology center at 7600 Antoine Blvd. in Shreveport, supporting increased production of digital infrastructure and data center equipment. The additional capacity will support higher production volumes as demand grows and strengthen long-term operations at the facility.

The company seems to be crossing off its last handful of things before it plans to unveil the vehicle on April Fool’s Day, just about four months away.

Tesla published three new positions for the Roadster this week, relating to Battery Manufacturing, General Manufacturing, and Vision Engineering. All three are located in Northern California, with two being at the Fremont Factory and the other at the company’s Engineering HQ in Palo Alto.

Technical Program Manager, Battery Manufacturing

Located in Fremont, this role specifically caters to the design of the Roadster to factory operations. It appears this role will mostly have to do with developing and engineering the Roadster’s battery pack and establishing the production processes for it:

“You will foster collaboration across design engineering, manufacturing, quality, facilities, and production to align with company priorities. Additionally, you will understand project opportunities, challenges, and dependencies; translate scattered information into concise, complete messages; and communicate them to every team member. As the business process development lead, you will develop, maintain, and implement tools and processes to accelerate battery manufacturing execution, achieve cross-functional alignment, and deliver highly efficient systems.”

Manufacturing Engineer, Roadster

Also located in Fremont, this role also has to deal with the concept development and launch of battery manufacturing equipment. Tesla says:

“In this role, you will take large-scale manufacturing systems for new battery products and architectures from the early concept development stage through equipment launch, optimization, and handover to local operations teams.”

Manufacturing Vision Engineer, Battery Vision

This position is in Palo Alto at Tesla’s Engineering Headquarters, and requires the design and scale of advanced inspection and control systems to next-generation battery products:

“You’ll work on automation processes that directly improve battery performance, quality, and cost, collaborating with world-class engineers in a fast-paced, hands-on environment.”

Developing and deploying 2D and 3D vision and measurement systems from proof-of-concept to deployment on high-volume battery manufacturing lines is part of the job description.

Roadster Unveiling

Tesla plans to unveil the Roadster on April 1, and although it was planned for late this year, it is nice to see the company put out a definitive date.

Musk said on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast in late October:

“Whether it’s good or bad, it will be unforgettable. My friend Peter Thiel once reflected that the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don’t have flying cars. I think if Peter wants a flying car, he should be able to buy one…I think it has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever.”

Production should begin between 12 to 18 months after unveiling, so we could see it sometime in 2027.

Tesla expanded its new Full Self-Driving program, which gives people the opportunity to experience the company’s suite, in Europe.

Tesla recently launched an opportunity for Europeans to experience Full Self-Driving, not in their personal vehicles, but through a new ride-along program that initially launched in Italy, France, and Germany back in late November.

People could experience it by booking a reservation with a local Tesla showroom, but timeslots quickly filled up, making it difficult to keep up with demand. Tesla expanded the program and offered some additional times, but it also had its sights set on getting the program out to new markets.

It finally achieved that on December 9, as it launched rides in Denmark and Switzerland, adding the fourth and fifth countries to the program.

Tesla confirmed the arrival of the program to Denmark and Switzerland on X:

The program, while a major contributor to Tesla’s butts in seats strategy, is truly another way for the company to leverage its fans in an effort to work through the regulatory hurdles it is facing in Europe.

Tesla has faced significant red tape in the region, and although it has tested the FSD suite and been able to launch this ride-along program, it is still having some tremendous issues convincing regulatory agencies to allow it to give it to customers.

CEO Elon Musk has worked with regulators, but admitted the process has been “insanely painful.”

The most recent development with FSD and its potential use in Europe dealt with the Dutch approval authority, known as the RDW.

Tesla says Europe could finally get FSD in 2026, and Dutch regulator RDW is key

Tesla said it believes some regulations are “outdated and rules-based,” which makes the suite ineligible for use in the European jurisdiction.

The RDW is working with Tesla to gain approval sometime early next year, but there are no guarantees. However, Tesla’s angle with the ride-along program seems to be that if it can push consumers to experience it and have a positive time, it should be easier for it to gain its footing across Europe with regulatory agencies.

Tesla Full Self-Driving performance and statistics continue to impress everyone, from retail investors to Wall Street firms. However, one analyst believes Tesla’s driving suite is “very close” to achieving unsupervised self-driving.

On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter said that Tesla’s recent launch of Full Self-Driving version 14 increased the number of miles traveled between interventions by a drastic margin, based on data compiled by a Full Self-Driving Community Tracker.

The data shows there was a significant jump in miles traveled between interventions as Tesla transitioned drivers to v14.1 back in October. The FSD Community Tracker saw a jump from 441 miles to over 9,200 miles, the most significant improvement in four years.

Interestingly, there was a slight dip in the miles traveled between interventions with the release of v14.2. Piper Sandler said investor interest in FSD has increased.

Full Self-Driving has displayed several improvements with v14, including the introduction of Arrival Options that allow specific parking situations to be chosen by the driver prior to arriving at the destination. Owners can choose from Street Parking, Parking Garages, Parking Lots, Chargers, and Driveways.

Additionally, the overall improvements in performance from v13 have been evident through smoother operation, fewer mistakes during routine operation, and a more refined decision-making process.

Early versions of v14 exhibited stuttering and brake stabbing, but Tesla did a great job of confronting the issue and eliminating it altogether with the release of v14.2.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk also recently stated that the current v14.2 FSD suite is also less restrictive with drivers looking at their phones, which has caused some controversy within the community.

Although we tested it and found there were fewer nudges by the driver monitoring system to push eyes back to the road, we still would not recommend it due to laws and regulations.

Tesla Full Self-Driving v14.2.1 texting and driving: we tested it

With that being said, FSD is improving significantly with each larger rollout, and Musk believes the final piece of the puzzle will be unveiled with FSD v14.3, which could come later this year or early in 2026.

Piper Sandler reaffirmed its $500 price target on Tesla shares, as well as its ‘Overweight’ rating.

The shorter days and colder nights, which demand reliable heating even in temperate latitudes, arrive amid increasing concerns about the country’s energy security.

The need for power has never increased this rapidly, as tech giants plan for metropolis-scale electricity to train their artificial intelligence models.

Data centers in the U.S. will make up almost half the growth in electricity demand between now and 2030, says the International Energy Agency (IEA). Driven by AI use, the U.S. economy is set to consume more electricity in 2030 for processing data than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminum, steel, cement and chemicals, according to the IEA. OpenAI’s data center plans alone will demand as much or more power than New York City and San Diego combined.

Add the reindustrialization of America, the electrification of transportation, and the retirement of aging and carbon-intensive generation facilities, and energy demand is increasingly threatening to outstrip supply.

Outage risk grows

“If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy,” U.S. Dept. of Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in July.

Without timely replacement of retired energy generation sources, annual outage hours could increase from single digits today to more than 800 hours per year by 2030, according to DOE calculations. Outage risk in several regions would rise more than thirtyfold, even if there are no retirements.

Power generation is only part of the energy security challenge. Transmission is another. Interregional transmission is sorely needed, says the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Significant interconnection queues and extended permitting timelines are creating challenges for the timely deployment of new clean energy. One common issue: the remote places that are favorable for wind or solar simply lack the transmission capacity to carry the energy into the grid.

China is actively focusing on transmission development. The New York Times recently detailed the nation’s 2,000-mile-long ultra-high voltage transmission line – equivalent to the distance between Idaho and New York. It’s one of 42 transmission lines in the country, reflecting a broader global trend toward building higher-capacity infrastructure to support clean energy. The transmission line is credited with helping accelerate China’s renewable energy transformation, cutting air pollution, and even adding nearly two years to citizens’ life expectancy.

Learning from the Texas Freeze

This February will mark the fifth anniversary of the Great Texas Freeze, a powerful combination of unusually cold temperatures and power grid vulnerability. Boilers failed, roofs collapsed and pipes burst in a deep freeze driven by a polar vortex that brought Arctic temperatures as far south as Mexico. At peak, millions of people were without power, mostly in Texas, unable to get heat or cook food. Damage and economic losses exceeded $130 billion in Texas.

“During the power grid crisis, all sources of electricity struggled during the frigid temperatures,” wrote the Texas Tribune. “The inability of power plants to perform in the extreme cold was the No. 1 cause of the outages.”

The challenges have been associated with a range of factors, including deregulation and privatization. Another factor was the Texas grid’s self-reliance in a country with regional grids.

The crisis could have been worse. Officials determined that Texas was less than five minutes away from complete grid failure, which could have taken weeks or more to recover from. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) ordered rolling blackouts to avoid it.

At this point, many readers are asking how the South can get so cold as the planet is warming. It’s a paradox, but with a rational explanation. The polar vortex disruption that contributed to the freeze may have been exacerbated by disruptive warming at the North Pole. Given that possibility, it’s smart to prepare for more instability.

Securing our needs

Regardless of causal factors, widespread freeze is a possibility this winter, and energy security could be at risk under any scenario.

My co-workers and I partner with companies to prepare for resilience during extreme weather and power spikes. We encourage leaders to ask themselves, Where does my business’s power come from today, and where will I obtain what I need to succeed in the future? What steps can I take to ensure resilience against potential shortfalls, grid strains and occasional utility failures?

For some companies – especially AI data center operators, the answer to these questions is colocation, shorthand for producing the power you need on the same site where you’ll be consuming it, thereby helping to mitigate the transmission issues. You may even sell some power back to utilities.

Colocation often leverages renewable energy as the power source. (In the future, small modular nuclear reactors or even smaller microreactors, with their passive safety designs, could be part of the mix.)

Additional recommendations for companies who are intent on securing their energy security could include:

Plan: Quantify your energy needs today and over the long term, accounting for growth, new power demands and expected energy efficiencies.

Back up: Design and install adequate power backup at both the local facility and central enterprise scale. Safely store energy from colocated renewables for times when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.

Anticipate hazards: Understand and mitigate the risks of fire, flood, freeze, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail and drought. Use hazard maps in your planning.

Invest in quality: Identify and only use products with third-party certification to ensure quality and reliability, such as solar panels that can resist hail damage and equipment that doesn’t have common design flaws.

Plan early and practice. Develop a detailed response plan for power interruptions, freeze and other hazards well in advance of an incident. Run the plan as a drill, at least on a tabletop.

Watch the weather. Meteorologists can predict vortex disturbances. Advance warnings give you time to execute your freeze plans. Make sure weather monitoring is part of your winter plans.

Our world is on the cusp of dramatic transformations in computing, clean energy and electrification. With demand putting immense pressure on supply, business leaders need to make sure their energy needs are quantified, their electricity sources defined and reliable, and plans for all contingencies – including Arctic weather as far South as the Mexican border – are thoroughly developed and practiced. Preparation creates resilience, the most important factor in any company's business success.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/69382cfdd7955f78ba12bcb7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-09 13:01:10.480011

Over 3,700 people signed a petition to “Stop the Construction of Michigan’s Largest Data Center in Howell” as of Monday morning.","The developers of a $1 billion data center in Howell Township withdrew a rezoning request for the project following months of pushback from residents concerned about the facility’s water use and impact on energy costs, among other issues.

The applicants are withdrawing the conditional rezoning application “after listening carefully to the community and giving this decision a great deal of thought,” according to a statement on the project’s Facebook page posted late Sunday.

“We believe the right thing to do now is to honor the current moratorium, which will give the township and its residents the time needed to develop thoughtful, well-considered regulations for any future data centers,” the Facebook post said.

The Howell Township board passed a six-month moratorium on data center developments Nov. 20.

With the moratorium in place, the township could have voted on rezoning land, township attorney Christopher Patterson told Planet Detroit Monday — but the site plan for the data center couldn’t have moved forward unless the applicant requested a waiver.

The developers’ decision to withdraw the application comes ahead of Monday’s Howell Township board meeting, where a hearing on the data center and a rezoning vote were scheduled. The agenda items have been removed, according to a statement posted Monday afternoon on the township website.

The developers may return when the moratorium ends, Township Treasurer and Zoning Administrator Jonathan Hohenstein told Planet Detroit.

“‎The communication from the applicant makes it sound like once the regulations are complete, they will resubmit their application; time will tell,” Hohenstein said in a Monday email.

Howell Township resident Cory Alchin told Planet Detroit the developers’ decision to withdraw the application is a victory for his many neighbors who oppose the data center.

More work is needed to ensure that data center ordinances “protect the health and safety of the township and its residents,” he said.

Howell Township resident: ‘We are setting a precedent’

The Howell Township project, from developers Stantec Consulting Michigan Inc. and Randee LLC, was planned for a 1,077-acre site of largely agricultural land north of I-96, roughly 54 miles from Detroit.

Stantec spokesperson Trevor Eckart declined to comment when asked whether the developer plans to move forward with the data center when the moratorium ends.

Ryan Van Gilder, whose family owns property within the footprint of the data center, did not respond to a request for comment.

Hundreds of residents attended a Sept. 23 Howell Township Planning Meeting that lasted for seven hours, with many raising concerns about potential impacts to water resources, electricity costs, and environmental impacts, WDIV reported.

Over 3,700 people signed a petition to “Stop the Construction of Michigan’s Largest Data Center in Howell” as of Monday morning.

The Howell Township Planning Commission voted not to recommend rezoning land for the project on Sept. 23, and the Livingston County Planning Commission voted against it Nov. 19. The township board has final say over the rezoning decision.

Data centers’ often massive water and energy needs have stoked fears in other Michigan communities over how the facilities could harm drinking water wells, pass on costs to other electric ratepayers, and jeopardize state climate goals.

The facilities’ electricity demands risk triggering an “off ramp” provision in the state’s climate law, allowing fossil fuel generation to stay online if there’s a capacity shortage.

Howell Township Assessor and Deputy Supervisor Brent Kilpela said in a Sept. 4 email to property owner Van Gilder that the project “is like winning the Power Ball for the local municipalities. Roads could be paved etc.”

Kilpela previously told Planet Detroit the data center could increase tax revenue by a factor of six or seven.

Township resident Alchin said people from 10 communities across the country have been in touch with Howell Township residents, sharing similar experiences of data center developers going into rural townships with ordinances that aren’t well designed and trying to rush through projects, Alchin said.

“We are setting a precedent for people to follow and have faith in, across the country,” Alchin said. “The key was that people kept showing up and kept showing up.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HowellRendering-1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 15:02:33.318134

The PERMIT Act does not eliminate environmental protections.","The Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act (“PERMIT” Act, H.R. 3898) reforms the Clean Water Act’s permitting process to reduce delays while still ensuring adequate impact analyses are performed. This bill aims to restore predictability, timeliness, and accountability to a permitting system that has become ineffective and lead to reduced energy supply and higher costs for Americans.

Ending Permitting Legal Limbo

One of the core problems with the Clean Water Act permitting structure is that agencies face few meaningful deadlines and projects can be stuck in the courts for years. Energy pipelines, power plants, transmission lines, ports, and manufacturing facilities can sit in agency review for years with no final decision. Even when permits are issued, litigation often resets the process entirely.

The PERMIT Act responds by setting clear limits on when and how court challenges may be brought. For approvals of state permit programs, for individual or general permits, and for verifications that an activity is covered by a general permit, any lawsuit must be filed within 60 days of the approval, permit issuance, or verification. Only parties that submitted sufficiently detailed comments during the public comment period may sue, and the suit must relate to those comments. In response to a successful lawsuit, courts may not vacate a permit unless there is an imminent and substantial danger to human health or the environment and no other equitable remedy is available.

By providing certainty to the timelines in permitting, the bill reduces the financial risk of infrastructure investment and lowers the cost of capital for building new projects. These lower financing costs on projects can be passed along to consumers through lower utility bills and lower prices for goods produced using that energy.

Restoring Proper Scope

The PERMIT Act reforms Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which governs state water quality certifications for federally permitted projects. This Section has been used to halt projects such as natural gas pipelines or power plants due to the overly broad application of water quality standards. The PERMIT Act keeps the existing outside limit that a certification decision may not take more than one year, but it breaks that period into concrete steps so developers can track where their project is in the pipeline and ensure that their investment does not sit idle.

Further restoring the scope of the federal government to a more reasonable level, the PERMIT Act also reforms how federal jurisdiction over water is defined. Interpretations of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) by the Biden and Obama Administrations allow expansive federal control over isolated wetlands, seasonal streams, roadside ditches, and dry land that may only hold water part of the year. This overreach forces otherwise local projects into years of federal review even when environmental impacts are minimal.

The PERMIT Act narrows that authority to its proper scope by restoring clearer limits on federal jurisdiction. This ensures that truly navigable waters remain regulated while preventing the federal government from federalizing nearly every construction project in the country. When fewer projects are dragged into duplicative federal review, infrastructure moves faster and costs fall.

Demolishing Duplicative Processes

The PERMIT Act streamlines duplication between state and federal regulators. When a state assumes authority under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the bill requires Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to act on that request within fixed timelines. The bill also requires the EPA to revise its regulations to encourage more state assumption. This reduces the problem of applicants being forced through layered permitting systems where multiple agencies review the same environmental impacts under different frameworks.

By limiting the ability of agencies to run endless studies after an application is submitted and ensuring that once regulators formally identify what information is required within the defined early windows, they cannot keep resetting the process with new demands later, the PERMIT Act reduces regulatory burdens while still ensuring that the necessary studies to issue the permit are completed.

The PERMIT Act does not eliminate environmental protections. It restores balance, predictability, and accountability to a system that has drifted far from its original mission. By breaking the government-imposed logjam on energy and infrastructure development, H.R. 3898 helps unlock America’s energy supply, lower prices, and reduce costs for American families.",https://epicforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty-images-AqZTVnZZ3xQ-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 12:01:51.796688

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing changes experts said would weaken reporting and monitoring rules for toxic “forever chemicals” known as PFAS.

Thousands of such synthetic chemicals are used in everything from nonstick cookware and waterproof clothing to firefighting foam and have been linked to cancers, thyroid disease, immune dysfunction and developmental harm in children. Previously, the Biden administration required all manufacturers using PFAS chemicals to report usage data by this year.

Betsy Southerland, a retired EPA scientist and member of the Environmental Protection Network, said the changes would extend the timeline and offer exemptions to some companies.

“What this new rule does is say, no, we’re going to give you at least another year,” Southerland explained. “Furthermore, we’re going to exempt many of the people who would have had to report their PFAS use.”

The Trump administration has also filed a motion to vacate portions of the EPA’s 2024 rule setting drinking water limits for the chemicals, seeking to eliminate enforceable standards for four different types of PFAS.

Southerland argued the agency is playing catch-up on determining what PFAS chemicals are in our environment and how dangerous they are to humans, noting that right now, scientists are able to detect just a fraction of specific PFAS chemicals in the environment.

“It’s taken EPA a number of years to just be able to monitor 40 PFAS chemicals in our water and sediments,” Southerland pointed out. “We need to know what other PFAS chemicals beyond these 40 we can measure for.”

King",,,,,https://www.dbusiness.com/daily-news/fords-new-european-strategy-includes-ev-partnership-with-frances-renault/,"A key element of the strategy is an electric vehicle and commercial vehicle partnership with France-based Renault Group.
While leveraging shared architecture for efficiency, Ford will lead the design and driving dynamics to ensure these vehicles are distinctly Ford.
“Our plan is about unleashing the Blue Oval,” says Jim Baumbick, president of Ford Europe.
Ford’s strategy for Europe is designed to navigate Europe’s evolving CO2 emission regulations, providing customers with a range of affordable, multi-energy options during the transition to electrification.
Aggressive CO2 targets on commercial vehicles unfairly penalize the small and medium-sized businesses that generate more than 50 percent of Europe’s GDP.","Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn today announced the next phase of its European strategy, reinforcing its commitment to the region for both retail and commercial customers with a strategy focused on agility, cost efficiency, and a sharpened brand promise.

A key element of the strategy is an electric vehicle and commercial vehicle partnership with France-based Renault Group.

The agreement includes jointly developing two Ford-branded electric passenger vehicles on Renault’s Ampere platform, arriving in showrooms in 2028. While leveraging shared architecture for efficiency, Ford will lead the design and driving dynamics to ensure these vehicles are distinctly Ford.

The companies also signed a letter of intend to explore the joint development and manufacture of Ford- and Renault-branded light commercial vehicles, leveraging common platforms to drive industrial scale.

“Our plan is about unleashing the Blue Oval,” says Jim Baumbick, president of Ford Europe. “We are leveraging strategic partnerships to ensure competitiveness, but we are obsessing over the product. These will be fun-to-drive, fully connected vehicles that stand out from the crowd.”

In addition to the collaboration with Renault, Ford’s strategy for Europe includes further strengthening its Ford Pro commercial vehicle division and optimizing its industrial system to drive scale and cost efficiencies.

Building toward a sustainably profitable business in Europe, Ford’s next chapter will see a new product offensive driven by the introduction of new multi-energy, affordable cars, and commercial vehicles designed to support customer choice on their journey to electrification and boost the company’s competitiveness in an aggressive market.

The planned new vehicles will enhance Ford’s existing product range and are expected to arrive in showrooms in 2028.

“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” says Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford. “How we compete here — how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”

Ford Pro, according to the automaker, continues to be the engine of the company’s European business. The division is moving beyond hardware to offer a comprehensive ecosystem of software and services. By turning billions of vehicle data points into actionable intelligence, the Ford Live Uptime system delivered an estimated 820,000 additional days of vehicle uptime to European businesses in 2024 alone.

Ford says it’s evolving its industrial operations in Europe, designed to support the shift to multi-energy vehicles and deliver customer choice. Ford’s Valencia plant is expected to continue to play a critical role in realizing Ford’s plan for an enhanced passenger vehicle portfolio in Europe.

Ford’s strategy for Europe is designed to navigate Europe’s evolving CO2 emission regulations, providing customers with a range of affordable, multi-energy options during the transition to electrification. The current share of electric vehicles in Europe is steady at 16.1 percent, far below the required 25 percent of new vehicle registrations required to meet Europe’s strict CO2 targets by 2025.

“We need to enable everyone to benefit from electrification and letting customers choose – whether that’s fully electric or hybrid vehicles,” says Baumbick. “It is about making the transition more attractive and more affordable for all consumers and businesses, stimulating demand rather than stifling it.”

Ford proposes three steps to ensure a successful transition:

Align Targets with Reality. We must align CO2 targets with actual market adoption and provide automakers with a realistic and reliable 10-year planning horizon. This includes giving consumers the option to drive hybrid vehicles for longer, bridging the gap rather than forcing a leap they aren’t ready to take.

Incentivize the Transition: European manufacturers have invested hundreds of billions in EVs. Governments must match that commitment with consistent purchase incentives and a charging infrastructure that extends beyond wealthy urban centers into the rural heartland.

Support the Working Economy: The current approach to commercial vehicles is an economic tax on the backbone of Europe. Only 8 percent of new vans are electric. These vehicles are tools for plumbers, florists, and builders. Aggressive CO2 targets on commercial vehicles unfairly penalize the small and medium-sized businesses that generate more than 50 percent of Europe’s GDP.

“With nearly half a million sales under the Maverick’s belt, Ford is updating the hardware and software in ways that make it both a better truck and a friskier, more fun commuter,” MotorTrend wrote.

“Over two weeks of intensive truck testing, the Ford quickly distinguished itself amid our field of two new and three revised contenders against our six key criteria: performance of intended function, engineering excellence, advancement in design, efficiency, value, and safety.”",https://cdn.dbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/12/FordInEurope800.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 12:02:44.473030

Donald Trump issued an executive order on the first day of his administration that paused all leasing, permitting and approvals for wind projects, killing tens of thousands of jobs across the country. Since then, the administration has rescinded permits for offshore wind projects, halted projects that were 80 percent completed, and gutted tax credits allocated for wind energy projects—all to weaken the rapidly growing wind energy industry.

Prior to Donald Trump’s assault on wind energy, the industry was one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the country. At the end of 2024, the wind sector employed nearly 150,000 Americans. Because of the administration’s attacks on wind, at least 17,000 jobs are in jeopardy in the offshore wind industry alone.

In May, the Sierra Club joined nine other environmental groups in an amicus brief arguing that “the administration's ‘Wind Directive’ is arbitrary and not based in science, lacks a clear purpose or timeline, and jeopardizes climate goals and public health.”

In response, Sierra Club Senior Advisor Nancy Pyne issued the following statement:

“The decision from the Federal Court is a victory for everyone who pays an electricity bill, is part of the clean energy workforce, and breathes air. Americans need cheaper and more reliable energy that does not come at the expense of our health and futures. We are glad to see this illegal order get vacated, and we will continue to advocate for more wind energy projects across the country to lower the cost of energy and create stable, union jobs in our communities.

The Court left in place another finding by EPA that allows Michigan to avoid some of the Clean Air Act’s other nonattainment requirements.
For nearly a decade, ozone pollution in Detroit has been above the air quality standard.","DETROIT, Mich. -- Detroit area residents will be able to breathe easier as Sierra Club’s latest win for clean air will result in stronger pollution standards at a time when asthma rates in the region are rising. The legal victory [link to opinion] comes after the Sierra Club and the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center sued EPA in 2023, challenging two EPA rulemakings under the Clean Air Act that allowed Michigan to move the Detroit area from “nonattainment” with ground-level ozone standards to “attainment” -- a label that allowed the state to avoid stricter air regulations and more robust permitting for new sources of pollution. The Detroit area has long suffered from bad air days caused by high ozone pollution levels, along with disproportionate levels of asthma and other health harms associated with ground-level ozone.

“Without this victory, EPA’s decisions would have let Michigan avoid the rules needed to reduce pollution and keep the air we breathe safe. At a time when asthma rates are rising in Detroit, especially in Black communities, that’s unacceptable. With the backing of this federal court decision, our community will continue to push the state of Michigan to take much-needed action to relieve ozone pollution in this area,” said Dr. Dolores Leonard, Sierra Club member and longtime advocate for Detroit environmental justice causes.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with Sierra Club that EPA acted unlawfully, and struck down EPA’s decision that the area could be redesignated to attainment. As a result, stricter air rules for sources of ozone precursor pollution will need to be put in place for the area, and stricter permitting rules will apply for new major sources of air pollution seeking to locate in the area. The Court left in place another finding by EPA that allows Michigan to avoid some of the Clean Air Act’s other nonattainment requirements.

Elena Saxonhouse, Managing Attorney, Sierra Club Environmental Law Program and counsel in the litigation said, “The decision puts Southeastern Michigan back on a path towards cleaner air and better health outcomes. It also closes an EPA-created Clean Air Act loophole, which made it easier for states to avoid the stricter requirements that come into play each time an ozone nonattainment area misses a deadline to attain federal health standards. ”

Nick Leonard, Executive Director, Great Lakes Environmental Law Center and counsel in the litigation said, “This ruling holds Michigan and EPA accountable for their failure to follow the Clean Air Act and take action to lower ozone pollution in Southeast Michigan. For nearly a decade, ozone pollution in Detroit has been above the air quality standard. Many residents impacted by this pollution struggle with extremely high rates of asthma. This decision is an important step forward for public health in Detroit and Southeast Michigan.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-09 12:02:25.547878

Still, Jones says his group is talking with members of Congress, and he expects a bill for a data center moratorium soonish.","A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

More than 230 groups have signed on to a letter calling for a national pause on new data centers that power AI. They cite the risk of higher utility bills and environmental concerns. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady.

JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The group Food & Water Watch drafted the moratorium letter to members of Congress as communities grapple with proposals to build the large energy-hungry campuses. Mitch Jones with the group says the country needs to pause and let regulations catch up.

MITCH JONES: And let's figure out if it's possible to do this in a way that is going to be safe for the environment, that is going to preserve water for communities, that is not going to drive up people's already increasing electricity prices.

BRADY: Jones argues Congress could regulate data center construction by giving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, more oversight. Data centers use a lot of water for cooling. He says that's another possibility for regulation. Or, he says, data center construction could be made subject to existing federal environmental laws. Other groups signing the letter include Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and Physicians for Social Responsibility. The industry group Data Center Coalition says halting construction would jeopardize digital infrastructure that's essential to contemporary life and risk U.S. economic competitiveness.

Much of the fight over data center construction is before state and local governments. President Trump wrote on social media Monday that he plans an executive order to curb state laws limiting data center development, but that likely would be challenged in court. This call for a national moratorium on new data centers echoes a Food & Water Watch campaign from a generation back against hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for natural gas.

JONES: Well, we called for a national ban on fracking as well, actually, and had legislation introduced in Congress to do that on multiple occasions.

BRADY: That effort failed, and gas drilling is booming. Still, Jones says his group is talking with members of Congress, and he expects a bill for a data center moratorium soonish.

The report said that 85% of all new power generation capacity from January through September of this year was solar power and energy storage.
The SEIA/WoodMac said the top states for new solar installations include Texas, the nation’s leader in renewable energy capacity.
Utah enters the list after bringing two utility-scale solar projects online totaling more than 1 GW of capacity.
“But the U.S. solar industry has more potential.","The U.S. solar power industry installed 11.7 GW of new generation in the third quarter of this year, according to a report from Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). It’s the third-largest quarterly gain on record, and moves total solar installations in 2025 above the 30-GW level.

The groups’ U.S. Solar Market Insight Q4 2025 report released December 9 (read the executive summary here) noted that 73% of all new solar capacity installed in the U.S. has been added in so-called “red states,” those won by Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. That’s notable because the Trump administration has supported fossil fuels, and taken actions to limit renewable energy, since starting his second term in January.

The report said that 85% of all new power generation capacity from January through September of this year was solar power and energy storage.

The SEIA/WoodMac said the top states for new solar installations include Texas, the nation’s leader in renewable energy capacity. Others on the list are Indiana, Florida, Arizona, Ohio, Utah, Kentucky, and Arkansas. Utah enters the list after bringing two utility-scale solar projects online totaling more than 1 GW of capacity. The other two states in the top 10 for new installations are California and Illinois.

A memo from the U.S. Dept. of the Interior (DOI) in July, along with several other actions by the Trump administration, have impeding utility-scale solar and storage projects, according to the report. The groups cited “significant business uncertainty” due to “the absence of clarity from DOI on permitting timelines or project approvals.” SEIA in November released an analysis of Energy Information Administration data that showed more than 73 GW of solar projects have permits pending, and are vulnerable to what it called politically-motivated delays or cancellations.

“This record-setting quarter for solar deployment shows that the market is continuing to turn to solar to meet rising demand,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper, who has announced she will step down from her post in January of next year. “Remarkable growth in Texas, Indiana, Utah, and other states won by President Trump shows just how decisively the market is moving toward solar. But unless this administration reverses course, the future of clean, affordable, and reliable solar and storage will be frozen by uncertainty and Americans will continue to see their energy bills go up. America’s manufacturing surge, our global competitiveness, and billions of dollars in private investment are on the line.”

The groups on Tuesday said that with the opening of two new solar module manufacturing facilities in Louisiana and South Carolina, totaling 4.7 GW of production, the U.S. has now added 17.7 GW of new module manufacturing capacity this year. The recent opening of a new wafer facility in Michigan means that domestic manufacturers can now produce every major component of the solar module supply chain.

“We expect 250 gigawatts of solar to be installed from 2025—2030,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. “But the U.S. solar industry has more potential. Wood Mackenzie is tracking substantial increases in power demand across the nation. The solar industry would be well-positioned to meet more of this new demand if existing constraints were alleviated, presenting upside to our forecast.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bechtel-is-adding-900-megawatts-of-new-renewable-power-to-mammoth-solar-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 12:04:04.794591

Funding will help address homes that are unable to benefit from weatherization programs because of pre-existing health and safety issues

GREENVILLE, S.C. – Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are awarding $125,000 in microgrants to South Carolina nonprofits that will help bolster existing programs that help make the necessary repairs that enable households to become eligible for energy efficiency improvements and long-term cost savings.

Why it matters: Many homes across the Palmetto State are unable to benefit from weatherization programs because of pre-existing health and safety issues, such as roof leaks, electrical hazards, mold, pest infestations or structural deficiencies that must be addressed before energy efficiency upgrades can occur.

Where the money goes: Qualified nonprofit organizations that prepare income challenged households for participation in energy efficiency and weatherization initiatives applied for grants up to $20,000 through a request for proposals process launched in September:

Citizens United for Redevelopment and Economic Stability of Chester ($10,000)

City of Florence ($10,000)

Emmanuel’s Hammer ($20,000)

Habitat for Humanity Greenville County ($20,000)

Habitat for Humanity of York County ($10,000)

Helping Florence Flourish ($10,000)

Rebuild Upstate ($5,000)

Sumter United Ministries ($20,000)

United Way of Hartsville ($20,000)

Our view

Jerry Dudley, Planning Director, City of Florence, S.C.: “The Duke Energy Foundation grant will enhance the city’s Weatherization and Rehabilitation Program by funding critical home repairs for income-challenged households. Several homeowners are in urgent need of roof repairs. These grant dollars will help extend the reach of the city’s program, allowing us to serve more families and address essential housing needs.”

John Lattimore, Chief Program Officer, Habitat for Humanity of Greenville County: “Habitat for Humanity of Greenville County is excited and honored to continue our partnership with Duke Energy and their commitment to providing a better quality of life for families in need. This specific funding will help provide warm, safe and dry conditions through critical home repairs for several deserving families. The need is great in our community and partners like Duke Energy allow us to meet more of that need.”

Tim Pearson, President, Duke Energy’s South Carolina: “Many homes in our state have underlying safety issues that prevent homeowners from participating in energy efficiency and weatherization programs that can significantly moderate energy bills and decrease the growing demand on the energy grid. Recent legislative efforts have made it clear energy efficiency is critical to our long-term efforts to respond to growth in our state, and Duke Energy continues to look at new ways of expanding energy saving opportunities for our customers.”

Saving energy and money: In addition to these grants, Duke Energy Progress launched a pilot program in South Carolina in 2024 offering free energy improvements to qualifying households based on income and energy use. And in 2025, Duke Energy increased incentives and eligibility for many of its energy efficiency and demand response programs in South Carolina, expanding ways customers can save money and energy.

Click here for previous votes.

Michael Lawler (R), District 17 (including Philipstown)

Lawler, 38, was elected to Congress in 2022 and re-elected in 2024. From 2021 to 2022, he was a Republican member of the state Assembly from the 97th district in Rockland County. A graduate of Suffern High School, he holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting and finance from Manhattan College. He is a former director of the state Republican Party and former deputy supervisor of Orangetown.

Pat Ryan (D), District 18 (including Beacon)

Ryan, 43, was elected to Congress in 2022 and re-elected in 2024. Formerly the county executive of Ulster, he grew up in Kingston and holds a bachelor’s degree in international politics from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a master’s degree in security studies from Georgetown. Ryan served in the U.S. Army as a combat intelligence officer from 2004 to 2009, including two tours in Iraq. He is also a former technology executive.

Children and Social Security Cards

The House on Dec. 1, by unanimous vote, passed the Social Security Child Protection Act (H.R. 5348), sponsored by Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.), to require the Social Security Administration to issue a new Social Security number to any child less than 14 years old if the child’s Social Security card was lost or stolen in the mail. Smucker called the change “a simple fix to protect our children and make the process of interacting with the Social Security Administration easier.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

Loans to Burma

The House on Dec. 1, by unanimous vote, passed the No New Burma Funds Act (H.R. 4423), sponsored by Rep. Nikema Williams (D-Ga.), to require the U.S. representative at the World Bank’s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to press for the bank to continue its halt to financial aid for Burma, due to Burma’s military coup in 2021. Williams said “this legislation gives our country yet another tool to put financial pressure on the Burmese government.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

Small Business Regulations

The House on Dec. 3, by a 223-190 vote, passed the Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act (H.R. 2965), sponsored by Rep. Beth Van Duyne (R-Texas), to require the Small Business Administration to ensure that its annual regulatory budget, which is the net cost of federal regulations for that year, is no greater than zero. Van Duyne said the bill “moves the needle toward empowering small businesses by reducing red tape.” A bill opponent, Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.), said it “may sound good on the surface, but it will have the practical effect of limiting the SBA from issuing any rules, even if the benefits outweigh the costs.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

Hotline for Small Business Regulations

The House on Dec. 3, by a 269-146 vote, passed the Destroying Unnecessary, Misaligned and Prohibitive Red Tape Act (H.R. 4305), sponsored by Rep. Tony Wied (R-Wis.), to require the Small Business Administration to develop a communications hotline for small businesses to tell the SBA about regulatory compliance burdens. Wied called the hotline “a commonsense way to gather input directly from the people most harmed by overregulation to allow Congress to take meaningful action.” An opponent, Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.), said: “The bill lacks adequate reporting mechanisms to identify who is making the submissions, leaving it vulnerable to abuse.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

China and Public Schools

The House on Dec. 3, by a 242-176 vote, passed the Combating the Lies of Authoritarians in School Systems Act (H.R. 1005), sponsored by Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio). The bill would condition federal funding for a public school on the school not having taken funds from China’s government, and require public schools to inform the Education Department of their receipt of funds from any foreign source. Joyce said: “As China seeks greater influence in education across the globe, we should take commonsense steps to protect our children and maintain the integrity of the U.S. system of schools.” An opponent, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), said: “This bill would compel schools to implement new reporting mechanisms, monitoring procedures, and compliance structures despite the complete absence of any factual verified threats.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

The House on Dec. 4, by a 247-164 vote, passed the Promoting Responsible Oversight to Eliminate Communist Teachings for Our Kids Act (H.R. 1069), sponsored by Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), to block federal funding to public schools that, either directly or indirectly, have ties to China’s government. Hern said the ban was needed because China’s leaders were “succeeding in their mission to indoctrinate American students with their Communist ideals.” An opponent, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), questioned whether the bill addressed an actual problem, and said it “would create significant administrative burdens to our schools and chill community investment in our children.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

Foreign Influence in Schools

The House on Dec. 4, by a 247-166 vote, passed the Transparency in Reporting of Adversarial Contributions to Education Act (H.R. 1049), sponsored by Rep. Aaron Bean (R-Fla.), to condition federal funding to local school districts on the districts informing students’ parents of their right to request and receive information regarding foreign influence in schools. Bean said: “We cannot allow our students, the future of our great nation, to be corrupted by foreign adversaries who are systematically and aggressively attempting to influence our nation’s K-12 schools.” A bill opponent, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), said it “burdens our already overstretched schools with new reporting requirements, new paperwork, and new bureaucratic hurdles, all without adding a single dollar to help them meet their obligations.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

Along with roll call votes this week, the House also passed:

The SBA Fraud Enforcement Extension Act (H.R. 4495), to extend the statute of limitations for fraud under certain pandemic programs;

The Trafficking Survivors Relief Act (H.R. 4323), to provide for the vacating of certain convictions and expungement of certain arrests of victims of human trafficking;

The Count the Crimes to Cut Act (H.R. 2159), to direct the attorney general to submit to Congress a report on federal criminal offenses; and

The Hospital Inpatient Services Modernization Act (H.R. 4313), to extend acute hospital care at home waiver flexibilities.

SENATE

North Carolina Judges

The Senate on Dec. 2, by a 53-45 vote, confirmed the nomination of David Bragdon to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. Bragdon has been a Justice Department attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina since 2007, after time as a private practice lawyer in Alabama, and was a Justice Department advisor for the Philippines from 2017 to 2020. An opponent, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), criticized Bragdon for refusing “to disavow his prior writings” posted on a personal website while Bragdon was in college.

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) voted no

The Senate on Dec. 2, by a 60-39 vote, confirmed the nomination of Lindsey Ann Freeman to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. An assistant U.S. attorney since early 2021, Freeman has been at the Justice Department since late 2017. She was previously a commercial lawyer in California.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) voted no

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) voted no

The Senate on Dec. 3, by a 57-41 vote, confirmed the nomination of Matthew Orso to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. A private practice lawyer in Charlotte since 2012, Orso clerked for a Western District judge from 2009 to 2011.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) voted no

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) voted no

The Senate on Dec. 4, by a 57-32 vote, confirmed the nomination of Susan Rodriguez to be a judge for the Western District of North Carolina. Rodriguez became a magistrate judge in the district in April 2023, following more than a decade as a commercial lawyer, focused on finance, in the state.

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) voted no

Reviewing Slate of Nominees

The Senate on Dec. 4, by a 43-37 vote, rejected a cloture motion to end debate on a bill (S. Res. 520), sponsored by Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), that would consider, en bloc, a set of 88 executive branch nominees, including ambassadorships, military posts, and about a dozen state-level U.S. attorneys. Thune said en bloc consideration would help the Senate nearly clear President Trump’s “nominations backlog by the end of his first year, in contrast to the situation, at this point, in President Trump’s first term and President Biden’s.” An opponent, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), said: “This nominee package is a perfect symbol of what this majority has been about from Day One: bowing to Donald Trump, rubberstamping his unqualified loyalists, and chipping away at the Senate’s role as a check on a highly abusive executive.” A three-fifths majority was required.

Alaska Oil and Natural Gas Development

The Senate on Dec. 4, by a 49-45 vote, passed a bill (H.J. Res. 131), sponsored by Rep. Nicholas Begich (R-Alaska), to nullify a Bureau of Land Management rule issued in December that placed a majority of land in a specified portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge off-limits for oil and natural gas production leases. A supporter, Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), said: “This resolution will help people live longer. It will help our country be stronger in terms of American energy. It will vindicate the rule of law after Joe Biden and Secretary Haaland blatantly violated it.” An opponent, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), called the refuge “the crown jewel of our National Wildlife Refuge System, and it belongs to every single American and deserves our protection.”

Reducing exposure to flame retardants If you’re concerned about flame retardants, here are some tips.","Foam-containing furniture sitting in your home for years can be a hidden source of harmful flame retardant exposure. Removing these old sofas and chairs can lower the amount of one type of flame retardant in your body, finds a newly published study by EWG and others(link is external).

Levels of the flame retardant class of chemicals known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, or PBDEs, decreased two to four times faster in study participants who removed the furniture than in those who didn’t.

The study, led by the California Department of Public Health and partners, including EWG, supports the state’s decision more than a decade ago to revise its furniture flammability standards, reducing the reliance on toxic flame retardants.

In 2020, Congress adopted the updated state standard.

These victories help protect families from harmful chemicals in upholstered furniture.

They were possible only after years of work by advocates and researchers who exposed the health risks of flame retardants and challenged misleading industry claims justifying their use. EWG, through testing, research and advocacy, has for decades called for an end to the use of toxic flame retardants.

But even though the safer furniture standards apply to new sales, families may continue to be exposed to these toxic chemicals, since flame retardants remain widespread in furniture already in use, as well as car seats, electronics and more.

Health risks from flame retardants

The study examined two major classes of flame retardants – PBDEs and OPFRs, or organophosphate flame retardants – that have been widely used since the 1970s to meet flammability standards. These chemicals have been added to many everyday products, including upholstered furniture like chairs and couches.

These products can emit the chemicals in house dust, contaminating rooms nearby. Exposure to flame retardant chemicals has been linked to serious health harms, including cancer, neurotoxicity, thyroid disease, pre-term birth and decreased fertility, as well as deficits in motor skills, attention and IQ in children.

People can ingest flame retardants in dust, inhale them from the air and absorb them through skin. Infants and young children are especially at risk since they crawl and play on the floor, where contaminated dust settles, and then frequently put their hands in their mouths.

Benefits of removing older furniture

Could taking older furniture out of homes reduce the amount of PBDEs and OPFRs detected in people’s blood and urine? That’s what the study set out to find.

Researchers from EWG, among other groups, launched their collaboration in 2015. The California Department of Public Health, the California Environmental Protection Agency, Silent Spring, the Green Science Policy Institute, the Sequoia Foundation and the University of California, Davis, also participated in the project.

Focusing on a few dozen California households, the investigation tracked how removing furniture made before 2014 affected levels of flame retardants in study participants.

In 2013 the Golden State updated its furniture flammability standards, no longer requiring the use of chemical flame retardants.

Study participants collected household dust before and after removing a couch or couch foam. Results of the dust tests released in 2021 showed a drop in the amount of flame retardants in dust, both PBDE and OPFRs, found after the furniture was removed and replaced.

The study’s most recent published findings build on the 2021 results by showing that PBDE levels in participants’ blood also dropped much faster in those who had removed older foam-containing furniture made with these chemicals than in a control group who did not replace their furniture.

In the study, removing or replacing furniture did not significantly affect OPFR levels, since people are likely exposed to OPFRs from other sources, including electronics and vehicles, in addition to furniture.

Science backs safer policy

Ditching sources of flame retardant exposure may benefit health, according to the new findings, published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Pollution.

A different study(link is external) found that during the approximately seven years after PBDEs were no longer used in furniture, levels of the chemicals detected in breast milk dropped by nearly 40%.

Furniture makers started using flame retardants following California’s decision, in 1975, to issue a flawed furniture flammability rule. Use of large amounts of flame retardants in polyurethane foam cushioning was one way to comply with the rule.

To avoid manufacturing products for California that were different from the rest of the U.S., national companies added flame retardants to items such as furniture and carpets.

Scientists warned about the health risks of flame retardant chemicals in furniture, urging a policy change to discourage the use of flame retardants because the chemicals didn’t lower fire risks or improve safety.

The state finally updated the rule in 2013 to end a requirement for using the chemicals in manufacturing furniture.

Furniture made today is less likely to contain harmful flame retardants. But older furniture continues to be a possible source of exposure, even years after it was manufactured.

Reducing exposure to flame retardants

If you’re concerned about flame retardants, here are some tips.

Buy products made without flame retardants, if possible. It’s easiest when shopping for couches, easy chairs and kids’ products, because flame retardants are no longer required in these types of furnishings.

It’s more difficult to avoid flame retardants in car seats and nearly impossible to avoid in cars and electronics. For car seats, look for flame-retardant-free products from Nuna, Clek (Mammoth or Railroad models) and Britax Grow, for example.

And take these simple precautions to minimize your exposure:",https://www.ewg.org/themes/custom/ewg/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-09 11:05:48.855836

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Bright Outlook The Zacks Solar industry is housed within the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector.
The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.","The U.S. solar industry is experiencing strong underlying momentum, with utilities, businesses and households increasingly adopting solar and storage. Installations reached 11.7 GWdc in the third quarter of 2025, while project delays eased. However, recent federal policy changes have created near-term uncertainty, complicating permitting, procurement and supply-chain planning. Despite a 12% drop in module prices, elevated U.S. tariffs have pushed commercial and utility-scale system costs higher. These policy and tariff pressures are squeezing margins and heightening project risk. A few prominent players in this industry that solar investors may like to watch are Sunrun RUN, Canadian Solar CSIQ, FTC Solar FTCI and Tigo Energy, Inc. TYGO.

About the Industry

The Zacks Solar industry can be fundamentally categorized into two groups of companies. While one is involved in designing and producing high-efficiency solar modules, panels and cells, the other is engaged in installing grids and, in some cases, entire solar power systems. The industry also includes a handful of companies that manufacture inverters for solar power systems, which convert solar power from modules into electricity required by electric grids. Per a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (“SEIA”), published on Dec. 8, 2025, solar accounted for 58% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid through the third quarter of 2025, with more than 30 gigawatt (GW) installed. Hence, it remains the nation's dominant form of new generating capacity.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Solar Industry

Strong Momentum Lifts Outlook: Utilities, businesses, and households are increasingly adopting solar power — especially systems paired with battery storage — to advance decarbonization, strengthen energy resilience and protect against rising electricity prices. As reported by SEIA, the U.S. solar industry installed 11.7 GWdc of new solar capacity during the third quarter of 2025, reflecting a 20% year-over-year increase. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) reported that solar remains the fastest-growing source of new electric-generating capacity, driven by the rapid buildout of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) projects by utilities and independent power producers. The EIA reported improvement in project timelines — just 20% of planned solar capacity faced delays in the third quarter of 2025, down from 25% a year ago. EIA also stated that developers further expect to bring 32 GW of new solar capacity online between October 2025 and September 2026. Such strong growth indicators and declining project bottlenecks should bode well for U.S. solar stocks.

Regulatory Friction Rises, Yet Industry Fundamentals Remain Strong: The U.S. government has recently implemented several policy measures that may create near-term headwinds for the nation’s solar industry, with the most consequential being the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Signed into law in July, the OBBBA sharply curtails a number of federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act and introduces new Foreign Entity of Concern (“FEOC”) requirements that could restrict access to key components and supply chains. According to SEIA’s December 2025 report, the industry has spent the months following the bill’s passage adjusting to a policy landscape that remains fluid and far from settled. Developers continue to face uncertainty around federal permitting decisions, and detailed Treasury guidance on FEOC compliance is still expected to take months to materialize. As a result, planning and procurement have become more complex. Even so, SEIA’s base-case outlook for 2025-2030 suggests 246 GWdc of total solar installations, which effectively remained unchanged from its September 2025 projection. This indicates that long-term demand remains resilient despite the new challenges.

Rising Tariff Pressures Strain Solar Economics: The heightened U.S. tariffs on imported goods have been negatively impacting nearly all industries, and solar is no exception. As expected, these tariffs have increased manufacturing costs for solar companies, which were already grappling with raw-material shortages due to global supply-chain challenges. According to SEIA report, module prices fell an average of 12% year over year across all segments, caused by expanded manufacturing capacity and higher-output Topcon cell technology. Residential system prices declined 3%, as lower module and inverter costs offset increases in other categories.

SEIA also mentioned that commercial system pricing rose 9% in the third quarter of 2025, primarily due to a 50% year-over-year surge in balance-of-electrical-system and racking costs, which more than offset savings from cheaper modules. Utility-scale costs also climbed — fixed-tilt systems increased 9%, while single-axis tracking systems rose 10%. These increases stem largely from an 8% rise in balance-of-electrical-system costs tied to new commodity tariffs. Labor costs rose 15% year over year, and EPC overhead and margins jumped nearly 40%, reflecting greater project risk amid ongoing policy and tariff uncertainty.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (“OEPA”) has public noticed a document titled:

Draft NPDES General Permit for Discharges from Data Center Facilities to State Waters (“Draft General Permit”).

See Public Notice No. 215991.

The document is a draft Clean Water Act General National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) Permit for statewide regulation of data center discharges.

A Clean Water Act NPDES individual permit is written to reflect site-specific conditions or a single discharger based on information submitted by that discharger in a permit application. It is unique to that discharger.

In contrast, an NPDES General Permit is written to cover multiple dischargers with similar operations and types of discharges. They are written based on the permit writer’s professional knowledge of those types of activities and discharges.

Individual permits are issued directly to an individual discharger but in the case of a general permit, it is issued with no particular facility in mind. In other words, multiple dischargers can obtain coverage under that general permit after it is issued, if consistent with the permit eligibility and authorization provisions.

Dischargers covered under general permits are informed of their applicable requirements before obtaining coverage under that permit. As a result, obtaining coverage under a general permit is typically faster than an individual permit with coverage under a general permit often occurring immediately.

The OEPA draft general permit for data centers covers facility operations that discharge to waters of the state. Both wastewater and stormwater from the data center facility are proposed for coverage under this permit.

Wastewater discharges are stated to include non-contact cooling waters (once through or re-circulated water that does not come into contact with the process operations of a facility and is used only to convey heat from the facility), low volume wastewaters (such as, cooling tower blowdown, boiler blowdown, and air compressor condensate yet excludes some waste streams like sanitary wastes) and stormwater associated with the industrial activities from the site.

Parameters addressed in the permit include:

pH.

Total filterable residue (i.e., Total Dissolved Solids).

Residual chlorine.

Residual Oxidants.

Key parameters monitored in the draft data center general permit include:

Flow volume.

Oil and grease.

Temperature.

A data center facility is defined by the general permit as including an establishment that provides computer processing and data preparation services, housing computing equipment that stores, processes, and distributes digital data. They are generally indicated to be defined by standard industrial classification code 7374-data processing and preparation.

OEPA notes that data centers can use a variety of cooling systems for the purpose of removing unwanted heat. These may include:

Air-cooled condensers.

Water-cooled condensers.

Evaporative cooling or a hybrid condenser with both air- and water-cooled modes.

Liquid-based cooling that uses coolants such as water or refrigerants.

Activities exposed to stormwater are described by OEPA as including:

Generators.

Fuel and chemical storage tanks.

Outdoor equipment storage.

Material loading/unloading areas.

Other operations where stormwater runoff may discharge pollutants.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 11:05:53.508663

If you look back years ago in the nineteen-twenties and the nineteen-thirties, they said, Global cooling will kill the world.
It would be easy, and accurate, to call 2025 the low point of human action on the climate crisis.
Here he is again, at the U.N., offering his definitive take on solar and wind power: “By the way, they’re a joke.
As the Times put it, “Countries like Brazil, India, and Vietnam are rapidly expanding solar and wind power.","Events now move at a pace so exhausting that it’s hard to remember that 2025 began with an epic climate-fuelled disaster: large portions of the nation’s second-biggest city, Los Angeles, burned in a firestorm that lasted days, after a record-dry autumn. A succession of such tragedies followed—for instance, the killer floods along the Guadalupe River, in Texas, where atmospheric moisture off an overheated Gulf of Mexico had hit record levels. Or Hurricane Melissa, where wind gusts reached two hundred and fifty-two miles per hour, faster than ever measured in a tropical cyclone at sea, thanks to the superheated waters of the Caribbean. The same day that Melissa hit Jamaica, a storm dropped five feet of rain on central Vietnam in twenty-four hours, the second-biggest deluge in recorded history, and the start of a truly sodden autumn across Southeast Asia which has left more than a thousand people dead.

The year 2025 seems nearly certain to enter the books tied with 2023 as the second-hottest ever measured, trailing only 2024. Since both of those earlier years were influenced by a strong El Niño event, this one will have the dubious distinction of being the hottest without such an extraneous force. This is apparently what business as usual looks like for a planetary climate carrying our atmosphere’s current load of carbon dioxide and methane. On the three-year moving average by which we measure such things, the Earth is now inching ever-closer to the 1.5-degree-Celsius increase in temperature set out as a goal to avoid just a decade ago at the Paris climate talks. And diplomatic events in 2025 did little to ease fears about what’s coming. The thirtieth Conference of the Parties (COP) global climate talks in Belem, Brazil—which no one from the Trump Administration attended—just concluded, and the Times described the final document in unusually straightforward terms as “a victory for oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia.”

None of this should shock anyone. International climate diplomacy, since its high-water mark at Paris, in 2015, has been besieged by the fossil-fuel industry and its proxy governments, which now include, of course, the United States, historically the Earth’s chief producer of CO2. I’m going to quote at some length from the speech the American President delivered to a silent U.N. General Assembly in September, because it sums up perfectly both his own imperviousness to fact and the assertiveness of the oil-and-gas world after his Inauguration this year.

2025 in Review

New Yorker writers reflect on the year’s highs and lows.

Describing, for instance, his understanding of climate science (invented arguably in its modern form in the United States, whose scientists first tracked the gases accumulating in the atmosphere and then built the computer models allowing us to predict our fate), Donald Trump said, “It used to be global cooling. If you look back years ago in the nineteen-twenties and the nineteen-thirties, they said, Global cooling will kill the world. We have to do something. Then they said, Global warming will kill the world. But then it started getting cooler. It’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion.” Then, with regard to modern environmentalism, one of America’s greatest contributions to the world—a consciousness that allowed our air and water to be cleaned up dramatically over recent decades—Trump said, “In the United States, we have still radicalized environmentalists, and they want the factories to stop. Everything should stop. No more cows. We don’t want cows anymore. I guess they want to kill all the cows. They want to do things that are just unbelievable.”

In service to his vision of the world, the President has spent the year undoing every environmental law he can find. The zeal of his lieutenants—Lee Zeldin, at the Environmental Protection Agency; the former fracking executive Christopher Wright, at the Department of Energy; and others—has been remarkable. They’ve unleashed oil drilling along the coasts, opened up vast new stretches of the interior for coal mining, scrapped laws that attempted to staunch the flow of methane from gas wells into the air. Here’s Wright, on climate science, “Like, it’s a real physical phenomenon. It’s worth understanding a little bit. But to call it a crisis and point to disasters and say that that’s climate change, that’s to say, I’m not going to do my homework.”

Indeed, he and his colleagues are working hard to make it impossible for anyone to do their homework. They’ve shut down NASA’s upper Manhattan Goddard Institute for Space Studies, where James Hansen and other scientists first documented our plight, proposed to shut down the satellites that watch the climate changing, and even planned, in next year’s budget, to shut down the monitoring stations at Mauna Loa and elsewhere which keep track of how much carbon is pouring into the atmosphere. It is almost certainly the greatest collective act of scientific vandalism in recent American history. It would be easy, and accurate, to call 2025 the low point of human action on the climate crisis.

And yet, it’s at least possible that Trump and company’s assault on environmental norms is more shrill than confident. Because something else happened this year that gives at least some hope for the future: the remarkable rise in clean, renewable energy, which set every kind of record in 2025. In May, in a rush to get solar farms up before a subsidies-for-growth policy ended, China was installing an average of three gigawatts of solar capacity a day—the U.S. installed a total of twenty-one gigawatts in the first three quarters of this year. China, which is currently at the center of the renewable revolution, broke its own records with ease: after surpassing its 2030 targets in 2024, it set new targets for 2035 this year, including a renewable-electricity share exceeding thirty per cent. It’s not alone: India met a 2030 target early, too. As Reuters reported in July, fifty per cent of installed electric capacity in the world’s most populous country ran on something other than fossil fuels. That’s not the same thing as saying it generated half its power from the sun and wind, but India was definitely trending in the right direction: coal use dropped nearly three per cent in the first half of the year.

Similar transitions have been occurring almost everywhere: in November, the Energy Information Administration reported that California used seventeen per cent less natural gas to produce electricity than it had the year before. Pakistan, which has seen a rapid solar buildout in the past two years, reached an agreement with Qatar to divert twenty-four liquified natural-gas cargoes in 2026 after domestic demand fell—with Pakistan bearing the loss if Qatar sells the cargoes below contract price. They simply don’t need the imports anymore. All told, through September, we generated almost a third more energy from the sun this year than last.

All this flies in the face of Trump’s call for U.S. “energy dominance” from oil and gas. He’s tried, with some success, to build that dominance on the back of tariffs—when the E.U. and Japan agreed to buy hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of liquefied natural gas, he cut their threatened tariff rates substantially, in what could be described only as a shakedown. He’s also done his best to wreck the prospects of clean energy, not only gutting President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which was designed to help America catch up with China’s green-tech lead, but also trying to halt work on nearly completed wind farms off the Atlantic seaboard. Just weeks ago, he put the kibosh on what would have been America’s largest solar array, in Nevada. And he’s tried to take his case around the world, lecturing leaders about the folly of clean energy.

Here he is again, at the U.N., offering his definitive take on solar and wind power: “By the way, they’re a joke. They don’t work. They’re too expensive. They’re not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great. The wind doesn’t blow. Those big windmills are so pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate, and they have to be rebuilt all the time and they start to rust and rot. Most expensive energy ever conceived. And it’s actually energy. You’re supposed to make money with energy, not lose money. You lose money, the governments have to subsidize. You can’t put them out without massive subsidies.” And this is how he summed up the situation: “And I’m really good at predicting things. . . . I don’t say that in a braggadocious way, but it’s true. I’ve been right about everything. And I’m telling you that if you don’t get away from this green-energy scam, your country is going to fail.”

Or maybe it’s America that’s in trouble. When historians look back at 2025, I think the story they will tell is that, in the course of just a few months, the U.S. voluntarily surrendered technological and economic primacy to its theoretical chief adversary in the course of just a few months. China’s green-energy exports this year, through July, were one and a half times the size of American oil and gas exports in the same period. From Belem, the view seemed fairly clear. As the Times put it, “Countries like Brazil, India, and Vietnam are rapidly expanding solar and wind power. Poorer countries like Ethiopia and Nepal are leapfrogging over gasoline-burning cars to battery-powered ones. Nigeria, a petrostate, plans to build its first solar-panel manufacturing plant. Morocco is creating a battery hub to supply European automakers. Santiago, the capital of Chile, has electrified more than half of its bus fleet in recent years.”

Crucial to this global shift was China, which was selling the technology and often providing the financing. “Green and low-carbon transition is the trend of the time,” the Chinese Vice-Premier, Ding Xuexiang, told the COP 30 delegates. “We need to stay confident, balance such goals as environmental protection, economic development, job creation, and poverty eradication.” China is far from a benign world power, but countries that buy green tech from it will not depend on it going forward, as they would depend on a supplier of gas or coal. Instead, they’ll depend on the sun, which has an enviable record of rising most mornings.

Americans, too, are starting to worry about the domestic effects of relying on fossil fuels. Electricity prices are spiking around the country, up ten per cent as the Trump Administration simultaneously green-lights the endless expansion of juice-sucking data centers and constricts the supply of the cheapest forms of energy. Election results from last month—especially in New Jersey, where the victorious Democrat in the gubernatorial race, Mikie Sherrill, made a strong commitment to renewable power—suggest that voters have woken up to this economic reality. Expect Sherrill’s colleagues across the country to start making much of the new data indicating that some of the states with the lowest power rates, such as Iowa and North Dakota, can often be those with the most wind, sun, and hydropower.

None of this is happening fast enough. But there’s definitely a wild card in what has often seemed like a stacked deck, and it’s increasingly coming into play. Another year will give us a sense of how much the game has been changed. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/69373112a32c6284427c9fa7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/02_R1-1.jpg",N,,2025-12-09 11:05:57.389831

The S&P 500 has increased 16% in that time. The two companies were supposed to be losers as they continued to lag behind the wounded Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) in the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market, and they have the most modest presence in China and the European Union. Tesla may be hurting, but it still has about a 45% EV market share in the United States. GM and Ford are closer to 10% each. In China, the world’s largest EV market, the two U.S. car giants have almost nothing at all.

The “win” for Ford and GM is that they are fossil-fuel kings in a fossil-fuel nation. The EV market has died, thanks mostly to the end of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit. iSeeCars research says that EV sales as a percentage of total U.S. new car sales dropped from 8% in the third quarter to 4% in the fourth quarter. It will stay at that level through 2026, the research firm forecasts.

GM and Ford have spent billions of dollars on EV development, only to find their legacy businesses are extremely healthy. In fact, their lead products are full-sized pickups, symbols of America’s gasoline-loving drivers.

Among the reasons that GM and Ford were wrong about EVs was that buyers still worry about range (at 300 miles for most EVs) and the number of charging stations. Excess tire wear and engines that do not take a full charge in very cold temperatures are also concerns. Some Americans don’t know how EVs work, which is another drawback.

On the other hand, the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline has dropped to $3. One of the selling points for EVs is that they save money on fuel. While that may be true, it is not as true as it was when gas was $5 a gallon, about the same time Russia invaded Ukraine. The world is awash in cheap oil, with prices falling toward $60 a barrel.

Add to the gas argument that there are, by some estimates, 175,000 gas stations in the U.S. (many of which have convenience stores). Filling a car with gas takes 10 minutes. EVs take longer to charge—if people can find a charger.

As a bonus, the dislike many Americans have for Tesla CEO Elon Musk has caused some people who might have bought Tesla cars to stick with combustion engine ones instead.

Gasoline-powered cars are the clear U.S. market winner. So much for gambling on EVs in America.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/imageForEntry7-EiV.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 11:06:10.979071

As demand for clean mobile power technologies accelerates, suppliers have a unique opportunity to gain a first-mover advantage by upgrading their fleets and positioning themselves as the preferred providers of clean, reliable power solutions.
There are three critical factors that will enable broader availability of clean mobile power: Increasing the variety of clean mobile power products offered in the market, allowing for optimizing clean mobile power product selection based on geographic, operational, and energy demand considerations.
At the same time, the industry should adopt baseline utilization standards for clean mobile power, for example, requiring clean mobile power quotes alongside diesel generators and/or mandating clean mobile power coverage of basecamp or catering loads where feasible.
Department of Energy Clean Hydrogen Production Standard (CHPS) Guidance,” US Department of Energy, https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/docs/hydrogenprogramlibraries/pdfs/clean-hydrogen-production-standard-guidance.pdf.","Film and TV productions are their own enclosed worlds. Often filming in temporary or remote areas, each production has to bring its own power to keep the lights, cameras, and everything else on. Here we explore the energy needs of a typical set, and how those needs can be met with clean mobile power solutions.

Production energy demands

Set: The filming location where the camera captures content, sets can be on a soundstage or on location. Soundstages often draw power from the electric grid to operate power lighting, cameras, and other equipment, though some require additional mobile power for other items, such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). One study found that several soundstages in Canada’s Greater Toronto Area and Vancouver and in New York City rely on mobile power to meet all the energy demand needs of a production on a given day.[1] On-location filming requires all equipment, such as lighting, cameras, and HVAC, to be powered by mobile power, typically using one or more 1,400 ampere (A) (210 kilovolt-ampere [kVa]) generators for lighting and an additional one for HVAC.[2]

Basecamp: The central hub of production activity, often within one mile from the set. Power loads include trailers (with HVAC) for talent, hair, makeup, and costumes, as well as offices for production staff. When located on a soundstage, and in some instances on location, basecamps will rely on grid tie-ins for power. However, when filming on location, accessing grid power is usually either not possible or limited, and as a result, the basecamp will rely in whole or in part on mobile power.[3] Basecamp power is typically one of the larger needs on a production, and if not using renewable energy generation or grid tie-ins, will rely on one or two 1,400–1,600 A (210–240 kVA) generators.[4]

Transportation: Trucks and cars are used for a variety of purposes during film production. They can be used to ferry staff and talent to and from set and basecamp, run errands off-site, and move equipment around a site, including cameras, props, and grip, among other uses. Traditionally, internal combustion engine vehicles would be used alongside diesel generators to power any additional equipment within the vehicles.[5] As electric vehicles (EVs) gain in popularity, transportation will represent a growing energy demand for a production set because these vehicles will need to be recharged on-site using either clean mobile power or grid charging.

Catering: Catering trucks or lunchbox trailers are typically located near basecamp and are used to prepare meals for production teams. They usually include cooking appliances and HVAC equipment to ensure occupant comfort and air circulation. These trucks often use a 5–6.5 kVA (33–43 A) “putt-putt” generator and propane for stoves and refrigerators as well as up to a 70 kVA (466 A) generator for heating, cooling, and lighting.[6]

The basics: What we mean when we talk about clean mobile power

Two types of clean mobile power technology have emerged as the most widely deployed diesel alternatives for film and TV productions today: solar power generation on production trailers (in the United States and Canada) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). Both have benefited from years of commercial development and falling costs outside the entertainment sector, making them relatively mature, reliable, and increasingly accessible for on-production use.

Solar generation, often installed on the roofs of modern, energy-efficient basecamp trailers, offers a proven method of generating clean electricity where sunlight is abundant, while BESS products serve as the storage and distribution backbone that allows renewable power to be used flexibly and reliably.

A third technology, hydrogen power units (HPUs), is also emerging as a promising complement to solar and battery systems. HPUs are at an earlier stage of deployment but have demonstrated strong potential to deliver high power outputs and rapid refueling capabilities. A deeper technical appraisal and practical considerations for their use on productions are discussed later in this section.

Benefits of clean mobile power for film and TV production

Clean mobile power offers a variety of industry-specific benefits, ranging from improving operational efficiency to providing health benefits and, in many cases, cost savings. Some specific advantages are explored below.

Health benefits from reduced pollution

During operation, diesel generators emit air pollutants like particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, which can result in poor air quality and adverse health impacts, including increased risk of stroke, lung cancer, and heart disease, in addition to worsening asthma symptoms. BESS and hydrogen fuel cells do not emit harmful particulates, so there are no adverse impacts on health related to local emissions. Hydrogen combustion units do emit some particulates during operation, though not to the same extent as diesel generators.[7]

Flexible use cases and operational efficiency

Diesel generators make noise, so they often must be placed far from the set to ensure they do not interfere with sound recordings. BESS units are quieter by comparison, which allows productions to use them in a broader range of use cases and locations compared with diesel generators. The more flexible placement for BESS units can also reduce cabling needs and leads to faster setup and teardown times, saving crews time.

While HPUs also vary in their noise levels, manufacturers that are early to market have shown that it is possible to make them quieter than equivalent prime-rated diesel generators. Hone’s fuel cell–based APS-GT100 produces 60 decibels (dB) at a 7-meter distance at its 100 kilowatt (kW) continuous power threshold, while the equivalent diesel MQ Power Whisperwatt 125 kVA/100 kW (833 A) model produces 66 dB at the same distance. This difference, approximately double the perceived sound pressure, is significant and is equivalent to someone speaking directly in front of a listener versus background noise in an average office. Due to various safety considerations, these solutions do have siting constraints that typically do not allow them to offer the same level of flexible location possibilities compared with battery solutions, and thereby savings in cabling or space needs.

Both BESS and HPUs can also support operational efficiencies through the avoidance of power breakdowns, which cause unexpected delays on production. These units can operate at a variety of loads, compared with diesel generators, which can fail if they are running at too low a load.

Improved community relations due to reduced noise and emissions

Diesel generators can be a contentious issue when filming on location in various communities due to the noise and the health hazards outlined above. The use of battery or hydrogen units can reduce air quality–associated complaints and noise complaints, keeping productions on schedule. Lower noise levels can also lead to cost savings as residents in neighborhoods adjacent to filming locations often need to be compensated for inconveniences associated with diesel generator use.

Increased creative freedom

Small battery units, when connected to small loads such as cameras or individual lights, can accommodate a broader range of cinematographic setups compared with diesel generators that are stationary and must be placed away from the set to limit noise disruptions. Furthermore, small battery units are flexible and enable expedited changes to a setup because they can be highly mobile (i.e., carried by one individual) and do not require long cable runs. Additionally, productions using near-silent power can capture content in locations previously unavailable due to restrictions on generator use or other sensitivities.

Operational cost benefits

BESS and HPUs are still relatively new, and as a result, their rental rates are typically higher than those of traditional diesel generators. However, when factoring in the full cost of mobile power (rental rates and fuel), batteries can offer potential cost savings, particularly in areas where the cost of grid tie-in electricity is low or when combining a battery unit with renewable energy generation, such as solar trailers. Battery units also require less maintenance compared with diesel generators, offering additional potential cost savings for owner/operators. Although the full cost of hydrogen and batteries is still higher in many cases today, our analysis in Section 4 indicates that projected total cost of ownership for BESS and HPU units are expected to decrease over time.

The case for action

The solution to the problem of noisy, polluting diesel generators already exists. Solar panels and batteries have been generating and storing power for decades, and the costs of those technologies have continued to fall. The technology is proven: scaling up industry-tailored products is now the only thing holding clean mobile power back.

By working together, industry leaders can accelerate the adoption and availability of clean solutions that power sets quietly, cleanly, and sustainably.

This opportunity comes as some government regulators and the industry as a whole are calling for cleaner solutions that generate low or no emissions, making a focus on clean mobile power not just a smart decision on production, but also one that sets up the industry to thrive in the long term.

For studios

Clean power technologies offer quieter, safer, and more efficient energy for on-production and basecamp operations, improving working conditions, providing production agility benefits, and enabling further electrification, such as charging for on-production EVs. Studios that move early will also benefit from incentive programs, lower long-term energy costs, and reduced exposure to tightening emissions regulations.

Embracing clean mobile power also helps studios meet sustainability goals. Diesel generators make up approximately 15% of emissions on a production, and as efficiency and electrification improvements are adopted across other major emissions sources on productions, the share of mobile power–related emissions will only increase over time with continued diesel use.

As major customers to equipment suppliers and rental houses, film and TV studios have a unique opportunity to shape the pace and scale of clean mobile power adoption across the industry. By setting clear standards for clean power use across their productions, studios can send a powerful demand signal that drives supplier investment, accelerates technology availability, and strengthens supply chains in key markets.

By taking decisive action, studios can establish a new industry standard, demonstrating that clean mobile power is not just an environmental imperative, but also a strategic and operational advantage for the future of entertainment.

For equipment suppliers and rental houses

Studios across the film and TV industry depend on equipment suppliers and rental houses to power their productions. As demand for clean mobile power technologies accelerates, suppliers have a unique opportunity to gain a first-mover advantage by upgrading their fleets and positioning themselves as the preferred providers of clean, reliable power solutions. By collaborating with manufacturers and studios, rental houses can help shape best practices for deployment, improve equipment utilization, and strengthen relationships across the production value chain.

Investing early in clean mobile power is also a strategic risk-mitigation measure. Governments worldwide are tightening emissions standards for diesel-powered equipment. For example, London’s low-emissions zone regulations and Metro Vancouver’s nonroad diesel engine program impose strict performance limits on diesel generators, while incentive programs such as California’s Clean Off-Road Equipment Voucher Incentive Project (CORE) help offset the cost of cleaner technologies. Transitioning fleets now allows suppliers to stay compliant, protect asset value, and avoid portions of their inventory becoming obsolete in key markets.

Beyond compliance, the shift to clean mobile power offers long-term financial and competitive benefits: reduced maintenance costs, access to incentive funding, alignment with studio sustainability commitments, staying relevant by providing the latest technology, and enhanced brand reputation. Early adopters will not only meet growing demand but also help shape the industry’s transition, turning clean mobile power from a niche option into the new standard for film production logistics.

For production executives, managers, and crews

Clean mobile power is not just an environmental upgrade, it enables creativity. Quiet, fume-free power systems allow productions greater flexibility in location choice, improved sound recording conditions, and a healthier, more comfortable on-production environment for both cast and crew. For directors and cinematographers, clean mobile power expands creative possibilities by delivering reliable energy to remote or noise-sensitive locations without compromise. For producers and managers, it reduces operational risks such as generator failure, fuel shortages, and community noise complaints, helping productions stay on schedule and on budget. And for talent and crew, it means a quieter, cleaner workspace that reflects the industry’s commitment to innovation and sustainability.

In addition to these creative and experiential benefits, clean mobile power technologies, such as grid tie-ins, solar photovoltaics (PV), BESS, and HPUs, offer practical on-production advantages. They eliminate harmful exhaust and noise, simplify cabling and site logistics, and improve safety by reducing exposure to emissions. Productions can also realize cost savings by reducing both equipment rental and fuel expenses.

Together, these advantages enhance efficiency, safety, and artistic potential — making clean mobile power not only a health and climate solution, but also a catalyst for better filmmaking.

For clean mobile power manufacturers

The film and TV industry represents a high-visibility opportunity for manufacturers to demonstrate performance, refine products, and accelerate adoption across multiple sectors. Productions require quiet, portable, and reliable power systems — precisely the characteristics driving innovation in the broader clean energy economy.

Demand for mobile, zero-emissions power is also expanding across adjacent industries such as construction, live events, and telecommunications. This diversification enables manufacturers to scale production, reduce market risk, and strengthen supply chains across use cases. BESS solutions now make up an estimated 25%–30% of global energy storage, while hydrogen-based systems remain at the earlier stages of commercialization (low-carbon hydrogen production represents less than 1% of hydrogen production globally; there are expectations for it to meet 13% of final energy demand in 2050).[8]

Despite this momentum, there are still significant market opportunities for technology expansion because diesel generators still dominate the mobile power industry (at approximately 65%–75% market share).[9] By engaging directly with studios, suppliers, and industry alliances, manufacturers can design fit-for-purpose units tailored to production needs, build brand recognition in a creative and influential sector, and help establish clean mobile power as the new standard for mobile energy generation worldwide.

Solar

Solar panels (PV cells) absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity for immediate use (e.g., for basecamp trailer lighting and HVAC) or for storage in a connected battery system. On film and TV sets, solar PV is most commonly installed on the roofs of basecamp trailers to power lighting, HVAC, and small equipment.

Solar panels are robust, inexpensive, and relatively available for productions in most major film and TV production hubs in Canada and the United States, and have been revolutionary in decarbonizing productions’ basecamps. The solar panel industry has experienced several decades of large-scale production and innovation, and the fundamental costs for solar panels have declined sharply as a result. Manufacturers of ultraefficient basecamp trailers have been incorporating solar panels into trailer roofs since at least 2014. More recently, solar combined with batteries and energy efficient trailers are helping decarbonize basecamps and reduce reliance on diesel for low-load power needs on film and TV productions.

Battery energy storage systems

BESS are energy storage systems, not energy generation systems. As such, they can be recharged in a variety of ways, including via the grid, on-site renewables, HPUs (see below), or diesel generators. There are a variety of battery chemistries that have been under development and are advancing quickly; however, most batteries manufactured for BESS use lithium-ion or sodium-ion technology.[10]

Batteries are nearly silent, emit no local pollutants, can be recycled at the end of their life, and are readily mobile. Batteries can also offer 100% carbon-free power solutions if charged with renewable energy generated on-site, with HPUs supplied with green hydrogen, or when plugged into a grid powered by renewable energy. Although meeting larger loads with batteries alone can pose some challenges, several available battery solutions could effectively replace small to midsized diesel generators. Many options in the general mobile battery energy storage solutions space now routinely offer maximum sustained loads of more than 100 kW, with a growth rate in maximum sustained load of around 25%–30% over the past decade.[11] For some productions with limited or no access to the grid, using batteries would require access to solar recharging, additional production planning to move batteries off-site for charging, or an energy-as-a-service (EaaS) model to deliver fully charged batteries each day to a production site.

Hydrogen power units

HPUs for clean mobile power applications generally fall into two categories: fuel cell–based energy storage systems and combustion-based generators. In contrast, combustion based hydrogen fuel cells combine hydrogen gas with oxygen in the air to create energy. They produce no climate pollution when powered by green hydrogen, emitting only water vapor. They also do not produce harmful toxins or particulate matter, which are particularly noxious and bothersome when using diesel power generators. Furthermore, they require minimal maintenance compared with diesel generators and can deliver high power (100 kW or more) output with reliable performance over an extended service life span.

Combustion-based hydrogen generators, in contrast, create energy in a similar fashion to diesel generators: hydrogen fuel is burnt, and this small explosion of gas pushes on a piston, creating power. Because the hydrogen reacts with all parts (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) of the ambient air when it burns, combustion hydrogen generators emit small amounts of nitrogen oxides (however, no carbon dioxide, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds [VOCs], carbon monoxide, and sulfur oxide), impacting health and air quality. These emissions can be mitigated to near-undetectable levels with proper catalytic converter design, removing the particulate pollutants and VOCs associated with diesel units.

The carbon intensity of hydrogen-powered systems depends on the feedstock used to produce the hydrogen fuel, its supply chain, and the indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of hydrogen due to leakage. Green hydrogen, generated via electrolysis (electrically splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen) powered by renewable energy, can provide a fully carbon-free solution to hydrogen fuel production, if also transported sustainably. However, there are still challenges with ensuring a completely zero-carbon transportation route and no leakage during transportation.[12]

Image: A behind-the-scenes look at Hone’s hydrogen generator and fuel supply setup, which support clean, efficient energy generation for field productions.

HPUs offer another balance of advantages and drawbacks distinct from those of diesel, solar, and BESS, but their adoption in film and TV remains at a much earlier stage than diesel, solar, or BESS technologies. Although batteries and solar are relatively mature, somewhat cost-competitive, and familiar to crews, hydrogen is still highly dependent on the development of new infrastructure, carries higher equipment costs, and faces an immature regulatory environment. These factors mean that film and TV tailored hydrogen systems historically have required greater demonstration, education, and de-risking before progressing into production pilots. However, HPUs also offer certain advantages over BESS-based designs: their theoretical refueling time from empty is closer to that of a diesel generator, and hydrogen stores much more energy by weight than an equivalently sized lithium battery unit. See Exhibit 3 for a view of how these technologies stack up against each other, depending on location.

Recommended technology combinations

There is no one-size-fits-all solution for clean mobile power. Each production has unique power demands, site conditions, and access to technologies. As a result, the most effective strategy is to combine grid tie-ins, efficient solar trailers, batteries, and hydrogen in ways that optimize reliability, cost, and emissions reductions for the specific context. Exhibit 4 illustrates how different technology combinations can be tailored to production needs.

Solar

Product offerings

New efficient basecamp trailers utilize roof-mounted solar arrays to offer independent power day and night through integrated battery storage. Reliability is increased by the ability of trailers to share power, and smart prioritization features can send energy directly to loads as they occur in real time. New, efficient trailer designs often consume just 20% of the energy of legacy trailer designs. When combined with batteries to store the solar energy generated by trailers, it has allowed some productions’ basecamps in regions where these trailers are available to go almost diesel-free. Productions have recently started to implement solar powered basecamps, which are increasingly available in major production hubs across the U.S. and Canada.

There are various solar basecamp products on the market. For example, Quixote by Sunset Studios offers the Verde series trailers that are equipped with roof-mounted solar arrays ranging from 2 to 5 kW. The trailers are designed to run entirely off-grid using a 40 kilowatt-hour (kWh) integrated battery for at least 10 hours at full load.

In North America, another example is BI Production Works who manufacturers trailers equipped with approximately 5–8 kW of solar generation capacity and onboard integrated batteries. BI also has a dedicated electric power microgrid storage system called the EPS 360, which combines a 360 kWh battery and 10 kW of solar generation capacity with the ability to receive and send power to solar trailers.

These offerings underscore the growing availability of sophisticated, solar-enhanced trailer solutions in major production hubs. Many other major production transportation vendors already offer or have begun converting their existing fleets of trailers to incorporate solar and BESS, increasing the availability of efficient solar trailers for productions in North America.

Pilots and commercial traction to date

Across the industry, leading studios are already proving what’s possible with clean mobile power. The following case studies show how solar technologies are delivering measurable carbon and cost savings while maintaining reliable on-production operations.

Disney Los Angeles feature production (summer 2024): A recent Disney production in Los Angeles used Lightnin Thunderbolt solar trailers that relied on solar and battery power 97% of the time from June to August 2024. This reliance on clean mobile power resulted in reducing diesel fuel consumption by approximately 4,900 gallons.

Disney New Jersey television series (summer/winter 2023): A Disney television series production in New Jersey, spanning both summer and winter seasons, saw more varied results. Although weekly percentage run time on solar and battery equipment was quite high in the summer (between 90% and 100% from April to June), the winter months experienced much less total cumulative diesel-free run time. This basecamp ran diesel-free around 50%–70% of the time and generated less than a third of its power from solar in most weeks. This indicates that these roof-mounted solar panels still struggle to keep pace with the high resistive heating loads experienced during peak demand periods in the winter in high latitudes. Even so, the production recorded 7,000 gallons of diesel fuel saved.

Netflix New Mexico television series Ransom Canyon (winter/summer 2024): The Ransom Canyon basecamp was Netflix’s first to be fully powered by solar products using Greenlite trailers and a BI Production Works EPS-400 battery microgrid storage system. The production reduced its diesel generator fuel usage across all power needs, including for set, work trucks and additional equipment, by more than 50% by using a mix of large mobile batteries, solar trailers, and solar battery systems, saving 8,000 gallons of fuel. From April to mid-June, this system powered the basecamp for almost all 12 weeks of production, with the basecamp generator running for only three hours.

Battery energy storage systems

Product offerings

There are already several BESS products marketed to the film and TV industry in various stages of development and deployment. Small systems, like Instagrid’s GO and Anton Bauer’s EDEN, are 2–3 kWh systems capable of supporting low (2–4 kW) loads while being portable by hand by a single person. These are meant to act as a mobile wall outlet and are an option for crews looking to use battery power for a few key pieces of equipment, often in locations or shots that do not permit the use of larger power equipment due to space or flexibility constraints. Other, slightly larger systems, like the Portable Electric Voltstack 5 kW electric generator and REON Technology’s Mobile Power Station, are designed to be packed on trucks and driven by personnel on film and TV sets and offer greater power and energy storage than the GO and EDEN while offering the same connection types found on traditional small gasoline generators.

Unlike their smaller counterparts, clean mobile power technologies at the larger end of the market need to deliver power and performance in a form factor similar to the large, trailer-mounted diesel generators used today. The nearly ubiquitous tow plant generator is often the standard for reliability, mobility, and power delivery by which large BESS unit options are compared. Currently, there are fewer large BESS systems available configured for film and TV production use compared with the aforementioned smaller systems.

Some manufacturers, like Viridi and ElectricFish, opt for midpower units in the 30–50 kW range, with a variable amount of storage between 90 and 550 kWh. Because the overall rated output of these units is lower than that of a tow plant generator, some manufacturers enable paralleling or daisy-chaining of the units to allow for higher-power delivery and longer duration of the energy storage system.

Other units opt for larger power and storage capacity to more closely replicate the capabilities, form factor, and feel of a 1,400 A (210 kVA) tow plant. These units, like RIC Electronics’s CleanGen J250, have outputs around 90–100 kW with 200–300 kWh of storage while remaining towable by light-duty vehicles. The CleanGen J250 is the most widely available large BESS product purpose-built for the film and TV industry in North America. It has developed a solid track record in various set power applications and has been successfully used in many Netflix and Disney productions to date. CleanGen systems are useful for a variety of applications in a diesel-free production, such as powering equipment trucks and providing power to rigging, catering, and basecamp.

Newer BESS manufacturers, like Allye Energy, have shown promise by using second-life EV cells in a similar towable trailer form factor to combine large amounts of power delivery (180 kW) and storage (300–1,000 kWh or more) while keeping costs relatively low for early adopters. Allye’s medium form factor battery, the Max 300 (180 kW, 300 kWh), has received positive feedback in early pilots in and around London, particularly in remote locations without grid access.

Beyond the systems mentioned above, other manufacturers have built and deployed large BESS products initially for industries like construction, defense, and disaster relief, which also have applicability in the film and TV industry. Though there are some growing pains concerning form factor (especially size and weight), mobility, and power specifications associated with using these products as-is in film and TV, newer iterations that consider industry feedback look promising. ElectricFish’s 350Squared, a 400 kWh BESS built primarily for mobile EV fast-charging and backup site and building power, can provide a total of 350 kW to EVs and is set to deploy with major automotive, live events, and defense customers. Ampd Energy’s product lineup, which started in Southeast Asian construction projects needing voltages higher than those required by film and TV, has grown substantially and has been piloted in very short film and TV scenarios. Other BESS manufacturers of note, like Joule Case, have found meaningful traction among defense and public transportation customers.

However, BESS power products specifically built for the film and TV industry in this high-power, high-storage segment are still relatively few, and suppliers and studios note a gap in the market. Weight and footprint constraints continue to be pain points for production crews seeking flexibility and portability. Other logistical considerations, such as charging times and compatibility between the BESS and the power distribution system, favor crews experienced in navigating the new advantages and drawbacks of BESS technologies.

Pilots and commercial traction to date

The majority of battery manufacturers developing products tailored to the film and TV industry have to date been located outside of the United States. Manufacturing location paired with new BESS systems in the United States, which requires UL9540 certification (a costly and time-consuming process), resulted in most BESS pilot activities being conducted in countries like the UK (Allye Energy) and Australia (Ampd Energy).

In a recent Netflix pilot of the Allye Energy Max 300 in the United Kingdom in 2025, a single battery was deployed for six days to serve a remote location without grid access. It powered a variety of basecamp equipment, including catering equipment, hair and makeup popup tents, EVs and small battery charging, and other basecamp trailers. During the entire six-day period, the battery ran for a cumulative 99.5 hours, and diesel generators on production were powered for only 16% of the time (during peak demand periods without solar generation available). Notably, the entire equipment stack ran silently using only battery power during the whole weekend period of relatively low demand. The Max 300 is seen as an especially promising product, and the users reported they “would happily use [the Max 300] in another production as-is.”

These early case studies highlight how some high-power, high-storage BESS products are already demonstrating market readiness with respect to power delivery, energy storage, and reliability. Positive feedback from pilots on both Netflix and Disney productions has been impactful — Allye has seen new interest from capital markets due to these successes and is in line to become another contender in the clean mobile power market at scale.

Hydrogen power units

Product offerings

Hydrogen products marketed to film and TV are generally positioned as mobile replacements for diesel generators, designed to operate with similar duty cycles and applications. They do not share the drawbacks of BESS units of long charging times at comparable energy storage capacities and can often be refueled within 30 minutes. There are a handful of HPU products currently available and tailored for film and TV use. H2 Portable Power Corp. is an HPU manufacturer in Vancouver, Canada. Its APS-GT100 delivers 100 kW of sustained three-phase power at 120/208 V, stores just over 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of energy onboard its fuel cell–based unit, and is capable of rapid (less than 30 minutes) refueling. Hone, a manufacturer and hydrogen provider based in Toronto, is developing a system that combines a hydrogen combustion generator and a fuel storage trailer and is designed to offer many of the same operational benefits as the APS-GT100.

Tests and pilots to date

Because HPUs are newer, less familiar, and face higher infrastructure and regulatory hurdles compared with solar or batteries, productions have chosen to not deploy them directly on production without first proving reliability. Through the Clean Mobile Power Initiative (CMPI), we found that structured de-risking tests are an essential step to validate performance, build crew confidence, and clear the path toward pilots.

To de-risk these technologies for use in the industry, in-person technology tests were held to validate pilot readiness of HPUs. The testing protocols were designed to showcase the power, refueling, and operational characteristics of the HPUs, and two such tests were held with H2 Portable Power Corp and Hone. These tests were jointly hosted and designed by partners in CMPI, and key participating personnel from production studios, rental supply companies, and local safety and regulatory agencies were invited to attend.

Both in-person testing events featured similar fundamental power delivery tests, designed to create stress-test scenarios at the limits of what would be expected of a generator providing power to a set, including:

A high inrush current test, where the unit powered a 72 kW array of set lighting to 100% from cold bulbs.

A dimming test, where a variety of low-light-intensity dimming patterns were run on the same lighting array to demonstrate the ability to handle difficult harmonics and imbalance loads.

An extended power threshold test, where the unit was connected to lighting, charging, basecamp trailer, and HVAC loads until the total load equaled 90 kW average for one hour, around two times the load of an average tentpole production load.

An additional “bump test,” where a 70 kW Lightning Strikes lighting unit was pulsed while power was simultaneously maintained to an 18k HMI, with the goal to not lose power to the HMI throughout (Hone only).

Although set lighting is not the primary use case for these clean mobile power products, the bump test scenario effectively showcased what is possible from a power delivery standpoint. Generator operators present at the Hone test, for instance, noted how 70 kW Lightning Strikes units are nearly always given their own power source because of the intensity of the load when the lighting unit is powered. To keep an additional 18k HMI powered was, in one attending crew’s opinion, “exceptional.”

Feedback sessions held with all attendees at each event uncovered potential barriers to adoption — direct and indirect — that must be addressed for these HPUs to succeed at scale. Many of these considerations, such as spatial footprint concerns, fire safety regulations, and labor/union constraints, will require further cross-industry collaboration and engagement with manufacturers and policymakers to resolve. These tests successfully addressed a key, early blocker for real-world deployments, providing core technical and operational validation for production-specific use cases. Furthermore, the events fostered collaborative conversations among manufacturers, studios, equipment suppliers, and crews on pathways for further product refinement and deployment.

Both H2 Portable’s and Hone’s HPUs demonstrated an ability to sustain required loads for film and TV production. Pilots took place following the events after studio representatives witnessing the tests unanimously noted their desire to move both units to pilots on real productions. Those productions included:

Netflix, British Columbia, Canada (2025): Importantly for H2 Portable Power Corp., these tests successfully unlocked pilot opportunities for its fuel cell–based HPU, the APS-GT100, on TV and film productions. Since completing its round of testing in February 2025, the manufacturer has participated in two direct pilots on Netflix productions in British Columbia. In these pilots, the APS-GT100 unit powered EV charging and basecamp power needs (battery charging, multiple trailers’ power) in remote locations without grid access, receiving overall very positive feedback. Additionally, Netflix and production crews noted the hydrogen power unit was “very safe for use on set” once the key fire code requirements, such as safety clearances, were taken into consideration. The same contacts noted that they would happily use the unit again, given that some of the bugs uncovered (low-voltage battery issues early on) could be addressed. However, some key challenges, such as the inability to refuel the unit in the field with existing equipment and the need to power down the unit before refueling, highlighted the importance of the overall infrastructure when considering hydrogen power for use in film and TV. Because these isolated pilots were reasonably close to a refueling depot, refueling was eventually successfully demonstrated on a more extended deployment of H2 Portable Power’s unit. However, the need for some kind of field refueling solution was noted as well.

Demand- and supply-side efficiencies

Energy efficiency is crucial to control costs and ensure no energy is wasted on production. Switching to clean mobile power solutions offers an inherent efficiency gain over diesel generators as battery systems convert stored energy directly to electricity without the losses (heat, noise) associated with combustion engines.

Beyond clean mobile power, further changes can improve energy efficiency. First, steps can be taken to reduce the overall energy (and peak power) demand, also known as demand-side efficiencies. These strategies, such as the use of superefficient trailers and equipment (i.e., HVAC, lighting, appliances), more efficient LED set lighting, and operational changes (i.e., controls and sensors to reduce wasted energy) reduce the baseline load of a production, making scaled utilization of clean mobile power solutions more viable. Second, once energy demand has been established, addressing supply-side efficiencies by rightsizing power systems to meet the projected demand can reduce the inefficiencies of using oversized systems.

Demand-side efficiency measures: reducing load on productions

Demand-side efficiency measures play an important role in reducing the total energy demand on a production and allowing clean mobile power solutions to be deployed more effectively. One prominent example is the use of the aforementioned modern, efficient basecamp trailers. These trailers are often equipped with solar panels and efficient HVAC systems for heating and cooling, making them particularly effective in reducing emissions at basecamp. They are now readily available and deployed in productions across many major film markets in North America.

Another efficiency-focused technology is the use of LED set lighting. Compared with legacy equipment, LED lighting drastically reduces power demands while offering greater and faster creative control. Although adoption is often framed as a creative decision left to individual productions, LED lighting is now broadly available, widely used, and relatively cost-competitive, and is therefore becoming the industry standard.

Efficiency improvements can also be achieved through operational changes and controls. For example, smart sensors and automated systems in trailers can minimize wasted energy by ensuring equipment only operates when required.

Taken together, efficiency strategies can play a significant role in reducing overall energy demands. Exhibit 6 demonstrated that a typical large production in a warm environment can achieve up to a 54% redution in energy demand from a combination of efficiency measures. This scenario offers the greatest efficiency gains for a production as overall energy demands are greatest due to high cooling needs in these environments.

Fleet electrification and future load and operations planning As studios advance their decarbonization strategies through the transition of vehicle fleets to electric models, on-production power needs may shift. Although electrification reduces tailpipe emissions and gasoline or diesel usage, it also creates new charging demands on a set that must be considered in overall power planning. This underscores the importance of combining demand reduction with accurate load forecasting to ensure clean mobile power systems are sized to meet both set and fleet requirements.

Supply-side efficiencies: rightsizing and transitioning to clean mobile power

After reducing load through demand-side measures, productions can flexibly adjust the size of clean mobile power systems to meet their actual projected energy demands. This allows productions to avoid the inherent inefficiencies caused by the current fossil fuel status quo: drastic oversizing of generators versus the actual equipment loads.

Many film production sets are currently powered by large (1,400–1,800 A or 210–270 kVA) generators with connected loads far below their nominal power rating to avoid voltage drops when new loads are activated during the day. Exhibit 7 outlines a case study of a Vancouver film production that used three-phase, 1,400 A (210 kVA) generators to meet its energy demand. The average load for the production was only 4% of the diesel generator unit’s nameplate capacity, and during periods of maximum load, it was only 16% of that capacity, demonstrating that these power units were substantially oversized for the day-to-day energy demands of the production.

Despite strong interest and early momentum, widespread adoption of clean mobile power technologies across the entertainment industry remains limited due to a range of persistent market, technical, and operational barriers. Such barriers are explored below.

Technical and infrastructure gaps

Technical and infrastructure limitations pose challenges that continue to inhibit adoption. The main technical barrier to the broader adoption of clean mobile power technologies is the lack of availability of units that meet the specific needs of the production industry. As previously discussed, there is a wide range of applications for clean mobile power generation and storage solutions, including backup power, live events, construction, disaster relief, telecommunications, and others. As a result, many manufacturers are developing cutting-edge solutions; however, they do not (yet) fit the required size, power, and mobility specifications to easily integrate into film and TV production.

Some of the technical specifications that require industry-tailored approaches include:

Mobility of the unit: Due to the nature of film and TV productions moving to different locations or needing units to be recharged off-site in remote areas, the industry requires clean power generation and storage solutions that are easily mobile and can be moved more than one time per day, either towed by a standard truck or mounted on a flatbed.

Physical size of the unit: Many production sets are working with constrained space, and as a result clean mobile power units need to be sized to fit within a standard parking space.

Power demand: Clean mobile power units intended to serve as drop-in replacements for diesel generators and function optimally with the existing production equipment must be capable of matching the power outputs of existing diesel generators, including power unit size (at least 90 kW), voltage (120/208 V for Canada and the United States, 230/400 V for the UK), and duration (up to 14 hours).

A survey across major production studios, suppliers, and producers found that the limited supply of industry-specific clean mobile power units, and the volume required for significant adoption, was a major barrier to moving away from relying on fossil fuels within their productions.[40] Yet, through a combination of industry-wide efforts, such as publishing product specifications and requirements and the work of CMPI, the production industry has seen an increase in the development of clean mobile power technology solutions that meet its operational needs.

The lack of supporting infrastructure to enable the use of clean mobile power units on productions has also slowed uptake, including plug-in locations as well as hydrogen power production and distribution.[41]

Labor complexities

Union and workforce rules to date have complicated the responsibilities around handling clean mobile power units and refueling. These rules, and the labor roles they govern, were created during periods where fossil fuel–based technologies and workflows were the only way to feasibly provide power to a set. As a result, clean mobile power technology manufacturers with ambitions of entry into film and TV have largely had to create products that fit into the existing workflows for roles in the industry. When products or business models that do not fit these existing paradigms are introduced, there is often uncertainty over who is authorized to operate or maintain the new technologies, which in turn can slow decision-making and adoption on production.

This challenge is compounded by a decentralized workforce. Crew members are often spread across different organizations and production companies, each with their own protocols and levels of readiness. This fragmentation makes it difficult to ensure consistent training, safety standards, and operational practices. Further, these crew members may even own existing power equipment — usually fossil fuel–based — that they rent to productions as owner/operators. This creates additional friction with adoption, because the end-user for many clean mobile power products may be actively disincentivized to vouch for their adoption since this switch may impact the crew member’s previous investments.

Many crew members, including electricians and gaffers, also often have limited familiarity with new technologies, safety protocols, or fueling/recharging workflows. These knowledge gaps can slow adoption, increase costs, and reinforce reliance on conventional diesel systems.

Complex stakeholder coordination

Complex coordination among stakeholders also poses a significant barrier. The adoption of clean mobile power solutions involves a wide array of stakeholders, including studios, producers, rental companies, equipment manufacturers, unions, and production crews such as electricians and gaffers. Aligning incentives and priorities across this fragmented ecosystem is difficult, especially when legacy practices are deeply embedded and traditional budgeting processes divorce fuel costs from equipment rental costs.

Existing diesel rental stock is spread across a diverse set of owners, including rental houses as well as individual owner/operators, making transitioning to clean mobile power a multitarget process. Each group faces different financial pressures, technical needs, and decision-making timelines, which complicates coordinated investment in new equipment and supporting infrastructure.

Higher capital costs and budget misalignment

Another constraint slowing clean mobile power adoption is the significantly higher capital costs of clean mobile power systems, particularly batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, compared with traditional diesel generators.[42] Based on our analysis, these premiums can be up to three times more than diesel alternatives for HPUs and up to two times more for BESS units, creating economic friction for productions that are incentivized to choose the lowest-cost option. Additional transportation accessories can add to these costs, with BESS unit premiums potentially increasing to up to three times more than a diesel alternative when including the trailer rental costs.[43]

Furthermore, the budgeting structure of most productions fails to capture the full value proposition of clean mobile power systems. Fuel costs, for example, are often categorized separately from equipment rentals, making it difficult to account for long-term savings in operational budgets. Even when clean mobile power solutions reduce total fuel usage or improve efficiency, these benefits may not be easily visible within conventional budget frameworks.[44]

Operational/financial risk and reliability perceptions

Beyond economics and technology, entrenched practices act as barriers. Producers, production managers, and crews are accustomed to established workflows, trusted vendors, and equipment they know will “just work.” This culture discourages experimentation, even when clean mobile power systems are available. The preference for business as usual slows adoption.

Clean mobile power technologies are often viewed by those procuring and operating these systems as unproven or risky, which leads to conservative behavior, such as renting backup diesel generators to limit or avoid any possible downtime on a production. This practice can be a useful backup solution in the earlier stages of clean mobile power technology adoption; however, as clean mobile power units are normalized on production, it can result in increased costs and continue to entrench the pattern of the use of diesel generators on productions. Owners of traditional equipment frame diesel as more reliable, further engraining legacy systems and discouraging experimentation with new clean mobile power products. Productions are effectively “zero-failure environments,” so even small uncertainties around run time, recharging logistics, or new workflows are magnified.

Operational barriers also persist. Clean mobile power solutions often require different workflows, footprints, and safety protocols than diesel. These new processes — including revised setup logistics, recharging schedules, and updated safety requirements — can feel cumbersome to crews accustomed to conventional operations. In some cases, external factors compound these challenges: for example, some insurance policies require productions using clean mobile power units to have backup diesel generators on-site. Together, these operational changes and institutional requirements reinforce the perception of clean mobile power technologies as complex or risky, further dissuading users from change. Additionally, many productions lack robust energy management systems (EMS) and real-time energy data, leading to chronic oversizing of generators and underuse of alternative clean mobile power solutions.

Policy and regulatory patchwork

Government policies (or lack thereof) can limit widespread adoption of clean mobile power technologies. The inherent global nature of productions, including filming in multiple international locations, can result in productions needing to coordinate between different restrictions, regulations, and operation requirements. Furthermore, this patchwork across geographies leads to a lack of, or reduced, centralized signal to governments for future regulatory directions. For example, many incentive programs for clean mobile power use on productions, as well as pollution restrictions for diesel generators, are implemented or enforced at the municipal or occasionally the state or province level. As a result, scaling operations across different jurisdictions for suppliers, studios, and manufacturers can be challenging.

Furthermore, given the novel and quickly evolving nature of some of the technologies available, regulators are still developing safety-related codes and standards for these units and their corresponding fuel supply (where applicable). Permitting processes for large clean mobile power products across North America still often rely on schemes developed for fixed, utility-scale energy storage products. In many jurisdictions in the United States, authorities having jurisdiction now require a mobile battery over 20 kWh (just under one-third the size of a Tesla Model Y battery) to have a UL9540 listing. The process for achieving this listing, which was originally developed for large, fixed BESS installed at utility sites, is arduous for nascent manufacturers, costing several hundred thousand dollars for several months of testing in which a full-scale unit must be destroyed.

BESS and HPUs are still nascent technologies for which regulatory bodies in many countries such as Canada, the UK, and the United States have not finalized all regulations around the movement of the power units or the transportation of fuel for unit refueling. This level of regulatory uncertainty can provide added risk for suppliers looking to purchase clean mobile power, and raises operational challenges for productions navigating different rules and permitting processes across geographies.

Weak and misaligned demand signals

Finally, and very importantly, a key barrier to clean mobile power adoption is the fragmented nature of how power equipment is purchased, maintained, and operated across the industry. Many studios do not own their own equipment and therefore rely on renting power units from rental houses for use on their productions. This structure places rental houses in a critical gatekeeping role for clean mobile power adoption.

However, many rental houses remain hesitant to invest in or stock these products due to unclear or fragmented demand signals from production studios. Without tangible commitments — such as minimum guarantee rental agreements from studios — rental houses face uncertainty about utilization rates and, consequently, the payback periods for new equipment. Rental houses must absorb the full up-front capital costs of these systems while relying on steady rentals to recoup their investment over time. With no assurance of repeat bookings or long-term contracts, clean mobile power units represent a higher-risk asset on their balance sheets. This risk is compounded by the steep price differential compared with diesel generators.

The lack of forward-looking commitments from studios limits the confidence of rental houses to invest in clean mobile power systems, and in turn deprives clean mobile power manufacturers of the market signals needed to justify ongoing R&D, production scaling, and hardware product modifications to meet the needs of the industry. Without visibility into guaranteed purchase volumes or future demand, manufacturers are less likely to invest in next-generation product advancements, build out dedicated production lines, or secure component supply chains. And for many of the manufacturers reliant on external funding such as loans and venture capital investment, lack of commitments — such as prepurchase agreements or letters of intent from rental houses — can inhibit further access to capital from external financiers.

These interdependent value chain dynamics result in a stalled innovation loop: manufacturers hold back on improving, scaling, or investing in clean mobile power technologies for the film and TV industry due to perceived market risk; rental houses delay procurement due to high costs and uncertainty; and studios continue relying on diesel due to constraints of clean mobile power product availability.

The transition to clean mobile power will not happen through technology development alone. To overcome the barriers identified in the previous section, the industry must align around a set of clear, measurable objectives that collectively create the conditions for clean mobile power deployment at scale. These objectives reflect both the demand- and supply-side shifts required for success: reducing the overall energy footprint of productions to ensure that clean mobile power solutions are available and affordable, driving the investment needed to scale, and fostering widespread adoption and literacy on productions. By articulating these outcomes, we aim to address what the industry needs to accomplish to achieve widespread adoption of clean mobile power as an alternative to diesel generators. Section 5 provides recommended strategies to achieve these industry objectives.

Reduce energy demand on productions to efficiently deploy clean mobile power solutions

As discussed in Section 3, demand-side energy reductions, or energy efficiency, are critical components of effective deployment of clean mobile power on productions. This includes taking advantage of new technologies and best practices to reduce the overall load, followed by rightsizing power provisions to meet the actual energy demand of a production. We estimate that efficiency measures can reduce overall energy demand on a production by approximately 49% on average across range of production sizes and temperature environments, bringing a remote production from 309.4 MWh down to 158.38 MWh. Efficiency measures would also reduce peak load by an estimated 63%, from 258 to 95 kW.

We estimate that efficiency measures could reduce energy demand by roughly 286 gigawatt-hours (GWh) across the United States, the UK, and Canada collectively, or 158.13, 66.8, and 61.1 GWh, respectively, in 2026. These savings are roughly equivalent to powering two midsize cities (approximately 100,000 inhabitants) for a month (electricity only).

Increase availability of clean mobile power solutions that meet industry power needs in critical markets

The availability of clean mobile power units tailored to film and TV production needs is still nascent globally. The volume and accessibility will need to increase to be deployed on productions at scale.

There are three critical factors that will enable broader availability of clean mobile power:

Increasing the variety of clean mobile power products offered in the market, allowing for optimizing clean mobile power product selection based on geographic, operational, and energy demand considerations.

Expanding manufacturers’ production capacity to meet growing demand for clean mobile power products.

Ensuring greater market access by increasing the volume of clean mobile power products purchased by suppliers and made available for rental to productions.

Based on current estimated available clean mobile power units, availability would need to scale by 25 times to meet a total energy demand of 360.1 GWh for productions in the United States, Canada, and the UK (based on 2026 projected estimates).

The industry will need to address all three critical availability pieces to deploy enough clean mobile power units at scale to meet energy demand on production sets today and in the future.

Decrease costs of clean mobile power units and services to be equal to or below diesel generators

Although the core components of clean mobile power are proven and benefit from mature supply chains, their application in film and TV is early stage, which keeps unit costs high due to low production volumes and custom, on-production requirements. The primary pathway to cost reduction will be economies of scale. The main, long-term cost driver of these units built for film and TV is still expected to be the underlying components generating and storing power (i.e., fuel cells, battery cells, inverters, and panels), which have relatively mature production processes and supply chains already established. However, the costs of power equipment built specifically for film and TV are initially very high because of the unique and specific needs of the industry, such as those developed with industry partners through CMPI.[45]

Even with additional premiums associated with the use of clean mobile power, it is important to contextualize this with the broader costs of a production. The spend on power and utilities represents an average of 0.8% of a film or TV production’s overall budget. If solar + BESS power is four times the costs of traditional diesel generators today (levelized basis), using BESS solutions would represent a 2.4% increase in overall budget. Similarly, if HPU units are five times the cost, it would result in a 3.2% increase in overall budget.

Drive investment into clean mobile power technologies to expand product offerings and propel product scale

Investment is a critical component to both expanding the range of products and companies that are developing clean mobile power products as well as supporting these companies to ramp up and scale their production lines. Targeted capital is needed not only for early-stage manufacturers, but also for commercial-scale manufacturing, deployment, and supporting infrastructure.

Over the past five years, we have seen just over $38 billion of investment globally into mobile battery climate technology startups and an additional $1 billion of investment in hydrogen power and storage system startups. Average investment round sizes within the past five years have been just under $33 million for battery companies and just over $13 million for hydrogen companies.[46] However, most of this investment has flowed to transportation and stationary power applications, rather than to portable or mobile applications like those needed for film and TV. Redirecting even a small portion of this momentum toward clean mobile power technologies could unlock significant progress for the industry.

Increased investment throughout the value chain can enable manufacturers to scale production, lower per-unit costs through economies of scale, and develop clean mobile power products tailored to on-location production needs. Sustained capital flows, directed not only to technology development but also to expanding shared charging and refueling infrastructure and low-to-zero-emissions fuel production, are essential to move clean mobile power from pilot projects to mainstream industry adoption.

Promote adoption, buy-in, and literacy on productions to remove usage barriers

Widescale buy-in is the linchpin to success in scaling clean mobile power within the film and TV industry. Even if the industry can successfully develop, invest, and scale clean mobile power technologies, if production managers and crews are not champions for using these products and if gaffers do not know how to integrate these products safely and effectively into their operations, then the industry will not see meaningful progress in the use of clean mobile power technologies on production sets, particularly over the next couple of years.

Exhibit 12 highlights critical components needed to enable a flywheel of clean mobile power adoption.

Although stakeholder-specific leadership is essential, from studios setting clean mobile power utilization requirements on productions, to suppliers bringing new technologies to market, to financiers unlocking capital, none of these efforts will be sufficient on their own. Achieving clean mobile power at scale requires cross-industry collaboration and alignment. The barriers to deployment are systemic: fragmented demand, perceived financial and operational risk, and business models that are misaligned with long-term adoption. Building on the objectives outlined above, the industry must pursue coordinated, multistakeholder strategies that create the certainty, trust, and momentum needed to establish clean mobile power as the new standard.

To deliver on these objectives, several priority pathways for collaboration stand out.

Demand and supply formation

Aggregate demand and execute advanced market commitments

Barriers addressed: Weak demand signals, limited supplier investment

Objectives advanced: Increase availability, decrease costs, drive investment

Today, the market signal for clean mobile power is fragmented: each studio or production makes purchasing or rental decisions independently, often for short project cycles. This scattered demand is too inconsistent and small scale to justify major investment in new manufacturing capacity, supply chains, or service infrastructure. The result is a “chicken-and-egg” problem: suppliers hesitate to scale without guaranteed demand, while studios face high costs and limited availability.

If studios act collectively, aligning on technical specifications, timelines for adoption, and clear commitments to transition away from diesel, they can transform this fragmented demand into a reliable, bankable pipeline of orders. Even a modest aggregation across a few major studios can create market certainty at a scale that fundamentally changes supplier incentives. Extending this approach to adjacent industries with similar temporary power needs, such as live events, construction, or sports production, would further amplify purchasing power and create cross-industry learning.

The benefits are clear. A coordinated demand signal reduces per-unit costs through economies of scale, encourages suppliers to invest in production capacity and workforce training, and accelerates the diffusion of new technologies. Aggregation also helps standardize equipment specifications and service requirements, reducing friction in deployment and making it easier for suppliers to serve multiple clients. In effect, the industry can create its own market transformation.

In other sectors, advance market commitments have successfully catalyzed investment into emerging technologies by guaranteeing future demand once products meet agreed-upon performance- and cost-based targets. Studios and adjacent industries can establish an advance market commitment–style commitment for clean mobile power, thus providing manufacturers with confidence to advance development and suppliers with confidence to invest in products. This aggregated, performance- and metric-based demand signal can unlock the supply chain and accelerate clean mobile power adoption.

Such an effort to leverage advance market commitments for an industry-wide demand signal can be executed in various pathways. However, a phased approach of implementation can entail the following: Studios and key suppliers can begin by quantifying near-term clean mobile power demand across productions, identifying the volume, size, and types of units they could realistically deploy over the next several years. In parallel, stakeholders can align on shared cost, reliability, and performance criteria that clean mobile power needs to meet to qualify for procurement, providing suppliers with clear targets for investment and fleet expansion. These demand parameters can then be formalized through multiparty commitments that give manufacturers bankable assurance of future orders. Finally, the industry can designate a neutral convening body or coalition to coordinate commitments, monitor progress, and communicate aggregated demand to suppliers and investors. Executing these steps can convert high-level intent into measurable, investment-ready demand, unlocking supplier confidence, lowering costs, and accelerating the transition from pilots to scaled clean mobile power action.

Flagship pilots

Barriers addressed: Risk aversion, crew and public perception

Objectives advanced: Increase availability, promote adoption, drive investment

Flagship pilots on high-profile productions can serve as powerful proof points to de-risk technology reliability, showcase performance capabilities, and highlight creative compatibility in real-world settings. Film and TV productions are global storytelling platforms; therefore, these pilots carry unique influence. Case studies, behind-the-scenes features, or short-form content can spotlight the practical benefits of clean mobile power while normalizing technologies across the industry (and beyond).[47]

Disney and Netflix have already begun to demonstrate the power of this approach. Publicizing their clean mobile power success stories through sustainability reports, video-based storytelling content, and written articles helps redirect conversations from “can this work?” to “when will this become the standard?” Directors, producers, talent, and crews — trusted voices with cultural reach — have the power to accelerate industry-wide adoption, and broader cultural acceptance. Publicizing and promoting outcomes from these pilots builds confidence, buy-in and excitement; demonstrates reliability; and accelerates adoption and investment.

Capital and cost

Coordinate joint procurement and long-term purchasing frameworks

Barriers addressed: Risk aversion, high costs, fragmented purchasing, limited supply

Objective advanced: Decrease costs, increase availability, drive investment

Once demand has been aggregated through mechanisms such as advance market commitments, joint procurement can offer a practical pathway to translate those signals into action. By pooling purchasing power, studios and rental houses can reduce costs, share risk, and accelerate investment. These collective procurement efforts can evolve into bulk purchasing agreements or frame contracts, which secure volume discounts and provide manufacturers with predictable order pipelines. Such agreements can be structured to include performance criteria, standardized technical specifications, and delivery timelines, ensuring the new clean mobile power products meet the shared industry needs.

Coordinating purchases across multiple suppliers, and potentially studios, increases negotiating leverage, particularly for large-format BESS and hydrogen units. This lowers per-unit costs, stabilizes production schedules, and ensures clean mobile power solutions are available when needed.

Negotiating collectively — rather than ad hoc, individual purchases — unlocks economies of scale and creates greater certainty for manufacturers and investors alike. In effect, this approach transforms fragmented studio interest into a coordinated purchasing body, an essential bridge between intent and implementation.

Develop innovative financing and insurance mechanisms

Barriers addressed: High up-front cost, financial risk aversion

Objectives advanced: Decrease costs, drive investment, increase availability

One of the biggest obstacles to wider adoption of clean mobile power is the perception — and in some cases, reality — of financial and operational risk. Studios are reluctant to take chances on technologies that may not perform as reliably as diesel, especially when production timelines are tight and downtime is costly. Suppliers, on the other hand, often struggle to access affordable capital to scale up manufacturing, maintain fleets, or invest in charging and refueling infrastructure. The result is a financing gap that slows the transition.

New financial structures and risk-mitigation tools can help close this gap. Performance guarantees backed by insurers could reassure studios that clean mobile power systems will meet agreed reliability and output standards. This type of guarantee has been crucial in other sectors: in the early days of solar and wind energy, warranties and performance bonds played a significant role in building buyer confidence. Similarly, credit enhancements or blended finance vehicles, developed in partnership with commercial lenders and development finance institutions, can lower the cost of capital for suppliers, making it easier to scale fleets and infrastructure without passing high costs on to studios.

Studios can also play a catalytic role. Just as corporate offtake agreements helped unlock renewable energy projects, forward commitments from major studios can underpin new financing models. For example, if studios committed to multiyear service contracts, financiers would have the certainty they need to back supplier expansion. Insurers can then step in with tailored products, such as operational risk coverage or revenue guarantees, ensuring that suppliers are protected if unforeseen performance issues arise. The EV sector offers a useful parallel. Battery performance warranties and residual value guarantees were essential in building trust with fleet operators and financiers. Once these mechanisms were in place, leasing and fleet financing models expanded dramatically. The same kind of risk-sharing tools can unlock the widespread adoption of clean mobile power.

Together, these mechanisms spread risk across the ecosystem instead of leaving it concentrated with a single stakeholder. Such collaboration would not only unlock the flow of capital into the sector but also build the trust and predictability needed to make clean mobile power a reliable, mainstream option for productions worldwide.

Secure government incentives and rebates

Barriers addressed: High up-front cost, policy patchwork

Objectives advanced: Decrease costs, drive investment, increase availability

Governments can help bridge the near-term cost premium for clean mobile power units. Targeted policies such as voucher programs (e.g., California’s CORE), tax rebates, and low-interest loans or grants can significantly reduce up-front costs and de-risk investment. Aligning permitting and regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions would also simplify adoption for productions that move between regions.

Studios, suppliers, and equipment manufacturers can help shape these policies by collectively engaging with national, state, and local agencies to align incentives with broader clean energy and film and TV production goals. For example, industry associations can advocate for inclusions of clean mobile power technologies in existing off-road equipment or clean-fleet rebate programs or establish dedicated production-based incentives tied to verified emissions reductions. Ensuring that rebates are designed to be available for all equipment owners, including both larger-scale rental houses as well as smaller independent owner/operators, is critically important.

Clear, consistent incentives and policies can not only drive down costs for early adopters but also provide predictable market signals and give manufacturers the confidence to expand production and drive innovation. Coordinated advocacy across the industry can enable clean mobile power solutions to be recognized as key components of forthcoming energy-, pollution-, human health–, and production-related policy measures, accelerating cost parity, adoption, and deployment.

Operations and workforce

Adopt Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) models

Barriers addressed: Misaligned incentives, operational/logistical risk

Objectives advanced: Increase availability, decrease costs, promote adoption

Traditional equipment rental models place the burden of operation, performance, and fuel management on productions, whereas EaaS offers a different path. Suppliers provide turnkey, reliable, clean energy services, and productions pay for energy delivered rather than for equipment rented. This reduces complexity for productions while creating recurring revenue streams for suppliers that can support reinvestment and growth.

However, for the film and TV industry, EaaS models must be designed in partnership with unions and crews. Current agreements define who can transport and operate equipment on production, roles that are critical for both safety and fairness. If structured collaboratively, EaaS can complement rather than replace these responsibilities, with suppliers managing back-end logistics like recharging or refueling, and crews maintaining their established on-production functions. With proper training and engagement, it can even create opportunities for new skills and roles as clean power systems scale.

EaaS works best for productions with sustained or complex power needs, where predictable service is more valuable than the lowest up-front rental cost. Its success depends on suppliers investing in infrastructure and logistical capacity, and on studios, financiers, and unions aligning early to shape fair, reliable service models. Paired with demand aggregation and financing tools, EaaS can become a cornerstone of industry-wide adoption.

The live events industry has already begun adopting EaaS approaches for portable solar and battery units. Instead of renting equipment, festivals and concerts increasingly contract for “clean power packages” delivered as a service, guaranteeing reliability while reducing operational hassle. For example, Greener Power Solutions offers delivery, setup, operation, monitoring, and takedown of its clean mobile power, including batteries, converters, power trailers, and mobile solar and wind turbines as part of its packages.[48] A similar approach can be adapted and scaled for film and TV production.

Establish efficiency and utilization standards

Barriers addressed: Inefficient generator use, cultural inertia, and lack of clean mobile power normalization

Objectives advanced: Reduce demand, promote adoption

Efficiency-first planning must also become standard practice. Productions should measure real energy loads rather than rely on oversized diesel generator norms. Suppliers can provide real-time monitoring tools, while studios integrate efficiency protocols for lighting, HVAC, trailers, and operations.

At the same time, the industry should adopt baseline utilization standards for clean mobile power, for example, requiring clean mobile power quotes alongside diesel generators and/or mandating clean mobile power coverage of basecamp or catering loads where feasible. Standardized clean mobile power utilization ensures these technologies become the default practice, reduces discretionary avoidance, and generates comparable data across projects.

System enablers

Build shared charging and refueling infrastructure

Barriers addressed: Infrastructure limitations, operational complexity

Objectives advanced: Increase availability, decrease costs, drive investment

Charging hubs for BESS and hydrogen fuel depots remain scarce, creating logistical hurdles and reliance on diesel backups. Studios, suppliers, and governments can coinvest in shared infrastructure at major production hubs. Shared facilities reduce downtime, enable more efficient fleet management, and spread capital costs across multiple users. Transparent governance and access agreements are needed to ensure fair use.

Create standards, interoperability, and data transparency

Barriers addressed: Technical fragmentation, risk perceptions, and knowledge gaps

Objectives advanced: Promote adoption, drive investment, increase availability

Interoperability standards allow suppliers to build flexible fleets without fear of stranded assets. A shared data platform, aggregating anonymized metrics like kWh delivered, uptime, costs, and emissions avoided, would provide transparency, support investment decisions, and accelerate learning across productions and technologies.

Taken together

These strategies form the backbone of a collective approach to industry transformation. Demand aggregation builds market scale, while financing and insurance tools reduce perceived risks, and service-based models realign incentives for long-term growth. Each pathway requires joint action among studios, suppliers, crews, financiers, insurers, and policymakers. But the payoff is clear: lower costs, higher confidence, and a faster path from promising pilots to industry-wide adoption.

No single intervention will deliver this transition alone. Success depends on a coordinated approach that increases demand, expands availability, lowers costs, drives investment, and builds adoption simultaneously. The good news is that the industry has already begun to test many of these solutions in practice. By scaling them through collective action, the film and TV industry can establish clean mobile power not as a niche innovation, but as the new baseline for production. The next step is clear: each stakeholder group must translate these pathways into concrete commitments and actions.

This report is a roadmap for the US, Canadian, and UK film and TV industry to meet a broad industry commitment of reducing generator or mobile power emissions on productions through the adoption of clean mobile power technologies.

Adopting clean mobile power will not only reduce the global production emissions footprint of the film and TV industry, it will also bring other welcome benefits, including reduced noise and air pollution, and, ultimately, operational cost savings. This added value offers a compelling alternative that aligns with environmental goals and production needs.

This shift comes as the clean mobile power market is on the cusp of transformative growth, with the entertainment industry uniquely positioned to lead this transition. Worldwide, the cost of renewable alternatives is falling, following a decades-long trend. There has never been a better time to explore and develop this market.

However, the specific needs of the entertainment industry in terms of size and scale are not currently being met. This is where the industry can take control: advance market commitments, joint procurement strategies, and better planning and standards can convince manufacturers and rental houses that significant demand exists for these technologies, creating economies of scale that drive down still-too-high up-front costs. Successful pilots can build trust among the industry’s essential workforce.

Outside the industry, government incentives, rebates, and innovative financing and insurance strategies can further tip the balance toward clean mobile power.

No single initiative can solve this challenge, but taken together, a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable production environment is possible.

The technology to provide clean mobile power exists today. In many cases, it is already in use. But in addition to scale, cultural barriers to change persist: oversized generators instead of energy efficiency planning, siloed studios instead of joint action, business as usual over improved systems.

All of these challenges have solutions, but it will take every stakeholder in the production process, from studio heads to rental houses and manufacturers, to the men and women who make production sets run, coming together in pursuit of a shared vision.

The industry is not beginning from a standing start; momentum has already grown from studios’ sustainability commitments to real action on the ground. We are now at the decision point of how to scale these technologies and practices even further.

This report demonstrates how to get there, but it will take the entire industry to implement. In working together, the film and TV industry has an opportunity to bring about the clean mobile power revolution. If successful, the result will not only be cleaner, quieter, and healthier productions, but also a film and TV industry that helps shape the clean energy transition worldwide.

Glossary of terms

Ampere (A): A unit of electrical current flowing through a circuit. Contrary to engineering convention, diesel generators in the film industry (especially in the United States) are often described by the number of amperes of current they can support across all their 120 volt (V) phases. This report provides these current “ratings” in keeping with this industry shorthand alongside the generator’s prime kVA rating.

Battery energy storage system (BESS): A rechargeable battery that stores electrical energy (often from renewable sources) and supplies it when needed. These are quiet, emissions-free alternatives to diesel generators.

Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): A standard unit for measuring carbon footprints. It expresses the impact of all greenhouse gases (like methane and nitrous oxide) in terms of the amount of CO₂ that would create the same warming effect.

Clean mobile power: Portable energy solutions that do not rely on fossil fuels to store and distribute energy. Clean mobile power may rely on charge stored in battery cells, or chemical energy stored in hydrogen to store and generate this energy.

Coulombic efficiency: A measure of the charge efficiency in batteries, representing the ratio of the total charge extracted during discharge to the total charge injected during a full charge cycle.

Diesel generator: A portable power source that burns diesel fuel to generate electricity. Common on film sets and a major source of climate and air pollution.

Greenhouse gases (GHGs): Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Key examples include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These are often emitted during fuel combustion on productions.

Grid tie-in/power drop: Temporarily accessing the electric grid to use for production power while filming on location, or at a studio or backlot that does not have sufficient power.

Hydrogen power unit (HPU): A generator that either uses hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen-fueled internal combustion to generate power. It emits only water vapor and heat, and (for hydrogen combustion) trace NOx particulates. When powered by green hydrogen, it is a zero-emissions alternative to diesel.

Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO): A type of renewable diesel made from waste fats and oils. It burns cleaner than fossil diesel and can be used in existing diesel generators with little or no modification.

Kilovolt-ampere (kVA): A unit of electrical power equal to 1,000 volt-amperes. Specifically, kVA refers to the apparent power of an alternating current system: both the power used for useful work (as in kilowatts) and the power not used for useful work. This report uses kVA to describe the prime rating of conventional generators alongside the ampere-based shorthand described above.

Kilowatt (kW): A unit of power equal to 1,000 watts. It measures the rate at which energy is used or produced. For example, a 5 kW power unit can supply 5 kW of power at any given moment. This report uses kW to describe the output of battery- and hydrogen-based power units with inverters.

Kilowatt-hour (kWh): A unit of energy equal to using 1 kilowatt of power for one hour. It is used to measure total energy consumption over time — like how much electricity a set uses during a shoot.

Load: The total amount of electrical power required by all equipment running at a given time on production. Managing load is key to choosing the right power source and avoiding overuse of generators.

Prime rating: In variable-power generator systems, the maximum amount of power a generator can produce when it is used as the primary power source for an application over an extended period. This report defaults to using a power unit’s prime rating when power figures are given, unless noted otherwise.

Renewable diesel: A drop-in fuel made from renewable feed stocks such as vegetable oils, meaning it can blend with regular diesel at any ratio, within a fuel tank. This type of diesel runs cleaner than regular diesel, and the industry standard is a typical 65% reduction in life-cycle GHG emissions.

Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions from sources a company owns or controls (e.g., from the perspective of a film production, fuel burned in on-production generators or vehicles).

Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heating, or cooling (e.g., from the perspective of a studio, power used in studios).

Scope 3 emissions: Indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur in a company’s value chain but are not directly controlled or owned by the company (e.g., from the perspective of a film production, the emissions resulting from building and shipping a generator to a production for use on production).

""We're in the middle of a generational rebuild of America's power system, and it's moving faster than anyone expected,"" said Vinnie Campo, Co-Founder and CEO of Haven Energy. ""Solar and home batteries have redefined power, delivering cleaner, cheaper, and more resilient energy than anything else on the market. Haven is scaling that transformation from the ground up by turning every home into the foundation of a smarter grid. Through partnerships with utilities and local installers, we're expanding faster than traditional infrastructure ever could. The future of power isn't years away. We're building it now.""

U.S. energy demand is projected to rise 15% by 2030, at a pace faster than new generation and transmission can be built. The result will be higher costs, more outages, and mounting strain on the grid. Haven is addressing this challenge by partnering with utilities to deploy home solar and battery systems to their customers. These distributed energy resources (DERs) give utilities flexible, local capacity that strengthens the grid and helps bring energy costs down.

Today, Haven has installed more than 10 MW of distributed capacity and has more than 50 MW in development for 2026, with over $75 million worth of projects in the pipeline. This capacity supports both Haven's growing VPP and the utility-run programs that Haven builds on behalf of its utility partners. Existing partners include the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Clean Power Alliance (CPA), San Jose Clean Energy (SJCE), Clean Energy Alliance (CEA), and Peninsula Clean Energy (PCE).

""Our utility partnerships will form the backbone of how we scale distributed capacity nationwide,"" said Jeff Chapin, Co-Founder of Haven Energy. ""The distributed generation sector has always been at odds with utilities, but we believe the future requires close collaboration to fully maximize the grid value of distributed assets, especially energy storage. Working with utilities isn't a nice-to-have anymore, it's a must. We've refined this model through multiple and successful collaborations, showing how quickly distributed capacity can scale when everyone is aligned. Haven is now building on that success, helping our partners lower costs and strengthen grid resilience faster than ever.""

The funding will also support the expansion of Haven's leasing model and Channel Partner Program. The program enables trusted local installers to offer Haven's solar and battery systems directly to homeowners and integrate the installations into the company's VPP. Haven manages financing, operations, and performance, allowing installers to focus on what they do best—installing.

""We're in the midst of one of the largest energy buildouts in a generation, and the companies that can scale quickly will define it,"" said Tommy Stadlen, Co-Founder of Giant Ventures. ""Haven is at the forefront of this shift, expanding grid capacity faster than traditional infrastructure ever could, leading with innovative models that expand access, and by bringing more individual homes into connected, intelligent energy assets.""

""Haven is demonstrating how quickly distributed energy generation and storage can scale when financing matches the realities of deployment,"" said Zeev Krieger, CEO of Turtle Hill Capital. ""Their approach is helping bring online resilient, reliable power at a moment when the grid needs it most.""

Some high-profile oil and gas industry leaders and organizations have objected to changes to long-standing government policy positions that give companies firm ground on which to make their plans.

And the financial picture around oil and gas drilling is moving against the Trump administration’s hopes. Though politicians may tout new opportunities to drill offshore or in Arctic Alaska, the commercial payoff is not clear and even unlikely.

Having worked in and studied the energy industry for decades, I’ve seen a number of discoveries that companies struggled to moved forward with because either the discovery was not large enough to be commercially profitable or the geology was too difficult to make development plausible. Market conditions are the prime drivers of U.S. energy investment – not moves by politicians seeking to seem supportive of the industry.

Market fundamentals trump policy announcements

The general decline in oil prices from 2022 through late 2025 has reduced the attractiveness of many drilling investments.

And opening the East and West coasts to drilling may sound significant, but these regions have unconfirmed reserves. That means a lot of subsurface work, such as seismic surveys, stratigraphic mapping and reservoir characterization – potentially taking years – would need to be done before any drilling would begin.

Offshore drilling also faces enormous opposition.

On the West Coast, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta have made forceful statements against any new California offshore oil drilling. They have said any effort is economically unnecessary, environmentally reckless and “dead on arrival” politically in the state.

California local governments, environmental groups, business alliances and coastal communities also oppose drilling and have vowed to use legal and political tools to block them.

There is opposition on the East Coast, too. More than 250 East Coast local governments have passed resolutions against drilling.

Governors on both sides of the aisle, including Democrat Josh Stein of North Carolina and Republicans Brian Kemp of Georgia and Henry McMaster of South Carolina, have spoken out against drilling off their coasts.

Arctic drilling is even harder

Drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Beaufort Sea off Prudhoe Bay in Alaska would be a massive undertaking. These projects require years of development and are subject to future reversals in federal policy – just as Trump has lifted long-standing drilling bans in those areas, at least for now.

In addition, Alaska is one of the most expensive and technically challenging places to drill. Specialized equipment, infrastructure for frozen landscapes, and risk mitigation for extreme weather drive costs far above other regions. These projects also face logistical challenges, such as pipelines running hundreds of miles through remote, icy terrain.

Natural gas from Alaska would likely be sold to Asian buyers, who increasingly have alternative sources of supply from Australia, Canada, Qatar and even the U.S. Gulf Coast. As production rises in those places, the entrance of Alaskan natural gas into the market raises the risk for global oversupply, which could depress prices and reduce profitability.

Despite political support from the Trump administration, the oil and gas companies would need financing to pay for the drilling. And those loans won’t come if the oil companies don’t have agreements with buyers for the petroleum products that are produced. Major oil companies have withdrawn from Alaska and signaled skepticism about attractive long-term returns.

Trump has helped some

In the first 10 months of the second Trump administration, the president has signed at least 13 executive orders pertaining to the energy industry. Most of them focus on streamlining U.S. energy regulation and removing barriers to the development and procurement of domestic energy resources. However, the broad nature of some of these orders may fall short of establishing the stable regulatory environment necessary for the development of capital-intensive energy projects with long time horizons.

Those efforts have reversed the Biden administration’s go-slow approach to oil drilling, reducing – though not completely eliminating – the backlog of requests for onshore and offshore drilling permits that accumulated during Biden’s presidency.

Delays in permit approvals increase project costs, risk and uncertainty. Delays can increase the chances that a project ultimately is downsized – as happened with ConocoPhillips’ Willow project in Alaska – or canceled altogether. Longer timelines increase financing and carrying costs, because capital is tied up without generating revenue and developers must pay interest on the debt while waiting for approvals. Delays also lead to higher project costs, eroding project economics and sometimes preventing the project from turning a profit.

Investment follows economics, not politics

Unlike in some countries, such as with Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, Norway’s Equinor or China’s CHN Energy, the U.S. does not have a national oil or gas company. All of the major energy producers in the U.S. are privately owned and answer to shareholders, not the government.

Executive orders or political slogans may set a tone or direction, but they cannot override the fundamental requirement for profitability. Investments can’t be mandated by presidential decree: Projects must make economic sense. Without that, whether due to low prices, high costs, uncertain demand or changing regulations, companies will not proceed.

Even if federal policies open new areas for drilling or relieve some regulatory restrictions, companies will invest only if they see a clear path to profit over the long term.

With most energy investments costing large amounts of money over many years, the industry likely wants a sense of policy stability from the Trump administration. That could include lowering barriers to profitable investments by accelerating the approval process for supporting infrastructure, such as transmission power lines, pipelines, storage capacity and other logistics, rather than relying on sweeping announcements that lack market traction.

The order directed federal agencies to halt new or renewed permits, leases, rights-of-way and other approvals for onshore and offshore wind energy projects pending the Trump administration’s review of federal wind policy.
Saris vacated the Wind Order in its entirety, effectively ending the nationwide freeze.
President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security.""
""We won our lawsuit and stopped the Trump administration from blocking an array of new wind energy projects.","A federal judge on Monday struck down an order by President Donald Trump that blocked the development of wind energy projects.

Trump issued the order, known as the ""Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects,"" or the Wind Memo, on Jan. 20, 2025. The order directed federal agencies to halt new or renewed permits, leases, rights-of-way and other approvals for onshore and offshore wind energy projects pending the Trump administration’s review of federal wind policy.

Judge Patti Saris, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, struck down the agencies’ implementation of the memo, known as the Wind Order.

TRUMP UNVEILS MAJOR ROLLBACK OF BIDEN FUEL RULES, PUTS GASOLINE BACK IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT

Seventeen states, Washington, D.C., and Alliance for Clean Energy New York (ACE NY) filed the lawsuit, claiming the order violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

Saris agreed and ruled on Monday that the order was ""arbitrary and capricious."" She also ruled that the freeze itself was ""contrary to law,"" saying that agencies are required to process permits within a reasonable amount of time.

Saris stated in her order that federal agencies failed to offer an explanation for halting the permits beyond the enforcement of the presidential memo. Additionally, she wrote that the agencies did not meaningfully analyze relevant issues before implementing the freeze.

""This scant administrative record makes clear, and the agency defendants do not meaningfully dispute, that the agency defendants have not 'reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the[ir] decision' to implement the Wind Order,"" Saris wrote in her ruling. She added that the defendants ""candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the president’s direction to do so.""

Saris vacated the Wind Order in its entirety, effectively ending the nationwide freeze.

The White House defended Trump's order in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

""Under Joe Biden’s Green New Scam, offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said ""President Trump’s day one executive order instructed agencies to review leases and permitting practices for wind projects with consideration for our country’s growing demands for reliable energy, effects on energy costs for American families, the importance of marine life and fishing industry, and the impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns. President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security.""

Even so, Carson’s team is evaluating a range of potential solutions, including heat-storing batteries and shallower geothermal networks, in case Earth Source Heat doesn’t work as well as hoped.","ITHACA, N.Y. — A faded-red wellhead emerged in the middle of a pockmarked parking lot, its metal bolts and pipes illuminated only by the headlights of Wayne Bezner Kerr’s electric car. He stepped out of the vehicle into the dark, frigid evening to open the fence enclosing the equipment, which is just down the road from Cornell University’s snow-speckled campus in upstate New York.

We were there, shivering outside in mid-November, to talk about heat.

Bezner Kerr is the program manager of Cornell’s Earth Source Heat, an ambitious project to directly warm the sprawling campus with geothermal energy pulled from deep underground. The wellhead was the tip of the iceberg — the visible part of a nearly 10,000-foot-long borehole that slices vertically through layers of rock to reach sufficiently toasty temperatures. Cornell is using data from the site to develop a system that will replace the school’s fossil-gas-based heating network, potentially by 2035.

“We can’t decarbonize without solving the heat problem,” Bezner Kerr repeated like a refrain during my visit to Ithaca.

The Ivy League university is trying to accomplish something that’s never been done in an area with rocky geology like upstate New York’s. Most existing geothermal projects are built near the boundaries of major tectonic plates, where the Earth’s warmth wells up toward the surface. Iceland, for example, is filled with naturally heated reservoirs that circulate by pipe to keep virtually every home in the country cozy. And in Kenya and New Zealand, geothermal aquifers supply the heat used in industrial processes, including for pasteurizing milk and making toilet paper.

Bezner Kerr and I, however, stood atop a multilayered cake of mudstone, limestone, sandstone, and other rocks — seemingly everything but water. To access the heat radiating beneath our feet, his team will need to create artificial reservoirs more than 2 miles into the earth.

America’s geothermal industry has made significant strides in recent years to generate clean energy in less obvious locations, and it’s done so by adapting tools and techniques from oil and gas drilling. One leading startup, Fervo Energy, is developing ​“enhanced geothermal systems” in Utah and Nevada to produce clean electricity around the clock. The approach involves fracking impermeable rocks, then pumping them full of water so that the rocks heat the liquid, which eventually produces steam to drive electric turbines.

Earth Source Heat plans to use similar methods to drill a handful of super-deep wells and create fractures near or within the crystalline basement rock, where temperatures are consistently around 180 degrees Fahrenheit, no matter the weather above. The project is also unique in that, among next-generation systems, it’s focused only on heating buildings — not supplying electricity — for the nearly 30,000 students and faculty. That’s because heat represents the biggest source of Cornell’s energy use, and its largest obstacle to reducing planet-warming emissions.

On the chilliest days, the campus can use up to 104 megawatts of thermal energy, which is more than triple its peak use of electrical energy during the year.

Such a ratio poses a big conundrum for not only large institutions like Cornell but also any cold-climate cities that burn fossil fuels to keep warm, as well as manufacturing plants that require lots of steam and hot water for steps as varied as fermenting beer, making oat milk, and sterilizing equipment.

Right now, one of the most immediate ways to cut emissions from thermal energy use is to replace gas-fired boilers and the like with heat pumps and other electrified technologies. But that can substantially increase a city’s or factory’s electricity use. In an ideal world, all the new power demand would be satisfied by renewable energy projects and served by a modern and efficient grid, helping limit the costs and logistical headaches of ditching fossil fuels.

In reality, though, the U.S. electricity system is straining to keep up with the emergence of data centers, new factories, and electrified buildings and vehicles. Utilities are pushing plans to build new gas-fired power plants and proposing higher electricity rates to cover the costs. New York, for its part, is failing to meet its own goals for installing gigawatts of new renewables and energy storage projects by 2030, in part because of barriers to permitting projects in the state. New York’s independent grid operator recently warned of ​“profound reliability challenges” in coming years as rapidly growing demand threatens to outpace supply.

Geothermal heating could provide a way to curb thermal-energy emissions without burdening the electric system even more, said Drew Nelson, vice president of programs, policy, and strategy with Project InnerSpace, a nonprofit that advocates for geothermal energy use.

“Electrification is great, but that’s a whole lot of new electrons that need to be brought onto the grid, and a whole lot of new transmission and distribution upgrades that need to be made,” Nelson said by phone. ​“For applications like industrial heat, or building heating and cooling, geothermal almost becomes a ​‘Swiss Army knife,’ in that it can help reduce demand.” Using geothermal energy directly is also far more efficient than converting it to electricity, since a lot of energy gets lost in the process of generating electrons.

Still, deep, direct-use geothermal systems like the one Cornell is developing are relatively novel, and many manufacturers and city planners are either unfamiliar with the solution or unwilling to be early adopters.

Sarah Carson, the director of Cornell’s Campus Sustainability Office, explained that Earth Source Heat is intended to reduce technology risks and costs for other major heat users that might benefit from geothermal, including the region’s dairy producers and breweries. We spoke inside her office, which is attached to the 30-megawatt gas-fired cogeneration plant that currently provides both electricity and heating for the campus.

“We’re working really hard to build a ​‘living lab’ approach into the ethos of how we approach things,” she said. ​“Can we not only take care of our own [carbon] footprint but also help develop and demonstrate solutions that could scale out?”

Inside the Lake Source Cooling facility, giant blue pipes intersect through pieces of equipment called heat exchangers. Since heat naturally flows from hotter objects to colder ones, the lake water acts like a magnet, pulling heat out of the campus-water loop. The lake-water loop then moves the heat down to the cold bottom of Cayuga, and the cycle repeats. Bezner Kerr said Earth Source Heat will do the same but in reverse, flowing hot water up to the surface and returning the cooled-off water underground, where the earth can continuously reheat it.

Initially, he said, the new geothermal system will connect to an existing underground hot-water loop that heats East Campus, including two energy-intensive research buildings. This first stage is expected to cost over $100 million and could be completed in the next few years. Depending on how Earth Source Heat performs, the university might expand the system to warm around 150 large buildings on the main campus.

The university’s approach is far more intensive than the geothermal systems that cities and high-rise buildings are increasingly deploying across the country. An underground thermal network in Framingham, Massachusetts, consists of 90 holes drilled about 650 feet deep that heat 36 homes and commercial buildings; it also uses electric heat pumps to boost the temperatures coming out of the ground. Cornell’s home city of Ithaca has proposed piloting its own thermal network to heat and cool buildings on a city block.

Jefferson Tester, a Cornell professor and the principal scientist for Earth Source Heat, said these shallower geothermal systems aren’t as practical for heating the 15-million-square-foot campus.

For one, the university would need to drill north of 10,000 smaller wells to adequately warm all its buildings, instead of the five very deep wells it has planned. And digging deeper into the ground will allow Cornell to use the heat straight away, without adding heat pumps.

Tester joined Cornell in 2009 to help launch Earth Source Heat, which is part of the university’s larger plan to achieve a carbon-neutral campus in Ithaca by 2035. For over a decade, faculty and engineers gathered data and developed models to get a better sense of the region’s geology, heat resources, and potential for drilling-related earthquakes, often in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy.

But to fully grasp the subsurface’s conditions, they needed to drill. ​“And once you understand the geology well enough … you could go anywhere in this region” to harness geothermal energy, Tester said.

In 2022, the university drilled that first 10,000-foot-long hole, which is called the Cornell University Borehole Observatory, in the parking lot. ​“It was the same level of intensity as an oil-and-gas exploration rig,” Bezner Kerr recalled. ​“It was oil-and-gas workers drilling a well that produces knowledge instead of producing hydrocarbons.” Cornell received about $7 million from the Energy Department for the project, which cost around $14 million to deploy.

Now the team is ready to drill again, though the timing of the next phase is up in the air amid funding uncertainty.

Earth Source Heat wants to reopen the borehole, deepen it, and use fiber-optic cables and other tools to study how the rock responds to stress and high-pressure injections of water — data that will inform the design of the final system. In 2024, during the Biden administration, Cornell applied for over $10 million from the Energy Department for the project, with plans to line up drilling equipment this year. But the Trump administration hasn’t yet responded to the request.

If the team can finish the second phase of its borehole observatory, the next step will be to drill a demonstration well pair — two vertical spines with horizontal legs, and fractured rocks in between — to begin heating part of East Campus.

The drilling delays come as Cornell faces growing criticism from climate activists both on and off campus, who argue that the university isn’t reducing its emissions nearly fast enough to help limit global temperature rise. Cornell on Fire, a climate-justice group, has framed Earth Source Heat in particular as too big of a gamble, given the project’s tenuous timeline for completion and the risks involved with deploying a first-of-its-kind solution.

Carson said her office is feeling pressure from climate advocates to start replacing the current gas-fueled heating network with electrified technologies like heat pumps and electric boilers. But she and her colleagues believe that swiftly boosting Cornell’s electricity demand would require increasing gas-fired power generation off campus, reducing the school’s CO2 footprint on paper without lowering emissions overall. Even so, Carson’s team is evaluating a range of potential solutions, including heat-storing batteries and shallower geothermal networks, in case Earth Source Heat doesn’t work as well as hoped.

These tensions highlight the tricky reality of developing big and novel clean-energy projects. A well-designed, smartly managed geothermal system could help decarbonize heat for buildings and factories over the course of many decades. But finding the right locations and best ways to install those networks takes careful planning, patience, and significant upfront investment. That can be tough to stomach, both for project investors antsy to see financial returns and for citizens eager to dump polluting fossil fuels today.

One Republican, Sen. Greg Walker, voted with the committee’s two Democrats against moving the proposal forward.

It is unclear, however, if there is enough support from the full chamber to pass the new congressional map backed by Trump into law. A few state senators on the elections committee voted to advance the bill but indicated they may vote against it later this week.

State Sen. Greg Walker, an Indiana Republican who is against redistricting, spoke about multiple threats made against him. About a dozen Indiana lawmakers have said they received threats in recent weeks as the state Legislature debates redistricting, which is backed by Trump.

“I refuse to be intimidated,” Walker proclaimed in an impassioned speech during an elections committee meeting on the legislation. “I fear for all states if we allow intimidation and threats to become the norm.”

He said that while he was holding a baby the previous night, “I began to cry as I thought about the future of that child where we accept that intimidation is normal.”

Walker, who is not seeking reelection, choked up as he said he’s considering filing anyway.

The federal judge says the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Crockett told a cheering crowd in Dallas to “tune out” those who say she can’t win in the GOP-dominated state because she is Black, a woman or a Democrat.

“I want to be clear. I’m not running just to run,” Crockett said. “This is about winning.”

The event opened with a video of Crockett, with audio of President Donald Trump criticizing her playing over it.

“As a candidate who is constantly attacked and seen as a threat,” she said, “that’s because I am.”

“What we need is for me to have a bigger voice,” Crockett said. “We need to make sure that we are going to stop all of the hell that is raining down on all of our people.”

GOP Sen. John Cornyn says he is eager for the prospect of facing U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett as the Democrat joins the race for the seat he currently holds.

“I think that would be a lot of fun,” he told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. “She just says such inflammatory and crazy things.”

But to face Crockett, Cornyn would need to survive a competitive GOP primary, which he acknowledged may advance to a runoff in May.

“I’ve been through a lot of campaigns before,” he said. “I actually kind of like them and so I look forward to the competition.”

“We’re doing what we need to do,” he added, “and we’re following our plan.”

A federal magistrate judge on Monday rejected a bid by Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters to be released from prison while she appeals her state conviction for orchestrating a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race.

Peters argued that the magistrate judge should free her because she said the state judge who sentenced her to nine years behind bars violated her First Amendment rights. Peters claimed he punished her for making allegations about election fraud, but prosecutors argued that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed judges to consider people’s speech during sentencings if they deem it relevant.

President Donald Trump and other supporters have called for Peters to be released. In August, Trump warned he would “take harsh measures” if Peters wasn’t freed, posting on Truth Social that “she did nothing wrong.”

A federal judge investigating whether Noem should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador wants to hear from a top Justice Department official and a whistleblower.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Monday ordered the government to make Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign available for testimony on Dec. 16. Boasberg wants to hear a day earlier from fired Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni.

In March, Boasberg ordered the administration to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. Instead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off the contempt probe.

Boasberg is trying to determine whether the administration willfully ignored his order and should be referred for prosecution on a contempt charge.

Reuveni filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a Justice Department official suggested the Trump administration might have to ignore court orders as it prepared to deport the migrants. The administration has denied those allegations and any wrongdoing.

Tucked into the National Defense Authorization Act that Congress is taking up this week is a provision that threatens to withhold money from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget if the Pentagon declines to hand over “unedited video of strikes” against drug cartels in Central and South America.

The congressional committees overseeing the military have been pressing the Pentagon for more answers on a boat strike after a press report that one operation had fired on two survivors of an initial strike who were clinging to a partially-destroyed boat.

While lawmakers with leadership positions on those committees were able to review the video last week, it has not been provided to the full committee and stayed in the possession of the Department of Defense.

Is the president taking sides in what could become a competitive GOP primary for New York governor? Not just yet.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, one of Trump’s most stalwart supporters in the party, has already launched a bid. But Nassau County executive Bruce Blakeman, similarly a Trump ally, is considering a run.

As a reporter on Monday asked about Stefanik, Trump interjected and said, “She’s great.” When the reporter continued about Blakeman, Trump added: “He’s also great.”

“He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people,” Trump said. “We have a lot of great people in the Republican Party.”

Stefanik was initially nominated to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but ultimately stayed in the House as to not risk the GOP’s narrow majority in the chamber.

Blakeman has been openly considering a run and last month announced a listening tour with stops across New York state.

Twelve former FBI agents fired after kneeling during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington sued Monday to get their jobs back, saying their action had been intended to de-escalate a volatile situation and was not meant as a political gesture.

The agents say in their lawsuit that they were fired in September by Director Kash Patel because they were perceived as not being politically affiliated with President Trump. But they say their decision to take a knee on June 4, 2020, days after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, has been misinterpreted as political expression.

The lawsuit says the agents were assigned to patrol the nation’s capital during a period of civil unrest prompted by Floyd’s death. Lacking protective gear or extensive training in crowd control, the agents became outnumbered by hostile crowds they encountered and decided to kneel to the ground in hopes of defusing the tension, the lawsuit said. The tactic worked, the lawsuit asserts — the crowds dispersed, no shots were fired and the agents “saved American lives” that day.

“Plaintiffs were performing their duties as FBI Special Agents, employing reasonable de-escalation to prevent a potentially deadly confrontation with American citizens: a Washington Massacre that could have rivaled the Boston Massacre in 1770,” says the lawsuit, which was filed by attorneys with the Washington Litigation Group.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says the reason farmers need billions of dollars from the federal government is largely because of President Donald Trump’s “disastrous” tariff policies.

“Now Donald Trump’s patting himself on the back, acting like a hero to farmers while using taxpayer dollars to clean up the mess he created,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “It’s textbook Donald Trump incompetence.”

Trump announced $12 billion in economic assistance to farmers earlier Monday. Schumer said a one-time payment is “cold comfort” for farmers who have suffered anxiety and financial losses.

“Farmers do not want a handout. Ask them,” Schumer said. “They want markets. But Donald Trump’s policies have killed the markets our farmers rely on to make a living.”

The president backed away from his comments last week in which he said “No problem” when asked if he would release footage of the military’s strike on a boat in the Caribbean and a follow-on attack that killed survivors.

When asked by a reporter, he denied that he said, “no problem” last week. Instead, he said, “Whatever Hegseth wants to do is OK with me.”

But last week, Trump said, “Whatever they have we’d certainly release.”

The president on Wednesday also seemed to acknowledge that the boat was capsized when the survivors were hit.

“I saw the video. They were trying to turn the boat back to where it could float,” he said. “We don’t want to see that because that boat was loaded up with drugs.”

The White House says China has agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans by the end of the year under a new agreement made in October.

But so far, China has bought about 2.8 million metric tons. Trump boasted in his meeting that China has promised to buy more than $40 billion of soybeans.

He may be referring to China’s pledge — as claimed by his administration — to buy at least another 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in each of 2026, 2027, and 2028. Beijing, however, has yet to confirm those numbers.

The president remarked on how his Cabinet meeting last week went long — in fact it was more than two hours, with the president’s eyelids appearing to flutter shut and his budget director doodling as it dragged on.

“We’re gonna go a little faster,” Trump said.

He then gave the floor to one of his top economic advisers, Kevin Hassett, but pleaded: “Go real fast, Kevin.”

Hassett did not quite go fast, and he seemed to realize it. He reassured the room: “I’m going fast.”

The Trump administration’s bridge payments for farmers are scheduled to go out the door in February.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the payments will move by Feb. 28. An initial $11 billion will target farmers of row crops, while another $1 billion is still being sorted out for specialty crops.

Farmers who are eligible to apply for the aid will know more about what the numbers look like in “the next couple of weeks,” Rollins said.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says $1 billion of the farming aid is being held back initially, though it will eventually go to help cover specialty crop expenses.

Rollins said $11 billion would be released in the first phase of the aid program to farmers — not the $12 billion Trump announced mere moments earlier.

Trump tried to interrupt, saying the program was actually worth $12 billion. But that prompted Rollins to take the unusual step of talking over the president to say $1 billion would be held back.

The president said that the U.S. is taking in “trillions” of dollars from tariffs and other investments.

But the actual numbers are far less than that. Treasury Department data shows that revenue from tariffs in the last fiscal year was nearly $195 billion. In the current fiscal year, tariffs have earned around $31 billion so far.

Trump has boasted of additional income from investments in the U.S. by other countries and international companies. But the precise terms of these investments have yet to be fully codified and released to the public, and some numbers are under dispute or involve potentially fuzzy math.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he has divested from his North Dakota soybean farmland.

“I actually just divested it this week as part of my ethics agreement, so I’m out of that business,” Bessent said Sunday on the CBS program “Face the Nation.”

Bessent, a millionaire former hedge fund manager, had stated in October that he shared the concerns of U.S. farmers who bore the brunt of the trade war between the U.S. and China, telling ABC News, “I’m actually a soybean farmer.”

The move comes as he leads Trump administration negotiations with China over trade and tariffs.

The president said the $12 billion in economic assistance comes from “taking a small portion” of revenue from the steep levies his administration has imposed on goods imported from around the world.

Trump has imposed tariffs against top U.S. trading partners at rates unseen in nearly a century.

He has frequently suggested that tariff revenues could be used to cover federal spending — frequently bragging about directing federal officials to “check the tariff shelf,” without providing details on how much federal revenue has actually been taken in, or how it would be distributed.

Farmers appreciate the aid package, but they say it’s likely only a down payment on what’s needed. They also added that government aid doesn’t solve the fundamental problems farmers are facing, including soaring costs and uncertain markets for their crops.

During Trump’s first term, he gave farmers more than $22 billion in aid payments in 2019 at the start of his trade war with China and nearly $46 billion in 2020, although that year also included aid related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

But farmers want to make a profit off of selling their crops — not rely on government aid to survive.

“That’s a start, but I think we need to be looking for some avenues to find other funding opportunities and we need to get our markets going. That’s where we want to be able to make a living from,” said Caleb Ragland, the Kentucky farmer who serves as president of the American Soybean Association.

Habba gave up her fight to stay as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor after an appeals court said she had been serving in the post unlawfully.

In a statement posted on social media, Habba assailed the court’s ruling as political, but said she was resigning “to protect the stability and integrity” of her office.

“But do not mistake compliance for surrender,” she said, adding that the administration would continue its appeal. “This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”

Once a partner in a small New Jersey law firm, Habba was among Trump’s most visible legal defenders during the four years he was out of power, representing him in court and frequently appearing on cable TV news as his “legal spokesperson.”

But she had limited federal court experience, and New Jersey’s two Democratic senators indicated they would block her confirmation in the U.S. Senate.

Arriving arm-in-arm with Santa, the first lady met with children and military families at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia on Monday.

She told children that Santa’s reindeer were resting at the North Pole while he joined her aboard a V-22 Osprey aircraft: “Santa told me the Osprey floated through the air like a giant snowflake, but was way faster than a sleigh could ever fly.”

Flanked by boxes of toys and a helicopter, the first lady wished families a merry Christmas and thanked those with loved ones away from home. Later, she passed out toys and helped children with coloring projects while a brass band played Christmas songs.

Conservative Supreme Court justices are posing tough questions about why independent-agency board members should be protected from presidential firing without cause.

Chief Justice John Roberts asked a series of questions about how far Congress could go in assigning power to independent agencies. Agarwal acknowledged “competing dangers” but argued that the current system of independent agencies has worked pretty well for nearly a century.

Expanding Trump’s firing power, on the other hand, would put “everything on the chopping block,” he said.

Justice Samuel Alito pushed back hard on that argument, suggesting Congress could one day whittle more power from the presidency.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, sometimes considered a potential swing vote, also seemed dubious. While the system may have worked so far, she said it’s impossible to tell what might happen 20 years in the future.

The case before the Supreme Court today is over the firing of Rebecca Slaughter, a member of the Federal Trade Commission.

But the court’s eventual decision has big implications for all kinds of federal agencies.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh brought up one of the biggest questions: If the court sides with the government, what would that mean for the Federal Reserve, which sets monetary policy?

Kavanaugh is a conservative who’s considered receptive to the Trump administration’s position. But he told Sauer he was concerned about undermining the Fed’s independence.

In his answer, Sauer pointed to the Supreme Court’s previous order, calling the Fed a “quasi private, uniquely structured. He said it raises different issues.

The court has allowed many of Trump’s firings for now, but a rare exception was Lisa Cook, the Fed board governor he tried to fire. The high court is hearing arguments over her firing in January.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and their Australian counterparts held annual U.S.-Australia security talks, lauding decades of strong strategic cooperation between their countries and talking up a deal with Britain under which Australia will develop nuclear-powered submarines as key to Indo-Pacific stability.

Rubio, Hegseth, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Defense Minister Richard Marles met at the State Department on Monday for discussions on their bilateral cooperation on critical minerals, defense production and the so-called “AUKUS” agreement, a Biden administration-era deal that will see the U.S. and Britain assist Australia with production of advanced submarines.

All sides said AUKUS was moving “full steam ahead” and Rubio is to meet later Monday with British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper.

None of the four made any reference to China and its increasing assertiveness in the region, including in the South China Sea and directed at Taiwan, but the annual AUSMIN meeting have for the past several years focused heavily on countering Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.

The Republican administration’s top attorney to the nation’s highest court is facing close questioning as he argues for expanded presidential power.

“You’re asking us to destroy the structure of government,” said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, “and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.”

The high court’s conservative supermajority is seen as sympathetic to the administration’s position that presidents should be able fire independent agency board members for any reason.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are meeting their Australian counterparts for annual U.S.-Australia talks expected to focus on Indo-Pacific security and countering China’s increasing assertiveness in the region, including in the South China Sea and directed at Taiwan.

Rubio, Hegseth, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Defense Minister Richard Marles were gathered at the State Department on Monday with many eyes also on the Russia-Ukraine and Gaza conflicts along with U.S. military strikes against alleged narco-traffickers in the Western Hemisphere that have raised questions about the use of force there.

The four are also expected to discuss progress in the so-called “AUKUS” pact, a Biden administration-era agreement under which the U.S., Britain and Australia committed to building nuclear submarines for the Australians. Rubio is to meet later Monday with British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper.

President Donald Trump is planning a $12 billion aid package for U.S. farmers who have struggled to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs after the president raised tariffs on China as part of a broader trade war, a White House official told the Associate Press.

Trump will unveil the plan Monday at the White House, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak ahead of the planned announcement.

Farmers have backed Trump politically but his aggressive trade policies and frequently changing tariff rates have come under increasing scrutiny because of the impact on the agricultural sector and because of broader consumer worries.

The aid is the administration’s latest effort to defend Trump’s economic stewardship and answer voter angst about rising costs — even as the president has dismissed concerns about affordability as a Democratic “hoax.”

Republicans in key battleground U.S. House districts are working to contain the political fallout that may come when thousands of their constituents face higher bills for health insurance coverage obtained through the Affordable Care Act.

For a critical sliver of the Republican majority, the impending expiration of what are called enhanced premium tax credits after Dec. 31 is a pressing concern as they potentially face headwinds in a 2026 midterm election that will be critical to President Trump’s agenda.

One of those is first-term U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-Pa., whose victory for the Allentown-area seat last year was among the narrowest in the nation.

Mackenzie is part of a bipartisan group that’s been pressing for an eleventh-hour compromise, advocating for an extension of the tax credits that tries to fix perceived flaws and bring down health care costs. But the push is a long shot due to entrenched GOP opposition to the health overhaul known as “Obamacare.”

Former Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, is ending his U.S. Senate campaign in Texas and instead will attempt a House comeback bid.

Allred said he’ll run in a newly drawn district in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which he previously represented in Congress before running unsuccessfully for the Senate in 2024.

Allred’s decision comes with Rep. Jasmine Crockett expected to make her decision on the Senate race on the final day of qualifying in Texas. State lawmaker James Talarico also is running for the Senate. Allred said in a statement that he wanted to avoid a Democratic primary battle and likely runoff.

Republicans also are expecting a hotly contested primary between incumbent John Cornyn, state Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt.

The Trump administration’s push to expand control over independent federal agencies comes before a sympathetic Supreme Court that could overturn a 90-year-old decision limiting when presidents can fire board members.

Lawyers for the administration are defending President Donald Trump’s decision to fire Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter without cause and calling on the court to jettison the unanimous 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor.

Arguments are taking place Monday.

The court’s six conservative justices already have signaled strong support for the administration’s position, over the objection of their three liberal colleagues, by allowing Slaughter and the board members of other agencies to be removed from their jobs even as their legal challenges continue.

Members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission also have been fired by Trump.

Trump is angry that Rep. Henry Cuellar is running again as a Democrat rather than switch parties after the president pardoned the Texas congressman and his wife in a federal bribery and conspiracy case.

Trump blasted Cuellar for “Such a lack of LOYALTY,” suggesting the Republican president might have expected the clemency to bolster the GOP’s narrow House majority heading into the 2026 midterm elections.

Cuellar, in a television interview Sunday after Trump’s social media post, said he was a conservative Democrat willing to work with the administration “to see where we can find common ground.” The congressman said he had prayed for the president and the presidency at church that morning “because if the president succeeds, the country succeeds.”

Citing a fellow Texas politician, the late President Lyndon Johnson, Cuellar said he was an American, Texan and Democrat, in that order. “I think anybody that puts party before their country is doing a disservice to their country,” he told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors and praised Sylvester Stallone, Kiss, Gloria Gaynor, Michael Crawford and George Strait, the slate of honorees he helped choose, as being “legendary in so many ways.”

“Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,” Trump, the first president to command the stage, said to open the show.

The Republican president said the artists, recognized with tribute performances during the show, are “among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.”

Since returning to office in January, Trump has made the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is named after a Democratic predecessor, a touchstone in a broader attack against what he has lambasted as “woke” anti-American culture.

Trump said Saturday that he was hosting “at the request of a certain television network.” He predicted the broadcast scheduled for Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.

Before Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees. Trump skipped the honors altogether during his first term.

Trump said Sunday that a deal struck by Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery “could be a problem” because of the size of the combined market share.

“There’s no question about it,” Trump said, answering questions about the deal and various other topics as he walked the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honors.

The Republican president said he will be involved in the decision about whether the federal government should approve the $72 billion deal. If approved by regulators, the merger would put two of the world’s biggest streaming services under the same ownership and join Warner’s television and motion picture division, including DC Studios, with Netflix’s vast library and its production arm.

Asked if Netflix should be allowed to buy the Hollywood giant behind “Harry Potter” and HBO Max, the president said, “Well that’s the question.”

“They have a very big market share and when they have Warner Bros., you know, that share goes up a lot so, I don’t know,” he said. “I’ll be involved in that decision, too. But they have a very big market share”

Reg 52,498 (Nov. 20, 2025); Revising the Definition of “Waters of the United States”, ENV’T PROT.","The ephemeral meaning of what bodies of water qualify as “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) is once again changing, spurring a renewed focus on state programs. On 17 November 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) announced a proposed rule redefining WOTUS under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) in the newest campaign in the prolonged legal war over the term’s definition.1

WOTUS is a crucial concept that defines the bodies of water subject to regulation under the CWA. Among other things, it determines when developers or landowners must obtain federal CWA permits for actions that affect wetlands and waters. The inclusion (or not) of an area as WOTUS determines when American industry, farmers, states, and landowners are required to seek CWA permits for activities such as dredging, filling, or discharging that may impact such waters. Changes to WOTUS that may reduce the scope of federal coverage will place greater emphasis on corresponding state regulations, which vary significantly concerning how closely they follow the federal regulations and, in some cases, provide distinct grounds for state water regulation.

The Sackett decision cemented a narrow interpretation of WOTUS, and the final rule must conform with that framework. Still, ambiguities will remain, particularly in the definition and application of “relatively permanent” waters and wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to such waters. Public comments on the proposed rule close on 5 January 2026.

Proposed Rule Highlights

The proposed rule is the agencies’ latest attempt to align the definition of WOTUS with the US Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA.2 The Sackett decision significantly narrowed the scope WOTUS, holding that federal CWA jurisdiction reaches only “relatively permanent waters” (e.g., streams, river, lakes) connected to traditional navigable waters and wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to such waters.3

A key feature of the proposed rule is a new limiting concept of “wet season,” applicable to the proposed rule’s definitions of “relatively permanent” and “continuous surface connection.”4 The proposed rule requires that during the “wet season” surface hydrology must “be continuous,” otherwise the CWA does not apply.5 The preamble to the proposed rule describes the agencies’ interpretation of “wet season,” but the proposed rule itself does not define the term.

The rule also removes “interstate waters” as an independent basis for CWA jurisdiction. Interstate waters must fall within the enumerated list of WOTUS (e.g., “relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water” (such as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes) and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such water bodies) to be covered under the CWA.

It also defines numerous terms such as “relatively permanent,”6 “tributary,”7 “continuous surface connection,”8 “excluded ditches,”9 excluded “prior converted cropland,”10 and excluded “waste treatment systems.”11

Although the rule attempts to add clarity about what kind of wetlands will be covered, the undefined term “wet season” will likely lead to more questions, challenges, and disparity in application between states. Ultimately, as federal coverage ebbs and flows, it will likely fall to the states to determine the level of protection granted to their waters.

Some States Fill the Gap, Others Roll Back Regulations

Many states rely on the CWA and its regulations as their only form of wetland protection for state waters. Others, such as California, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Virginia already have comprehensive regulatory programs. States have also responded to Sackett and the instability of the WOTUS rule by changing their laws: New Mexico and Colorado have responded by expanding protections and programs, while states such as Tennessee have rolled back their laws.

States Already Protecting Waters Beyond the Scope of CWA Jurisdiction

Many states already have comprehensive water protection and permitting schemes that apply to all waters within the state, including and beyond those covered by federal definitions.12 For instance, Pennsylvania’s “Clean Streams Law” extends protections to all “waters of the Commonwealth,”13 and its Dam Safety and Encroachments Act14 continues current wetland protection standards and permitting requirements without regard to whether wetlands qualify as WOTUS.

In Virginia, the State Water Control Law has implemented requirements beyond the CWA since 2000 with the goal of protecting and restoring the quality of Virginia’s waters. The law requires permits for actions affecting state waters and covers pollution control, water conservation, and management, with penalties for violations.15 Virginia defines “state waters” as “all water, on the surface and under the ground, wholly or partially within or bordering the Commonwealth or within its jurisdiction, including wetlands.”16 Where wetlands are defined as “those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.”17

Similarly, in California, “waters of the state” are defined broadly as “any surface water or groundwater, including saline waters, within the boundaries of the state.”18 Both waters of the state and wetlands are protected and regulated under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act by the State Water Resources Control Board and Regional Water Quality Control Boards, responsible for water quality protection and permitting activities that can affect water quality. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is responsible for permitting streambed alterations of state waters.

States Expanding Protections

Southwestern states were some of the most severely affected by Sackett; according to the New Mexico Legislature, approximately 90–95% of “waters” in the state lost protections, prompting the legislature to pass Senate Bills 21 and 22.19 The bills expand the New Mexico Water Quality Act to protect surface waters no longer covered by federal law. They also give New Mexico authority to seek the EPA’s approval to become the 48th state to gain authorization for surface water permitting,20 and address polluted groundwater that falls outside federal Superfund program jurisdiction.

Similarly affected, Colorado is also expanding state regulations to address gaps left by Sackett. The state legislature directed the Water Quality Control Commission to establish dredge-and-fill permitting and mitigation rules by 31 December 2025 to protect state waters not otherwise protected by federal law. The outcome will be Regulation No. 87, which is expected to be finalized by 31 December 2025.

The California Legislature is also considering additional regulations to further protect California state waters to address a perceived rollback in protections due to the Sackett decision and Trump administration policies.21 The proposed regulations would explicitly extend protections to state waters no longer covered under federal law.

States Rolling Back Protections

Tennessee has a robust state program but changed its wetlands protections during its 2025 legislative session in response to Sackett.22 These amendments to the Tennessee Water Quality Control Act establish new categories of wetlands with varying regulatory triggers for each. The thresholds for needing a state permit for altering isolated wetlands have been changed so that some isolated wetlands can be altered with no regulatory oversight as long as there is no water quality impact, and the trigger for needing a state permit for altering isolated wetlands has been limited.

conclusion

Comments on the proposed WOTUS rule are being accepted until 5 January 2026. The Final Rule will take effect 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. The EPA and USACE will also hold two hybrid public meetings during the comment period. Information on the public meetings can be found here.

4 “The phrase ‘at least during the wet season’ is intended to include extended periods of predictable, continuous surface hydrology occurring in the same geographic feature year after year in response to the wet season, such as when average monthly precipitation exceeds average monthly evapotranspiration. As proposed, surface hydrology would be required to be continuous throughout the entirety of the wet season.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 52,518.

5 EPA and USACE state that they “intend to use the metrics from the Web-based Water-Budget Interactive Modeling Program (WebWIMP)” to identify “wet seasons,” but solicit comment on the most appropriate method to identify the “wet season.” Id. at 52,519.

6 Defined as “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.” Id. at 52,545.

7 Defined as “a body of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and banks, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow. A tributary does not include a body of water that contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through a feature such as a channelized non-jurisdictional surface water feature, subterranean river, culvert, dam, tunnel, or similar artificial feature, or through a debris pile, boulder field, wetland, or similar natural feature, if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow. When the tributary is part of a water transfer (as that term is applied under 40 CFR 122.3) currently in operation, the tributary would retain jurisdictional status.” Id.

8 “Continuous surface connection means having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.” Id. at 52,546.

9 Defined as “[d]itches (including roadside ditches) that are constructed or excavated entirely in dry land.” Id. at 52,540.

10 Defined as “any area that, prior to December 23, 1985, was drained or otherwise manipulated for the purpose, or having the effect, of making production of an agricultural product possible. EPA and the Corps will recognize designations of prior converted cropland made by the Secretary of Agriculture. An area is no longer considered prior converted cropland for purposes of the Clean Water Act when the area is abandoned and has reverted to wetlands, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Abandonment occurs when prior converted cropland is not used for, or in support of, agricultural purposes at least once in the immediately preceding five years. For the purposes of the Clean Water Act, the EPA Administrator shall have the final authority to determine whether prior converted cropland has been abandoned.” Id. at 52,545.

11 Defined as “all components of a waste treatment system designed to meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act, including lagoons and treatment ponds (such as settling or cooling ponds), designed to either convey or retain, concentrate, settle, reduce, or remove pollutants, either actively or passively, from wastewater prior to discharge (or eliminating any such discharge).” Id. at 52,546.

Reaffirms progress toward delivering £500 million in climate finance by 2026.

Investments will deliver an estimated 1.8+ GW of clean energy and avoid over 1.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.

British International Investment (BII), the UK’s development finance institution (DFI) announced it has committed £308 million in climate finance across South-East Asia during its current strategy period, advancing its ambition to invest up to £500 million by 2026.

BII’s investments are expected to deliver over 1.8 GW of clean energy capacity and avoid more than 1.6 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, supporting the region’s green transition.

South-East Asia is among one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, facing rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and significant threats to food and water security. The region is also heavily dependent on fossil fuels, with coal and natural gas still dominating its energy mix. To address these challenges, governments across the region have set ambitious decarbonisation targets including net-zero commitments by 2050, reflecting a strong policy push toward clean energy.

However, the region needs an estimated US$210 billion annually for green infrastructure to meet its climate goals. This is a gap that cannot be filled by public funding alone. As a committed partner to the region, BII is stepping in not only with capital but with a patient and flexible approach to de-risk projects, demonstrate their commercial viability, and encourage market participation.

Pictured left to right: Srini Nagarajan – Managing Director and Head of Asia, Leslie Maasdorp – CEO, Holger Rothenbusch – Managing Director, Head of Infrastructure and Climate

Leslie Maasdorp, BII CEO on his first visit to the region since joining the organisation said: “Our commitment in South-East Asia reflects our ambition to deliver climate finance where it matters most, supporting countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change and driving the transition to clean energy.

“By taking a patient and flexible approach to de-risk projects and demonstrate their viability, we’re helping accelerate the development of bankable projects that are essential for this transition. These investments not only reduce emissions but also create jobs, build resilience, and unlock private capital for sustainable growth.

BII is investing across the full capital spectrum in South-East Asia including through funds, equity, debt, and innovative platforms. Its first investment on re-entering the region was in the SUSI Asia Energy Transition

Fund (SAETF), which supports infrastructure projects across renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy storage, and has already built a pipeline of over 800 MW of solar and wind projects.

The DFI is also building platforms like Sustainable Asia Renewable Assets (SARA), a co-investment initiative with FMO and SUSI, designed to develop a 500 MW portfolio of greenfield renewable projects. SARA’s recent acquisition of a 39.4 MW wind project in Vietnam is expected to generate 110.9 GWh of clean energy annually and avoid more than 55,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

In equity, BII’s investment in Xurya is pioneering rooftop solar in Indonesia, targeting 600 MW by 2028 and creating over 6,000 green jobs. On the debt side, its first direct investment in Vietnam through VPBank will enable financing for climate-related projects and SMEs, further unlocking capital for sustainable growth.

Also, under the joint Development and Construction Facility established by BII and Pentagreen Capital, $80m has been committed to ib vogt to finance solar, hybrid solar, and battery storage projects in the Philippines, Indonesia, and other eligible geographies in South-East Asia. The 99 MWp Tantangan Solar Power Plant is the first project to benefit from this facility. Once completed in 2026, it is expected to generate over 150 GWh of clean electricity annually, enough to power more than 82,000 households, while offsetting over 66,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions every year.",https://assets.bii.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/17180922/AdobeStock_395738037-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 11:05:21.512138

In their final words, the Task Force argues that reparations are not a gift — they are a debt owed.","When voters overwhelmingly approved a reparations ballot initiative in 2021, they tasked the city with confronting deep-seated, long-standing injustices. In 2023, the Detroit Reparations Task Force — a 13-member body composed of Detroit residents and community leaders — began intensive work, gathering public input, reviewing decades of municipal decisions, and wrestling with the legacy of discriminatory policies.

Their final report, a 558-page report submitted at the end of October 2025, aims to do more than acknowledge past wrongs: it charts a comprehensive, city-wide plan for repairing harms inflicted on generations of Black Detroiters by systemic racism, neglect, and economic displacement.

At its core, the report makes a stark claim: the wealth and economic stability many enjoy today are directly tied to the exploitation of Black labor — from slavery to forced labor and discriminatory municipal practices. The report argues that municipal policies over decades not only favored downtown and corporate interests, but systematically eroded the foundations of Black communities.

According to the report, Detroit effectively split into “two cities”: one — largely downtown — thriving and investment-heavy; the other — neighborhoods home to Black Detroiters — neglected, under-resourced, and plundered.

With that diagnosis in hand, the Task Force delivers sweeping recommendations across housing, economic development, policing, water and utilities, education, environment, and culture — attempting to rewrite Detroit’s future with justice and equity at its center.

Who qualifies — and who might receive reparations

One of the first questions the report tries to answer is: who is eligible? The Task Force proposes three straightforward criteria for reparations eligibility:

Being a descendant of an African enslaved in the U.S. or the African diaspora.

At least 21 years old.

A current Detroit resident who has lived continuously in the city for at least 20 years.

These criteria are intended to focus reparations on those whose families experienced — or directly descended from — the generations of systemic disenfranchisement, redlining, displacement, environmental injustice, and economic neglect tied to municipal policy.

But the Task Force stresses that the recommended reparations aren’t limited to cash payments: many are structural — policies, programs, and investments designed to repair neighborhood wealth, infrastructure, community health, and quality of life.

What reparations could look like — The Recommendations

Below is a broad overview of the main recommendations, grouped by sector.

Housing & Land

The report calls for a dedicated “Reparations Administrative Office” to manage reparations programs. Among its tasks: distributing housing grants, overseeing housing policy reforms, and ensuring long-term accountability.

Under housing grants: up to US$40,000 per eligible recipient for down-payment assistance to buy a home in Detroit, or up to US$30,000 for home repairs.

Construction of at least 1,000 new affordable housing units for African American residents — priced for households earning ~50% of area median income (~US$35,350).

Implementation of rent control policies and conversion of vacant city-owned properties into shelters for unhoused residents.

Ending the practice of transferring city-owned land to the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA), instead steering redevelopment programs to prioritize community residents.

Cancelling liens associated with delinquent water bills, and entirely eliminating sewage fees for eligible residents.

Refunding African American property owners who lost homes through tax foreclosure, using proceeds from auction sales.

For those previously over-assessed by the city, the report recommends freezing future property taxes.

These proposals seek to reverse generations of displacement, tax-foreclosure, overassessment, and the loss of generational wealth tied to homeownership — often a core path to intergenerational stability.

Economic Development & Business

The Task Force’s approach connects housing to broader economic renewal — offering support to families and local businesses alike:

Grants of up to $100,000 to businesses displaced by prior urban-renewal and development projects.

Creation of grants and low- or no-cost loans aimed at Black-owned co-ops, startups, small businesses, grocery stores, and community-based enterprises — to rebuild community wealth and ownership.

Plans to build ten new commercial strip malls that provide five years of rent-free space for eligible Black-owned businesses — with the hope that these spaces become hubs of neighborhood commerce and jobs.

Using tax increment financing (TIF) zones for these commercial areas, meaning tax revenues generated would get reinvested locally — supporting long-term economic sustainability.

Prioritizing Black-owned businesses in city contracts — a move toward equitable public contracting.

Providing free or subsidized post-secondary training for skilled trades, along with accessible online financial literacy courses — addressing both immediate economic mobility and long-term financial stability.

Through these measures, the Task Force envisions rebuilding a robust, community-rooted entrepreneurial base — one that provides jobs, builds generational wealth, and restores local control over commerce.

Policing, Justice & Public Safety

Acknowledging the long history of policing inequities, over-policing, dispossession, and distrust in Black communities, the Task Force makes bold calls for transformation:

Paying restitution to individuals (or their heirs) who were injured or killed by police — a move toward accountability and redress for past harms.

Ending “qualified immunity” for officers — opening the way for civil accountability for misconduct.

Terminating so-called “high-risk” officers (especially those who have a record of shootings, misconduct or who have shot unarmed citizens).

Hiring more Black officers and legal staff to reflect community demographics; institutionalizing more robust civilian oversight — including adding staffing to process community complaints, preserving body-camera footage in a permanent archive, and ensuring transparency.

Dissolving controversial policing initiatives like the command center monitoring schools, and ending the “One Detroit” anti-crime initiative (a partnership involving federal agencies) — which the Task Force argues function as layers of overlapping surveillance and militarized policing that disproportionately target Black communities.

Instead, investing in community-based violence intervention, mental-health co-response teams, and restorative justice programs — shifting focus toward prevention, support, and healing rather than punitive enforcement.

Through these policing reforms, the report seeks not just to curb abuse and violence — but to rebuild trust between the city, its institutions, and its Black residents.

Water, Sewerage & Utility Access

Utilities — often taken for granted — have been a flashpoint in Detroit’s history of inequality. The report spotlights how water shutoffs and unaffordable billing contributed to housing instability, unsanitary conditions, and displacement.

Key recommendations:

A moratorium on residential water shutoffs; ending the practice of turning unpaid water bills into liens on property.

Establishing an affordability program that limits water and sewer charges to no more than 3% of a household’s income.

Renegotiating the city’s existing lease with Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA), currently a $50 million annual lease, and restructuring the service agreement to reflect equitable cost distribution. The report cites that Detroit currently bears 83% of sewerage system costs, while suburban communities pay only 17%.

These reforms aim to remove systemic barriers to basic survival — ensuring access to utilities doesn’t become a tool for displacement or poverty.

Education & Youth Opportunities

The Task Force frames education as a critical pillar of reparations — one that can break cycles of disinvestment and restore opportunity to younger generations:

Establishing reparations-funded school grants to support: STEM fellowships, free high-speed internet access for students, athletic and mental-health programs, and other academic enrichment initiatives.

Repurposing shuttered or vacant school buildings for community use — to serve as centers for education, programming, or community services rather than letting them rot.

Lobbying the state legislature for additional funding to reduce class sizes, upgrade school infrastructure, hire more African American teachers, and integrate African-centered curricula.

By investing in education, the Task Force hopes to reverse the legacy of neglect and underfunding that has long plagued schools serving Detroit’s majority-Black student population.

Quality of Life, Health, Environment & Food Justice

Reparations, according to the report, must go beyond housing and money — to restore dignity, health, environment, food access, and long-term sustainability to neighborhoods that have borne the brunt of neglect and environmental racism.

Some of the flagship proposals:

Creating 100 acres of community-controlled agricultural land by 2035 — aiming to foster urban farming, local food production, and food sovereignty.

Establishing a “Food Sovereignty and Nutrition Equity Fund” — supporting Black-owned grocers, cooperatives, community kitchens, and food markets. Vacant city land could be repurposed into food distribution centers.

Designating “Environment Reparations Zones” in census tracts with high pollution, toxic air, or environmental hazards — enabling targeted environmental clean-up, monitoring, and remediation efforts.

For communities with high asthma rates or poor air quality, deploying in-home air filters, ongoing air quality monitoring, and establishing buffer zones between neighborhoods and industrial facilities. The Task Force aims to halve asthma-related emergency room visits within a decade.

These measures reflect an understanding that reparations are not just economic — they must restore health, environmental justice, access to food, stability, and community control over neighborhood destiny.

Arts, Culture & Legacy — Restoring Identity and Memory

To rebuild not only physical infrastructure but also cultural identity and heritage, the Task Force recommends the creation of a dedicated Office of African American Cultural Programs. This office would:

Fund historic preservation projects, galleries, studios, and community arts.

Lead efforts to rename public sites in honor of notable African American leaders — reclaiming public spaces and rewriting the city’s symbolic landscape.

Through cultural investments, the city can affirm the contributions, resilience, and identity of Black Detroiters — not as an afterthought, but as a central piece of reparative justice.

How the plan could be funded — and what’s next

The Task Force acknowledges that implementing such sweeping reforms will be expensive, and calls for creative — and city-anchored — funding mechanisms. Among the suggestions:

A downtown entertainment tax on events and venues.

An additional fee on casino revenues — redirecting profits from entertainment and tourism toward community reparations.

A new fee on city contracts, ensuring that city development and procurement contribute directly to reparative efforts.

Clawing back tax breaks or abatements from developers who fail to meet agreed-upon benchmarks — using those funds as reparations resources.

The core mechanism to oversee all this would be a proposed “Reparations Administrative Office,” run by an independent board of residents. Its responsibilities: distribute grants and benefits, coordinate programs, track outcomes, ensure accountability, and manage ongoing community input.

Importantly, the DRTF wrote the report — they do not have the power to implement it. That responsibility rests with the City Council, which must vote to adopt any portion of the plan. As of now, the report has been submitted. Some members may be asked to stay on, but the Task Force’s official term ended October 31, 2025.

Whether the City Council — or the next administration — acts remains open. As of November 2025, the incoming mayor’s team was reviewing the report.

Why it matters — beyond numbers and grants

What sets this report apart is its scope and ambition. Rather than offering narrow, piecemeal fixes, the Task Force is proposing a holistic blueprint — one that aims to reshape Detroit’s economic, social, and civic structure for decades to come.

For many Black Detroiters, these recommendations are not just about reparations — they are about reclaiming dignity, equity, and the possibility of generational stability. The housing grants and new affordable units address long-standing barriers to homeownership. Economic support for Black-owned businesses and co-ops could rebuild the local entrepreneurial class. Policing reforms could begin to restore trust in justice and safety. Water and utility reforms could eliminate a chronic cause of displacement and instability. Education and cultural investments could foster community pride, opportunity, and identity.

If implemented in full — or even partially — the plan could mark one of the most far-reaching municipal reparations efforts in U.S. history. And for a city like Detroit — one that has endured decades of disinvestment, deindustrialization, racialized policies, and population loss — the stakes are existential.

Yet, the report makes clear: this is not charity. It’s reckoning. It is not a favor — but a repayment. A restoration.

As the report states: for decades, the city surrendered its authority to corporate interests and external stakeholders — draining value from neighborhoods while letting downtown flourish. Now, the Task Force argues, it’s time to reverse course. To invest not just in buildings, but in Black Detroiters themselves.

What’s uncertain — what remains unsaid

While the recommendations are sweeping, there are some sharp questions — and important unknowns:

Cost: The report does not provide a firm estimate of how much all the proposals would cost. Funding ideas are outlined, but the real fiscal burden — and where that money would come from — remains uncertain.

Political viability: Implementation depends entirely on the will of the City Council, the mayor, and likely state-level cooperation — especially for reforms touching policing, school funding, and taxation.

Eligibility verification: While the eligibility criteria are defined, determining who qualifies — particularly tracing lineage to enslaved ancestors — could present legal, administrative, and evidentiary challenges.

Timing and scope: Even if adopted, realizing the full vision — building 1,000 homes, launching commercial centers, agricultural zones, environmental remediation zones — will take years, sustained investment, and vigilant oversight.

Community buy-in: Some residents (especially those without the specified ancestral lineage, or newer Detroiters) may object to or feel excluded by a reparations plan limited to descendants of enslaved Africans. The report does not deeply address how to navigate or reconcile such tensions.

The moral and symbolic weight — how Detroit frames reparations

At a deeper level, the 2025 DRTF report is as much about identity and memory as it is about infrastructure or grants. By explicitly tying Detroit’s contemporary inequalities — housing loss, environmental injustice, underfunded schools, policing abuse, economic displacement — to a legacy of slavery, segregation, redlining, and corporate-era neglect, the Task Force demands more than policy fixes.

This is a reckoning: a public admission that the city’s path forward cannot ignore the traumas and structural harms inflicted on Black residents. It is a demand that Detroit — as a municipal entity — accept responsibility. That it uses its power, resources, and governance to restore what was lost.

By combining financial reparations, community investment, structural reforms, and cultural recognition, the plan asserts that justice must be generational, systemic, and anchored in dignity.

In their final words, the Task Force argues that reparations are not a gift — they are a debt owed. It is not charity — it is restoration.

What happens now — and what’s at stake

With the report submitted to City Council at the end of October 2025, the next chapter begins — but its outcome remains uncertain. According to reports:

The incoming mayor’s team (at the time, reviewing the document) had not committed to adopting the recommendations.

The Task Force’s formal authority ended October 31, 2025 — meaning new leaders must decide whether to implement, modify, or discard the plan.

Community pressure, public input, and the political climate — including debates around funding, taxation, lineage, and equity — will shape what parts (if any) move forward.

What’s at stake is nothing less than the future of Detroit’s Black neighborhoods: whether they remain marginalized in favor of downtown development, or whether the city embraces a future where justice, equity, and community control are central.

If even a portion of the recommendations are acted upon — affordable housing, water access, small business support, school funding — it could mark a turning point for a city long defined by loss, disinvestment, and systemic neglect.

If ignored, it risks reaffirming that decades of harm — to neighborhoods, families, and generations — remain unacknowledged and unaddressed.",https://michiganchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Reparations.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 12:02:30.495136

In Canada, the fossil industry has dropped 38,000 jobs in the last five years, mostly in upstream oil and gas, even though production increased 35% for oil and 24% for natural gas over that period, the Centre for Future Work reported Monday.

“This long-term decline is set to continue for many reasons, not solely or mostly climate policy. New technologies, economic forces, resource depletion, and corporate outsourcing strategies are all eliminating fossil fuel jobs,” the Vancouver-based organization said in a release. The 95-page report concludes [pdf] that:

• The job transition out of fossil fuels is taking place in spite of any efforts in national climate policy, not because of them.

• The pace of the decline is consistent with a full phaseout of fossil fuels by 2050.

• Most of today’s fossil fuel workers will have reached normal retirement age by then.

• Interviews with workers showed that most of them expect to see the industry decline, but are reasonably confident the transition can be managed without mass displacement.

• Federal “just transition” efforts to date have been “long on aspiration and consultation, and short on implementation and effective guarantees.”

• Transition planning in Canada “is made even more nebulous by the fact that no general transition away from fossil fuel production and use is in fact occurring,” except for the 2030 federal mandate to phase out coal.

The research “confirms that an employment transition away from fossil fuel jobs is occurring, and occurring quickly,” said report co-author and centre director Jim Stanford. “Regardless of the twists and turns of climate policy debates, that decline will continue, driven by deeper economic and technological factors.”

But when it comes to just transition planning, “most policies emphasize consultation and dialogue, not binding agreements and entitlements,” the report states. “Instead of clear guarantees of employment and income for affected workers, workers are typically offered retraining subsidies and career counselling. In a labour market defined by chronic insecurity and fierce competition for decent work, this does not convince fossil fuel workers that their employment and incomes will be protected.”

Stanford added that a new oil pipeline megaproject, like the one envisioned in last month’s sweeping memorandum of understanding between Canada and Alberta, won’t reverse the trend. “Building a pipeline creates medium-term construction, he said—but no more than equivalent amounts spent on other energy investments” in renewable energy, transition, energy retrofits, or public transit.

On a global scale, many of those job categories are soaring, the International Energy Agency reported Friday, with the energy sector outpacing the global economy in 2024 for the third year in a row and increasing its work force to 76 million.

“Strong investment in energy infrastructure drove a 2.2% rise in energy jobs last year, nearly double the rate of employment growth for the wider global economy,” the Paris-based agency said in a release, with electricity surpassing fuel supply as the biggest industry employer for the first time.

The IEA reports that:

• Photovoltaic solar has been a “principal driver of demand, accounting for half of the job additions in the electricity sector since 2019.”

• Almost all the jobs in the power sector were in low-emitting power generation, grids, or storage, with only a small percentage in unabated fossil generation.

• Nuclear power, grids, and storage have provided 25% of the new power sector jobs.

• Offshore wind saw layoffs in turbine manufacturing and other “persistent challenge”, leading to a 6% job decline last year.

• Jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing grew by 800,000, with EVs and batteries now accounting for about 40% of automotive employment in China.

• Oil and gas has recovered most of the jobs it lost in the COVID-19 pandemic. But “it now appears that many firms are entering a new period of retrenchment in the face of lower oil prices and revenues, with a number of major oil companies announcing job cuts in 2025.”

• Coal jobs have increased in India, China, and Indonesia, growing 8% between 2019 and 2024.

Skilled worker shortages emerged as a key concern in the IEA’s annual Energy Employment Survey, with more than half of respondents reporting critical hiring bottlenecks and an aging work force compounding the problem.

“Most of the top energy occupations facing constraints within energy are considered applied technical roles, including electricians, pipefitters, electrical power line workers, and engineers, particularly in nuclear,” the IEA wrote. “Many of these broader categories are already in short supply across the wider economy.”

The CEF report noted that since the start of 2023, China’s total overseas direct investment in clean technology has surpassed $180bn.
According to the report, South East Asia continues to be the primary destination for Chinese clean technology manufacturing investments.
At the same time, the Middle East and North Africa became the most rapidly growing region for Chinese clean technology investment, led by Egypt, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia.
Meanwhile, following Trump’s election, the US Administration has reduced its climate and clean energy commitments, increasing support for fossil fuels.","China’s clean technology investment overseas has reached approximately $80bn over the past year, according to a report by Australian research group Climate Energy Finance (CEF).

According to the report, Chinese companies have been seeking new markets to address a surplus in supply, resulting in a significant increase in foreign direct investment in green technology since early 2023.

The CEF report noted that since the start of 2023, China’s total overseas direct investment in clean technology has surpassed $180bn.

This expansion has been partly driven by countries seeking to strengthen clean tech cooperation with China, particularly following tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.

Chinese companies have established a strong presence in supply chains for critical minerals processing, solar panels and batteries.

Chinese foreign investment in clean energy infrastructure is also facilitating the creation of new markets for these products.

CEF China engagement lead and report author Caroline Wang noted that this trend offers opportunities for emerging economies aiming to decrease their reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Wang said: “China’s got a supply glut when it comes to green technology like solar panels and batteries, because of a structural supply-demand mismatch, so they need overseas markets to absorb their products,” according to Reuters.

According to the report, South East Asia continues to be the primary destination for Chinese clean technology manufacturing investments.

While new solar manufacturing investments in the region have declined due to US tariffs, Chinese investment in electric vehicles, renewable power and batteries has increased.

At the same time, the Middle East and North Africa became the most rapidly growing region for Chinese clean technology investment, led by Egypt, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia.

Together, these countries secured approximately $7bn in announced funding. These projects highlight how Gulf and north African nations are pursuing economic diversification by developing sectors beyond oil.

The report found that Chinese companies are increasingly favouring large-scale projects that integrate both upstream and downstream supply chains.

Notable recent projects include an $8.27bn green hydrogen project in Nigeria announced by Longi Green Energy and a $6bn battery factory under construction by CATL in Indonesia.

The report noted that the October 2024–25 period marked the consolidation of China’s position as a “dominant global investor in clean-energy manufacturing and infrastructure”.

During this time, nearly $80bn in new projects were disclosed across 26 nations, primarily driven by private companies.

According to the report, Chinese companies view the trade war initiated by US President Trump in March 2025 as having increased uncertainty and have responded by prioritising “long-term risk mitigation through market diversification, with a focus on countries not hit by Trump’s tariffs that offer favourable investment environments”.

The Chinese Government has encouraged companies to collaborate with local companies in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) nations.

The report read: “The clean-tech economy represents a flourishing form of South-South cooperation, where national development goals meet China’s techno-industrial might.

“While the US sees China’s rise as a threat, many developing countries are inspired by its success and aim to emulate it.”

According to statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce “Going Global” Service Platform, Chinese enterprises made 215bn yuan in non-financial direct investment in BRI nations from January to September 2025, a 24.7% year-on-year increase.

Meanwhile, following Trump’s election, the US Administration has reduced its climate and clean energy commitments, increasing support for fossil fuels.

Most clean-energy production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have been suspended or reduced, and new renewable energy investment in the US fell by 36% in the first half of this year.

Many global companies, including First Solar and Enphase, have paused or relocated projects to South East Asia and the EU, the report noted.

The US President has committed to increasing oil and gas drilling, exiting the Paris Climate Agreement and reversing environmental policies established by previous administrations.

“Drill, baby, drill” was Trump’s campaign pledge, and the administration has proposed widening the production of fossil fuels.

The Trump administration has proposed opening federal waters near the coasts of Alaska, Florida and California for oil and gas drilling, including regions that have not previously been explored.

While other Western countries are taking steps to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, the US is moving in the opposite direction.",https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/12/shutterstock_2498872563.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 10:00:05.314493

Batteries as large as shipping containers are being connected to power lines and installed beside solar panels and wind turbines. They soak up power when it's plentiful and cheap and release it when electricity use soars, helping reduce the need for expensive power plants and lines.

American researchers invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and later showed that the devices could help the electric grid. But for a long time, batteries made little headway because grid managers and utility executives dismissed them as expensive and risky.

Advt

One of the first breakthroughs came about 15 years ago when engineers at a U.S. energy company installed one of the first lithium-ion batteries tied to a grid in a desert nearly 9,000 feet above sea level in Chile. Challenging conventional notions of how the electricity system should be run, that team helped prove that batteries could help make electric grids more stable and reliable.

The concept of storing energy was not new. Thomas Edison developed alkaline nickel-iron batteries largely for industry and early electric vehicles. Various companies tried other technologies like sodium sulfur, which have not gained much traction. And some utilities have long pumped water uphill so that later it could be sent back down to generate electricity.

But those systems were relatively limited. The kinds of lithium batteries installed in the Atacama Desert in 2009, by comparison, are now being used around the world.

The rapid growth of wind and solar power and the rising demand for electricity from data centers are making batteries a necessity. They store surplus renewable energy for when it's not windy or sunny and maintain a balance between energy supply and demand.

Consider California. In recent years, state officials have often asked residents to use less electricity on hot summer days to prevent power outages. But there have been no such alerts since 2022, largely because batteries have allowed California to use its abundant solar power well into the evening. Over the last seven years, the state added 30 times as much battery storage capacity as it had in 2018.

Advt

The rest of the world has also seen impressive growth, according to the International Energy Agency, a multilateral organization in Paris. The boom was made possible by a stunning 90 per cent drop in the cost of batteries over the last 15 years as new factories have come online. China is by far the world's largest battery manufacturer, but Europe, India and the United States have recently been increasing production, too.

""Batteries are changing the game before our eyes,"" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said recently.

A bumpy start

The use of batteries on the grid did not come easy.

A Virginia company called AES began testing grid batteries in Indiana, Pennsylvania and California as early as 2008, but U.S. energy suppliers did not use them commercially until two years later. The pace was plodding for a while.

""There wasn't the experience with battery storage,"" said Carla Peterman, a former member of the California Energy Commission and now an executive vice president at Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility. ""It was a bit of a chicken or the egg, where there wasn't enough on there to really say that this could be a big part of the energy system.""

But some Americans clearly saw the benefits of batteries. One of them was Christopher Shelton, an executive at AES, which owns utilities and power plants across the world.

He began to look into lithium-ion batteries when his bosses asked employees to pitch proposals for a ""billion-dollar idea."" Shelton said he thought batteries could reduce the need for power plants that utilities used only when electricity demand climbed to peak levels.

""Why would you build an asset that you weren't going to use more than 5 per cent of the time?"" Shelton said. ""We were saying batteries should be an alternative to peaker plants.""

He first installed battery cells at a nondescript electricity substation outside Indianapolis, a city known for its 500-mile car race. His company later connected one in Norristown, Pennsylvania, at an operations center of the nation's largest grid manager, PJM Interconnection. The Los Angeles area was connected next, followed by a larger battery for the Indianapolis grid.

While his tests were successful, they did not sufficiently impress many American utility executives. The reaction was typical of an industry that prides itself for sticking with what it knows best: large coal, gas and nuclear power plants. Anything else has generally been treated as a threat that may cause blackouts.

""Utilities have long been skeptical of new technologies,"" said Leah Stokes, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies energy politics and policy. ""They know how to make a widget, which is a giant fossil fuel power plant, so they keep doing that.""

Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade organization, disagrees with that assessment. ""The U.S. energy grid is the world's most important machine, and America's electric companies are quick to pilot and deploy new technologies once they become commercially viable and affordable for customers,"" he said.

But even now, U.S. utilities in many states are reluctant to add batteries. A lot fewer large batteries are being added in the Southeast, for example, than in California and Texas.

Utility executives are not the only ones who are skeptical. So are policymakers and many ordinary Americans.

Some local governments have banned big batteries because of safety concerns. In May and June, a large battery complex in Monterey County, California, was destroyed in a fire that spewed smoke and harmful chemicals.

Despite that disaster, energy experts say many risks have been addressed. The California fire happened in a type of battery that most companies no longer use. And those batteries were installed in a power plant building where the fire easily spread from device to device. Most batteries are installed outdoors to reduce the chances that fires spread.

Testing it on the moon

Not much beside the odd desert fox lives on the desolate plateau in Chile where AES set up its battery project. The site is several hours from the two closest airports, in Calama and Antofagasta.

After landing, visitors have to drive at least four hours to the salt flats of the Atacama Desert, where workers collect lithium -- a key battery ingredient.

The AES camp is another hour away. It sits on a rocky, unpaved path, lined with busted tires. Although temperatures during a late spring and early summer day can reach the 80s, the nights can be near freezing.

""It was like taking the battery and testing it on the moon,"" said Joaquín Meléndez, an engineer who led the AES project there under Shelton.

In the early 2000s, Chile had an energy crisis because Argentina, its main supplier of natural gas, couldn't provide enough of it. That left Chile, which has no domestic fuel sources, with too little energy for its people and its copper, iodine and lithium mines.

Chile was forced to rely on power plants that burned expensive imported coal. But those plants could not be easily turned up or down, and the needs of Chile's mining companies fluctuated a lot.

That was where the batteries came in. While it can take a coal plant about 12 minutes to get going, batteries can discharge power almost instantly. By pairing the two, engineers realized that batteries could deliver the electricity that mines needed while coal plants fired up.

Meléndez worked 16-hour days for six months to connect the first commercialized lithium battery to an electric grid. That device still stands, though most of its tasks have been taken over by newer, more efficient and affordable units.

The project was immediately successful, helping keep the electricity system stable when mining operations caused surges that had previously led to grid failures and outages.

AES executives back in the United States kept close track of what was happening in Chile. And in 2010, the company installed commercial battery systems in New York and Texas. Two years later, AES began adding more batteries in Chile, including next to big solar farms.

Over the last decade, batteries have helped Chile use less coal. Last December, the country got more than 40 per cent of its electricity from solar panels and wind turbines, up from 19 per cent five years earlier, according to Ember Energy Research, a nonprofit. Australia, Britain, China, India and other countries have also been adding lots of renewable energy and batteries.

Shelton said that even he had been surprised by the recent rapid growth of batteries. ""We underpredicted how far the prices would fall.""

SEIA president and chief executive Abigail Ross Hopper said: “This record-setting quarter for solar deployment shows that the market is continuing to turn to solar to meet rising demand.”

She added that unless the administration reverses course, the future of clean, affordable and reliable solar and storage will be “frozen by uncertainty”.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms.
Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.
“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.
Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax.","The most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken calls for a new approach to jointly tackle the most pressing environmental issues including climate change and biodiversity loss that threaten over 1 million plant and animal species with extinction.

The U.N. Environment Assembly — which the U.S. government didn’t attend — produced the new report this week by almost 300 scientists from 83 countries.

The issues, which also include land degradation and pollution, are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme’s Global Environment Outlook said.

“You can’t think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,” said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. “You can’t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.”

They’re “all undermining our economy,” worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven’t made nearly enough progress, they said.

Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.

“What we’re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,” Watson said. “It has to be done rapidly now because we’re running out of time.”

Global tipping point

The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.

Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil — reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.

Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.

Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.

What’s more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn’t involved in the report.

“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.

Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded, and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.

Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.

The report says that to achieve a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and restore biodiversity, about $8 trillion in global investment is needed every year. But starting in 2050, economic benefits will surpass spending, growing to $20 trillion a year by 2070 and $100 trillion a year thereafter.

Nations also must look beyond gross domestic product as a barometer for economic health, because it doesn’t measure whether growth is sustainable or recognize its potential harms, Watson said.

Environmental issues aren’t the only things interlinked, Watson said. He also said governments, nonprofits, industry and the financial sector also must ensure that there are incentives and funding for renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices, for example.

University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn’t involved in the report, welcomed its emphasis on tackling issues across governments and society.

“We must do what is right, rather than what seems politically expedient,” Mann said. “The stakes are simply too great.”

International cooperation falters

Despite the report’s urgent call for action, international cooperation is anything but guaranteed, scientists say — especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to participate in many of the discussions.

Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax. He’s promoted fossil fuel use, canceled permits for renewable energy and is abandoning automobile fuel-efficiency standards.

“International action and agreements are becoming harder and harder,” Watson said, noting that this year’s U.N. climate conference in Brazil failed to “move in the direction we needed it to move” with stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.

Talks this summer on a treaty to address plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement, though a U.N. conference earlier in the year garnered commitments for funding to protect global biodiversity.

Watson said that the U.S. didn’t attend the intergovernmental meeting in Nairobi, but joined discussions on the last day and “said they didn’t agree with anything in the report.”

“Some countries might say if the U.S. is not willing to act, why should we act?” Watson said.

Still, he believes that some countries will move forward, while others, including the U.S., could fall behind.

Hayhoe, the Texas Tech scientist, said that she’s confident changes will happen, because the stakes are becoming too great.

“It is not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we’re gone,” Hayhoe said. “The question is, will there be a healthy, thriving human society on that planet? And the answer to that question is very much up for grabs at this point.”

To support this manufacturing capacity, USA Rare Earth is developing the Round Top Heavy Rare Earth and Critical Minerals Project in West Texas.","REAlloys, which is in the process of merging with Blackboxstocks Inc. (NASDAQ: BLBX), has moved to the front of the rare earth sector with a new agreement that gives it control over the lion’s share of North America’s upcoming heavy rare earth production.

Its partnership with the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) brings commercial volumes of dysprosium, terbium, and high-purity NdPr into the region for the first time, directly targeting the largest bottleneck in Western magnet manufacturing.

Reuters described the transaction as a “rare earths tie-up with strategic implications for the North American supply chain” because policymakers have their eyes glued to this space in light of 2027 procurement rules.

As new U.S. sourcing laws tighten, REAlloys now holds the supply position that downstream defense and advanced-manufacturing buyers will depend on, the Globe & Mail heralding the SRC facility as “North America’s first vertically integrated rare-earth processing complex–capable of separation and smelting at commercial scale”.

This is the segment of the supply chain the United States has been trying to rebuild for nearly two decades.

Heavy rare earths are the performance elements. They dictate whether a magnet can withstand heat, acceleration, and EMI without losing stability. These are all capabilities that extend far beyond defense. They are central to electric-vehicle motors, high-efficiency industrial equipment, medical imaging, renewable-energy generation, satellites, aerospace controls, and precision manufacturing. In short, they sit at the core of technologies that underpin both modern economies and military readiness.

And until now, North America has had no commercial-scale ability to refine them.

A Midstream Capability the Region Has Never Had

SRC’s facility in Saskatoon is North America’s first rare-earth complex designed to integrate monazite processing, separation, and metal production at a commercial scale. That’s a capability the region has lacked for decades.

The new agreement with REAlloys accelerates that evolution by adding a full heavy rare earth line, transforming the site from an advanced separation plant into the continent’s only integrated source of dysprosium, terbium, and high-purity NdPr metals.

Under the partnership, REAlloys will invest approximately $21 million to expand SRC’s refining capacity, increasing heavy rare earth throughput by roughly 300% and boosting NdPr metal output by about 50%.

When the upgraded system enters production in early 2027, SRC expects to deliver 30 tonnes of dysprosium oxide, 15 tonnes of terbium oxide, and 400-600 tonnes of high-purity NdPr metal annually.

REAlloys has secured 80% of this expanded output under a long-term offtake arrangement, a position that gives the company the dominant share of the first commercial heavy rare earth production run in North America.

According to the announcement, the redesigned system will also include “AI-driven separation and smelting infrastructure,” enabling SRC to move directly into metal production rather than stopping at oxide, a step most Western facilities historically have been unable to achieve.

This changes where REAlloys sits in the market. It is no longer a magnet manufacturer with upstream ambitions. Instead, it’s the principal customer of the only heavy rare earth refining platform in the region, and one of the few companies globally positioned to supply high-performance magnet metals into compliant supply chains.

The timing is highly strategic.

Beginning January 1, 2027, the U.S. Department of Defense will be barred from sourcing rare earth metals, magnets, and components from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea. Federal buyers will shift procurement to domestic or allied suppliers. And for heavy rare earth metals, SRC’s upgraded facility–with REAlloys as its primary offtake partner–will be the only operation ready to meet that requirement at commercial scale.

Integrating the Chain From Source to Magnet

This agreement fits into a larger structure REAlloys has been putting in place across the rare-earth chain.

At the upstream level, the company anchors its plans in Hoidas Lake in Saskatchewan, a deposit with roughly 2.15 million tonnes of measured and indicated TREO and one of Canada’s most significant rare-earth resources. It gives REAlloys a defined long-term feedstock, supported by additional allied and recycled material sources that broaden the supply base.

The midstream is defined by the Saskatchewan Research Council’s separation and metal-making operation, now being expanded with AI-driven separation and smelting systems to create North America’s first commercial-scale heavy rare earth production line. Under the new agreement, REAlloys becomes the primary offtake partner for this upgraded capacity, securing 80% of the heavy rare earth output and effectively linking its upstream resource base to a domestic refining platform capable of producing dysprosium, terbium, and high-purity NdPr metals at meaningful scale.

Downstream, the Euclid Magnet Facility in Ohio forms the final step in the chain. Established in 2013 to serve U.S. Department of Defense and Department of Energy customers, the facility produces advanced alloys and magnet materials, holds SBIR status that permits sole-source federal procurement, and has earned multiple R&D 100 awards and associated materials-science distinctions. Together, these assets give REAlloys something Western operators have struggled to assemble: a vertically aligned system that spans ore, metals, alloys, and magnets inside a single continental corridor.

Adding to this structure is a clear signal from Washington.

The U.S. Export-Import Bank issued a $200 million Letter of Interest in support of REAlloys’ integrated mine-to-magnet strategy, underscoring federal recognition of the need for a domestic magnet industry as procurement rules tighten.

Piece by piece, the company has begun to build the architecture of a supply chain that has been missing from North America for decades and is now central to reindustrialization efforts on both sides of the border.

A Shift in Market Dynamics

Demand for high-performance magnets continues to accelerate across defense, electric mobility, automation, satellites, and clean energy. Still, the bottleneck has always been the same. Even when Western miners produced rare earth concentrate, they still depended on China for metal-making and heavy rare earth preparation.

That pressure point is now tightening under new procurement rules. Beginning January 1, 2027, the U.S. Department of Defense will be barred from sourcing rare earth metals, magnets, and components from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

This shift forces federal buyers to transition toward domestic or allied supply. Most manufacturers are not ready for that deadline.

REAlloys, through its partnership with SRC, is now one of the only groups positioned to supply dysprosium, terbium, and NdPr metals at the volumes required by the U.S. and Canadian industrial base.

Heavy rare earths remain the least substitutable inputs in magnet production. They determine stability under heat, acceleration, magnetic load, and environmental stress–all the things that define missile guidance accuracy, aircraft efficiency, EV motor durability, satellite maneuvering, and industrial automation reliability. For nearly 15 years, every Western supply chain assessment has identified heavy rare earths as the system’s most acute vulnerability.

With this agreement, that vulnerability lessens. REAlloys and SRC are establishing the first commercially scaled heavy rare earth production line in North America, and for the first time, a significant portion of that output is contracted directly to a domestic magnet producer.

Execution Will Define the Next Step

North America’s rare earth problem has never been about geology. It has always been the absence of a functioning midstream, the refining and metal-making steps that turn mined material into usable inputs. This gap has forced the United States and Canada to depend on offshore supply even when domestic or allied resources were available.

Heavy rare earths have been the hardest of all to source, leaving defense, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing exposed to single-country dependence for the materials that determine thermal stability, precision, and performance.

SRC’s expansion arrives as North America finally confronts the part of the rare earth chain it never built: the part rare earths are converted into usable critical materials. Beginning in 2027, U.S. defense buyers must shift away from Chinese supply, but the region has had no commercial-scale source of dysprosium, terbium, or NdPr metals, prompting Reuters to note that the SRC upgrade is the first step toward filling that gap.

The REAlloys agreement doesn’t close the loop, but it does create the first steady flow of heavy rare earth metals inside the U.S.-Canada system. For defense, auto manufacturing, and advanced industrial applications, it marks a shift from theoretical supply to material that can be contracted, scheduled, and built into production plans.

What happens next depends on execution. If SRC delivers its upgraded capacity on schedule and if downstream buyers adapt to the new procurement landscape, 2027 could mark the first time North America has had a functional heavy rare earth channel of its own. It would not eliminate vulnerability, but it would begin to narrow the exposure that has shaped every rare earth strategy discussion since the early 2000s.

Other companies to watch in the resources sector:

Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE)

Vale S.A. continues to aggressively decouple its base metals operations from its traditional iron ore business to capture higher valuations in the green energy market. The Brazilian mining giant has formally structured Vale Base Metals as a distinct entity tasked with managing its vast nickel and copper assets in Canada, Brazil and Indonesia. This strategic separation allows the unit to operate with the agility of a growth-focused company while leveraging the massive capital resources of its parent.

Vale is currently executing a $25 billion to $30 billion capital investment program aimed at increasing its copper production to 900,000 metric tons per year and its nickel output to 300,000 metric tons per year by 2030. The company’s operations in Sudbury, Ontario, and Voisey’s Bay in Labrador remain the linchpins of this strategy, providing low-carbon nickel rounds and pellets that Western automakers prioritize for their compliance with inflation-reduction incentives and ESG mandates.

Beyond simple extraction, Vale has deepened its downstream integration to secure its role as a direct supplier to the battery supply chain. The company is advancing joint ventures in Indonesia to process laterite nickel ore using high-pressure acid leaching technology, a method essential for producing the mixed hydroxide precipitate required for battery cathodes. Simultaneously, Vale has solidified long-term supply agreements with major automotive partners, including General Motors and Tesla, ensuring that a significant percentage of its high-grade Class 1 nickel is allocated directly to North American and European electric vehicle production.

Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU)

Energy Fuels Inc. has successfully transitioned from a pure-play uranium miner into a diversified critical minerals processor, leveraging its White Mesa Mill in Utah to bridge a critical gap in the U.S. supply chain. As of late 2025, the company is processing commercial volumes of monazite sands—a radioactive byproduct of heavy mineral sand operations—to recover both uranium and rare earth elements.

The White Mesa Mill is the only facility in the United States with the existing licenses and tailings capacity to handle the radionuclides associated with monazite, giving Energy Fuels a distinct regulatory advantage. The company has moved beyond producing a mixed rare earth carbonate and is now operating Phase 1 separation circuits to produce commercial quantities of separated neodymium and praseodymium oxides. This operational shift effectively bypasses the historical necessity of shipping American feedstocks to China for separation, creating a nascent but vital domestic pathway for magnet materials.

To secure sufficient feedstock for this expansion, Energy Fuels has aggressively acquired heavy mineral sand projects in the Southern Hemisphere, including the acquisition of Base Resources and its Toliara Project in Madagascar, as well as the Bahia Project in Brazil. These acquisitions provide the company with a vertically integrated supply of monazite, insulating it from spot market volatility. The company is utilizing its ""crack and leach"" capacity to extract the rare earths while simultaneously recovering uranium for the nuclear fuel market, creating a dual-revenue model that lowers the effective cost of production for both commodities.

MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP)

MP Materials Corp. has completed its multi-year strategy to restore the full rare earth magnet supply chain to the United States. While the company continues to maximize output at its Mountain Pass mine in California, its strategic focus has shifted heavily toward midstream and downstream manufacturing.

In 2025, MP Materials ramped up commercial production at its magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. This facility is now actively producing finished neodymium-iron-boron magnets, sourcing the metal alloy directly from the company’s own separated oxides. This vertical integration allows MP Materials to control every step of the process, from the open pit in California to the finished component in Texas, effectively insulating its customers from the geopolitical risks associated with the Chinese supply chain. The Fort Worth plant is designed to produce approximately 1,000 tonnes of finished magnets annually in its initial phase, with plans to scale significantly to meet demand from General Motors and other automotive partners.

MP Materials has secured substantial backing from the Department of Defense to refine heavy rare earths as well, acknowledging that a complete magnet supply chain requires dysprosium and terbium. The company is currently fulfilling a contract to supply rare earth materials to the Pentagon, underscoring the dual-use nature of its products. By successfully closing the loop between mining and manufacturing, MP Materials has established itself not just as a mining firm, but as the foundational industrial anchor for the American electrification and defense sectors.

Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML)

Critical Metals Corp. is advancing its ""trans-Atlantic"" strategy to supply strategic materials to Western markets through its flagship assets in Austria and Greenland. The company’s Wolfsberg Lithium Project in Carinthia, Austria, has moved through the definitive feasibility stage and is positioning itself as the first fully permitted lithium mine in Europe.

Located roughly 170 miles from major battery manufacturing hubs, Wolfsberg offers a logistical advantage that reduces transportation emissions and aligns with the European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act. The project is designed as an underground mine to minimize surface disruption, a key factor in securing local community support and regulatory approval in an environmentally sensitive region. Critical Metals has signed binding offtake agreements with top-tier partners like BMW, ensuring that the lithium hydroxide produced at Wolfsberg has a guaranteed route to market as soon as commercial production begins.

In parallel, the company is developing the Tanbreez Rare Earth Project in Greenland, which hosts one of the largest known deposits of heavy rare earth elements and zirconium in the world. The Tanbreez asset differs from many competitors because its mineralization is hosted in kakortokite rather than carbonatite, which allows for different processing metrics and a potentially lower acid consumption profile.

USA Rare Earth, Inc. (NASDAQ: USAR)

USA Rare Earth, Inc. is executing a strategy centered on the revitalization of the American magnet manufacturing sector, anchored by its new facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Unlike peers that focus primarily on extraction, USA Rare Earth prioritizes the downstream production of sintered neo magnets, the highest-performance category of permanent magnets used in electric vehicle traction motors and defense systems.

The Stillwater plant has commenced initial qualification runs, utilizing equipment and intellectual property acquired from former Hitachi Metals facilities in North Carolina. This approach has allowed the company to leapfrog the typical research and development timeline, deploying proven commercial-scale technology to meet immediate demand. The company aims to scale production to meet a substantial portion of the U.S. defense industry's annual requirement, reducing the Pentagon's exposure to foreign supply shocks.

To support this manufacturing capacity, USA Rare Earth is developing the Round Top Heavy Rare Earth and Critical Minerals Project in West Texas. Round Top is a unique geological deposit containing a wide suite of magnetic rare earths alongside lithium, beryllium and gallium. The company is piloting a continuous ion exchange processing method to efficiently separate these materials from the rhyolite host rock. While the mine development continues, the company has secured intermediate feedstock supplies to ensure the Oklahoma plant can operate independently of the mine’s timeline.

Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. (OTC: LYSDY)

Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. remains the most significant producer of separated rare earth materials outside the People’s Republic of China, providing the global market with a proven non-Chinese supply of NdPr oxide. The Australian firm has substantially reconfigured its industrial footprint to mitigate regulatory risks and expand capacity.

The company’s new cracking and leaching facility in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, is now fully operational. This plant processes the lanthanide concentrate from the Mt Weld mine locally, removing radioactive waste material before shipping a mixed rare earth carbonate to Malaysia for final separation. This operational change was necessitated by tightened environmental regulations in Malaysia but has ultimately strengthened the company’s supply chain by retaining the most hazardous waste handling within the mining jurisdiction of Australia.

Simultaneously, Lynas is constructing a heavy rare earth separation facility in Seadrift, Texas, a project partially funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. This facility is designed to process heavy rare earth feedstock to produce separated dysprosium and terbium, materials that are currently sourced almost exclusively from China.

General Motors Company (NYSE: GM)

General Motors Company has fundamentally altered its procurement strategy to become an active participant in the mining sector, recognizing that raw material availability is the primary bottleneck for its ""Ultium"" electric vehicle platform. The automaker is investing directly in resource development to secure the lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese required for its battery cells. GM’s $650 million equity investment in Lithium Americas Corp. has facilitated the development of the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, the largest known lithium source in the United States. This deal grants GM exclusive access to the Phase 1 production from Thacker Pass, ensuring a domestic supply of lithium carbonate that enables its vehicles to qualify for full consumer tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Beyond lithium, GM has forged a web of direct supply agreements for other battery metals, bypassing traditional intermediaries. The company has multi-year contracts with Glencore for cobalt and with Vale for low-carbon nickel sulfate from Canada. GM is also constructing a localized cathode active material supply chain through a joint venture with POSCO Chemical in Quebec, which will process materials sourced from GM’s mining partners. The automaker is heavily investing in a closed-loop battery recycling ecosystem through its collaboration with Li-Cycle, aiming to recover up to 95 percent of the critical minerals from end-of-life batteries and manufacturing scrap.

Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE: SCCO)

Southern Copper Corporation is leveraging its position as the holder of the world’s largest copper reserves to meet the structural supply deficit projected for the late 2020s. The company operates open-pit mines in Peru and Mexico that are among the lowest-cost producers in the industry, allowing it to generate robust cash flows even during periods of price volatility.

A major development for the company is the advancement of the Tía María project in the Arequipa region of Peru. After more than a decade of social and political delays, the company has commenced construction on the $1.4 billion greenfield mine. Tía María is expected to produce 120,000 tons of copper cathodes annually using solvent extraction and electrowinning technology, which eliminates the need for a smelter and reduces the environmental footprint. The successful activation of this project signals a significant improvement in the company’s ability to navigate complex community relations in Peru.

In Mexico, Southern Copper is investing heavily to expand its Buenavista Zinc and Pilares projects, aiming to increase its total production capacity to over 1.2 million tons of copper per year. The company is also advancing the massive Michiquillay project in Cajamarca, Peru, a world-class deposit that is currently in the exploration and social baseline study phase. Southern Copper’s strategy focuses on organic growth through the development of its own extensive concession portfolio rather than through expensive acquisitions.

Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ: PLL)

Piedmont Lithium Inc. is establishing itself as a multi-jurisdictional supplier of lithium hydroxide, balancing near-term revenue generation with long-term domestic development. The company’s Carolina Lithium project in Gaston County, North Carolina, has received its state mining permit, a crucial regulatory victory that clears the path for construction. This fully integrated project is designed to mine spodumene ore and convert it into battery-grade lithium hydroxide on the same site, minimizing logistics costs and carbon emissions.

However, recognizing the time required to build such a facility, Piedmont has executed a strategy to secure lithium units earlier through international partnerships. The company holds a supply agreement and equity interest in Sayona Mining’s Quebec operations, where production is already underway at the North American Lithium complex. This partnership allows Piedmont to sell commercial shipments of spodumene concentrate to the global market while its U.S. assets are developed.

Piedmont is also advancing the Ewoyaa Lithium Project in Ghana in partnership with Atlantic Lithium. The company is funding the development of this asset in exchange for a 50 percent interest in the project’s production. The Ewoyaa material is intended to serve as a primary feedstock for Piedmont’s proposed conversion facility in Tennessee, known as Tennessee Lithium. This merchant plant aims to process foreign concentrate into domestic lithium hydroxide, further expanding the U.S. refining base.

Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. (NYSE: NMG)

Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. is nearing the completion of its ""ore-to-anode"" business model, aimed at providing a carbon-neutral alternative to Chinese synthetic and natural graphite. The company is constructing the Matawinie Mine in Saint-Michel-des-Saints, Quebec, which is notable for being the world’s first open-pit mine designed to operate with an all-electric fleet of mining equipment. This electrification strategy allows the company to produce graphite concentrate with a significantly lower carbon footprint than competitors. The extracted material will be transported to the company’s advanced manufacturing plant in Bécancour, Quebec, a dedicated battery materials industrial park. Here, the concentrate will be shaped and purified to produce the coated spherical graphite required for lithium-ion battery anodes.

The company has solidified its commercial viability through multi-year offtake agreements with anchor customers General Motors and Panasonic Energy. These contracts cover the vast majority of the company’s projected Phase 1 production, providing the revenue certainty needed to secure project financing. Nouveau Monde has also attracted strategic capital investments from Mitsui & Co. and Pallinghurst Resources, partners that bring both financial strength and logistical expertise.

Perpetua Resources Corp. (NASDAQ: PPTA)

Perpetua Resources Corp. has achieved a historic regulatory milestone for its Stibnite Gold Project in central Idaho, securing a Final Record of Decision from the U.S. Forest Service. This approval authorizes the company to proceed with the restoration and redevelopment of the brownfield site, which was abandoned by previous operators decades ago. The project is unique in that it contains one of the largest economic reserves of antimony not controlled by China.

Antimony is a federally designated critical mineral essential for the production of munitions, specifically as a hardening agent for lead in bullets and in the primers of small-caliber ammunition. It is also increasingly vital for large-scale liquid metal batteries used in grid energy storage.

Recognizing the national security implications of the project, the U.S. Department of Defense has awarded Perpetua Resources nearly $75 million in funding through the Defense Production Act and other initiatives to accelerate the project's development. This government backing effectively de-risks the permitting and construction timeline, validating the project's strategic necessity.

Perpetua’s plan involves reprocessing historical tailings to recover gold and antimony while simultaneously repairing the environmental damage left by World War II-era mining, including the restoration of fish passage for native salmon populations.

For the global community of hydropower engineers, the plan contains a clear signal: long-duration electricity storage (LDES), including pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), will be indispensable to meeting the country’s clean-power ambitions.
It also sets the stage for more than 10,000 jobs linked to clean-energy industries and support for over 1,000 community energy projects, expanding public participation in the energy transition.
By investing in clean power, supporting local projects, and unlocking British industry, Great British Energy will help deliver an energy system that works for everyone.” Energy Secretary Ed Miliband added: “We set up Great British Energy to be a national champion that allows us to reap the benefits of Britain’s natural resources.

For the global community of hydropower engineers, the plan contains a clear signal: long-duration electricity storage (LDES), including pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), will be indispensable to meeting the country’s clean-power ambitions.

The plan details how GBE will deliver at least 15GW of clean generation and storage by 2030, mobilise £15 billion of private finance, and build an income-generating portfolio whose returns will be reinvested into new capacity. It also sets the stage for more than 10,000 jobs linked to clean-energy industries and support for over 1,000 community energy projects, expanding public participation in the energy transition.

Speaking on publication of the strategy, GBE CEO Dan McGrail said: “We are proud to be putting public ownership to work, unlocking investment, powering communities, creating jobs, and building an energy system that delivers for the UK.

“This Strategic Plan marks a major milestone in our mission to accelerate clean energy and the industries that support it.”

GBE Chair Juergen Maier emphasised the stakes for public benefit, saying: “This plan puts the UK public at the heart of our energy future. By investing in clean power, supporting local projects, and unlocking British industry, Great British Energy will help deliver an energy system that works for everyone.”

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband added: “We set up Great British Energy to be a national champion that allows us to reap the benefits of Britain’s natural resources.

“This plan shows what a publicly-owned energy company will deliver: an abundance of clean, homegrown energy for British people and thousands of good jobs across the country.”

Behind these political statements lies a technical message that will resonate strongly with engineers: the UK cannot reach its clean-power goals without a massive scale-up of long-duration storage. According to the Strategic Plan, system-operator modelling shows Britain will need 7–10GW of LDES by 2035, compared to around 2.7GW today, capacity largely provided by existing pumped storage schemes. Demand for short-duration batteries is also expected to triple, but the plan makes clear that only LDES can provide the multi-hour to multi-day flexibility required to manage periods of low wind and low solar generation.

GBE notes that while the UK’s new LDES “cap and floor” mechanism is designed to unlock projects such as new PHES, it will not alone overcome the high upfront capital costs, long construction times, and revenue uncertainty that have slowed progress. To address this, the company signals it will take a direct role as developer and equity investor, absorbing early-stage risk, anchoring project finance, and helping projects reach bankability. GBE frames this as a “public ownership with purpose” model, using public capital to crowd in private investment while retaining long-term value for consumers.

The plan also underscores the relationship between storage and the UK’s projected surge in renewable generation. Without intervention, onshore solar and wind could fall 6–15GW short of the levels required by 2035, and offshore wind – expected to reach as much as 86GW by the same year – could face a shortfall of up to 38GW. Deep-water and floating offshore wind, in particular, are expected to increase the system’s reliance on multi-day storage, heightening the importance of pumped hydro and other LDES technologies.

To support this build-out, GBE is also launching a £1 billion “Energy – Engineered in the UK” programme to strengthen domestic supply chains, including engineering capability relevant to pumped storage civil works, grid infrastructure, and major mechanical systems. The scheme is expected to help deliver the country’s industrial strategy while creating thousands of skilled jobs in regions transitioning from oil and gas.

Although the plan spans only the first five years of operation, GBE makes clear that long-duration storage will remain central as the UK’s electricity demand grows and renewables become its dominant power source.",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-09-at-12.47.15.png,N,,2025-12-09 12:01:46.515973

- Solar Installations Peak (for Now) –

LONDON and NEW YORK and SINGAPORE, Dec. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Global Energy today released its Top Trends report identifying the pivotal developments shaping clean energy technology, sustainability and growth in global energy markets in 2026. The report was produced by analysts of its Horizons team, which provides comprehensive energy expansion and sustainability intelligence, from big picture trends to asset level insights.

""In 2026, AI's surging power demand growth will be testing grid limits, revenue models and sustainability goals,"" said Eduard Sala de Vedruna, Vice President and Head of Research, Horizons, S&P Global Energy. ""The pace of progress will depend on unlocking new capacity and flexibility, with grid modernization a key constraint on energy security and competitiveness.""

S&P Global Energy Horizons Top Trends for 2026—tackling themes from AI's rapid growth, geopolitical realignments, and mounting climate risks—highlight how energy expansion and sustainability are necessarily interlinked.

""The interplay of AI-driven demand, grid bottlenecks, evolving procurement strategies, and rising climate risks highlights how energy expansion and sustainability are not parallel ambitions, but intertwined imperatives,"" said Leanne Todd, Senior Vice President, Global Head of Horizons, S&P Global Energy.

TOP TRENDS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT:

As AI uptake soars in 2026, energy supply and sustainability commitments face a breaking point. S&P Global Energy Horizon's high growth view shows global datacenter power demand increasing 17% to 2026 and 14% per year through 2030, reaching potential demand of over 2,200 TWh, equivalent to India's current electricity use. This surge is testing grid limits and sustainability goals, with 38% of assessed companies with datacenter operations lacking net-zero commitments. Major tech firms including Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta are exploring new options to reconcile their power needs without compromising on their climate targets as aggregate US datacenter capital spending approaches $500 billion in 2026.

Solar growth peaks (for now): first annual slowdown in renewables additions in 2026. China's annual additions will fall from roughly 300 GW in 2025 to about 200 GW in 2026, triggered by a major policy shift from guaranteed pricing to competitive bidding. With China accounting for 50% of global additions over the past decade, this slowdown will have a deep impact. For the first time ever, new global solar installations are expected to decline year-on-year, albeit by less than 10%, as emerging markets take up some of the slack Despite this contraction, cumulative PV capacity is still expected to double over the next five years, supported by emerging markets and continued innovation, including faster deployment of battery energy storage.

Grid modernization becomes a key energy security, transition and competitiveness constraint. Decades of underinvestment have created a critical bottleneck as the world races to electrify and decarbonize. With 40% of EU grids over 40 years old, the European Commission estimates €584 billion in grid capital expenditure is needed by 2030 to support decarbonization. The US faces potential limitations on the ability to deliver needed power without investment to support explosive AI-driven datacenter growth, making grid modernization a national competitiveness issue.

Flexible Power Purchase Agreements become the new standard as price volatility reshapes how risks are managed. Increasing renewable capacity is leading to more zero- and negatively priced settlements, driving the evolution from traditional PPAs to complex hybrid structures that integrate multiple technologies and storage. The market is moving toward shorter contract terms and stronger downside protections as extreme price swings become more visible, particularly in Europe where PPA indices remain well below cost-based levels. Datacenters account for 27 gigawatts (GW), or 43% of total corporate power procurement in 2025 through October, continuing as a leading sector for clean energy procurement.

As the rest of the world slows down to consider, China gets serious about green hydrogen. Chinese projects will install about 1.5 GW of electrolyzers in 2025, nearly doubling the 1.7 GW installed globally at end-2024, with deployment projected to reach 4.5 GW in 2026. Electrolyzer stack prices have plunged from $250 per kilowatt (/kW) in early 2024 to under $100/kW due to oversupply and fierce competition. Unlike solar and batteries, Chinese firms aim to export energy as well as technology, with at least two Chinese green ammonia plants receiving EU certification for clean molecule exports, with indications of prices as low as $600 per metric ton on a free-on-board basis (FOB).

Global SAF capacity expands by one third in 2026—Asia leads, Europe pays. Global dedicated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capacity is expected to rise by about one third to eight million metric tons (MMt), though the speed of growth slows compared to the near doubling seen annually from 2022 to 2025. More than half of global SAF capacity will be concentrated in Asia despite modest regional demand, as producers target a European market facing supply shortfalls. Beyond 2026, capacity could increase eightfold to 42 MMt by 2030 if announced projects materialize, though only 7.3 MMt have reached final investment decision.

EV uptake continues as China has shown that EVs can be price-competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. China appears on track to become the first major ""EV majority"" market globally, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) representing about 50% of new light vehicle sales in the first three quarters of 2025. Europe shows renewed growth due to stricter CO2 standards, while the US faces its first test of organic consumer demand without tailwinds of federal EV tax credits in 2026. Emerging markets including Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Mexico, Nigeria and Malaysia are identified as relatively ripe for Chinese EV adoption.

Global trade and climate policy is increasingly focused on harmonizing emissions reporting. The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) takes effect January 1st, 2026, requiring accountability for carbon intensity of imported goods, while major revisions are proposed for the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard. Potential proliferation of carbon border adjustment mechanisms requires companies to report different emissions to different regulators, complicating global trade. The harmonization of product-level carbon accounting is increasingly seen as prerequisite for markets to differentiate products based on carbon intensity.

China leverages global clean energy leadership and further expands influence. China has consolidated its leadership in clean energy deployment, technologies and supply chains. With overall cleantech spending growing 30% over the next five years while upstream spending is expected to remain constant, new global energy investment is shifting eastward. Meanwhile, the US is adopting a more interventionist industrial strategy, featuring greater government involvement through equity stakes and targeted support for technologies like nuclear and advanced geothermal. Diplomatically, China continues active climate participation while the US challenges multilateral efforts, creating additional space for China to expand global influence.

As emissions could drive a 2.3°C rise by 2040, adaptation shifts from optional to essential in 2026. Extreme weather and climate hazards are creating escalating risks for infrastructure, physical assets, and operations. S&P Global Energy Horizons projects annual climate-related costs of ~$885 billion for large publicly traded companies in the 2030s. Climate risk assessments and adaptation planning show patchy uptake across sectors, with an evident adaptation gap even in industries where risk assessment is more common. The increasingly urgent question is no longer whether companies will adapt, but how quickly.

In twenty countries worldwide, renewable energy is now providing 20% or more of electricity, according to a new report by Zero Carbon Analytics. Ten years since the Paris Agreement was signed, the installed renewable electricity capacity has increased 2.4 times globally.

According to the report, wind and solar now power half of the Netherlands’ electricity needs, compared to 11% a decade ago. Chile has shown better progress, as renewables provide electricity to nearly three-fourths of homes and businesses now.

The report found that solar is nearly 80% cheaper, while clean-energy jobs have nearly doubled to 16.2 million. Annual clean-energy investment has climbed to $2.2 trillion—twice that of fossil fuels.

Considering that damages caused by climate change are increasing drastically every year, renewables growth is now more important than ever. The report cited that damages caused by the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies already exceed $28 trillion.

“One can say that Paris has already reduced future risks for people and ecosystems—fewer extreme heat events, lower sea-level rise, and less pressure on vulnerable communities than in a 3-4°C world. The 1.5°C limit and the net zero goal has shaped policy, finance, litigation and sectoral rules. Action has slowed in the last four years, as the impacts have grown, and we are still a long way from 1.5°C. So while the Paris Agreement has bent the curve and begun rewiring the system, our future now depends on whether governments will begin moving forward again at the rate and scale needed to finish the job,” said Bill Hare, CEO, Climate Analytics.

Electricity access through renewables

There are benefits to this renewable energy expansion as well through improved energy security and access. The report found that increased solar energy has reduced the dependence on fossil fuel imports in island nations like the Cook Islands, Kiribati and Martinique.

On the other hand, renewables accounted for 70% of new electricity capacity in Liberia. This helped people in the country gain access to electricity, and twice the number of people have electricity now as compared to a decade back.

“Ten years on, the Paris Agreement has already reshaped the global economy and set in motion a shift towards clean energy that no country can now ignore. This is opening new possibilities for development, energy security and more prosperous, healthier societies. Today the task is to protect the cooperative spirit that made Paris possible, because most countries still want to move forward – and they know the world is better for it,” said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, European Climate Foundation.

Rob Moore is the principal from Scioto Analysis – a group that studied the impact of the way the state is handing out energy permits.

“You have economic growth where we’re trying to make sure that we have enough energy to be able to support the needs that are happening in Ohio,” Moore said. “We recommended that the chamber and business leaders be talking to the legislature and making sure that there are restrictions on how long the process can be.”

The study found the faster the process – the better, because the longer they take, the more likely those projects will fall through.

The study is making several recommendations, including expediting public hearings and standardizing the timeline for their entire process.

Steve Stivers, the CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce – the group that requested the study – said some neighboring states have already been affected.

“Our goal is to make sure that Ohio can quickly and efficiently approve safe projects that will make sure that we can get energy online faster so that we can live the American dream and have an economic miracle here in Ohio,” Stivers said. “Indiana and the MISO region actually had some rolling blackouts about a year ago as a result of too much demand for electricity and not enough supply.”

Congressman Bob Latta (R – Ohio 5th district) said getting energy from one point to the other is a global issue.

This is why Latta said Congress is considering more than a dozen bills related to energy.

“Because our competitors, as I said, the communist Chinese, they’re moving forward and they’re putting the power on,” Latta said. “And again, if you don’t have the power and the grid security and the modernization of the grid out there, you’re falling way behind.”

This study comes as AEP is requesting to increase its rate. A request that company officials said is needed because of the high demand for energy.

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is holding hearings regarding that request this week.

As for the impact on Ohioans, Moore said there’s always a tradeoff, but their research is aiming to find balance.

“Moving the pendulum a little bit more towards efficiency is probably going to be able to protect environmental concerns and community concerns,” Moore said. “While at the same time get more projects through so that energy prices don’t keep on rising and rising.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/WEB_PHOTO_ENERGY_PERMIT_crop,N,,2025-12-09 15:03:02.011544

When presenting the Green Deal Industrial Plan in 2023, Ursula von der Leyen stated that “the race is on to determine who is going to be dominant in the clean tech market in the future”. In 2025, this race has shifted substantially: Europe’s clean tech producers are now hit by two powerful shocks. US tariff policy under Trump 2.0 is creating massive uncertainty for trade, while the rollback of clean industrial policy puts clean tech investments in the US on hold, dampening US demand for European clean tech exports. At the same time, China’s structural oversupply, combined with low manufacturing costs for many clean tech products – from electric vehicles to solar panels – has intensified. Additionally, US trade barriers have led to the redirection of cheap Chinese exports towards Europe, amplifying price pressure on EU-based manufacturers and deepening Europe’s dependency on Chinese tech. The immediate effect is a squeeze on European producers from weaker sales abroad and tougher competition at home.

The window for the EU to respond is narrow. Without timely action to shore up its industrial base, the current squeeze could harden into lasting dependency on a few foreign suppliers of critical clean technologies. Letting Europe’s clean tech base erode through inaction would be a serious strategic mistake, given that the global importance of these industries will only grow in coming years. Despite current challenges, the EU, with its strong industrial and technological base, has all the potential to be a leader in the clean tech race. The EU still has global leaders in wind equipment, heat pumps, next-generation batteries and electrolysers, as well as a large internal market that can create economies of scale. By building on these strengths the EU can claim a leading position – but only if it moves fast and decisively.

The EU therefore needs a short-term, sector-specific response to enable it to weather the immediate shock – protecting European clean tech industries from the impact of US tariffs and redirected Chinese exports – while laying the groundwork for longer-term competitiveness once global demand rebounds. An effective EU policy strategy for clean tech should encompass trade defences against Chinese overcapacity, EU-level production support to complement national state aid for clean tech, and regulatory stability to boost domestic demand for clean tech.

In this paper, we discuss how recent shifts in US trade and industrial policy are changing the prospects for Europe’s clean tech industry, focusing on equipment for wind and solar energy generation, batteries, EVs, electrolysers and heat pumps. We conclude with detailed policy recommendations to strengthen these key industries.

2. Tariffs up, industrial policy down: How US actions affect EU clean tech producers

This section examines how recent US policies are reshaping Europe’s clean tech industry in two distinct ways. Section 2.1 looks at the impact of trade turmoil on the EU market – how renewed US tariffs and Chinese overcapacity are redirecting low-priced Chinese exports toward Europe, intensifying price competition and import dependency. Section 2.2 then turns to the impact on EU exporters, analysing how the rollback of US climate support and weaker domestic demand under Trump affect European producers selling into the American market.

2.1 Trade diversion: ith new US trade policy, the EU market is facing greater inflows of cheap Chinese clean tech

For years, China has been providing ample industrial policy support to its clean tech sectors, including massive subsidies. The result is a persistent supply glut: despite record-high clean tech deployment at home, large parts of Chinese capacity remain underutilised. Facing a saturated home market, Chinese firms are increasingly exporting excess output. Thanks to their willingness to reduce export prices and accept the resultant losses,1 China’s market share in the global market for clean tech has been increasing quickly.

Past US tariff hikes increased the inflow of Chinese clean tech to the EU market. Under the first Trump administration, the US created widespread trade barriers to China. The Biden administration broadly maintained this protectionist strategy: the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the post-pandemic stimulus package supporting climate and clean tech investments, largely excluded foreign producers, including EU ones. Moreover, the Biden administration kept high tariffs, especially on China. As a consequence, Chinese exports have been redirected away from the US and towards more open markets such as the EU. As shown in Chart 1, in 2023, around 40 per cent of China’s clean tech ex-ports across six major technologies went to Europe, up from 12 per cent in 2016. At the same time, the share of Chinese clean tech exports to the US stagnated. This indicates that the EU has absorbed some of the Chinese export volume displaced from the US market.

By 2024, about 73 per cent of the EU’s clean tech imports originated in China (Chart 2). This growing import concentration makes Europe highly vulnerable to tariff-induced price competition from Chinese firms, as new US trade barriers instituted by President Trump in 2025 continue to redirect low-priced Chinese exports into the EU market.

At the same time, it is important to distinguish between the share of EU imports coming from China for a given good and China’s market share in the EU: these metrics indicate different levels of dependency. For example, Chinese EVs make up about 60 per cent of EU imports, as illustrated in Chart 2, but EVs made in China only represented about 20 per cent of EV sales in the EU in 2023 (and 8 per cent if we consider Chinese brands only).2 Conversely, in 2024 the EU imported more solar panels from China than it installed.3

While clean tech products have not been a key focus for Trump, both country-specific and sectoral tariffs affect them heavily. In sectors where China has still been exporting large quantities of goods to the US, the EU will likely face an even greater inflow of cheap Chinese products than is currently the case. Simulations suggest that the scale of trade diversion under a renewed US–China tariff escalation could be substantial. In a severe scenario, EU imports from China could rise by 7–10 per cent, according to estimates by the European Central Bank (ECB).4

Trade diversion is highly uneven across sectors. In the short run, highly standardised goods, whose demand is highly sensitive to price, are most prone to redirection following a tariff shock.5 This includes goods like solar panels and batteries: China could increase its supply of these goods to non-US markets by nearly 30 per cent, according to estimates.6 Likewise, these sectors are also the most responsive to tariffs. In contrast, complex, regulation-intensive technologies are less sensitive to short-term price shifts, and hence less prone to rerouting. These products include electric vehicles, wind turbine systems and to some degree electrolysers. Their supply chains rely on certification, standards alignment, and high capital investment, which protect them from short-term shocks but also make them harder to rebuild once displaced.

A striking example of trade re-routing in the first US-China trade war was lithium-ion batteries. Batteries are the only clean technology where the US and the EU imported comparable volumes from China ahead of the 2018-2020 trade war. The US did not entirely close its market to Chinese batteries (unlike EVs), but introduced a series of harsher trade restrictions than the EU. As a result, Chinese import concentration in the US declined in 2019-2020 – showing that the US diversified its battery imports in response – while it continued to rise in the EU. Afterwards, import concentration from China picked up again in the US, though at a slower pace than in the EU (Chart 3).

This pattern appears to be repeating itself under Trump 2.0: since the start of 2025, US battery imports from China have fallen sharply while EU imports have continued to rise, hinting at a possible renewed diversion of Chinese supply from the US market towards Europe. As trade redirection towards the EU increases, Chinese export prices are bound to go down even further. There is already some evidence of this for batteries: unit prices of Chinese batteries imported into the EU (in US dollars per kg) declined by approximately 17 per cent between December 2024 and August 2025. While part of this decline reflects technological improvements and lower input costs, the fall was more than three times steeper than in the preceding eight-month period – suggesting that stronger price competition linked to market redirection also played a role.7

2.2 A turnaround in US industrial policy, while the EU slowly crafts its own

The second Trump administration is rolling back US climate policies and cutting down substantially on the industrial policy subsidies that boosted American clean tech manufacturing under Joe Biden’s presidency. This is exemplified by the shift from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to Trump’s signature budget bill, the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ (OBBB).

Adopted in August 2022, the IRA offered various types of financial incentives over a planned time horizon of 10 years. For manufacturing, this included tax credits for products such as solar energy components, power inverters, batteries and critical raw materials. To boost deployment, the IRA offered purchase incentives for consumers to adopt EVs and heat pumps, as well as subsidies for producing and storing clean energy with solar panels and batteries. These generous support schemes came with a large but hard-to-pinpoint fiscal cost, with overall manufacturing subsidies officially estimated at $72.7 billion for the years 2023-2027.8 This is substantially larger than the EU and member-states have been offering.

But Trump’s OBBB is now entirely stopping some IRA subsidies and is speeding up the phase-out of others.9 Additionally, the Trump administration is actively erecting investment barriers against some clean technologies, including by attacking individual projects in wind energy. The effect is substantial: for US electricity and clean fuels production alone, the OBBB is estimated to reduce cumulative capital investments by $500 billion in 2025-2035.10

Overall, the new US administration is creating substantial headwinds for EU exporters, as well as some limited opportunities. The new US policies have three key impacts on the US market: First, US demand for many clean technologies has started to fall, and is set to contract further. Second, future US supply of clean technologies will be lower than expected as well. However, the OBBB does not reduce most manufacturing subsidies significantly, so the supply reduction is likely to be less pronounced than the demand reduction (see Chart 4 below). Third, the new tariffs might squeeze China out of the US market in product categories where it is still exporting to the US, possibly providing some opportunities for EU exporters to capture its market share. If US demand for a given technology fell by less than domestic supply and Chinese imports combined, this would represent an opportunity for EU exporters – otherwise, exports to the US are likely to be reduced.

For some EU exports, such as EVs, reduced US demand is probably the dominant effect – and a key drag. US demand for clean tech was boosted substantially by the IRA. For example, the IRA offered an EV tax credit of up to $7,500, which was also available for EU-made EVs (although only for leased vehicles). Given that the US is a key export market for EU-made EVs (see Chart 5), the IRA would have provided crucial demand for EU car makers over the coming years. However, the OBBB has phased out EV tax credits, which will, it is estimated, result in 27-41 million fewer EV sales in 2035, a 20-30 per cent reduction from the current policy scenario.11 On top of that, Trump 2.0 has also used executive orders to reverse some of the supportive EV regulation of the Biden administration, like the vehicle emissions standards, as well as state-level policy initiatives, such as EV mandates in California.

At the same time, the potential for European substitution for Chinese EV exports is marginal. Because of prohibitive tariffs and regulatory restrictions, Chinese EV exports to the United States have already been negligible, at only $389 million in 2023 – barely 2 per cent of total US EV imports. Moreover, US policy has favoured reshoring and continental supply integration in North America (as part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) rather than substituting imports from Europe for those from China.12 Additionally, the US is currently on track to double its production capacity to about 6 million EVs per year, while demand is estimated only at 4 million.13 Overall, the outlook for EU EV exports to the US market, relative to the baseline pre-Trump, has deteriorated sharply.

On the other hand, heat pump exports to the US are currently comparatively small, but could present a growing opportunity for EU producers in spite of the US phasing out heat pump subsidies. Because about 40 per cent of the US imports of heat pumps in 2024 came from China, tariffs on these goods would create tangible room for European manufacturers – provided they can match US price points and expand production. Chart 6 shows that European exports of heat pumps to the US rose sharply during the pandemic, after the previous US–China tariff rounds in the first Trump administration. This suggests that European suppliers could increase their export capacity again, especially if Chinese competitors retreated.

For clean energy generation components, the outlook for EU exporters is mixed. With the IRA, subsidies for wind and solar energy were around $30/MWh, totalling approximately $30 billion per year,14 which substantially boosted demand for wind and solar parks. Similarly, the 3 USD/kg unit subsidy for green hydrogen was sizeable. But the OBBB is phasing out solar, wind and hydrogen tax credits much earlier than planned, leading to estimated cuts in renewable energy investment in the US by at least $60 billion in 2028.15

Most of these changes in US subsidies affect EU manufacturers too. Solar panels are the exception, given that the EU does not export many of them anyway. While the market for electrolysers is quite small today, it is likely to grow substantially in the future, with EU producers well-positioned to capture parts of the US market.

On the other hand, EU exports of wind energy components to the US are likely to decrease in the short term. Wind energy is one of the few strongholds of EU clean tech industry, and EU-based manufacturers benefitted from and supplied products to power the IRA-driven surge of wind park projects in the US. However, the impact on wind energy of Trump’s policy reversal is already evident in the decline in demand for wind energy components. One striking example was the Trump administration’s unilateral halt to the $1.5 billion ‘Revolution Wind’ offshore wind project, for which EU manufacturers supplied most of the high value kit.16 While a federal judge’s decision has since ordered work to resume,17 getting permits for new wind projects will undoubtedly be much more difficult under this administration. Consequently, the export opportunities created by the IRA for wind are mostly gone for now. A silver lining might be that the US retrenchment causes some international wind project developers to shift their investments from the US to the EU, as indicated by recent investment figures for wind parks in Chart 7.

In the battery sector, EU companies will have to compete against the massive domestic production capacities being built in the US (Chart 8). While the evolution of US domestic demand is uncertain given the ongoing policy U-turns,19 the estimated battery production capacity in the US would be largely sufficient to satisfy it, indicating that EU exporters will face fierce competition on the US market. Even though US trade barriers against Chinese batteries are limiting their imports, it will be a challenge for EU producers to capture an increasing market share in the US.

In sum, Trump’s policy reversal has worsened the prospects for exports of key EU clean technologies to the US. This will hit exports of EVs and wind energy equipment particularly hard, because they benefitted from IRA provisions. US domestic capacity for bat-tery manufacturing is growing, so it will be difficult for EU battery producers to seize a large market share. Some smaller industries – such as heat pumps and electrolysers – could benefit from Chinese goods being largely excluded from the US market, however.

3. Policy recommendations

The EU lacks a clear clean tech strategy. In response to the IRA, in mid-2024 the EU adopted the Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA), which set targets for domestic clean tech manufacturing – some ambitious, others unrealistic. However, since then, the EU has continued to slip behind China, instead of catching up with it, in many clean technologies.20 With the Clean Industrial Deal (CID), the EU has correctly identified its problems and the right machinery to tackle them, such as ‘Buy European’ requirements to support the emergence of markets for clean tech, continued carbon pricing, a faster and less bureaucratic regulatory framework, as well as financial support. But whether these instruments are wielded in pursuit of a clear strategy, and with sufficient force, will only be answered in the next one to two years, once legislation is adopted. The medium-term picture is more positive: if a climate-ambitious administration came into office in the US after the 2029 election, US clean tech demand could rebound, to be partly satisfied by EU producers. But as emerging countries start considering tariffs on Chinese exports,21 more Chinese production could be diverted onto European markets.

What the EU needs today is targeted industrial policy to help its clean tech industry weather the current rough patch and position itself for a possible upswing. The Industrial Accelerator Act, to be proposed by the Commission in December 2025, can incorporate many of the necessary measures. This is how these policies should be structured:

1) Step up trade defences against Chinese overcapacity

Deploy tariffs where dumping destroys capacity, not where cheap inputs lower costs. Europe should target trade-defence measures to support sectors most exposed to Chinese price competition, such as batteries. Demand for this type of commoditised good is highly sensitive to price changes, and below-cost imports can quickly wipe out EU producers. By contrast, for solar panels, where global overcapacity is extreme and EU re-shoring would demand unmanageable subsidies, the EU should continue to benefit from low-priced imports to accelerate installation.

Expand European preferences in public procurement – but keep them open to allies. With Chinese exports increasingly redirected toward Europe, European preferences could raise returns and reduce risk for EU firms. This is important for wind and battery manufacturing equipment – technologies that are both central to Europe’s clean tech value chains and highly exposed to Chinese price pressure. Clean tech tenders should favour EU-based supply chains by weighting carbon footprint, recyclability and – for tackling import concentration on China – supply-chain diversification in award criteria. This would keep the EU approach to procurement open to partners meeting equivalent standards, while keeping non-allies – particularly China – out of tenders for selected products. The European Commission should activate the International Procurement Instrument when European businesses face unfair barriers abroad in procurement, allowing Europe to penalise or exclude bidders from countries that do not reciprocate market openness.

Introduce clear obligations for foreign investment in strategic sectors to protect critical capacities and avoid future dependency. Foreign direct investment (FDI) can help expand Europe’s manufacturing capacity, but it does not automatically create local jobs, technology transfer, or diversified supply chains. To ensure that it does, the EU should screen investments in strategic industries. Such FDI should be conditional on investments in local R&D, workforce training and knowledge sharing. This would ensure that foreign capital builds European capabilities rather than increasing dependency on a single supplier. These tools should complement anti-dumping and subsidies counter-vailing tariffs, including anti-circumvention measures, as well as decisive measures under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, helping to maintain a level playing field.

2) Offset the US demand shock in sectors in which Europe is competitive

Provide regulatory and demand-side stability in sectors of European industrial strength. A mix of policies could buttress EU clean tech production in the face of weaker US demand. In wind energy, such policies could include multi-year auction pipelines, predictable contracts for difference (CfDs) that guaranteed developers a fixed revenue and reduced exposure to volatile electricity prices, and accelerated permitting for wind parks. In the automotive sector, the EU should stick to the 2035 phase-out of internal combustion engines, harmonise consumer incentives across member-states, and accelerate the buildout of charging infrastructure for EVs. Policy certainty would give firms the confidence to invest through the current geopolitical turbulence.

For consumer-facing technologies like heat pumps, demand stability is equally vital. Stable regulatory frameworks, subsidies, accessible financing and predictable public-sector procurement – for schools, hospitals, and renovation of public buildings – is needed to create steady demand for these emerging technologies. The EU should also top up national subsidies with European funding, drawing on instruments like the planned European Competitiveness Fund and Horizon Europe, ensuring predictable resources and a truly common industrial effort rather than fragmented national initiatives.

3) Boost supply-side support for strategic emerging industries

Expand Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs) and simplify access for emerging technologies. IPCEIs are state-aid regulatory instruments that ena-ble member-states and firms to co-operate on large, cross-border industrial investments considered strategic. Yet complex approval procedures slow their impact, and so far they only exist for a limited number of sectors. To maximise their potential, the EU should: (1) continue its efforts to simplify access and reduce procedural burdens, enabling faster decision-making and project deployment; (2) broaden coverage, set by member states via the Joint European Forum for IPCEIs, to include technologies in which European producers can grow and lead – for example heat-pumps and emerging battery technology (such as sodiumion types); and (3) make IPCEIs eligible for addi-tional EU funding (via instruments like the European Competitiveness Fund) to achieve the size and scope needed for truly pan-European industrial scale. At present, projects rely mainly on national budgets, which constrains their scale and excludes countries with less fiscal capacity. EU co-financing could support larger projects where potential and European benefits are highest.

Complement national aid frameworks with EU-level production support. The EU’s new Clean Industrial State Aid Framework (CISAF) allows member-states to provide support to clean tech manufacturing, but it does not bridge differences in fiscal capacity between them. Moreover, it does not have the time horizon to deliver predictable, long-term support, and only allows investment aid, not production-linked subsidies. But the latter could help Europe’s battery and hydrogen industries remain competitive during ramp-up until uptake and learning curves reduce costs. This is particularly relevant for batteries, where high electricity and input costs have been important drivers behind the erosion of Europe’s cost competitiveness.

4. Conclusion

EU clean tech is facing a double shock – strong Chinese competition fuelled by technological innovation and overcapacities, and stagnating demand in the US due to an abrupt policy reversal. Combined with an uncertain policy outlook at home, these shocks threaten clean tech manufacturing, even though the EU starts from a strong industrial base.

Beyond short term impacts on EU exports, US retrenchment opens possibilities for the EU to position itself better globally. At least for the next few years, the US will be a less prominent player in the global race for clean tech. Yet this race will go ahead: the EU should seize this opportunity to position itself as a powerhouse in a growing market, as clean tech manufacturing is one of the few economic domains where the EU can surpass the US and resist China’s manufacturing take-over. As this paper outlined, the EU needs a coherent strategy to become a global clean tech leader: targeted trade defence measures, EU-level industrial support that complement national measures, and consistent climate policy signals.",https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/styles/spotlight/public/offshore_windpark_sl.jpg?itok=sHzb3eX-,N,,2025-12-09 10:00:09.267439

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,” James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,’' she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,’' Kennedy said.

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,’' she said, adding that the Trump administration “should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.’'",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/73a6fa0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7891x4439+0+412/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F74%2Fa5%2Fb6fb46997120b6f9954f2c4d2e33%2F7a37973f9f0b4a87a19e757ec22f1242,N,,2025-12-09 14:03:31.194836

Further, the conductors and transformers affected are designed to handle overloads significantly greater than those caused by inadvertent export.
The voltage screen for export-limited projects addresses this risk by estimating their impact on grid voltage, using the formula below.
Continuing momentum on common-sense procedures This settlement marks a significant victory for clean, distributed energy in Michigan.","Michigan communities can breathe easier this winter knowing that the state just streamlined the process to connect affordable and reliable clean energy, thanks to an update to utility DTE’s interconnection procedures.

When a customer is seeking to connect a distributed energy resource (DER) such as rooftop solar to the grid, their electric utility’s interconnection procedures detail the steps to ensure it is done legally and safely. The procedures also govern requirements for DERs to be eligible for incentives such as net metering.

In April 2023, Michigan updated its statewide rules (the MIXDG rules) for the first time since 2009, requiring each utility to revise its procedures and submit them to the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) for review and approval. The MPSC found that each utility needed to make some changes—but especially DTE, the only utility whose application was converted to a contested case complete with expert testimony, cross-examination, and legal briefs.

UCS and our partners in Michigan intervened in the case, where I filed testimony focusing largely on how “export-limited” DERs, described below, are handled. Later, we worked directly with DTE on a settlement agreement to resolve the complicated technical issues of the case. In an MPSC ruling last week, the agreement was accepted, with DTE’s updated procedures taking effect immediately.

The approved procedures mark a major step forward for clean energy interconnection, making the process clearer, fairer, and more consistent with modern standards and technology, paving the way for more clean energy to come online.

In this blog, I’ll discuss export-limited DERs, how they’re addressed in the updated procedures, and what this means for distributed, clean energy in Michigan.

What are export-limited DERs?

An export-limited DER is a system where the maximum output to the grid is constrained to be less than the DER’s full capacity. This may be needed if the first step in the procedures, the “penetration screen,” indicates that the grid has insufficient hosting capacity for the proposed DER. Adding power to the grid above its hosting capacity could compromise the safety and reliability of the grid.

Historically, penetration screens have assumed a worst-case scenario, comparing the nameplate capacity of the DER (its maximum rated power) to the peak demand of the neighborhood electric circuit where it will connect. This made sense for DERs like fossil fuel generators that can provide their full output at any time, but it’s excessively conservative for solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, the predominant type of DER being connected today.

To understand why, consider a typical 50 unit apartment building in Detroit with 80 kilowatts (kW) of rooftop solar panels. On a sunny summer day, the highest output from the solar is about 60 kW—but at the same time, the building uses about 100 kW, meaning there’s no net export to the grid. In fact, the highest net output during the year is about 50 kW on a typical spring day, shown below.

While the nameplate capacity of this hypothetical system is 80 kW, in practice it almost never exports more than 50 kW to the grid, as the building’s own load is typically consuming everything above that amount. If the project faced a hosting capacity limit of only 50 kW, the building could still connect the 80 kW array (and get all the benefits of the larger system), by constraining (or limiting) what it exports to the grid to 50 kW.

Power control systems enable robust, affordable export limiting

Until about 10 years ago, most options for export limiting were expensive and complicated, and only made sense financially for the largest DERs. But by 2016, manufacturers of solar inverters had begun offering built-in export limiting using power control systems (PCS).

PCS technology has now been on the market for close to 10 years, with California being the first state to allow its use in 2016. The 2020 edition of the National Electrical Code introduced rules governing use of PCS, and was coordinated with changes to UL 1741, the safety standard for solar inverters. Several other states have since approved export limiting with PCS, including Arizona, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, and Nevada.

One challenge which PCS introduce is the risk of “inadvertent export,” the phenomenon when a PCS momentarily exceeds the export limit. If the load behind the PCS suddenly decreases (such as air conditioning cycling off) or if the connected generation suddenly increases (such as clouds parting above the solar array), it may take a moment for the PCS to measure and respond to the change. Without limits or safeguards against inadvertent export, this momentary spike in exported power can result in damage to grid equipment.

Fortunately, the MIXDG rules include two critical safeguards against this risk. First, consistent with UL 3141 (the relevant safety standard), any PCS must be certified to respond to inadvertent export within 30 seconds. Second, if any part of the PCS malfunctions, the DER must stop exporting any energy to the grid.

DTE sought to restrict the use of PCS

Despite these safeguards, in its original August 2023 filing, DTE sought to place three restrictions on PCS in its proposed procedures:

Penetration screens would be based on nameplate capacity, not export capacity, eliminating the principal motivation to use a PCS.

The time limit for a PCS to respond to inadvertent export would be 200 milliseconds, instead of the standard 30 seconds. This is excessively conservative and would make it challenging to find an approved PCS.

The nameplate capacity of a DER with PCS would be limited to no more than 20% above the export capacity. But in typical solar-plus-storage systems, the solar and battery are each sized to meet the building’s full load, making the nameplate capacity roughly twice the PCS-limited export capacity—far above the proposed limit.

In testimony, DTE’s witness did not provide evidence of the specific risks or why these restrictions are necessary.

DTE’s proposed limits were excessive and contradicted the rules

In my testimony, I argued that the actual risk of damage from inadvertent export is significantly lower than DTE assumed, making the proposed restrictions unnecessary.

I pointed out that because inadvertent export events are triggered only by sudden changes in load or generation, their impact is naturally limited, and simultaneous or repeated events are highly unlikely. Further, the conductors and transformers affected are designed to handle overloads significantly greater than those caused by inadvertent export. This means that the risk of thermal damage to equipment is essentially zero.

I did acknowledge that there is a minor risk of voltage fluctuations caused by inadvertent export. But rather than using the restrictions DTE proposed, I recommended that this risk be mitigated using a simple voltage screen like the one initially proposed in the BATRIES report. This definitive report was developed by a group of researchers and utilities to support standardization of interconnection procedures for batteries and solar-plus-storage DERs. And as the BATRIES report explains, because voltage issues precede other risks to grid equipment, it also effectively screens for those risks.

Further explanation of the minimal risk posed by inadvertent export is provided in a memo from IREC, included as Exhibit CEO-4 in my direct testimony.

Settlement discussions were long, technical, but productive

After briefs were filed in the case, DTE reached out to discuss a settlement. Over several months, we discussed the procedures point-by-point, hashing out the technical details. Ultimately, we settled on a nuanced approach to limited export DERs which eased the restrictions on PCS while addressing DTE’s safety concerns by adding the voltage screen I had proposed.

DTE agreed to base the penetration screen on export capacity and align the time limit on inadvertent export with the 30 second requirement in the MIXDG rules. DTE also agreed to ease the capacity limits, basing them on the rating of the utility infrastructure rather than the DER size. While I still believe these limits should be higher, they are unlikely to affect most conventional projects. I’ve summarized the (fairly nuanced) limits below:

In practice, on a typical residential feeder served by a 50 kVA transformer, the total nameplate capacity of all export-limited projects could not exceed 150 kW if each individual project was 20 kW or less.

DTE is the first Midwest utility to implement a voltage screen for inadvertent export

A key component of the settlement was the addition of the voltage screen that I had recommended, which addressed DTE’s concerns about the risks of inadvertent export.

The BATRIES team developed the screen to address a gap in the typical screening process that applies to export-limited projects. The limit for the initial penetration screen (15% of peak load) is set to account for the impact of DERs on grid voltage. But if some portion of the DER capacity is export-limited, it’s possible for voltage to rise above acceptable limits during an inadvertent export event, when the active capacity can momentarily exceed the 15% limit. The voltage screen for export-limited projects addresses this risk by estimating their impact on grid voltage, using the formula below. If the voltage change exceeds 3%, then the project fails the screen and must undergo further study.

We discussed this screen at length with DTE, who ultimately agreed to implement it with a few tweaks. As far as we are aware, DTE is the first utility in the Midwest to implement this screen, and one of only a handful across the US to adopt this sophisticated, rational approach to screening export-limited projects.

Other important wins in the settlement

In addition to this significant accomplishment for export-limited projects, there are several other notable settlement terms:

Unintentional islanding: DTE originally required costly direct transfer trip (DTT) for all risks associated with islanding, a safety risk occurring when DERs continue generating power during grid outages. The settlement replaces this with a screening process that triggers a study only when needed and allows more cost-effective mitigation options. DTE will also join workgroup discussions which will consider an updated screening approach developed by IREC.

IEEE 2800 applicability: DTE initially sought to apply the entirety of IEEE 2800—a standard for projects connecting directly to the transmission system—to any project which might impact the transmission system. The settlement narrows this to only the specific clauses relevant to certain projects, giving developers clearer, more appropriate requirements.

Incentive program eligibility: DTE will now account for solar panel orientation and tilt when calculating annual generation for distributed generation program eligibility, allowing many more projects to qualify for incentives.

Continuing momentum on common-sense procedures

This settlement marks a significant victory for clean, distributed energy in Michigan. Alongside the Environmental Law and Policy Center, the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council, Advanced Energy United, and MPSC staff, we worked closely with DTE to develop procedures that comply with the MIXDG rules, provide clear guidance for DER projects, and robustly manage the risk of inadvertent export. The support of IREC, the lead author of the BATRIES report, was also critical early in the case.

It was encouraging to see DTE take up this challenge and implement solutions like the voltage screen. We hope to see the company continue to lead in this way, participating in the interconnection workshops and supporting other Michigan utilities seeking to implement this approach.

In the meantime, customers in DTE’s territory who are seeking to implement clean solar energy projects will have a clearer and more reasonable set of procedures to follow when doing so, resulting in more projects being approved more quickly.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog-Thumbnail-rooftop-solar-in-Michigan.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 13:00:38.549581

The experts acknowledged that the geopolitical situation today was difficult, with the US under Donald Trump, some other countries and corporate vested interests working to block or reverse environmental action.
There were also about $1.5tn in environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, food and mining, the report said.
Watson noted that wind and solar energy was cheaper in many places but held back by vested interests in fossil fuel.
An earlier version said that the GEO report estimated the benefits from climate action alone would be worth “$100bn” by 2100; this should have been $100tn.","The unsustainable production of food and fossil fuels causes $5bn (£3.8bn) of environmental damage per hour, according to a major UN report.

Ending this harm was a key part of the global transformation of governance, economics and finance required “before collapse becomes inevitable”, the experts said.

The Global Environment Outlook (GEO) report, which is produced by 200 researchers for the UN Environment Programme, said the climate crisis, destruction of nature and pollution could no longer be seen as simply environmental crises.

“They are all undermining our economy, food security, water security, human health and they are also [national] security issues, leading to conflict in many parts of the world,” said Prof Robert Watson, the co-chair of the assessment.

All the environmental crises were worsening as the global population grows and required more food and energy, most of which was produced in ways that pollute the planet and destroy the natural world, the experts said. A sustainable world was possible, they said, but required political courage.

“This is an urgent call to transform our human systems now before collapse becomes inevitable,” said Prof Edgar Gutiérrez-Espeleta, another co-chair and the former environment minister in Costa Rica.

“The science is good. The solutions are known. What is required is the courage to act at the scale and speed that history demands,” he said, adding that the window for action was “rapidly narrowing”.

The experts acknowledged that the geopolitical situation today was difficult, with the US under Donald Trump, some other countries and corporate vested interests working to block or reverse environmental action. Watson, a former chair of leading international climate and biodiversity science groups, said: “The public have got to demand that they want a sustainable future for their children and their grandchildren. Most governments do try and respond.”

The GEO report is comprehensive – 1,100 pages this year – and is usually accompanied by a summary for policymakers, which is agreed by all the world’s countries. However, strong objections by countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Turkey and Argentina to references to fossil fuels, plastics, reduced meat in diets and other issues meant no agreement was reached this time.

A statement made by the UK on behalf of 28 countries said: “We witnessed diversion attempts to question the scientific nature of this process. Our delegations fully respect every state’s right to safeguard their country’s national interests and rights, but science is not negotiable.”

The GEO report emphasised that the costs of action were much less than the costs of inaction in the long term, and estimated the benefits from climate action alone would be worth $20tn a year by 2070 and $100tn by 2100. “We need visionary countries and private sector [companies] to recognise they will make more profit by addressing these issues rather than ignoring them,” Watson said.

The report contained several “critical truths”, Gutiérrez-Espeleta said: environmental crises were political and security emergencies, threatening the social ties that held societies together. Today’s governments and economic systems were failing humanity and financial reform was the cornerstone of transformation, he said: “Environmental policy must become the backbone of national security, social justice, and economic strategy.”

One of the biggest issues was the $45tn a year in environmental damage caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, and the pollution and destruction of nature caused by industrial agriculture, the report said. The food system carried the largest costs, at $20tn, with transport at $13tn and fossil-fuel powered electricity at $12tn.

These costs – called externalities by economists – must be priced into energy and food to reflect their real price and shift consumers towards greener choices, Watson said: “So we need social safety nets. We need to make sure that the poorest in society are not harmed by an increase in costs.”

The report suggests measures such as a universal basic income, taxes on meat and subsidies for healthy, plant-based foods.

There were also about $1.5tn in environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, food and mining, the report said. These needed to be removed or repurposed, it added. Watson noted that wind and solar energy was cheaper in many places but held back by vested interests in fossil fuel.

The climate crisis may be even worse than thought, he said: “We are likely to be underestimating the magnitude of climate change”, with global heating probably at the high end of the projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Removing fossil fuel subsidies could cut emissions by a third, the report said.

The convergence of industrial scale production, chemistry innovations, and competitive pressures has created unprecedented cost dynamics that extend far beyond traditional supply and demand mechanisms.

What's Driving the Historic Battery Price Collapse to $108/kWh?

Lithium-ion battery prices fall 2025 has emerged as a defining trend, with pack costs reaching a record low of $108/kWh despite rising raw material expenses. This 8% annual decline represents a 93% reduction from 2010 levels, fundamentally altering the economics of energy storage across multiple applications.

Manufacturing Overcapacity Creates Unprecedented Cost Pressure

Chinese manufacturing facilities have generated substantial production surplus, driving intense price competition throughout global markets. China achieved the steepest regional price reduction at $84/kWh in 2025, representing a 13% real-terms decline from 2024 levels. This oversupply condition has created cut-throat competition that overwhelms traditional cost structures.

The facility utilization dynamics reveal how excess capacity translates into aggressive pricing strategies. Chinese manufacturers maintain production volumes despite margin compression, prioritising market share retention and meeting annual sales targets over short-term profitability.

Regional capacity distribution demonstrates significant concentration:

• China: Dominant production capacity with aggressive export strategies

• North America: Higher cost structures with 44% price premiums

• Europe: Import dependency driving 56% price premiums

Market dynamics show that manufacturing overcapacity has become the primary price determinant, overriding raw material cost fluctuations that would typically drive pricing increases.

Chemistry Shift Accelerates Cost Reduction Beyond Raw Materials

The widespread adoption of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology has created substantial cost advantages across all market segments. LFP battery packs averaged $81/kWh while nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) systems cost $128/kWh, establishing a $47/kWh differential that drives strategic chemistry selection.

Cost differential analysis reveals strategic implications:

Chemistry Type Average Price Cost Advantage Market Penetration LFP Technology $81/kWh 37% lower cost Expanding rapidly NMC Technology $128/kWh Premium pricing Specialty applications Industry Average $108/kWh Benchmark All segments

Performance trade-offs have become increasingly favourable for LFP applications. Grid-scale storage and many automotive applications can accommodate the lower energy density of LFP chemistry while capturing significant cost benefits. China's dominance in LFP production has enabled nearly universal global supply, facilitating rapid market adoption.

Supply Chain Hedging Strategies Neutralise Commodity Volatility

Long-term contract structures have effectively insulated battery manufacturers from spot price volatility in critical materials. Despite rising lithium and cobalt costs due to supply constraints and new export quotas from the Democratic Republic of Congo, these increases did not translate into higher pack prices.

Financial hedging mechanisms enable manufacturers to stabilise input costs across multi-year periods. Vertical integration benefits throughout the value chain have allowed companies to absorb raw material cost increases while maintaining competitive pricing pressure on finished battery packs.

The industry deployed three primary mechanisms to offset higher metal costs: expanded LFP adoption, long-term procurement contracts, and sophisticated financial hedging strategies. Furthermore, the development of spodumene lithium extraction processes has helped improve supply chain efficiency.

Which Market Segments Are Experiencing the Steepest Price Declines?

Stationary Storage Achieves Lowest-Cost Position at $70/kWh

Battery pack prices for stationary storage applications reached $70/kWh in 2025, representing a dramatic 45% year-over-year reduction. This segment experienced the steepest decline among all lithium-ion battery applications and became the lowest-priced category for the first time.

The 45% price reduction transforms grid-scale deployment economics by crossing critical viability thresholds for multiple applications. Energy arbitrage opportunities, peak shaving strategies, and renewable integration projects now achieve economic returns without policy subsidies in many markets.

Grid-scale systems benefit from minimal space constraints, enabling wholesale adoption of lower-cost LFP chemistry without performance compromises. The cost structure at $70/kWh supports 4-hour energy storage systems at approximately $280/kW total cost, creating compelling economics for utility-scale deployments.

Competitive positioning analysis against alternative technologies:

• Pumped hydro storage: Geographic limitations but lower long-term costs

• Compressed air systems: Site-specific requirements with moderate costs

• Flow batteries: Higher upfront costs but extended duration capabilities

• Lithium-ion (stationary): Broad applicability with rapidly declining costs

Electric Vehicle Batteries Maintain Sub-$100 Threshold

Battery-electric vehicle packs reached $99/kWh in 2025, marking the second consecutive year below the critical $100/kWh adoption benchmark. This sustained positioning indicates market maturation and increasing competitive pressure in automotive applications.

The sub-$100/kWh threshold represents a psychological and economic milestone for consumer EV adoption. Battery cost contribution to total vehicle pricing continues declining, improving affordability relative to internal combustion engine alternatives when total cost of ownership calculations include fuel and maintenance differentials.

Regional market penetration correlates strongly with battery cost levels. Markets achieving the lowest battery costs demonstrate accelerated EV adoption rates, while regions with higher battery prices experience slower electrification progress. According to recent analysis, lithium-ion battery price predictions suggest continued downward trajectory.

EV battery pricing impact on market segments:

Vehicle Category Battery Size Cost Impact Market Response Compact EVs 40-50 kWh $3,960-4,950 Mass market entry Mid-range EVs 60-75 kWh $5,940-7,425 Mainstream adoption Luxury EVs 85-100 kWh $8,415-9,900 Performance focus

Consumer price impact accelerates as battery costs represent approximately 30-35% of mid-range vehicle total costs, compared to 40-50% when batteries cost $120-150/kWh. This structural shift enables competitive positioning against comparable internal combustion vehicles across multiple market segments.

How Are Regional Price Dynamics Reshaping Global Competition?

China's $84/kWh Benchmark Sets Global Competitive Floor

Chinese battery pack prices established the global competitive baseline at $84/kWh, reflecting optimal manufacturing costs and scale economies. This pricing represents a 13% real-terms reduction from 2024 and demonstrates the intensity of domestic competition within Chinese markets.

Manufacturing cost advantages stem from vertically integrated supply chains spanning mining, refining, cell production, and pack assembly. Chinese companies benefit from concentrated industrial ecosystems that minimise logistics costs and enable rapid technology transfer across value chain participants.

Scale economics provide decisive cost advantages as Chinese facilities operate at utilisation rates that drive down fixed cost allocation per unit. Export strategy implications focus on maintaining global market share through aggressive pricing rather than maximising per-unit margins.

Technology transfer and localisation pressures create strategic considerations:

• Intellectual property protection versus market access trade-offs

• Local content requirements driving investment decisions in target markets

• Government policy responses to Chinese competitive advantages

• Supply chain security concerns influencing purchasing decisions

North American and European Premium Persists Despite Convergence

North American battery pack prices averaged approximately $121/kWh, representing a 44% premium over Chinese levels despite a 4% year-over-year decline. European markets experienced $131/kWh pricing with a 56% premium over China, though prices fell 8% from 2024.

Tariff impact analysis reveals complex cost structure evolution as trade barriers influence pricing through multiple mechanisms. Import duties directly increase landed costs, while local content requirements force higher-cost domestic sourcing for battery components and materials.

Regional premium breakdown by contributing factors:

Cost Component North America Europe China Baseline Labour costs +15-20% +20-25% Reference Supply chain +10-15% +12-18% Integrated Import duties +8-12% +5-8% Domestic Facility costs +5-8% +8-12% Optimised

Local content requirements drive investment decisions as manufacturers balance compliance costs against market access benefits. In addition, developments in australia lithium industry innovations are helping to diversify global supply chains. These regulations create structural cost increases while fostering domestic supply chain development and technology transfer.

Trade Flow Redirection Intensifies European Competition

Chinese manufacturer export strategies pivoted toward European markets in response to shifting US trade policies and increased tariff barriers. This strategic redirection intensified competitive pressure in European markets, contributing to the 8% price decline compared to North America's 4% reduction.

Aggressive pricing tactics maintain volume targets as Chinese companies prioritise market share retention over margin optimisation. Export volume redirection created oversupply conditions in European markets, forcing domestic and other international suppliers to reduce pricing to maintain competitiveness.

Market share battles in high-value European segments demonstrate how trade policy indirectly influences regional pricing through supply flow modifications. The concentration of Chinese exports in Europe creates pricing pressure that exceeds what would occur through organic market competition alone.

Trade flow impact on market dynamics:

• Increased Chinese export volume to Europe following US policy changes

• Aggressive pricing to maintain global sales targets despite regional barriers

• European market oversupply creating competitive pressure on all suppliers

• Price convergence acceleration between Chinese and European markets

What Economic Thresholds Are Being Crossed in 2025?

Grid-Scale Storage Achieves Economic Viability Across Applications

The $70/kWh stationary storage price point crosses critical economic thresholds that enable unsubsidised deployment across multiple grid applications. Energy arbitrage strategies become profitable in markets with sufficient price spreads between off-peak and peak electricity pricing, typically requiring $40-80/MWh differentials.

Renewable energy integration benefits from cost-effective storage that smooths intermittent generation and provides grid services. Peak shaving applications achieve attractive returns as storage systems reduce demand charges for commercial and industrial customers while providing backup power capabilities.

Grid-scale deployment acceleration metrics:

• 4-hour storage systems: $280/kW total cost enables merchant revenue models

• Energy arbitrage: 10-15 year payback periods in competitive electricity markets

• Peak shaving: 7-12 year returns for commercial demand charge reduction

• Grid services: Additional revenue streams from frequency regulation and reserves

Utility-scale deployment acceleration reflects improved project economics as storage systems achieve competitive positioning against alternative grid infrastructure investments. Return calculations support storage deployment without requiring policy subsidies in most developed electricity markets.

Electric Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership Parity Approaches

Battery cost contribution to vehicle pricing evolution approaches levels that enable TCO parity with internal combustion engine vehicles across multiple segments. Consumer adoption curve inflection points emerge as upfront cost premiums diminish while operating cost advantages become more pronounced.

Fleet electrification economic triggers activate as commercial operators recognise favourable TCO economics. The combination of lower battery costs, reduced maintenance requirements, and fuel cost savings creates compelling business cases for fleet conversion across delivery, transit, and corporate vehicle applications.

EV adoption economic analysis:

Vehicle Segment Battery Cost Impact TCO Comparison Market Response Compact vehicles 25-30% of cost Near parity Rapid adoption Mid-size vehicles 30-35% of cost Slight premium Accelerating sales Commercial fleets 35-40% of cost Favourable TCO Fleet conversions

The sustained $99/kWh pricing for the second consecutive year indicates market stabilisation at levels that support mass market adoption. Further cost reductions will likely require technological innovations rather than simple manufacturing scale improvements.

However, market participants must consider lithium market downturn insights which could impact future supply dynamics and pricing stability.

Battery cost reductions create transformative opportunities across the energy sector. Record-low pricing enables accelerated EV adoption while supporting grid-scale storage deployment for renewable energy integration worldwide. The industry has reached a critical inflection point where storage economics support widespread deployment without policy dependencies.

Despite countries agreeing to transition away from fossil fuels two years ago, the use of coal, oil and gas has remained stubbornly high - driving record carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Global Carbon Project compiled by scientists.

But this year also saw renewable energy expand, driven by solar power which grew by nearly a third in the first half of 2025, according to the think tank Ember Energy.

Here's what you need to know.

Renewables overtake coal for the first time

For the first time, solar power made up a larger share of the electricity mix than coal in the first half of this year, according to the Ember report, marking a key moment in the world's efforts to transition to clean energy.

More than half of the record growth in solar generation took place in China, followed by the United States and the European Union, the report said.

The surge helped to meet the world's growing energy demand in 2025, according to Ember.

But solar's share in electricity generation is still small - growing to 8.8% in the first six months of this year from 6.9% in the same period of 2024.

AI and geopolitics are transforming the energy outlook

While scientists say the world must transition to clean energy to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, 2025 has seen artificial intelligence and geopolitics make it more challenging.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects the energy demands of AI to more than quadruple by 2030.

Meanwhile, the global energy outlook is being shaped by geopolitical uncertainty as countries prioritise meeting surging energy needs over climate concerns, and consulting firm McKinsey predicts fossil fuels will keep a large share of the energy mix beyond 2050.

United States and Europe retreated on clean energy

After President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. government repudiated the clean energy policies of his predecessor Joe Biden, cutting subsidies for renewables projects while easing the way for new oil and gas licences.

Trump has issued executive orders to shore up his country's coal industry, particularly to address fast-rising electricity needs for new data centres to power AI tools.

While China and India saw fossil-fuel generation decrease in the first six months of 2025, the United States and Europe bucked that trend, according to Ember's report.

Elsewhere in the world, fossil fuel exploration continued in spite of scientific warnings, including in South America's vulnerable Amazon rainforest region.

Fossil fuels were kept off the page at COP30

Despite these trends, multilateral efforts for a deal to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels have faltered.

At last month's U.N. COP30 climate summit in Brazil, negotiators from Latin America and the EU demanded an accord with language on a transition, but the final text sidestepped it.

The United States did not send a delegation, and a coalition of other fossil oil producers, led by top exporter Saudi Arabia, said any mention of fossil fuels was off the table.

Clean energy transformation needs skilled workers

The energy sector has been a good source of jobs in recent years globally, employing 76 million people in 2024, up more than 5 million since 2019, according to a new report from the IEA.

Beyond the headline figures, the IEA said the sector is struggling to meet increasing demand for applied technical workers, who are crucial for clean energy development, including the construction of solar and wind farms.

This problem is being compounded as employees retire, including in critical jobs like grid-related professions - where for every one new entrant, 1.4 people are retiring, the IEA said.

North America on track for ICAO’s 2030 cleaner-energy target as other regions lag

IBA, the aviation market intelligence and advisory company, reports that North America is currently the only global region on track to meet the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) cleaner-energy goal for 2030: a 5% reduction in CO₂ emissions from international aviation through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other clean energy sources.

All other regions, including Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, are forecast to fall short of the 5% CO₂ reduction target unless substantial additional SAF capacity is developed.

IBA calculated these figures by combining ICAO’s latest SAF production capacity data with its own independent global fuel demand forecasts to assess whether each region is developing sufficient supply to remain aligned with a credible long-term decarbonisation pathway. The analysis shows that North America’s existing SAF capacity is slightly below the level required for 2030, but when including facilities currently under construction, the region’s capacity meets and slightly exceeds ICAO’s notional requirement. This reflects the impact of sustained policy support in the United States, including the federal SAF Grand Challenge, tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and state-level measures such as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which together have helped unlock financing for a diverse range of SAF technologies.

In contrast, Europe, despite a comparatively strong project pipeline, remains below the capacity needed to achieve ICAO’s 5% benchmark. Although the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation sets progressively rising SAF blend levels from 2025, stringent sustainability criteria and high production costs continue to limit supply growth.

However, IBA notes that the European Commission’s newly announced Sustainable Transport Investment Plan aims to address this shortfall by mobilising around €100 billion across aviation and shipping to accelerate the deployment of renewable and low-carbon fuels.

Regions including Latin America, Africa and the Middle East remain significantly behind the required levels, reflecting limited operational capacity and fewer advanced projects under development. IBA highlights that, for these regions to meet their long-term climate goals, rapid acceleration in investment and enabling policy frameworks will be necessary.

Globally, SAF facilities that are operational or under construction currently represent around 4.5% of global jet fuel supply in 2025, underscoring the substantial scale-up required as the sector works towards ICAO’s 2030 milestone and the broader 2050 net-zero commitments.

Industry: Chemicals

Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2800712/3-diversified-chemical-stocks-to-watch-amid-demand-headwinds

The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry remains buffeted by persistent demand headwinds in certain markets, including consumer durables and building & construction. Lower consumer spending due to inflationary pressures in Europe and a slow recovery in China is weighing on demand.

Industry players such as Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Albemarle Corp. and Avient Corp. are relying on strategic measures, including operating cost reductions and price hikes, to navigate the challenging environment.

About the Industry

The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry consists of manufacturers of basic chemicals, plastics, specialty chemicals and agricultural chemicals. Companies in this space serve a host of end markets, such as automotive, building & construction, transportation, electronics, aerospace and agriculture.

Basic chemicals are produced in large quantities and include petrochemicals and intermediates (such as ethylene, propylene and benzene), polymers (including plastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride) and inorganic chemicals (such as chlorine, caustic soda and titanium dioxide). Specialty chemicals that include catalysts, specialty polymers and coating additives are used in specific fields based on their performance. Agricultural chemicals include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides that are used to protect crops from disease, pests and weeds.

What's Shaping the Future of the Chemicals Diversified Industry?

Subdued Demand in Key End Markets: Companies in the chemical-diversified space remain hamstrung by demand weakness in certain key markets. The sluggishness in the building & construction, and consumer electronics markets is the key concern. In North America, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. housing market are weighing on building & construction.

Elevated borrowing costs and inflation have taken a bite out of the residential construction industry. The consumer electronics market, a key driver of demand for specialty chemicals and advanced materials, is among the hardest hit. Following the post-pandemic boom, global electronics demand has cooled amid high inflation, elevated interest rates and cautious consumer behavior.

Manufacturing activities have also softened amid weaker demand for goods and higher borrowing costs, while recovery remains tepid. Demand for chemicals in the industrial sector has weakened due to constrained industrial production. Softer demand in industrial and consumer durables is hurting chemical volumes.

Slowdown in Europe and China: In China, a slower recovery in economic activities is hurting chemical demand. China is seeing slower economic growth and a sluggish real estate market. A weak property market and a slowdown in infrastructure investments have led to softer demand. The real estate sector has taken a hard hit amid a decline in new home prices, property investment and housing sales.

The slowdown in Europe, resulting from the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and weaker consumer spending due to high levels of inflation and high interest rates, has also led to softer demand in that region. Energy and feedstock inflation has lowered industrial production and consumer spending in Europe. The ongoing weakness in these key regions will likely adversely impact the demand for chemicals over the short term.

Self-help Actions to Aid Results: Companies in this space are taking a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows. In particular, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to lower costs. The industry participants are also raising selling prices to counter cost inflation. Such moves are likely to help the industry sustain margins amid the prevailing challenges.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects

The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216, which places it at the bottom 11% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.

Industry Underperforms Sector & S&P 500

The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector over the past year.

The industry has lost 32.9% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s rise of 16.4% and the broader sector’s increase of 13.5%.

Industry's Current Valuation

On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing chemical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 11.06, below the S&P 500’s 18.73X and the sector’s 14.31X.

Air Products is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and brings leading low-emission hydrogen and ammonia production at scale.","Yara and Air Products have advanced negotiations to partner on low-emission ammonia projects.

Yara has matured a project portfolio for potential investment in cost competitive US ammonia to diversify its energy position and increase competitiveness of its European nitrate production.

Air Products is developing the world’s largest low-carbon energy complex in the state of Louisiana. The complex is designed to produce >750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen, capturing 95 percent of the CO2 generated during normal operation.

Air Products is the project developer and once the ammonia plant has achieved agreed upon performance levels, Yara would acquire the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities for approximately 25 percent of the total project cost (estimated between $8-9 billion). Yara would assume responsibility for related operations and integrate the entire ammonia output into its global distribution network.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tonnes of low-carbon ammonia per year. The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products’ customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products’ 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system.

About five million tonnes per year of high purity CO2 captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

Additionally, the companies are planning to collaborate on the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia which is more than 90 percent complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tonnes per year of renewable ammonia.

Air Products and Yara anticipate entering into a marketing and distribution agreement where Yara would commercialize, on a commission basis, the ammonia not sold by Air Products as renewable hydrogen in Europe.

The model enables ammonia from the world’s first large-scale renewable ammonia plant to be delivered worldwide by Yara’s shipping fleet. The marketing and distribution agreement is targeted to be completed during the first half of 2026.

Yara is the world’s largest trader and shipper of ammonia, currently transporting over four million metric tonnes annually, which is supported by Yara’s 12 ammonia vessels and 18 import terminals. In addition, Yara has a significant internal ammonia demand.

Air Products is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and brings leading low-emission hydrogen and ammonia production at scale.

The collaboration would enable the companies to meet the increasing demand for low-emission ammonia in the coming years, particularly in Europe both for Yara's internal consumption and other customers.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/source-166149.png,N,,2025-12-09 12:04:31.960739
,Indiana and Evs,2025-12-09 11:09:45+00:00,CNN,Ford teams up with Renault to make EVs that can rival Chinese brands | CNN Business,Not Available,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/business/ford-renault-european-evs-intl,"Renault and Ford will jointly develop small, cheaper Ford-branded electric vehicles for the European market to fend off rising competition from Chinese rivals, the companies said Tuesday.
They will be smaller than any Ford plans for the US market and fill a gap in the automaker’s line-up, Farley said.
The two automakers will also jointly develop Renault and Ford brand vans for Europe.
Although there are few Chinese brand vans on sale in Europe, Farley said the two companies “compete with them directly every day” in emerging markets.
Ford already produces two EV models in Europe on a Volkswagen platform and makes vans with the German automaker.","Renault and Ford will jointly develop small, cheaper Ford-branded electric vehicles for the European market to fend off rising competition from Chinese rivals, the companies said Tuesday.

“We know we’re in a fight for our lives in our industry,” Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley told reporters in Paris Monday ahead of the announcement, when describing Ford’s response to the threat posed by cheaper Chinese competition. “There is no better example than here in Europe.”

Europe’s traditional automakers face an influx of Chinese rivals from BYD to Changan and Xpeng (XPEV).

As part of the Ford-Renault partnership, the first of two planned small EVs – to be produced at a Renault plant in northern France – will reach European car showrooms in 2028. They will be smaller than any Ford plans for the US market and fill a gap in the automaker’s line-up, Farley said.

The two automakers will also jointly develop Renault and Ford brand vans for Europe.

A ‘powerhouse’ for light commerical vehicles

“Together we can create a powerhouse of LCV in Europe that would be very difficult for the Chinese to compete with,” Farley said.

Although there are few Chinese brand vans on sale in Europe, Farley said the two companies “compete with them directly every day” in emerging markets.

Renault CEO Francois Provost also said: “The Chinese will come soon and that’s why I don’t want to wait.”

The partnership was formed after a Renault team visited Ford’s Detroit headquarters in March. Both Farley and Provost said the two automakers do not plan to merge.

Ford’s share of the European passenger car market has almost halved in Europe from 6.1% in 2019 to 3.3% in the first 10 months of this year as it has pulled back from passenger vehicle sales. As part of a series of restructurings, the company has cut jobs and this year closed its Saarlouis plant in Germany.

Given the withdrawal of EV support from US President Donald Trump’s administration, the No. 2 US automaker faces the dual expense of investing in combustion-engine models and expensive new EV technology.

Using Renault’s EV platforms with Ford designs should help the US automaker compete in Europe’s electric car market against traditional automakers such as Volkswagen, as well as the Chinese.

Ford already produces two EV models in Europe on a Volkswagen platform and makes vans with the German automaker. Farley said the Renault partnership will complement its existing one with Volkswagen.

Europe’s smallest mainstream automaker

Renault is Europe’s smallest mainstream automaker and does not sell vehicles in China or the United States – the world’s two biggest car markets – so the Ford partnership boosts its manufacturing scale to lower costs.

The French carmaker is actively seeking partnerships to make fuller use of its factories and reduce the burden of developing new EVs.

In 2026, Renault will produce two vehicles using platforms from China’s Geely in Brazil and is in talks with more automakers, including China’s Chery, to jointly produce and sell cars.

“Our ambition… is to show that in Europe we can produce EV cars in Europe as competitively as anyone, including the Chinese,” Renault’s Provost said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147727783.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-09 07:59:29.460785

One key element is the 45Q carbon capture tax credits, which avoided the clean energy funding cull from the US government.
With an expected 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year expected to be captured, Air Products could bank over $460m annually from 45Q.

Under the deal with Yara, Air Products will offload the Louisiana project’s ammonia production, storage, and shipping elements – representing around 25% of that $8–$9bn.","Air Products is signing off 2025 on a positive note after announcing an imminent deal with ammonia and fertiliser giant Yara for its troubled Louisiana blue hydrogen project.

One key element is the 45Q carbon capture tax credits, which avoided the clean energy funding cull from the US government.

CEO Eduardo Menezes said the credit, which offers up to $85/tonne of carbon dioxide capture, stored or used in industry, would “skew” the plant for its first 12 years of operations, to deliver returns higher than a traditional grey hydrogen project.

“The EBITDA for the first 12 years should be higher than a normal EBITDA would be in an industrial gas project,” he explained. With an expected 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year expected to be captured, Air Products could bank over $460m annually from 45Q.

The company is still negotiating the carbon capture segment of the project. Air Products expects to announce a third-party carbon capture deal under a long-term agreement “later”. Currently, the sequestration scope is not included in the new capital expenditure forecasts of $8–$9bn – up from the original $4.5bn.

Under the deal with Yara, Air Products will offload the Louisiana project’s ammonia production, storage, and shipping elements – representing around 25% of that $8–$9bn.

Air Products plans to sell around 80% of its blue hydrogen to Yara under a 25-year offtake agreement, enabling the production of 2.8 million tonnes of ammonia per year. The remaining 20% would be fed into the industrial gas firm’s existing US Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system, where it moves over 1.5 bcfd of hydrogen, representing around 12% of total volume.

The Louisiana project, initially expected to be operational in 2026, is now due online in 2030 if final investment decision (FID) can be taken by mid-2026. News of the Yara partnership follows spending on the project pausing in May and last month’s earnings call in which the CEO confirmed “advanced negotiations” were underway.

He stressed that the transaction will only close once the project starts.

“We will have progress payments like we would have with any project, with the difference being that the final payment will be larger than what would be in a normal transaction of a sale of a project. This is something we are still finalising,” Menezes said.

Yara, the largest ammonia trader globally, has keen interest in developing renewable ammonia, both blue and green.

“It’s a good deal for Yara but also a very good deal for Air Products as we won’t need to have a sales force and marketing structure and so forth … personally, I have been working with Yara for 20 years,” added Menezes. “Having a partner like Yara, with its infrastructure [of] ships and terminals, really eliminates this volume risk that we have today.”

Menezes sounded off on a note of caution, underlining that negotiations remain at a critical stage.

“If we cannot get to a capital expenditure number that we can both live with, we will not have an FID,” he said. “We are making this announcement as we believe that we have a path to get there, but until we have these agreements with construction companies done, and we have a final picture, we will still need to make a decision on the FID.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/07/shutterstock_1873346731.jpg",N,,2025-12-09 10:01:11.022439

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms.
Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.
“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.
Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax.","The world needs a new approach to environmental crises threatening the health of people and the planet by adopting policies to jointly tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation and pollution, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday.

Those issues are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme's quadrennial Global Environment Outlook said.

“You can’t think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,” said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. ""You can’t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.""

They’re “all undermining our economy,"" worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.

Almost 300 scientists from 83 countries contributed to this year's report — called the most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken — which was released during the U.N. Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven't made nearly enough progress, they said.

Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.

“What we’re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,” Watson said. “It has to be done rapidly now because we’re running out of time.”

The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.

Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil — reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.

Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.

Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.

What's more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn't involved in the report.

“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.

Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded; more than 1 million plant and animal species face extinction; and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.

Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.

The report says that to achieve a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and restore biodiversity, about $8 trillion in global investment is needed every year. But starting in 2050, economic benefits will surpass spending, growing to $20 trillion a year by 2070 and $100 trillion a year thereafter.

Nations also must look beyond gross domestic product as a barometer for economic health, because it doesn't measure whether growth is sustainable or recognize its potential harms, Watson said.

Environmental issues aren't the only things interlinked, Watson said. He also said governments, nonprofits, industry and the financial sector also must ensure that there are incentives and funding for renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices, for example.

University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn't involved in the report, welcomed its emphasis on tackling issues across governments and society.

“We must do what is right, rather than what seems politically expedient,” Mann said. “The stakes are simply too great.""

Despite the report's urgent call for action, international cooperation is anything but guaranteed, scientists say — especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to participate in many of the discussions.

Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax. He's promoted fossil fuel use, canceled permits for renewable energy and is abandoning automobile fuel-efficiency standards.

“International action and agreements are becoming harder and harder,” Watson said, noting that this year's U.N. climate conference in Brazil failed to “move in the direction we needed it to move” with stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.

Talks this summer on a treaty to address plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement, though a U.N. conference earlier in the year garnered commitments for funding to protect global biodiversity.

Watson said that the U.S. didn't attend the intergovernmental meeting in Nairobi, but joined discussions on the last day and ""said they didn’t agree with anything in the report.”

“Some countries might say if the U.S. is not willing to act, why should we act?” Watson said.

Still, he believes that some countries will move forward, while others, including the U.S., could fall behind.

Hayhoe, the Texas Tech scientist, said that she's confident changes will happen, because the stakes are becoming too great.

“It is not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we’re gone,” Hayhoe said. “The question is, will there be a healthy, thriving human society on that planet? And the answer to that question is very much up for grabs at this point.”

“Across the country, regional governments are demonstrating that bold climate action doesn’t have to wait for Washington,” says One Earth, a global network of climate researchers. “They are implementing policies that expand renewable energy, protect natural ecosystems, and promote regenerative agriculture.”

America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned states and cities, planned to send “more than 100 U.S. subnational leaders – including governors, senior state officials, nearly 40 mayors and dozens of city officials – to the climate talks known as Cop30 (November 10-21, 2025) and the UN Local Leaders Forum planned for the days before,” said Gina McCarthy, co-chair of the group and former EPA leader, according to The Guardian.

Another group, the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), representing more than 180 U.S. House of Representatives members, “aims to deploy them in their ‘soft power’ role to promote climate action,” Earth.Org explains. “Although the 17 members of Congress who prepared to go to COP30 were forced to remain home to vote on the US government shutdown, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island did attend – the only U.S. federal representative in Belém,” Brazil.

“Whether the federal administration is in or out or lukewarm, the U.S. states have always been coming to the COP. And this year is no exception in 2025,” said Amy Holm, executive director of the Climate Registry, according to Earth.Org. “The U.S. states are here to tell their story of climate action, that they’re still implementing in their jurisdictions, whether it be clean energy, transportation, affordability, land use, all those things are going on in jurisdictions all across the United States.”

Some examples of states and cities leading the way include:

California

Chicago

Detroit

Massachusetts

New Mexico

New York

Vermont

Wyoming

California

California continues to lead climate change efforts. “[In] 2024, the state consistently generated more than 100% of its electricity demand from renewable sources,” One Earth notes.

The Golden State was also one of the first U.S. states to commit to the global 30×30 movement, which ensures data-driven, transparent conservation efforts. As One Earth explains, “California has allocated billions of dollars through conservation bonds and budget appropriations to support habitat restoration, wildlife corridors and Indigenous-led conservation projects.”

Chicago

The city has converted all 400+ of its municipal buildings to use renewable energy.

Chicago has also “established long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that guarantee stable electricity rates while supporting renewable energy infrastructure,” continues One Earth. “Moreover, workforce development programs funded through this transition provide training for local residents, ensuring equitable access to green jobs as part of the city’s energy transformation.”

Detroit

Detroit has achieved notice for its approximately 1,400 urban community gardens and farms. “These initiatives have been supported by progressive zoning policies that allow urban farming on vacant land, city-backed land banks that provide affordable access to property and local ordinances promoting community-led agriculture.”

Massachusetts

Massachusetts’ efforts have focused on reducing food waste.

“Since its initial implementation in 2014 and expansion in 2022, the state has increased its annual diversion of food waste from 100,000 tons to 380,000 tons, reducing emissions from food waste by 25%. By 2030, the goal is to divert 780,000 tons per year,” One Earth says. “The state’s success is attributed to clear regulatory requirements, accessible composting infrastructure, and strong enforcement mechanisms, including fines for non-compliance. The integration of food waste reduction into climate policy highlights how waste management reforms can be a key strategy for emissions reduction.”

New Mexico

New Mexico has “committed to an energy transition where we are a net zero carbon emitter by 2045, with a 50% reduction by 2035,” says Andrea Desiree Romero, a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives. “We’re doing a lot on the energy investment side, and we have a huge startup community in the advanced energy space. We have $1 billion in venture capital for new company investments in spaces that help us solve these problems.”

New York

New York has implemented a new law that decrees schools must be built far removed from high-pollution roadways and expanded “the state’s 10-year-old fracking ban to outlaw the process of injecting liquified carbon dioxide to pull gas from the ground,” according to a January 30, 2025, article in The Guardian. “Days after Trump’s election, [New York Governor Kathy] Hochul also abruptly resurrected a plan to enact a toll for driving in congested zones, and … pledged to allocate [$1 billion] to greening the economy.”

Vermont

Vermont passed legislation in 2024 that requires Green Mountain Power, the state’s largest utility, to provide 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2035 and places a 2035 deadline upon smaller utilities to achieve the same sourcing.

“This builds upon Vermont’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which mandates legally binding emission reductions to help the state achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,” One Earth explains. “To meet these targets, Vermont has prioritized investments in local renewable energy projects, including small-scale community solar and wind initiatives that keep energy dollars circulating within the state. Additionally, policies such as Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and tax incentives for residential solar installations have facilitated Vermont’s clean energy transition while ensuring affordability for consumers.”

Anaphite has developed technology that has the potential to make electric vehicle battery manufacturing cheaper and less energy intenstive.

The company was founded in 2018 by chemist Sam Burrow and physicist Alexander Hewitt after the duo met at the University of Bristol.

By 2021 the pair had applied their technology to lithium-ion battery cell electrodes and proven the application of their composites in dry coating feasibility trials with the University of Warwick.

The business has raised millions of pounds since it was established.

The latest cash injection is a combination of £700,000 in grant funding from Innovate UK Investor Partnerships: Clean Energy and Climate Technologies competition, alongside £700,000 of investment from climate-focused venture capital funds Elbow Beach and World Fund.

It is understood Anaphite will use the funding to expand its technology platform and further its commercial capabilities.

Anaphite’s chief executive Joe Stevenson said: “We're thrilled to have secured this grant support from Innovate UK and the matching investment from Elbow Beach, World Fund and other Anaphite investors.

""This enables us to attack one of the toughest technical challenges in dry coating – successfully manufacturing LFP electrodes. Once achieved at scale, it will be enormously valuable to the industry.""

Anaphite's existing DCP technology platform uses proprietary chemical compositing techniques to disperse difficult-to-mix materials such as binders and conductive carbons, attaching them to active material particles.

The company says the approach ""overcomes the limitations"" of other mixing techniques.

Craig Douglas, partner at World Fund, said: “Anaphite’s technology is broadly applicable across next-generation and established battery technologies alike.

""This investment will enable the company to significantly expand its commercial capabilities, accelerating the scale-up of its manufacturing processes and driving down manufacturing costs for the global battery industry.”

Jonathan Pollock, chief executive of Elbow Beach, added: “The future of driving is electric, so scaling up affordable, low-carbon battery manufacturing is essential.

""Anaphite’s technology has the potential to significantly cut both costs and carbon footprint for battery makers and EV manufacturers, and we’re excited to support them as they lead the way in this critical sector.”",https://i2-prod.business-live.co.uk/incoming/article30019175.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRIHB_270924-anaphite.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 06:00:14.702484

Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax.","The most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken calls for a new approach to jointly tackle the most pressing environmental issues including climate change and biodiversity loss that threaten over 1 million plant and animal species with extinction.

The U.N. Environment Assembly — which the U.S. government didn’t attend — produced the new report this week by almost 300 scientists from 83 countries.

The issues, which also include land degradation and pollution, are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme’s Global Environment Outlook said.

“You can’t think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,” said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. “You can’t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.”

They’re “all undermining our economy,” worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven’t made nearly enough progress, they said.

Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.

“What we’re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,” Watson said. “It has to be done rapidly now because we’re running out of time.”

Global tipping point

The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.

Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil — reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.

Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.

Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.

What’s more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn’t involved in the report.

“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.

Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded, and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.

Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.

The report says that to achieve a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and restore biodiversity, about $8 trillion in global investment is needed every year. But starting in 2050, economic benefits will surpass spending, growing to $20 trillion a year by 2070 and $100 trillion a year thereafter.

Nations also must look beyond gross domestic product as a barometer for economic health, because it doesn’t measure whether growth is sustainable or recognize its potential harms, Watson said.

Environmental issues aren’t the only things interlinked, Watson said. He also said governments, nonprofits, industry and the financial sector also must ensure that there are incentives and funding for renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices, for example.

University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn’t involved in the report, welcomed its emphasis on tackling issues across governments and society.

“We must do what is right, rather than what seems politically expedient,” Mann said. “The stakes are simply too great.”

International cooperation falters

Despite the report’s urgent call for action, international cooperation is anything but guaranteed, scientists say — especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to participate in many of the discussions.

Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax. He’s promoted fossil fuel use, canceled permits for renewable energy and is abandoning automobile fuel-efficiency standards.

“International action and agreements are becoming harder and harder,” Watson said, noting that this year’s U.N. climate conference in Brazil failed to “move in the direction we needed it to move” with stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.

Talks this summer on a treaty to address plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement, though a U.N. conference earlier in the year garnered commitments for funding to protect global biodiversity.

Watson said that the U.S. didn’t attend the intergovernmental meeting in Nairobi, but joined discussions on the last day and “said they didn’t agree with anything in the report.”

“Some countries might say if the U.S. is not willing to act, why should we act?” Watson said.

Still, he believes that some countries will move forward, while others, including the U.S., could fall behind.

Hayhoe, the Texas Tech scientist, said that she’s confident changes will happen, because the stakes are becoming too great.

“It is not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we’re gone,” Hayhoe said. “The question is, will there be a healthy, thriving human society on that planet? And the answer to that question is very much up for grabs at this point.”

In the waning days of Governor Phil Murphy’s tenure, New Jersey officials unveiled an updated Energy Master Plan that calls for 100% clean electricity by 2035 and steep reductions in climate pollution by midcentury. Since 2019, the state has used the first version of the plan as the backbone of its climate strategy, promising reliable, affordable, and clean power.

The blueprint lands at a moment when delivering on all three goals is increasingly in doubt.

While the second Trump administration rolls back federal clean-energy support, PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator that serves New Jersey and a dozen other states, struggles to manage surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers.

“The Energy Master Plan is a statutorily required report to chart out New Jersey’s energy future,” said Eric Miller, who leads the Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy. While not binding, it is the state’s official roadmap to attain its climate goals.

Miller’s office and the state Board of Public Utilities developed the plan with public input and help from outside consultants.

Under the plan, New Jersey is betting heavily on utility-scale solar and battery storage. State modeling envisions total solar capacity climbing to about 22 gigawatts by 2050, which is four times today’s roughly 5 gigawatts of installed solar. On paper, it would be enough to supply nearly all the state’s current households over a year. To get there, the plan assumes adding about 750 megawatts of new solar each year from 2026, roughly double the pace of solar construction in 2024.

The plan’s release follows a governor’s race in which energy costs dominated, and voters chose U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat who campaigned on preserving Murphy-era climate targets, over Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican who argued for a slower transition.

“Voters sent a clear message that clean energy is the most cost-effective path forward and the smartest long-term investment,” said Ed Potosnak, head of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters and a local council member in Franklin Township.

A grid tested by data centers

The plan lands as New Jersey enters what Miller calls the ​“load-growth era.”

For roughly two decades, electricity demand in PJM’s footprint, which stretches from New Jersey to Illinois, was flat or falling as aging power plants retired and efficiency improved. That trend has flipped because of data centers.

“What we saw in 2024 into ​’25, and I think what we’re going to see for the next 15 years, is a scenario where demand on the electric grid is growing,” Miller said.

For years, New Jersey spent billions subsidizing hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles and thousands of buildings to electrify. Now, Miller said, ​“some of the techniques for greenhouse gas reductions are going to have to kind of meet the moment,” by taking a more proactive role in engaging with PJM or by filling in the dearth in clean energy incentives caused by the Trump administration.

The recent PJM capacity auctions have added billions of dollars in costs for customers across the region. This showed up as a 20% jump in summer electricity bills in New Jersey this year, which became a hot campaign issue during its recent gubernatorial race.

“The wholesale price of electricity is determined by PJM and federal policy, and then also the price of natural gas,” said Frank Felder, an energy economist who has advised regulators. ​“New Jersey can’t do much about that.”

Participating in a fast-track rulemaking process that PJM initiated to address data center–driven demand, outgoing governor Murphy joined other governors in proposing that data center developers bring their own power generators in exchange for quicker permit processing.

PJM seeks to decide which proposals to pursue this month and file them with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by the end of the year.

Federal headwinds and stalled offshore wind

Layered on top of PJM’s turmoil are decisions coming from Washington.

Experts repeatedly pointed to President Donald Trump’s second-term moves to strip away clean-energy tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and to impose new tariffs on imported solar panels and wind equipment. They say those steps have raised costs and driven off developers.

Potosnak called it ​“Trump’s clean energy ban” and said the administration’s opposition to offshore wind ​“derailed the best chance we had to get massive amounts of offshore wind going that would have begun lowering our utility rates this year.” Several major Atlantic projects, including those planned off New Jersey’s coast, have been canceled or delayed.

Offshore wind ​“was a big piece of trying to get to 100% clean electricity by 2035,” Felder said. With new contracts unlikely for several years, he warned that New Jersey could be ​“back at basically square one” by the end of the decade.

Even so, Felder and others urged caution against writing off renewables entirely. Robert Mieth, a Rutgers University researcher who studies power systems, noted that offshore wind is well established in Europe and that, with or without U.S. manufacturing, ​“there will be access to competitive and affordable renewable technology from other countries.”

In the meantime, state officials point to progress in areas they can influence more directly.

Miller noted that New Jersey has gone from roughly 20,000 plug-in vehicles in 2018 to about 270,000 today, after lawmakers set clear targets and funded incentives and chargers.

The state’s ​“nation-leading solar program,” he said, is ​“primarily state-incentivized, primarily state-funded,” and it can keep expanding — albeit more slowly now — even as federal tax credits expire.

“The cheapest energy is the energy you don’t have to make,” Potosnak said, citing efficiency programs, rooftop and warehouse solar, and batteries on parking lots that ​“drive down utility costs for families and businesses” while cutting pollution.

A guide, not a mandate

For all its detail, the Energy Master Plan is not binding.

“The Energy Master Plan does not have the force of law,” Miller said. It has been ​“very informative,” he added, but ​“it is not a legal requirement that we follow it exactly.”

Gov.-elect Sherrill will determine how closely New Jersey hews to the map. Neither she nor her opponent had any role in shaping the modeling, Miller said, and the plan was not written with a particular ​“political future” in mind. Instead, Miller said, the Murphy administration hopes the incoming governor will treat it as ​“a very useful modeling exercise” or a guide.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/NJ-Sherrill-and-Murphy-GettyImages-2250639634.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=7a79690ec63c8cccc205e19d22b29703,N,,2025-12-09 06:59:14.882833

America’s energy future The environmental groups’ moratorium demand represents a pivotal moment that could determine whether AI accelerates climate progress or becomes a massive environmental burden.","Environmental activists just delivered Congress the most aggressive ultimatum yet against America’s AI revolution.

More than 350 pro-environment organizations from all 50 states coordinated a massive campaign demanding lawmakers immediately halt new AI data center construction or face the wrath of voters everywhere. Coordinated by major groups including Physicians for Social Responsibility, Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth, this represents the most organized environmental assault on Big Tech’s expansion plans in decades.

The coalition’s letter warns that data center expansion represents “one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation.”

With electricity bills already spiking 21% since 2021—largely driven by data center growth, Food & Water Watch reported—environmental groups demand “a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities.”

Their math is intriguing: if current construction plans proceed, these facilities could consume as much electricity as 30 million households and water equivalent to 18.5 million homes by 2030.

The numbers

Recent analysis reveals AI’s environmental impact has reached crisis levels that lawmakers can no longer ignore. By 2030, AI data centers could annually produce 24 to 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide—equivalent to adding five to 10 million cars to American roadways, Cornell researchers discovered last month. Water consumption would drain up to 1,125 million cubic meters annually, matching the household usage of six to 10 million Americans.

Power requirements for North American data centers nearly doubled from 2,688 megawatts to 5,341 megawatts between late 2022 and 2023, MIT confirmed in January. By 2030, electricity consumption at data centers is projected to surge 133% to 426 terawatt-hours, Pew Research documented two months ago. Some residents near data centers have seen their electricity bills jump 267% compared to five years earlier.

Local communities fight back

The environmental backlash is already reshaping American politics in unexpected ways. A remarkable $64 billion worth of data center projects faced delays or cancellations between May 2024 and March this year due to fierce local opposition. In Virginia, a Democrat successfully flipped a traditionally Republican legislative seat by campaigning specifically against the burden of data centers on local communities.

The opposition crosses unexpected political boundaries. In Michigan, OpenAI’s ambitious $7 billion Stargate project is encountering significant resistance from local communities concerned about farmland conversion.

Minnesota recently passed comprehensive legislation introducing strict oversight over data center energy and water consumption, while grid operators warn that most planned data center construction will occur in regions already at “elevated risk” for reliability issues, energy analysts confirmed three weeks ago.

America’s energy future

The environmental groups’ moratorium demand represents a pivotal moment that could determine whether AI accelerates climate progress or becomes a massive environmental burden. Current projections show most additional electricity for AI data centers will come from natural gas, requiring a 10% to 20% increase in overall U.S. gas production by 2030, energy researchers warned three weeks ago. The pressure on local grids could trigger winter blackouts similar to Texas’s 2021 disaster that killed an estimated 246 people.

The stakes extend far beyond environmental concerns. Virginia’s primary utility company warned that average ratepayers could see power bills increase 50% over 15 years, primarily due to new data centers, Atlantic Council analysis uncovered five months ago.

As Congress faces this unprecedented environmental ultimatum, the decisions made in coming weeks could reshape both America’s energy infrastructure and the global AI race for decades to come.",https://assets.eweek.com/uploads/2025/12/photo-1732027912131-3a10677b8449.jpeg.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 06:01:09.356077

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.
They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.
The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,"" James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.""

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump's order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States' largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation's electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,'' she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

Calgary (Canada) / Geretsried (Germany) - In Geretsried, a commercial closed-loop geothermal system is feeding electricity into the German grid for the first time. With this, Eavor Technologies has reached a milestone and is positioning geothermal direct heat and power generation as a potentially scalable, baseload-capable option in the energy market.

The plant demonstrates the functionality of a closed drilling circuit that harnesses heat from deep rock layers. Investors and European institutions see it as a blueprint for scaling geothermal use. Initial operating data confirm high stability, technical maturity, and progress in drilling technology and system design.

Milestone for International Geothermal Development

With the commissioning of the Eavor-Loop, the Canadian company has been feeding electricity into the German grid since early December. “We are proud to announce the successful delivery of the world’s first electrons generated from closed-loop multilateral wells. With Geretsried now on-stream, we’re more confident than ever that our closed-loop geothermal system, designed for adaptability and suited to the world’s diverse regions, will secure its place as the leading solution for commercial geothermal applications,” said Mark Fitzgerald, President and CEO of Eavor. “We are especially grateful to our project partners for their confidence and early investment, which were instrumental in pushing the first-of-a-kind learning phase and advancing the project maturation,” added Fabricio Cesário, Head of Project Delivery and Operations, Eavor GmbH.

The project operates without natural geothermal water reservoirs and requires neither rock permeability nor reinjection. This significantly reduces subsurface technical complexity while keeping operations largely low-maintenance. Geretsried forms the foundation for a planned rollout across Europe and other markets.

Technology: How the Closed Loop Extracts Heat

The Eavor-Loop functions like a large underground radiator with completely sealed pipes. Two deep vertical wells are connected through horizontal laterals, forming a closed circuit. A working fluid circulates within the system, entirely isolated from the geological environment.

Circulation occurs largely without a pump through the thermosiphon effect: cooler fluid sinks, heats up in deep rock layers, and rises on its own. After about 30 minutes, the startup pump was able to be turned off. The system has also proven to be black-start capable, quickly adjustable, and able to operate in circulation mode without load for months.

The drilling phase was technically challenging: two vertical wells with six horizontally branched sidetracks each (12 total) were connected “toe to toe” underground using the Active Magnetic Ranging Tool (AMR). This created six pairs forming the underground heat exchanger. At 16 kilometers per pair, the wells are among the longest in the world. Accompanying data show a 50% reduction in drilling time per lateral and a tripling of drill-bit run times.

European Institutions Back New Geothermal Options

The commissioning has been met with strong interest from European institutions. EIB Vice-President Nicola Beer described the project as “a European success story in action: The first commercial Eavor-Loop plant shows that geothermal energy can be scaled up to deliver affordable, clean, and reliable heat and power to households and businesses - day and night, in every season. It cuts emissions and strengthens energy security.” The bank is supporting the facility with an InvestEU-backed loan of nearly €45 million. The Canada Growth Fund and Japanese utility CHUBU also view the project as an industrially significant technological leap.

Project partner OMV highlights its suitability for urban-proximate and baseload-capable use. The collected data will inform further development projects that Eavor is planning in Europe and worldwide.

Together, these renewable energy PPAs deliver more than 808 GWh of clean electricity, supporting high-impact suppliers responsible for manufacturing lab consumables, equipment, and materials.
Multi-buyer PPAs help bridge this gap by pooling demand from several pharmaceutical companies and enabling suppliers to access affordable renewable electricity.","As biotech and pharmaceutical companies look for credible ways to reduce their environmental footprint, many are turning their attention beyond internal operations to the suppliers that power laboratory and clinical work. My Green Lab’s newly released 2025 Carbon Impact of Biotech and Pharma Report details a significant step forward: a series of multi-buyer renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs)—long-term contracts that allow organizations to purchase electricity directly from new solar and wind projects.

These agreements represent one of the clearest examples of coordinated climate action across the life sciences. For lab managers, they signal an important shift—one that could influence the carbon intensity of lab consumables, reshape the lab supply chain, and strengthen long-term sustainability expectations for vendors.

New PPAs deliver substantial renewable capacity

Two major renewable energy PPAs are detailed in the report. The first agreement provides 563.7 GWh of renewable electricity each year and is estimated to avoid 393,795 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. The second PPA supplies an additional 245 GWh of renewable electricity per year and extends clean energy access across North America, Europe, and Asia.

In the life sciences, PPAs serve as a mechanism for companies to lock in long-term renewable power at predictable rates—an approach that helps decarbonize upstream manufacturing for common lab products. Together, these renewable energy PPAs deliver more than 808 GWh of clean electricity, supporting high-impact suppliers responsible for manufacturing lab consumables, equipment, and materials.

Supplier engagement strengthens emissions reductions

Renewable-energy procurement can be challenging for smaller manufacturers that lack the scale to negotiate competitive long-term clean-energy contracts. Multi-buyer PPAs help bridge this gap by pooling demand from several pharmaceutical companies and enabling suppliers to access affordable renewable electricity.

According to the report, more than 750 suppliers have participated in renewable-energy or emissions-reduction initiatives across Energize, Activate, and Sustainable Markets Initiative programs. These collaborations support supplier emissions reductions by offering:

Lower barriers to entering renewable-energy markets

Improved emissions performance

More consistent carbon data

Stronger operational resilience

Implications for labs and procurement teams

As suppliers adopt renewable-energy commitments, lab managers may begin to see:

Lower-carbon product portfolios

More detailed sustainability documentation from vendors

Greater availability of Product Carbon Footprints

Updated supplier scorecards emphasizing emissions metrics

These changes can support more accurate Scope 3 reporting at the lab and institutional levels and improve visibility across the lab supply chain.

Why renewable energy PPAs matter for lab managers

The expansion of renewable energy PPAs across pharma supply chains offers tangible benefits for laboratory operations:

Reduced embedded emissions in equipment and consumables

Clearer sustainability data for purchasing decisions

Better alignment with organizational decarbonization goals

Reduced supply risk as clean-energy incentives evolve

As the sector accelerates its decarbonization efforts, renewable energy PPAs demonstrate a scalable model for supplier emissions reductions—one that additional scientific sectors may soon follow.

Why it matters: With federal EV tax credits now expired, Tesla is leaning hard on fuel savings to justify the switch.

The Details

The tool lets users input daily miles driven and select any Tesla model.

Results display estimated monthly charging costs alongside projected gas savings.

Users can toggle between daily and monthly views for flexibility.

The calculator links directly to Tesla’s Wall Connector home charging solution.

An “Order Now” button sits prominently below the results.

Monthly Charge Cost: $62.09

Monthly Gas Savings: $149.88

Model S (100 miles/day):

Daily Charge Cost: $4.48

Daily Gas Savings: $12.48

Model 3 (300 miles/day):

Daily Charge Cost: $12.27

Daily Gas Savings: $29.52

EVXL’s Take

This calculator is Tesla’s latest move in a cost-transparency playbook it started years ago. Back in 2022, the company added a Charge Stats feature to its mobile app, showing existing owners their charging costs versus gas savings. That tool targeted current Tesla drivers. The new Charging Calculator flips the script, bringing the same pitch to shoppers before they buy.

The timing is no accident. With the $7,500 federal tax credit gone since September 30, Tesla needs fresh ammunition to close sales.

Electric grids worldwide are being transformed by lithium-ion batteries. These large batteries store excess power from solar and wind sources. They then release energy during peak demand, reducing reliance on traditional power plants. This technology has seen rapid growth due to falling costs and increasing renewable energy adoption.

ANTOFAGASTA, CHILE: Lithium-ion batteries, which power everything from cellphones to cars, are increasingly saving electric grids around the world.

Batteries as large as shipping containers are being connected to power lines and installed beside solar panels and wind turbines. They soak up power when it's plentiful and cheap and release it when electricity use soars, helping reduce the need for expensive power plants and lines.

American researchers invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and later showed that the devices could help the electric grid. But for a long time, batteries made little headway because grid managers and utility executives dismissed them as expensive and risky.

One of the first breakthroughs came about 15 years ago when engineers at a U.S. energy company installed one of the first lithium-ion batteries tied to a grid in a desert nearly 9,000 feet above sea level in Chile. Challenging conventional notions of how the electricity system should be run, that team helped prove that batteries could help make electric grids more stable and reliable.

The concept of storing energy was not new. Thomas Edison developed alkaline nickel-iron batteries largely for industry and early electric vehicles. Various companies tried other technologies like sodium sulfur, which have not gained much traction. And some utilities have long pumped water uphill so that later it could be sent back down to generate electricity.

Live Events

But those systems were relatively limited. The kinds of lithium batteries installed in the Atacama Desert in 2009, by comparison, are now being used around the world.

The rapid growth of wind and solar power and the rising demand for electricity from data centers are making batteries a necessity. They store surplus renewable energy for when it's not windy or sunny and maintain a balance between energy supply and demand.

Consider California. In recent years, state officials have often asked residents to use less electricity on hot summer days to prevent power outages. But there have been no such alerts since 2022, largely because batteries have allowed California to use its abundant solar power well into the evening. Over the last seven years, the state added 30 times as much battery storage capacity as it had in 2018.

The rest of the world has also seen impressive growth, according to the International Energy Agency, a multilateral organization in Paris. The boom was made possible by a stunning 90% drop in the cost of batteries over the last 15 years as new factories have come online. China is by far the world's largest battery manufacturer, but Europe, India and the United States have recently been increasing production, too.

""Batteries are changing the game before our eyes,"" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said recently.

A bumpy start

The use of batteries on the grid did not come easy.

A Virginia company called AES began testing grid batteries in Indiana, Pennsylvania and California as early as 2008, but U.S. energy suppliers did not use them commercially until two years later. The pace was plodding for a while.

""There wasn't the experience with battery storage,"" said Carla Peterman, a former member of the California Energy Commission and now an executive vice president at Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility. ""It was a bit of a chicken or the egg, where there wasn't enough on there to really say that this could be a big part of the energy system.""

But some Americans clearly saw the benefits of batteries. One of them was Christopher Shelton, an executive at AES, which owns utilities and power plants across the world.

He began to look into lithium-ion batteries when his bosses asked employees to pitch proposals for a ""billion-dollar idea."" Shelton said he thought batteries could reduce the need for power plants that utilities used only when electricity demand climbed to peak levels.

""Why would you build an asset that you weren't going to use more than 5% of the time?"" Shelton said. ""We were saying batteries should be an alternative to peaker plants.""

He first installed battery cells at a nondescript electricity substation outside Indianapolis, a city known for its 500-mile car race. His company later connected one in Norristown, Pennsylvania, at an operations center of the nation's largest grid manager, PJM Interconnection. The Los Angeles area was connected next, followed by a larger battery for the Indianapolis grid.

While his tests were successful, they did not sufficiently impress many American utility executives. The reaction was typical of an industry that prides itself for sticking with what it knows best: large coal, gas and nuclear power plants. Anything else has generally been treated as a threat that may cause blackouts.

""Utilities have long been skeptical of new technologies,"" said Leah Stokes, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies energy politics and policy. ""They know how to make a widget, which is a giant fossil fuel power plant, so they keep doing that.""

Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade organization, disagrees with that assessment. ""The U.S. energy grid is the world's most important machine, and America's electric companies are quick to pilot and deploy new technologies once they become commercially viable and affordable for customers,"" he said.

But even now, U.S. utilities in many states are reluctant to add batteries. A lot fewer large batteries are being added in the Southeast, for example, than in California and Texas.

Utility executives are not the only ones who are skeptical. So are policymakers and many ordinary Americans.

Some local governments have banned big batteries because of safety concerns. In May and June, a large battery complex in Monterey County, California, was destroyed in a fire that spewed smoke and harmful chemicals.

Despite that disaster, energy experts say many risks have been addressed. The California fire happened in a type of battery that most companies no longer use. And those batteries were installed in a power plant building where the fire easily spread from device to device. Most batteries are installed outdoors to reduce the chances that fires spread.

Testing it on the moon

Not much beside the odd desert fox lives on the desolate plateau in Chile where AES set up its battery project. The site is several hours from the two closest airports, in Calama and Antofagasta.

After landing, visitors have to drive at least four hours to the salt flats of the Atacama Desert, where workers collect lithium -- a key battery ingredient.

The AES camp is another hour away. It sits on a rocky, unpaved path, lined with busted tires. Although temperatures during a late spring and early summer day can reach the 80s, the nights can be near freezing.

""It was like taking the battery and testing it on the moon,"" said Joaquín Meléndez, an engineer who led the AES project there under Shelton.

In the early 2000s, Chile had an energy crisis because Argentina, its main supplier of natural gas, couldn't provide enough of it. That left Chile, which has no domestic fuel sources, with too little energy for its people and its copper, iodine and lithium mines.

Chile was forced to rely on power plants that burned expensive imported coal. But those plants could not be easily turned up or down, and the needs of Chile's mining companies fluctuated a lot.

That was where the batteries came in. While it can take a coal plant about 12 minutes to get going, batteries can discharge power almost instantly. By pairing the two, engineers realized that batteries could deliver the electricity that mines needed while coal plants fired up.

Meléndez worked 16-hour days for six months to connect the first commercialized lithium battery to an electric grid. That device still stands, though most of its tasks have been taken over by newer, more efficient and affordable units.

The project was immediately successful, helping keep the electricity system stable when mining operations caused surges that had previously led to grid failures and outages.

AES executives back in the United States kept close track of what was happening in Chile. And in 2010, the company installed commercial battery systems in New York and Texas. Two years later, AES began adding more batteries in Chile, including next to big solar farms.

Over the last decade, batteries have helped Chile use less coal. Last December, the country got more than 40% of its electricity from solar panels and wind turbines, up from 19% five years earlier, according to Ember Energy Research, a nonprofit. Australia, Britain, China, India and other countries have also been adding lots of renewable energy and batteries.

Shelton said that even he had been surprised by the recent rapid growth of batteries. ""We underpredicted how far the prices would fall.""

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,” James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,” she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,” Kennedy said.

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,” she said, adding that the Trump administration “should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.”

But as Josh Siegel writes, Republican leaders will be grappling with a new hurdle on top of those that thumped permitting talks of the past: President Donald Trump’s assault on renewables.

House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), one of the party’s key permitting negotiators, has advanced a bill that would overhaul the decades-old National Environmental Policy Act without favoring either renewables or fossil fuels.

The SPEED Act is bipartisan, with seven Democrats joining seven Republicans as co-sponsors. But some Democrats want the bill to go further to unravel Trump’s recent attacks on green energy projects, while hard-line Republicans insist on an anti-renewables bent.

The measure is a test of House Speaker Mike Johnson’s ability to navigate the administration’s priorities and manage his slim majority on major legislation with the midterm elections looming.

To win over Democrats, Westerman included an amendment to hamper presidents from canceling energy project permits. That’s a nod to Trump’s efforts to shackle wind and solar projects — and to Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a move Westerman opposed in 2021.

But that could be a problem for the House Freedom Caucus.

Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) has said he wants the bill to be “amended to protect our communities from the harmful expansion of offshore wind.” And Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who once urged Trump to immediately end clean energy tax credits, has raised concerns about the SPEED Act, saying he doesn’t want to “fast-track any of the wind and solar.”

Some Democrats are also unpersuaded by Westerman’s proposal. They want language that would not just prevent the president from hobbling wind and solar projects in the future but also reverse Trump’s recent decisions attacking renewables.

Westerman told Josh he had consulted the White House about his compromise. But so far, the president has been mum on the SPEED Act publicly.

Former Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican from Louisiana who was involved in previous permitting negotiations, said Westerman had done as well as he could to keep the bill bipartisan.

“You can take a bill and you can write it in a way that only represents the views of the Freedom Caucus,” Graves said. “But we all know exactly what happens when it gets over to the Senate. They will end up shoving something down the House’s throat.”

More permitting fights loom, including a demand from Republicans for soften Clean Water Act rules to ease pipeline approvals.

Democrats will also be looking to boost electricity transmission, because a shift away from fossil fuels would need massive upgrades to the grid.

“I don’t understand how you can call something permitting reform and not deal with the main problem,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told Josh. “If we want electrons of all kinds to be flowing and we want prices to go down, we have to deal with the main bottle[neck], which is that we have a transmission and distribution system that is from the Dark Ages.”

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Benjamin Storrow breaks down the increasing volatility of power markets in the U.S.

Power Centers

More power to the president?

A majority of Supreme Court justices appear ready to limit the independence of agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, writes Niina H. Farah.

At oral arguments today in Trump v. Slaughter, the justices weighed whether the president has the authority to fire heads of independent agencies. The case centers on Trump’s decision earlier this year to remove Rebecca Slaughter from her position on the Federal Trade Commission.

The 1935 ruling Humphrey’s Executor v. United States only allows “for cause” removals for heads of such agencies. But the Trump administration is arguing that the president should have authority to remove agency heads who are exercising executive power.

Those arguments seemed to find purchase with the court’s conservative majority. But the court’s liberal wing warned against the risks of increasing presidential power.

Coal continues in ‘reliability pickle’

An older unit at a coal-fired power plant in Colorado is staying open past its planned retirement this year while a newer unit gets repairs, Benjamin Storrow writes.

The move has implications for Colorado’s goal of cutting 50 percent of climate pollution at 2005 levels by 2030. The Comanche Generating Station is one of the state’s biggest climate contributors. State regulators planned to gradually phase out the plant’s three turbines, and the first one closed in 2022.

When regulators approved the request to extend the unit’s life last week, they had harsh words for Xcel Energy, the unit’s largest owner, for failing to outline costs associated with fixing the broken unit.

“We are in the dark about what any of this costs. We are just in a real reliability pickle because once again Unit Three has broken in a catastrophic way,” said Commissioner Megan Gilman.

The mystery of data center water use

States facing drought are starting to worry about data center water use, writes Miranda Willson.

Lawmakers from at least eight states have introduced legislation this year to require data centers to report their water use. The push for transparency has scrambled traditional partisan alliances.

Democratic Govs. Phil Murphy of New Jersey and Gavin Newsom of California vetoed bills requiring data center water use reporting, while Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have authorized local governments to evaluate data center noise, water and land-use impacts.

Data centers gobble up massive amounts of electricity, but their water use is generally less clear and depends on the design of the facility. Federal laws like the Clean Water Act do not regulate water quantity, resulting in a patchwork of state policies for large water users.

The annual tutor-led event brings together professionals from across the country to share strategies that improve tutoring as well as academic coaching and student engagement.

STC’s CLE team helped lead that national conversation with sessions on topics like “Developing a Mistake-Friendly Session,” “From Crisis to Clarity: Planning for Emotional Regulation in Student Sessions,” “Fueling Student Motivation for Long Term Success,” and much more.

Presenters at the conference included Alejandro Benavidez, Josue Arandy, Cristian Hernandez, Emily Jimenez, Vanessa Garza, Brenda Mungia and Karla Ruiz.

CLE Director Lynell Williams, who also sits on the board of 4C as the organization’s technology liaison, said what viewers see on screen is the result of months of careful preparation behind the scenes.

“The CLE has a robust internal process to vet the presentation proposals before they are sent to the national reviewers,” Williams said. “The tutors, Supplemental Instruction (SI) leaders and academic coaches all invest a great deal of time and energy in researching and organizing their topics before submitting a proposal. This dedication shows in the high quality of presentations.”

Williams said two presenters have been nominated by conference organizers for selection as the 2025 “Exemplary Session.” In addition to the presentations, the conference also showcased student creativity. The official Growth, Planning, Success conference logo was designed by Gualberto Voidanova, a student learning assistant at STC.

For SI Leader Vanessa Garza, the conference became both a professional milestone and a personal homecoming. Garza first worked at STC as a student tutor more than a decade ago, before earning an associate degree in Biology from the college, a bachelor’s degree in Biology from the former University of Texas- Pan American and then a master’s degree in Kinesiology from the University of Texas in Austin.

Now returning to the CLE, Garza presented on educational technology tools that tutors, SI leaders and academic coaches can use to encourage collaborative learning in their sessions.

“It felt incredible to reach people at a national level and hopefully make learning more fun and engaging for our students,” Garza said. “Coming back to the Valley, I really felt a drive to give back to my community. Serving students academically is what I would consider my calling.”

Garza’s experience was echoed by Alejandro Benavidez, another Supplemental Instruction leader who recently earned his associate degree in Computer Science from STC and is now pursuing a bachelor’s degree at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Benavidez’s presentation focused on the realities and challenges of being the only tutor available for certain subjects.

“When I first started here, I faced a lot of unique challenges,” Benavidez said. “Presenting at a national level let me connect with other tutors, share my experience and hear how they overcome similar situations. Exchanging strategies and resources reinforced that I know what I am doing and that I can help my community in the way I want to.”

Also presenting at this year’s presenter lineup were STC Academic Coaches Karla Ruiz and Brenda Mungia supervised by CLE Learning Support Manager Maria Bridwell and CLE Assistant Director Rosario Vazquez.

Ruiz co-presented “From Crisis to Clarity,” a session focused on common emotional challenges students face, including stress, academic pressure, depression and sleep deprivation.

The team shared tools tutors can use to support students experiencing these struggles.

“We never see the same situation twice,” Ruiz said. “Students come with different challenges, and being able to share strategies – especially with tutors who often only meet students briefly – helps everyone better support them.”

Vazquez said the 4C conference has become a signature growth opportunity for CLE staff since STC began participating in the conference in 2021.

The investment advances the company into its commercialization phase as it works to deliver safe, high-performance silicon solid-state batteries built for mobility systems and stationary energy storage.

As part of the funding announcement, Amazon Senior Vice President and Distinguished Engineer James Hamilton will join the company’s board of directors. Blue Current said the additional capital will accelerate efforts to scale its silicon composite battery platform, which the company designed from first principles to improve energy density, shorten charging times, enhance safety, and operate at low pressure without relying on flammable liquid electrolytes.

The company’s platform uses earth-abundant silicon and elastic polymer anodes paired with fully dry electrolytes. Its design approach supports multiple formulations and allows the batteries to be manufactured cost-effectively using widely deployed lithium-ion equipment. Blue Current emphasized that this combination of safety, performance, and manufacturability positions it to support both next-generation electric mobility and grid-scale energy storage.

The company noted that more than a decade of research and development has gone into creating batteries intended to reduce fire risk, increase cycle life, and improve charging speed. With new funding and Amazon’s participation, Blue Current is preparing for the next stage of commercial deployment and aims to address market limitations that have slowed the adoption of solid-state solutions.

Amazon’s participation signals continued interest in advancing domestic battery manufacturing and exploring technologies that can support longer-range electric vehicles and grid storage with improved safety. Blue Current’s headquarters and pilot line facility are located in Hayward, California.

The delegation argues that Indiana’s manufacturing power, military infrastructure, and academic research capabilities make it an ideal location for the expansion of the federal UAS Test Site Program.

Indiana Delegation Unites Behind FAA Test Site Bid

The support letter, signed by every member of Indiana’s congressional delegation including Congresswoman Erin Houchin, emphasizes that Indiana is positioned to help the FAA integrate drones into the national airspace system while advancing American-built drone technology.

Lawmakers highlighted Indiana’s central location, diverse testing environments, and strong state and federal backing as key advantages. They said the state could deliver the “best outcomes for American leadership in drone manufacturing and deployment.”

Their push builds on the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which authorized two additional UAS test sites beyond the seven that already exist across Alaska, North Dakota, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Texas, and Virginia.

Why Indiana Thinks It Can Lead America’s Drone Future

Indiana’s pitch is built on a mix of industrial capability, academic expertise, and military infrastructure.

The state already hosts the Technology Readiness and Experimentation initiative at Camp Atterbury, a major hub where the military tests advanced UAS and counter-UAS technology. In 2025, the site demonstrated a system capable of neutralizing a swarm of forty-nine drones with a single electromagnetic pulse, a milestone in U.S. counter-drone defense.

Muscatatuck Urban Training Center offers additional restricted airspace for complex testing scenarios, while NSWC Crane continues to expand its role in counter-UAS development.

Purdue University brings deep academic strength to the proposal with the nation’s first university-owned airport, the world’s largest indoor motion-capture facility, and research programs dedicated to drone safety and airspace integration.

The Applied Research Institute, one of the state’s major consortium managers, supports projects that link industry, defense, and academia. Its involvement is expected to help coordinate large-scale drone R&D and manufacturing across Indiana.

At the state level, Governor Mike Braun’s recent executive order created the Indiana Initiative for Drone Dominance Task Force.

The task force is developing a statewide strategy to strengthen drone manufacturing, improve public-safety drone operations, establish new aerial test corridors, and expand counter-UAS capabilities. Senator Young collaborated closely on the initiative and says it positions Indiana to match federal priorities.

What an FAA Test Site Would Mean for Hoosiers and the U.S.

If Indiana is selected, the state would become a central hub for drone research, testing, and manufacturing at a time when the U.S. is seeking to reduce its dependence on foreign-made drones.

Lawmakers argue that Indiana could help restore American drone dominance by supporting everything from defense applications to agriculture, infrastructure inspection, and public-safety operations.

The FAA would gain a new partner capable of testing detect-and-avoid systems, command-and-control links, beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations, airworthiness standards, and urban air-mobility technologies. Indiana universities and manufacturers would gain access to federal research grants, experimental airworthiness approvals, and expanded testing infrastructure.

The state also plans to create an aerial test corridor connecting Camp Atterbury, Muscatatuck, and NSWC Crane. New training pipelines would prepare Hoosiers for drone engineering, manufacturing, maintenance, and public-safety operations, supporting a share of the North American drone market, which could reach fifty-nine billion dollars by 2030.

Supporters say the effort aligns with President Trump’s executive orders on restoring American drone leadership and strengthening domestic airspace security. They argue that Indiana’s manufacturing workforce, military assets, and universities position the state to scale drone production and deliver new technology across the country.

DroneXL’s Take

Indiana is setting itself up as a serious contender for one of the two new FAA test sites. The combination of manufacturing strength, military testing ranges, and academic capability gives the state a compelling case.

If approved, the site could accelerate America’s move away from foreign-built drones and position the Midwest as a new center for U.S. drone innovation.

Offshore wind has been a crucial part of the Northeastern states’ plans to transition to renewables, due to their geography and the plentiful wind in the winter.

Judge Patti B. Saris of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts wrote that Trump’s executive order banning leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms is “arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.”

Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, DC, filed a lawsuit in May against the memorandum halting federal approvals of wind energy development, which was supported by industry and public interest groups.

The Attorneys general claimed that the halt “harms the States’ efforts to secure reliable, diversified, and affordable sources of energy to meet the ever-increasing demand for electricity; their billions of dollars in investments in supply chains, workforce development, and wind-industry-related infrastructure, including transmission upgrades; and their statutory- and policy-based efforts to protect public health and welfare from harmful air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, as well as greenhouse-gas emissions.”

Because of Trump’s ban, at least seven offshore wind farms in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic have been paused, as well as several others at earlier stages of development. Offshore wind has been a crucial part of the Northeastern states’ plans to transition to renewables, due to their geography and the plentiful wind in the winter. The region also heavily relies on natural gas, which is subject to price fluctuations.

Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel, US Clean Energy at Environmental Defense Fund, said, “We should not be kneecapping America’s largest source of renewable power, especially when we need more cheap, homegrown electricity. Striking down this unlawful ban gives relief to the communities and workers who need affordable power, local investment and jobs from wind projects that have been stuck in limbo.”

As a result of the Trump administration’s “arbitrary” policies, BloombergNEF reduced its forecast of new offshore wind power coming online by 2035 by 56%. And while the ruling is good news for the wind industry, it doesn’t mean the federal government is required to approve projects. And let’s face it: Foreign renewable companies aren’t exactly going to come running back to the US to do business. (Just today, for example, Denmark’s Eurowind Energy announced it’s shutting its US office, citing “political uncertainty.”) But at least offshore wind is no longer banned.

Oceantic Network CEO Liz Burdock said, “We thank the Attorneys General and the Alliance for Clean Energy New York for taking this case forward to protect American business interests against the politicization of our energy sector.”

National research effort to build Australia’s sovereign clean energy future

The University of Wollongong (UOW) will lead a new Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Renewable Fuels, a landmark national collaboration that will position Australia as a global leader in the clean energy transition.

The Centre will bring together world-class researchers from seven Australian universities with 16 industry and international partners to develop next-generation renewable fuel technologies and build Australia’s clean energy production capability.

Led by ARC Industry Laureate Distinguished Professor Gerry Swiegers (pictured above), the Centre will accelerate the shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy powered by renewables including green hydrogen, green ammonia and green methanol.

“Our vision is to make Australia a world leader in renewable fuels, driving our transition from a major exporter of fossil fuels to the world’s leading exporter of renewable energy. This Centre will deliver the technologies needed to achieve that while training a new generation of researchers and engineers,” Professor Swiegers said.

The $72 million initiative will unite expertise in chemical and materials engineering, electrochemistry and energy systems to design and scale technologies for producing and processing renewable fuels. Economists, social scientists and community and policy experts will develop a roadmap for integrating the technology into industry and the Australian economy.

Its three research themes – Make It, Process It and Integrate It – will tackle the challenge from every angle, from large-scale production and processing to economic competitiveness, safety and community engagement to policy and regulation.

“Our research will underpin new industries and jobs, strengthen national energy independence and decarbonise sectors that cannot easily be electrified, such as steelmaking, shipping and aviation. It will enable Australia to export renewable fuels and green products, ensuring prosperity while reducing emissions,” Professor Swiegers said.

Judge Patti B. Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts wrote that the president’s sweeping executive order, which halted all leasing of public lands and waters for new wind projects, was “arbitrary and capricious,” violating federal law.

Judge Saris, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said the Interior Department had not provided a “reasoned explanation” of its decision to stop approving wind projects, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. Instead, she said, the “agency defendants candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the president’s direction to do so.”

Mr. Trump, a longtime critic of wind power, issued the executive order on his first day back in office in January. At the time, states like Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York had been planning to build more than a dozen large wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean to meet their renewable energy goals.

The order effectively put a stop to many of those efforts. At the moment, one offshore wind farm has been completed and five more are under construction in U.S. coastal waters. But developers have been unable to receive permits for additional wind farms, and some planned projects have been canceled altogether.

The directive also stymied wind farms on federal land. In particular, it prohibited the development of the Lava Ridge Wind Project, a large wind farm in Idaho that the Biden administration had approved.

Led by New York, a coalition of 17 states and the District of Columbia challenged the executive order in court in May. They were joined by the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Albany, N.Y.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, said in a statement that the decision was “a major victory for our state and the entire region” that would protect “thousands of good-paying jobs” supporting the offshore wind sector.

Asked about the ruling, Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email that the Biden administration had given offshore wind projects “unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.” She said that Mr. Trump’s executive order, had it remained in effect, would have spurred federal agencies to study whether offshore wind projects were raising energy costs for American families.

Matthew Nies, a spokesman for the Justice Department, declined to comment on whether the agency would appeal the ruling.

But even if the decision withstands a challenge, it could have a limited impact, according to a research note by analysts at ClearView Energy Partners, a consulting firm. That’s because the courts typically cannot compel federal agencies to approve new projects. Many wind developers could also be reluctant to submit additional projects for federal permits under Mr. Trump, the analysts wrote.

In addition to the freeze on new permits for wind farms, the Trump administration has sought to revoke permits that were issued by the Biden administration for wind farms off Maryland and Massachusetts. It has also attempted to halt construction of two wind farms that were already partly built, including Empire Wind off Long Island and Revolution Wind off Rhode Island.

Those efforts have also faced pushback from the courts: In September, a federal judge issued a preliminary ruling that construction could restart at Revolution Wind, saying that the administration’s stop-work order threatened “irreparable harm” to its developer. (The Trump administration has also allowed work at Empire Wind to restart after negotiations with Ms. Hochul.)

Mr. Trump has disparaged wind power ever since he failed 14 years ago to stop an offshore wind farm visible from one of his golf courses in Scotland. He has called wind turbines ugly, expensive and inefficient. He railed against renewable energy during his presidential campaign last year, when he also promised oil and gas executives that he would make policy changes that would help their industry, such as rolling back environmental rules.

In September, the White House took the extraordinary step of instructing a half-dozen agencies to draft plans to thwart the country’s offshore wind industry as it intensified its attack on wind energy.

U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston sided with a group of 17 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia in finding that agencies had failed to sufficiently explain why they had indefinitely paused all federal approvals of wind-energy projects.

Saris, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, said an indefinite halt on issuing or denying all authorizations related to wind projects violates a statutory requirement that agencies proceed to conclude matters presented to them ""within a reasonable time.""

The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, had been implementing a directive Trump made on his first day back in office to halt offshore wind lease sales and stop issuing permits, leases and loans for both onshore and offshore wind projects.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose state led the legal challenge, called the ruling ""a big victory in our fight to keep tackling the climate crisis"" in a social media post.

Interior Department and White House officials were not immediately available for comment.

An offshore wind energy trade group welcomed the ruling.

""Overturning the unlawful blanket halt to offshore wind permitting activities is needed to achieve our nation's energy and economic priorities of bringing more power online quickly, improving grid reliability, and driving billions of new American steel manufacturing and shipbuilding investments,"" Oceantic Network CEO Liz Burdock said in a statement.

Trump has sought to boost government support for fossil fuels and maximize output in the United States, the world's top oil and gas producer, after campaigning for the presidency on the refrain of ""drill, baby, drill.""

The states, led by New York, sued in May, after the Interior Department ordered Norway's Equinor to halt construction on its Empire Wind offshore wind project off the coast of New York. While the administration allowed work on Empire Wind to resume, the states say the broader pause on permitting and leasing continues to have harmful economic effects.

The states said the agencies implementing Trump's order never explained why they abruptly changed a longstanding policy supporting wind energy development. The agencies also departed from the government's findings that wind projects can proceed with minimal adverse environmental impacts, the states said.

Saris agreed, saying the policy ""constitutes a change of course from decades of agencies' issuing (or denying) permits related to wind energy projects."" She said the agencies never provided a reasoned explanation for adopting the change.

Zoox, the robotaxi startup owned by Amazon, has expanded a bit recently, and it is ready to scale up enough that it has secured an EV battery supplier for more EV production.

Starting in early 2026, Zoox will be receiving batteries from Panasonic Energy. It will be using 2170 cylindrical batteries from the Japanese battery producer that was once Tesla’s exclusive battery supplier (and still supplies some of Tesla’s batteries).

The cells will initially come from Japan, but the plan is to eventually produce them in Kansas. Note that while the Trump administration has killed all of the EV subsidies for consumers, it has not (yet) touched the battery production tax credits Democrats and President Joe Biden passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Those include tax credits for producing battery cells as well as battery packs (and also battery mineral mining and processing if a company engages in those activities in the USA).

Note that Zoox recently started operating robotaxis in San Francisco, joining Waymo as the second robotaxi operator in The Golden City (unless you also count Cruise, which used to operate robotaxis there but no longer does).

The executive order had brought the nearly completed Revolution Wind project—one of the largest offshore wind initiatives in the country—to a standstill, threatening jobs, billions in investment and regional energy targets.

Trump has assailed wind farms and renewable energy sources in recent comments, while promoting reopening mines and other energy sources in the U.S.

The court vacated the wind order on the basis that it was unlawful.

Why It Matters

The federal ruling marks a pivotal moment for the U.S. renewable energy landscape. With electricity demand climbing and state governments racing to meet climate goals, the court’s decision not only preserves critical momentum for renewable energy but also signals potential limits on executive power to disrupt industry progress based on uncertain or unsubstantiated grounds.

What To Know

U.S. District Judge Patti B. Saris on Monday ruled that the executive order issued by Trump in August was unconstitutional, opening the door for Revolution Wind and other offshore energy projects to move forward.

The decision came after U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth issued a preliminary injunction in September against the Trump administration's stop-work order for the nearly $6 billion Revolution Wind project—a joint effort by Danish energy company Orsted and partners BlackRock and Skyborn Renewables.

The project had been halted since August by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which cited national security concerns without specifying details, PBS reported.

Lamberth found that the administration's action caused ""irreparable harm"" to the plaintiffs, with each day of delay costing $2.3 million and threatening the whole project's viability due to inflexible construction deadlines and limited vessel availability.

He described the government's justification for the halt as ""the height of arbitrary and capricious"" and noted that the shutdown could endanger over 1,000 union jobs, Engineering News-Record reported in September.

The Revolution Wind project, set to power up to 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut, is intended to deliver approximately 2.5 percent of regional energy needs, splitting electricity between the two states. At the time of the halt, about 70 percent of turbines had been installed, and developers had invested or committed about $5 billion.

Trump has long voiced opposition to wind power, describing wind turbines as unsightly, noisy and environmentally harmful in public statements and on the campaign trail.

He has repeatedly criticized offshore wind developments, claiming they drove up energy costs, killed wildlife and caused other environmental issues—a stance at odds with the Biden administration’s earlier emphasis on renewables.

Trump used his position to pause construction on multiple wind projects and attempted to revoke or freeze federal funding and permits for the sector, positioning fossil fuels as the preferred energy source for the U.S.

What People Are Saying

Saris, in the court decision Monday: ""Given that the Wind Order constitutes a change of course from decades of agencies’ issuing (or denying) permits related to wind energy projects, the Agency Defendants were required, at minimum, to “provide a reasoned explanation for the change” and to “display awareness that [they were] changing position.”

Trump, on Truth Social in August: ""Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS.""

Trump, at a July meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland: ""Wind is the most expensive form of energy. And it destroys the beauty of your fields and your plains and your waterways. And look, look out there—there's no windmills. But if you look in another direction, you see windmills. If, when we go to Aberdeen, you'll see some of the ugliest windmills you've ever seen. They're the height of a 50-story building. And you can take a thousand times more energy out of a hole in the ground ... It's called oil and gas.""

What Happens Next

Revolution Wind partners aim to resume construction immediately to meet their timeline and avoid additional costs. The U.S. Interior Department and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management may still appeal Saris' ruling, which would move the dispute to the federal appellate court.

Despite possible new legal challenges, the court decision represents a major, if temporary, victory for wind developers, labor unions and states pursuing renewable energy jobs and targets.

Back in the 60s, electricity demand grew 7%, 8%, 10% a year, almost through the whole decade.
What solutions do they have to not only maintain their climate goals, but also to meet this demand for power?
“We have had periods when electricity generation grew pretty fast.
So by the time we get out to the point where we have really binding constraints on our ability to meet new energy demand, we’re going to have new options available.","Five years ago, Virginia passed a law that requires 100% renewable energy on the grid by 2050.

But Virginia is also home to more data centers than anywhere else in the country, and those new buildings require a whole lot of power.

“All through the 2000s, electricity demand in the state hardly grew at all,” said William Shobe, professor of public policy at the University of Virginia. “And then it really took off.”

5 questions with William Shobe

Are you able to quantify just how much the electricity demand has increased in the five years since the Virginia Clean Economy Act passed?

“We’re tracking it pretty closely. For the last couple of years, data center demand by itself has been growing 25% to 30% a year, and data center electricity use in the state is now bigger than all of our industrial demand, and it’s closing in on residential demand. In the next year or so, data center electricity use in Virginia will pass all use of electricity in homes around the state. So it’s growing pretty fast. It’s not unprecedented. We had growth like this back in the [1960s]. Back in the 60s, electricity demand grew 7%, 8%, 10% a year, almost through the whole decade. But it hasn’t been like that for a long time.”

Some people are calling Virginia the data center capital of the world. Is it really that much? What’s driving all this interest in this new infrastructure in Virginia?

“It really is that much. Part of it has to do with the history of how the internet started. It was a very good place for data centers to connect up to the internet. And I don’t think anybody really expects that to slow down anytime soon.”

With the cost of power going up, this is an issue that’s evolving politically. The incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger campaigned on energy affordability. Now, Democrats control the state government. What solutions do they have to not only maintain their climate goals, but also to meet this demand for power?

“We have had periods when electricity generation grew pretty fast. So that’s not unprecedented by itself, trying to do it without causing a lot of damage to the environment and a lot of health effects because of the generation. The emissions from the generation is the new challenge because we’d like to have the added generation to support the data centers, but without all the health effects and environmental effects of those data centers.

“The modeling we’ve done indicates we can get there. It’s possible to do, but we just have to give the right incentives for generating clean energy and expanding the supply without the emissions that used to go along with the expanded supply.”

Do you think there’s any way to meet that demand without more natural gas?

“It depends on whether you’re talking about the short run or the long run, because sales of electricity have been going up so fast. It may be that we need to expand the use of natural gas in the short run, but Virginia generates almost 10% of its electricity from solar energy now, and that percentage is growing.

“From year to year, we’re adding quite a lot of generation. Next year, we have a big new wind farm that’s going to be coming online, and we have a pretty strong offshore wind resource that we can tap. Plus, there are plans to add new types of nuclear generation to the mix. The answer to your question is that, in the longer run, it does seem to be possible. We just have to have the right incentives in place.”

When you look at this broadly across the country, what do you think it means for efforts to slow down climate change now that the cost of energy is becoming such a major political issue?

“In Virginia, non-emitting energy resources like solar, for example, that’s our cheapest new source of energy. So if we were just picking new sources of energy along that cost continuum, we want to build plenty more of that solar.

“Now we need a mix of different types of generation. We need the intermittent renewables; we need some base load power. But the development of new technologies, especially new nuclear, and people are talking about developing directional drilling technology that gives us the ability to tap geothermal power. In the short run, we have good technologies we can use in the longer run. There are new sources coming along that can substitute for what we’ve been using.

“We have the development of a fusion energy power plant in central Virginia, a proposed one. So by the time we get out to the point where we have really binding constraints on our ability to meet new energy demand, we’re going to have new options available. So I think it’s really partly a matter of making sure that we’re open to those new technologies as they become available, and we’re ready to incorporate them in our energy mix.”

Why it matters: The January memo is among the most direct of the Trump administration's directives or policies hindering renewable power — but it's not the only one.

Trump officials have been especially aggressive in targeting offshore wind projects, including ones already approved or even under construction.

Driving the news: Judge Patti Saris, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, ruled Monday that Trump's Jan. 20 order is ""arbitrary and capricious"" under administrative law.

The ruling came in a case brought by New York and other states, and the nonprofit Alliance For Clean Energy New York.

Saris, a Clinton-era appointee, found that federal agencies did not provide a ""reasoned explanation"" for their actions under the order.

While projects planned for federal lands and waters are most directly affected, onshore projects on private lands also rely on various forms of federal approvals.

Yes, but: The effects of the judge's ruling are unclear as federal officials rely on several overlapping orders and agency policies to justify restrictions on renewables.

ClearView Energy Partners said in a note last month that if Saris ruled against the administration, it ""could reject any pending permits and/or pursue a de facto pause of project reviews and lease sales since the courts cannot 'force' agencies to issue permits.""

What they're saying: ""Striking down this unlawful ban gives relief to the communities and workers who need affordable power, local investment and jobs from wind projects that have been stuck in limbo,"" Environmental Defense Fund attorney Ted Kelly, whose group participated in the case.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

“This critical victory also preserves well-paying green jobs and access to reliable, affordable energy that will help Massachusetts meet our clean energy and climate goals,″ she added.

The coalition that opposed Trump's order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States' largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association. The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C.

The Interior Department and the White House didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, but the White House previously accused the Democratic attorneys general of using lawfare to stop the president’s energy agenda.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation's electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,'' she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,'' Kennedy said.

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,'' she said, adding that the Trump administration ""should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.''",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/4ffd6e7d-e13f-4ba8-8df5-e858218c9d63/20251209T001504/4ffd6e7d-e13f-4ba8-8df5-e858218c9d63.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 20:00:18.511902

Rob Moore is the principal from Scioto Analysis – a group that studied the impact of the way the state is handing out energy permits.

“You have economic growth where we’re trying to make sure that we have enough energy to be able to support the needs that are happening in Ohio,” Moore said. “We recommended that the chamber and business leaders be talking to the legislature and making sure that there are restrictions on how long the process can be.”

The study found the faster the process – the better, because the longer they take, the more likely those projects will fall through.

The study is making several recommendations, including expediting public hearings and standardizing the timeline for their entire process.

Steve Stivers, the CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce – the group that requested the study – said some neighboring states have already been affected.

“Our goal is to make sure that Ohio can quickly and efficiently approve safe projects that will make sure that we can get energy online faster so that we can live the American dream and have an economic miracle here in Ohio,” Stivers said. “Indiana and the MISO region actually had some rolling blackouts about a year ago as a result of too much demand for electricity and not enough supply.”

Congressman Bob Latta (R – Ohio 5th district) said getting energy from one point to the other is a global issue.

This is why Latta said Congress is considering more than a dozen bills related to energy.

“Because our competitors, as I said, the communist Chinese, they’re moving forward and they’re putting the power on,” Latta said. “And again, if you don’t have the power and the grid security and the modernization of the grid out there, you’re falling way behind.”

This study comes as AEP is requesting to increase its rate. A request that company officials said is needed because of the high demand for energy.

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is holding hearings regarding that request this week.

The challenge was brought by Attorneys General from 17 states and Washington, D.C., and supported by industry and public interest groups, including Environmental Defense Fund.

In their challenge, the Attorneys General claimed that the halt on federal permitting approvals “[creates] an existential threat to the wind industry,” and could erase nearly $100 billion in investments and cost 40,000 jobs if left in place throughout the President’s term.

“For nearly a year, the Trump administration has recklessly obstructed the build-out of clean, affordable power for millions of Americans, just as the country’s need for electricity is surging,” said Ted Kelly, Director and Lead Counsel, U.S. Clean Energy at Environmental Defense Fund.

“Electricity prices are climbing, and our grid is facing rising demand from data centers, industry and homes. Wind, solar and battery storage – when allowed to move forward – offer the most affordable ways to get more reliable power onto the grid.

“We should not be kneecapping America’s largest source of renewable power, especially when we need more cheap, homegrown electricity.

EPA “confesses error,” urges court to vacate Soot Rule. In a motion filed on November 24 in Commonwealth of Kentucky et al. v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency et al., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ended its defense of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5, commonly called the Soot Rule, and urged the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit to vacate it. In essence, the agency is siding with the plaintiffs in the case, a coalition of business associations and the Attorneys General from 25 Republican-led states who argue that the rule would raise costs for manufacturers, utilities, and consumers and could hamper the construction of new factories. The rule was finalized in February 2024 and put in place tougher limits on emissions of fine particulates. The agency’s November 24, 2025 motion stated that the rule was finalized “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and that the “EPA now confesses error and urges this Court to vacate the Rule.” Eliminating the rule would revert the fine-particulate standard to levels set in 2012.

One-year tariff exclusions extended to additional products. On November 26, certain industrial and medical products manufactured in China received a one-year extension of tariff exclusions as part of the November 1 US-China trade agreement between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. The renewed exclusions affect 14 categories of solar manufacturing equipment, as well as 164 diverse categories, such as automotive air compressors, printed circuit boards, pump components, and electric motors. Tariffs on those products had been extended several times this year and would have expired on November 29.

FDA withdraws proposed rule requiring cosmetics makers to test talc for asbestos. On November 26, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew a proposed rule that would have required manufacturers of talc-containing cosmetic products to test their products – or the talc components of those products – for asbestos, and to maintain records showing their compliance with the rule. An FDA spokesperson told The New York Times that the agency intends to submit a new, more comprehensive proposed rule, but did not provide further details. Talc is widely used in many industrials processes – for instance, to reduce friction and improve ink adhesion in paper manufacturing – but, with the FDA’s move, attention is turning to its use in products intended for human ingestion, such as pharmaceuticals, candies, dried beans and fruits, and dietary supplements. Starting in 2027, the European Union will ban all uses of talc in cosmetics under the Cosmetics Regulation. The United Kingdom is exploring the possibility of a similar ban.

CBP forced labor enforcement continues. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has issued its fifth Withhold Release Order (WRO) for 2025, directing the detention of garments, apparel, and textiles manufactured in Mauritius by Firemount Group Ltd., based on information that reasonably indicates the use of forced labor in violation of 19 U.S.C. § 1307. WROs are a powerful tool that can immediately disrupt shipments and merchandising plans, with downstream impacts on inventory, retail operations, and brand commitments. Currently, CBP is overseeing 54 WROs and nine Findings under § 1307.

Eleview settlement highlights US enforcement of export control rules on Russia. A freight forwarding business based in Virginia, as well as its owner, chief executive officer, and an employee, have pled guilty to conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act over schemes to transship more than USD6 million worth of sensitive United States technology to Russia through third countries and to provide false information on export control documentation submitted to the US government. The outcome underscores the US government’s intent to investigate conduct that threatens US national security and economic interests while also serving as a case study in cargo risk detection and control.

Another legal challenge for NESE pipeline. In mid-November, a coalition of environmental groups asked the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's November 7 decision that granted a crucial water quality certificate for the Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) pipeline project. The 37-mile NESE pipeline would route gas from Pennsylvania through New Jersey and New York, passing in part beneath the ocean floor near Staten Island to deliver natural gas to 2.3 million New York City households. The controversial project has faced years of permit rejections from both New Jersey and New York, and was cancelled by its developer, the Williams Companies, before New York Governor Kathy Hochul supported it earlier this year. In a statement on November 7, Governor Hochul stated that the pipeline is one aspect of New York's ""all-of-the-above approach"" and pointed to the “continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability.” The new lawsuit follows earlier legal challenges brought by the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC): one charging that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission improperly reissued a certificate for the pipeline in September and a second disputing both New York and New Jersey’s permit approvals in federal court. Last month, New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill expressed skepticism about the value of the NESE project, stating that it “does nothing to lower electric bills for New Jersey residents.” Separately, the Williams Companies have withdrawn the water permit application for the Constitution Pipeline, a USD1 billion underwater project intended to move natural gas from Pennsylvania to Albany, New York for routing via extant pipelines to New England.

Germany calls on EU to soften the 2035 internal-combustion engine phaseout. In a November 28 letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz asked that the European Union (EU) ease its 2035 deadline for registering new internal-combustion vehicles, arguing for “a reconciliation of competitiveness and climate action” and warning of risks to Germany’s auto industry. The letter is the latest step in a broader push by the European auto industry and its supporters for greater flexibility in ICE reductions and deadlines. Earlier this year, European automakers urged the EU to make allowance for internal combustion engines running on CO2 neutral fuels; in September the EU fast tracked a review of the policy, with details due December 10. On November 26, EU Executive Vice President Stephane Sejourne said the coming update will bring greater “flexibility” to European automakers, adding that “Europe is ready to activate all levers to make the European automotive industry successful.”

Russia turned away from UN shipping council. On November 28, for the third straight year, Russia did not receive enough votes to rejoin the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Council. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent pollution from ships. One hundred thirteen votes are needed to join the Council; Russia received 47. The IMO election results, Reuters Maritime observed, reflect the “continued global stance against Russian maritime practices.” Norway, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine, opponents of Russia’s candidacy, all pointed to concerns about Russia’s so-called shadow fleet – oil tankers often sailing under flags of convenience to circumvent economic sanctions.

FDRE marks an important shift in India’s clean energy procurement.
The report stresses that FDRE is not meant to replace all other clean energy solutions.
Beyond Energy Costs: Health, climate, and jobs The report also highlights that comparing FDRE and coal solely on energy costs ignores coal’s full societal costs.
Our current work is anchored in the grand challenges of our time, namely, Clean Energy Transition, Clean Air for All, and Sustainable and Secure Future for All.","December 9, 2025, New Delhi—India can secure reliable, round-the-clock clean power at costs competitive with new thermal plants by 2030 under realistic market conditions, with the possibility of achieving cost parity as early as 2025 under more favourable circumstances, a new report found.

The study, Budgeting for Net Zero: Powering India’s Reliable Clean Energy Future by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, finds that firm and dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE)—hybrid projects combining solar, wind, and battery storage—can match or undercut the cost of new thermal power plants when developers are able to monetize both a portion of surplus electricity generated by oversized renewable sources and additional storage capacity.

FDRE projects install slightly more renewable and storage capacity than required for their contracted supply; selling this surplus power plays a critical role in lowering overall costs. FDRE—one of several types of tenders for firm clean energy—is already much cheaper than new coal when the full social costs of thermal power plants are considered.

Without accounting for social costs, the study identifies three cost-parity timelines, depending on how much surplus power developers can sell into the market:

2025 when 100% of surplus power is monetized,

2030 when 50% of surplus power is monetized, and

2047 when only 30% of surplus power is monetized.

“Firm and dispatchable renewables are not just a clean alternative—they are an increasingly competitive source of reliable power. With thoughtful tender design and market reforms, India can tap into FDRE to meet rising electricity demand, cut long-term costs, and build a power system that is both resilient and future-ready,” said Sunil Mani, policy advisor at IISD.

The study examines when and under what conditions FDRE can compete with new thermal, whether government support is needed to accelerate deployment, and the macroeconomic impacts of scaling FDRE. It also evaluates how tender design, developer strategies, and electricity market reforms influence FDRE’s affordability.

FDRE marks an important shift in India’s clean energy procurement. Instead of simply adding variable renewable energy to the grid, FDRE tenders require developers to supply clean electricity at specific, often peak hours aligned with distribution companies’ (discoms’) demand patterns. This is becoming increasingly relevant as India’s power needs rise and discoms face higher costs from managing variability through short-term markets and limited access to flexible supply. FDRE offers one pathway to scale renewables while maintaining reliability and cost predictability for both discoms and consumers.

Although early FDRE tenders have faced challenges—such as uncertainty around the optimal renewable–storage mix and the monetization of surplus power—9.7 GW of FDRE capacity is already under construction, and bid prices closely match the cost projections in the study.

The report stresses that FDRE is not meant to replace all other clean energy solutions. Because FDRE guarantees firm delivery, it is naturally more expensive than standalone solar, wind, or storage when round-the-clock supply is not required. The authors of the report highlight that a balanced approach—deploying FDRE where demand profiles justify it and expanding lower-cost clean energy and storage elsewhere—will deliver the most efficient outcomes for India’s evolving power system.

“FDRE can play an important role alongside standalone renewables, storage, and smarter grid management to support India’s clean energy transition,” says Dr Anasuya Gangopadhyay, senior associate in the Climate Change Mitigation team at CSTEP.

Beyond Energy Costs: Health, climate, and jobs

The report also highlights that comparing FDRE and coal solely on energy costs ignores coal’s full societal costs. When air pollution and climate damages are included, the effective cost of new pithead coal rises from INR 4.65/kWh to INR 13.19/kWh, making FDRE immediately cheaper in all scenarios.

In addition, FDRE provides energy security advantages: it reduces exposure to fossil fuel price volatility and can be deployed in 2–2.5 years, compared to 5–7 years for new coal plants.

Beyond costs, scaling FDRE would raise India’s GDP by 1.8% by 2050, create 64,000 net new jobs, and reduce public health costs linked to air pollution while strengthening energy security by lowering dependence on fuel imports.

The study identifies several policy options to strengthen FDRE tender design and create market conditions that support deployment, including more flexible demand-fulfilment ratios, capacity payments for storage, improved penalty structures, expanded revenue opportunities, and enhanced resource adequacy planning at the state level.

The company is also playing a role in the nation’s clean energy transition.

Harder Mechanical is leading critical projects in battery recycling and lithium mining. “These efforts not only support sustainability goals but also strengthen the domestic supply of key materials for electric vehicles, making this both a profitable and nationally strategic market for us,” says Harder.

The company is also growing its presence in the data center sector. “These projects require speed, precision and innovation, areas where Harder Mechanical’s off-site manufacturing (OSM) capabilities give us a major advantage,” says Harder.

“These markets are hot because they sit at the intersection of technology, energy and sustainability, the three most transformative forces shaping modern industry,” he says. “Harder’s combination of scale, technical depth and advanced [offsite manufacturing] fabrication allows us to meet the high demands of these projects safely, efficiently and with industry-leading quality.”

A key driver of efficiency and success for the firm has been moving more fabrication and modular work to its offsite manufacturing shop. This strategy has improved safety, productivity and cost control while allowing field crews to focus on higher-value tasks.

“Harder Mechanical’s focus on continuous improvement—from upgrading safety policies, adopting Revit companywide and achieving ISO 9000 certification across all fab shops—shows a company committed to evolving and excelling,” says Harder.

Harder was part of the team on the Portland Airport’s Terminal Core project that redeveloped the main terminal.

Harder has been a key part of the Portland International Airport’s $2.15 billion, 860,000-sq-ft Terminal Core Redevelopment (TCORE) project, which is currently under construction and slated to complete in 2026. As a key trade partner on this transformative effort, Harder is working on security screening areas, baggage handling systems, office spaces and presecurity concessions, all while keeping airport operations running smoothly.

To meet the project’s ambitious schedule and minimize disruptions, Harder implemented an innovative modular construction strategy, designing and building 41 modular pipe racks off site—21 dedicated to utility systems and 20 to hydronic systems. This approach maximized prefabrication opportunities, enhancing both efficiency and worker safety in one of the most complex active airport construction environments in the Pacific Northwest.

“Harder Mechanical’s collaboration during the pre-construction phase of the Portland Airport expansion project was instrumental in shaping a cost-effective and constructible design,” says Bob McGinnis, senior preconstruction director at Skanska USA Building. “Their proactive approach to budgeting, value engineering and system coordination ensured seamless integration of complex mechanical solutions for this landmark project.”

Buffon Decker, senior project manager for Hoffman Skanska JV, says Harder was integral to the success of the project.

“They worked closely with the JV and the other trade partners in the initial planning and were responsive and quick with solutions when we hit the inevitable challenges on such a complex project,” Decker says. “They helped us to make sure that the airport provided the passenger experience and comfort that PDX is known for.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/12/08/Harder-001.jpg?height=635&t=1765229732&width=1200,N,,2025-12-08 21:58:04.969879

People across the country, from New York to Alabama, have opposed data center developments in their neighborhoods—with varying degrees of success.
In Southern states, despite a largely supportive regulatory environment, some communities have mounted strong opposition to proposed data centers.
In Bessemer, Alabama, the city council voted to rezone agricultural land to allow the construction of a new data center.
Data centers’ high power usage also pushes up the forecasts for peak demand—the highest demand possible for a region’s grid.","More than 200 environmental organizations signed a letter to Congress supporting a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers. The letter, sent Monday, highlights these centers’ impacts on water resources, electricity rates and greenhouse gas emissions.

Data centers often suck up large amounts of water to cool their computers. They require a lot of electricity to run their servers, often leading to higher regional utility rates and upgrades to the electricity grid to accommodate them. Some utilities are planning to build natural gas plants to serve the new load, while some data-center companies are even building their own plants, increasing local greenhouse gas emissions.

It is near-impossible to paint a complete picture of the energy and water use of data centers, and the corresponding climate impacts, given the limited data that companies provide. A November study in the journal Nature Sustainability predicted that, depending on the speed of expansion, the artificial intelligence industry could emit as much carbon dioxide each year as 10 million cars, Inside Climate News reported.

People across the country, from New York to Alabama, have opposed data center developments in their neighborhoods—with varying degrees of success. The letter states that environmental groups want to stop these developments until “adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities.”

In a prepared statement, Eric Weltman, senior New York organizer at Food & Water Watch, said: “It’s prudent that we press the pause button on Big Data’s voracious and expanding appetite for energy and water before it’s too late to prevent massive harm.”

Data-center boosters have touted the economic benefits of new construction, including tax revenue increases for local governments and new jobs for residents.

In October, Dan Diorio, the vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, told NPR that companies are trying to reduce their water consumption, and to ensure they pay “the full cost of service for electricity.”

In New York, state leadership has taken a mainly supportive stance on data center development—Gov. Kathy Hochul recently told Bloomberg News that she wants to “let the tech industry know this is the place you want to be.”

But some communities in upstate New York have opposed data center development, particularly cryptocurrency mines that consume large amounts of energy to create bitcoin for profit. More recently, a potential AI data center in Lansing, a town near the state’s Finger Lakes region, has residents concerned about rising electricity costs and environmental problems.

“These slick corporations come into unsuspecting communities with the promise of job creation and tax revenues,” said Yvonne Taylor, the vice president of Seneca Lake Guardian, an organization that fights data centers near the Finger Lakes, and president of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining, which opposes them across the country.

Both organizations signed the letter. “The fact of the matter is that all of these machines … they’re all fully automated, and it doesn’t require a lot of people, so there aren’t a lot of jobs that are created, but the community is left with the consequences, including increased energy bills,” she said.

In Southern states, despite a largely supportive regulatory environment, some communities have mounted strong opposition to proposed data centers. In Bessemer, Alabama, the city council voted to rezone agricultural land to allow the construction of a new data center. This decision has divided the community, which is concerned about electricity rates, water use and potential air pollution from the on-site backup diesel generators.

Data centers use up so much power in certain states, like Virginia, that the regional electric grid operator will need to upgrade the transmission system that is essentially the backbone of the grid, according to Eric Gimon, an independent consultant who works as a technical expert and policy adviser with Energy Innovation, an energy and climate policy think tank.

Consumers usually subsidize those changes. A 2024 report from Virginia’s legislative watchdog agency found that households there could see their bills increase by an estimated $14 to $37 monthly by 2040 as a result.

Data centers’ high power usage also pushes up the forecasts for peak demand—the highest demand possible for a region’s grid. This can also affect household electricity rates.

“For all these things, there are solutions,” said Gimon. “It’s just a question of demanding the solutions get implemented.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2214908695-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 19:01:50.085082

EV charging TRUMP: ""We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.""
This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case.","DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump this week announced plans to weaken rules for how far automakers' new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, set under former President Joe Biden.

READ MORE: Proposal Could Weaken Mileage Rules That Limit Air Pollution

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg (55.5 kpg) in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg (81.1 kpg) that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.""

THE FACTS: It's true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers' growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden's policies were ""a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.""

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: ""We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.""

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile (1.6 kilometers) of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren't evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers ""safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.""

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle's cost.

""If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,"" Edmunds' Caldwell said. ""However, it's unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.""

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

""This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,"" said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All campaign. ""This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.""",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/cars.jCorcCnsSf.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.55&fp-y=0.44&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-12-08 19:02:30.209147

The energy contracts submitted for the data center will not increase rates for existing customers, she said.
Whitmer released a letter in support of DTE’s data center plan just minutes before Wednesday’s hearing.","The Michigan Public Service Commission declined to take up DTE Energy’s power contracts for the Oracle and Open AI data center in Saline Township Friday, despite the utility’s statement that the project could be canceled if not approved by Dec. 5.

“When cases before the Commission are ripe for a decision, cases are put on the agenda,” MPSC spokesperson Matt Helms said in a Friday email.

The massive, $7 billion, 1.4-gigawatt data center planned for 575 acres of farmland south of Ann Arbor is a political flashpoint.

The MPSC has received over 5,000 online comments on the case and over 800 people attended a virtual hearing on the data center Wednesday night.

An additional virtual hearing will be held at 6 p.m. on Dec. 18 on a permit application for the Saline data center’s proposed wetland, stream, and floodplain impacts, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy announced Friday.

When asked about the passing of DTE’s deadline, DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said the company “will continue to follow the regulatory process and wait for the MPSC’s decision on these contracts.”

Wilmot did not say whether the status of the project is affected by the missed deadline, and deferred questions on the matter to developer Related Digital and Oracle.

The utility’s contracts with the data center customer allow it to terminate the agreement within 30 days if the deal is not approved by Dec. 5, or if the customer does not agree to extend this date to Dec. 19, according to a DTE regulatory filing. The MPSC’s next regular meeting is Dec. 18.

Related Digital spokesperson Natalie Ravitz said the Saline Township data center is an exceptional opportunity for job creation and building digital infrastructure.

“The project is structured to ensure a responsible development plan that protects ratepayers, preserves Michigan’s natural resources and water, and delivers a positive impact on the local economy,” Ravitz said in an email.

Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

Data centers are statewide issue that demands oversight, residents tell regulators

During the public comment portion of the MPSC’s Friday meeting, around 20 Michiganders spoke against the data center or in support of a contested case.

Ayat Al-Tamimi, a public health researcher and member of the grassroots group Michiganders Against Data Centers, held up a copy of the heavily redacted contracts DTE submitted to the MPSC as evidence of what she said is DTE’s failure to be a good partner to the people of Michigan.

“They’re able to circumvent clean energy commitments, if their power demand exceeds their ability to meet their clean energy commitments,” Al-Tamimi said, referring to an off ramp provision in Michigan’s 2023 clean energy law that allows fossil fuels to stay online if there is insufficient capacity to meet demand.

Saline Township resident Tim Bruneau said he has difficulties with outages and long restoration times and is concerned the data center could increase electric costs, referencing a September Bloomberg report that showed dramatic increases in ratepayers bills. The story said data centers increased electricity costs by as much as 267% over five years in some areas.

“The people of Michigan deserve a say in what happens to our power grid, to our land, and to our water,” said Christian Alvarado, a Plymouth resident and organizer with the nonprofit Detroit Action. The data center has the potential to impact ratepayers statewide, and the project “must be carefully and transparently vetted,” he said.

Nessel, lawmakers call for data center oversight

DTE Energy, which applied for ex parte approval of the data center electricity contracts without official hearings, has said a contested case is unnecessary because the project will not increase the cost of service for other customers.

Residents and some lawmakers say a contested case with Michigan regulators is needed to ensure the data center doesn’t increase utility bills, decrease energy reliability, undermine Michigan’s climate law, or leave ratepayers to pay for stranded costs if the facility uses less power than anticipated or ceases operation.

A contested case would enable parties representing businesses, environmental interests, ratepayers, and other groups to submit testimony on the electric contracts for the Saline Township data center.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and some union representatives and lawmakers support the project, and say it will create thousands of temporary construction jobs, hundreds of permanent jobs, and bring tax dollars to local communities.

Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel faced off on opposite sides of the data center issue this week.

DTE failed to show how it will supply power for the facility and protect residents from covering project costs, Nessel said in a Thursday statement.

Among the deficiencies Nessel said she found in DTE’s request for approval of the contracts are “unjustified redactions and rushed deadlines.”

“DTE continues to push for a rubber-stamp approval of a secret deal, but time and again, my office has contested their filings – and time after time, the utility has shown it is not a trustworthy partner, routinely filling cases with unjustified costs,” Nessel said, adding that a case involving hundreds of millions of dollars in energy infrastructure costs should be contested.

When asked about Nessel’s statement, DTE’s Wilmot said the company has an obligation to serve any business or residential customer. The energy contracts submitted for the data center will not increase rates for existing customers, she said. Whitmer released a letter in support of DTE’s data center plan just minutes before Wednesday’s hearing. The project will create jobs, she said, adding that her office reviewed the project’s environmental and ratepayer protections to ensure residents are not negatively impacted.

“Can Michigan benefit from these jobs and build data centers in a smarter way while upholding our strong environmental laws to protect our precious natural resources? We have an opportunity to do both,” Whitmer wrote.

Twenty-eight Republican and Democratic lawmakers signed a Dec. 2 letter that urges the MPSC to hold a contested case.

The lawmakers said the project could be a major economic opportunity, but that it also represents the “largest energy consumption increase in Michigan history,” and the MPSC will be unable to make an informed and fair decision on the matter without a contested proceeding.

Robust public input and feedback is needed to ensure existing customers don’t pay more for energy if “the energy usage overtaxes infrastructure, impedes Michigan’s clean energy goals, or because the companies proposing the data centers go bankrupt or otherwise do not fulfill their promises,” the letter said.

During Friday’s meeting, Augusta Township resident Wendy Albers said residents of Michigan townships are often left in the dark while data center deals are negotiated, with developers pushing a rushed timeline for approval once the proposals are made public.

“Please end the secrecy and protect the people of Michigan,” Albers told the commission in her request for a contested case.

“This is your chance to provide some equality between big tech, government, and the people.”

Antares, an advanced nuclear energy startup, announced the close of its $96 million Series B funding round.

The round was led by Shine Capital, with participation from Alt Capital, Caffeinated, FiftyThree Stations, Industrious, and other investors.

The round consists of $71M in new equity capital and $25M in debt for equipment, factory build-out, and uranium procurement.

Antares CEO Jordan Bramble said the new capital will fuel the company’s mission to deliver safe, reliable, and scalable nuclear power solutions.

“This funding marks a major milestone for Antares,” Bramble said. “We’re months away from our first reactor demonstration, which will validate our control systems and neutronics models, develop our testing facility, and fabricate our fuel ahead of our upcoming full scale electricity producing prototype in 2027.""

Bramble added, ""We’ve raised the capital we need to mobilize to provide resilient energy for our partners at the Department of War (DoW) and NASA.”

Founded just over two years ago, Antares has made rapid progress in technology maturation.

The company has raised over $130M in funding to date and put those resources to work building out a 145,000-square-foot facility in Torrance, California, capable of producing 10 units per year.

Antares has also secured contracts with the United States Air Force, Space Force, Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), and NASA to advance its technology.

With operations in Torrance, California; Idaho Falls, Idaho; and Aiken, South Carolina, and a team of 60, Antares is working to demonstrate a low-power test reactor before July 4, 2026, and to test its first-of-a-kind electricity-producing demonstration unit in 2027.

Production units will be deployed as early as 2028.

Over the summer, Antares conducted an electrically heated demonstration of its reactor in partnership with NASA at their Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

In April, Antares was selected by DIU under the Advanced Nuclear Power for Installations (ANPI) program to provide nuclear power to DoW installations.

In August, the company received an allocation of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel feedstock from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and was selected for DOE’s new reactor pilot program, which creates a fast-track pathway for reactor demonstration and licensing.

In October, the U.S. Army announced the establishment of a program of record for advanced nuclear energy, called JANUS, targeting reactors from kilowatt class up to 20MWe.

With this new funding, Antares plans to compete to provide the Pentagon with resilient energy for critical assets and infrastructure.

Antares’ will also propose on NASA’s Fission Surface Power program, which aims to deliver 100 kWe of nuclear power on the lunar surface by 2030.

Middleburg, a leading developer and operator of rental housing throughout core Southern markets, has closed a $39.1 million refinance of Vesta Creeks Run, a workforce and affordable housing community located at 4640 Forest Hills Drive in North Charleston, South Carolina.

Newmark arranged the Freddie Mac financing on behalf of Middleburg.

Throughout the course of its ownership since acquiring the asset in 2021, Middleburg implemented several operational and capital. The property is 97 percent occupied.

“Our partnership with Capital Solutions and Affordable Communities of America, a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving affordable housing throughout the country, enabled us to come up with creative strategies to help us continue to provide and maintain high-quality attainable housing stock in markets like Charleston,” said Michael Bediones, vice president of Asset Management at Middleburg.

Vesta Creeks Run is part of Middleburg's Vesta brand, the firm's workforce and affordable housing platform serving residents across the Southeast.

Officials said the property features attainable rents and area median income (AMI)-restricted units, addressing growing workforce housing needs in the Charleston region.

Under the leadership of Founder and CEO Chris Finlay, Middleburg continues to expand its attainable housing platform across three brands: Mosby, its marquee Class A multifamily product; Vesta, its workforce and affordable housing brand; and Hamlet, its purpose-built single-family rental product.

With over two decades of multifamily sponsorship, Middleburg has acquired, developed, and financed more than 32,000 multifamily units, exceeding over $4.5 billion in transactions since 2004.",http://locable-assets-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/resource/file/1261312/antares_20logo.jpg?timestamp=1765245556,N,,2025-12-08 20:59:19.028008

The National Grocers Association petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last Thursday to revise its hydrofluorocarbon management rule, citing unrealistic timelines, excessive compliance costs and regulatory requirements that exceed what Congress mandated.

NGA argued that the HFC Management Rule imposes impractical and overly burdensome requirements on food retailers. These include a drastic expansion of the number of covered refrigeration appliances and a leak-rate limit that does not reflect real-world system performance. The association also said the rule’s repair, testing and retrofit deadlines are unrealistically short, especially given national shortages of technicians and parts. It is requesting additional time to comply with automatic leak-detection system mandates.

“Independent grocers are committed to environmental sustainability and responsible refrigerant management,” said Max Wengroff, NGA senior manager of government relations. “But the EPA’s rule places unrealistic obligations on retailers that simply cannot be met under the imposed timelines and thresholds. These unnecessary obligations will raise costs for businesses and families.”

In the petition, NGA stated that it supports reducing HFC emissions by limiting production and use. However, it argued that compliance with the rule would increase operating expenses, forcing grocers to pass those costs on to consumers.

According to NGA, the EPA’s new leak-rate threshold for repair is unworkable. The agency set the threshold at 20%, despite industry data indicating that the typical food-retail refrigeration system leaks about 25% of its refrigerant each year. The association is requesting that the threshold be raised to 30% or that the agency adopt a phased schedule that starts with a higher rate and becomes more stringent over time.

The independent grocery sector represents nearly one-third of all U.S. grocery sales—more than $250 billion annually—and supports over 1 million jobs. NGA contended that without reasonable revisions to the rule, many independent grocers will face costs they cannot absorb, which will ultimately be passed on to customers.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-12/background/Cooler%20in%20a%20grocery%20store.jpg?VersionId=kTiLZPbN8c2AFMfIrK6VRA0K1E9KebLJ,N,,2025-12-08 17:02:05.240052

Technically, you could fit a couple of them in the same space as a single 500X, so inventory headaches might be minimal. But sarcasm aside, Fiat really has announced it’s bringing the bite-sized model to the States.

The company will share more details next year, but the Topolino is a small two-seat electric vehicle that has a front-mounted motor developing 8 hp (6 kW / 8 PS) and 32 lb-ft (44 Nm) of torque. It’s powered by a 5.4 kWh battery pack, which provides a range of 46 miles (75 km) under the World Motorcycle Test Cycle.

The European model has a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) and it can accelerate to that number in ten seconds flat. This would make it ideal for use in neighborhoods, where golf carts have exploded in popularity.

We’ll learn more about the US-spec model in the coming months, but the European Topolino rides on 14-inch wheels. The ultra-compact EV is also sold in Europe as the Citroen Ami and Opel Rocks, though those variants won’t be making their way here. Unless Dodge or Jeep get any weird ideas.

That’s 43.1 inches (1,096 mm) shorter than the slow-selling 500e, which starts at $30,500 before a hefty $1,995 destination fee. Just imagine this thing next to an Escalade or an F-150.

Under direct pressure from Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency was pushed to go beyond rolling back climate protections and weaken long-standing public health safeguards as well. Documents reveal that the Office of Management and Budget leaned on EPA this summer to not only repeal a foundational climate policy underpinning most federal emissions rules for cars and trucks, but also to loosen limits on deadly non-climate pollutants like soot and smog-forming chemicals.

While EPA officials resisted parts of this pressure, the exchange—made public after the proposed rollback was released in July—lays bare the Trump administration’s aggressive campaign to dismantle environmental regulation across the board, not just climate rules. Current vehicle standards, finalized in 2024 under the Biden administration, target both greenhouse gases and so-called “criteria pollutants” that cause asthma, heart disease, and premature death. But as Trump’s EPA moves to gut those protections, the White House budget office has simultaneously pushed to weaken rules on toxic air pollution itself—showing that this rollback is not only about climate denial, but also about abandoning basic public health protections.

The climate crisis is here and now. The fossil fuel industry knew, lied, denied, and sabotaged action on catastrophic climate change for decades, all while raking in billions in profit every year.

The paper argues that a U.S. Strategic Lithium Reserve (SLR)—modeled on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve—could provide the price stability needed for private capital to finance new lithium mining and conversion projects across the Western Hemisphere.

A Market-Based Alternative to Subsidies and Price Floors

Lithium prices have swung 10–15× in recent cycles—far beyond what most long-term capital can withstand. Much of this volatility stems from China’s dominance of lithium chemical conversion, where oversupply and subsidized lepidolite production exert sustained downward pressure on global prices. The result: U.S., Canadian, and allied projects struggle to reach Final Investment Decision (FID) even when resource quality and management execution are strong.

“A Strategic Lithium Reserve is the simplest, fairest, and fastest policy tool available,” said Howard Klein, Founder of RK Equity.

“It doesn’t pick technologies or subsidize risky projects. It neutralizes volatility so private capital can back the best projects.”

How the SLR Works

The SLR would operate as a rules-based reserve of lithium carbonate, purchasing material when prices fall below incentive levels—typically around $20,000–25,000 per tonne—and releasing it during extreme price spikes, supply disruptions, or export restrictions.

Establishing a 170,000-tonne reserve today would cost approximately $3.4–4.25 billion. A fully built-out 300,000-tonnereserve by 2030 would cost $6.0–7.5 billion. These sums are modest compared to existing U.S. industrial policy initiatives such as:

DOE Loan Programs Office: >$100B

Inflation Reduction Act clean energy incentives: >$400B

CHIPS Act: ~$50B

Immediate Strategic Impact

The white paper highlights that the Americas—particularly Chile and Argentina—are already the largest non-China producers of lithium carbonate. Redirecting a portion of these flows away from China and toward a U.S. reserve would provide immediate strategic supply security.

“Unlike permitting a new mine or building a U.S. refinery, which takes years, the SLR can begin stabilizing the market within months,” Klein added.

“It is the lithium-age analogue to the SPR.”

Complementary Industrial Strategy

In addition to the SLR, the paper recommends:

Continued use of the 45X Production Tax Credit, a broad-based, non-distortive incentive

Targeted LPO, EXIM Bank, or Department of the Navy’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) support for nationally significant, long-lived strategic projects

Limited, performance-linked incentives for companies with demonstrated ability to build and operate large-scale conversion capacity

The white paper also presents a three-phase implementation roadmap, beginning with authorization and early purchases, followed by hemispheric project alignment, and culminating in a fully operational SLR capable of dampening market extremes across cycles.

Welch’s parents both worked as park rangers at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and as she grew older, her mom took on seasonal work at other parks during the summer months.

“From living in Yellowstone to New River Gorge National Park, I was always outside and knew I wanted to have a similar career to my parents,” Welch said.

Welch volunteered at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in high school and later served as a rafting guide, experiences that reinforced her aspirations to work outdoors.

As she was preparing for college, Welch focused on finding academic programs that would align with her goal of working in conservation.

That’s when she discovered the College of Natural Resources at NC State, where she enrolled as a fisheries, wildlife and conservation biology major with a minor in applied ecology.

Inspired by a dendrology course taught by Steph Jefferies in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources, Welch decided to double major in plant biology.

“Dr. Jefferies made the class so engaging, and I use what I learned almost daily, or whenever I see a tree,” Welch said.

Welch also enrolled in the University Certificate in Field Botany program, which provides students with the opportunity to develop skills in vascular plant identification.

This interdisciplinary path has provided Welch, who is graduating this fall, with a unique perspective on conservation, allowing her to fully realize the interconnectedness of plants and wildlife.

“In an ecosystem, plants and wildlife are so connected, and learning about the parts of a system helps us understand the entire ecosystem,” Welch said.

Reconnecting with Her Indigenous Roots

While at NC State, Welch’s studies also deepened her connection to her ancestral roots, as she is an enrolled member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (ECBI).

“Growing up, I didn’t know that much about Cherokee culture. It wasn’t really taught in schools, and I didn’t search it out,” Welch said.

Welch didn’t expect to miss her cultural background when left home for college, as it hadn’t been a significant part of her identity at that time.

But the longer she was away, Welch’s desire to reconnect with her culture grew, leading her to participate more in events focused on Cherokee traditions and heritage back home.

In August 2024, Welch joined the James Buzzard Leadership Development Program, through which she learned about the Indigenous Conservation Corps (ICC).

The ICC is a partnership between Conservation Corps North Carolina, the U.S. National Forest Service and the ECBI to promote environmental stewardship and cultural preservation through collaborative conservation efforts.

Last summer, Welch served as an assistant crew lead for the ICC alongside her sister Rebecca, learning about Cherokee ecological knowledge and EBCI Natural Resources Department’s efforts to restore their relationship with the land.

“I’m so thankful that I participated in this program with my sister,” Welch said. “It helped me realize that I want to combine what I’ve learned at NC State with honoring Cherokee land stewardship and deepening my understanding of the culture.”

Exploring, Learning and Gaining Experience

Reflecting on her journey, Welch emphasized that her experience with the ICC was made possible in large part by the College of Natural Resources’ emphasis on hands-on learning.

As part of the fisheries, wildlife and conservation biology curriculum, all students are required to complete an experiential learning opportunity, such as an internship or field practicum, to graduate.

“The college sets students up for success by providing internship opportunities, supporting clubs and offering events,” Welch said. “One of its greatest strengths is enabling students to learn beyond the traditional classroom.”

Welch specifically highlighted the 6-week field practicum, known as Summer Camp, as being crucial to preparing her for fieldwork. The practicum allows students to gain practical experience in wildlife management and conservation practices.

“This experience was my first real introduction to wildlife management, and I’ve used so much of what we learned in just two internships,” Welch said.

In addition to her experience with the ICC, Welch also completed an internship with Discover Life in America at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 2024.

Through these internships, Welch gained invaluable firsthand research skills, immersing herself in the complexities of fieldwork and learning to navigate logistical, environmental and organizational challenges.

Looking ahead, Welch plans to work seasonally before pursuing a master’s degree. Eventually, she hopes to return to her home in western North Carolina to pursue a career in conservation or a related field.

Welch expressed gratitude for the support and guidance she received throughout her time at NC State, specifically thanking her advisor, Lara Pacifici, and Kaly Wall, an academic services specialist.

When asked for advice to current students, Welch encouraged them to embrace every opportunity, stressing that hands-on experience is key to career success and building professional connections.

Additionally, Welch highlighted the importance of flexibility in fieldwork, noting, “Things won’t always go as planned, but a positive attitude makes all the difference.”",https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/12/julianna-welch-wolf-plaza-katherine-griffey-1146x600-1.png,N,,2025-12-08 17:02:32.940620

Congress Preps Hegseth’s Trillion-Dollar War Chest

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Lawmakers on Sunday released the compromise defense policy bill for FY 26, which would authorize a more than $900 billion Pentagon budget. If passed, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) would bring total U.S. military spending to well over a trillion dollars annually, thanks to the GOP-led Big Ugly Law passed in July, which included $150 billion in additional Pentagon funds. Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, released the following statement:

“The last person who should be entrusted with an even bigger budget is the dangerous and lawless Pete Hegseth.

“As Hegseth illegally targets civilian boats near Venezuela with expensive Hellfire missiles, wastefully and recklessly deploys the National Guard in cities around the country, and teases an unconstitutional and costly war, Congress should refuse to add a penny to his budget.

“The $8 billion bump proposed for the Pentagon budget is, thankfully, less than the $32 billion proposed by the Senate. But it’s still an unconscionable increase to a budget already overflowing with dangerous, ultra-wasteful line items like the President’s ‘Golden Dome’ grift and unchecked killer robot programs.

“It’s time for Congress to get its priorities straight and stop piling more money on the trillion-dollar Pentagon budget beset with fraud and waste, at the expense of priority human needs. The $8 billion in additional funds for the Pentagon are nearly enough to pay for SNAP benefits for the four million people who will lose them under the tax and budget reconciliation bill.

“Congress should unequivocally reject the bill and use this moment to voice its strong opposition to Hegseth’s reckless overseas killings, protracted domestic deployments of the National Guard, and countless other security and human rights breaches.”",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:02:00.802431

“Lithium occurs in small quantities,” Ted Pagano, CEO of MPSC, told Crain’s. “Those supply chains are complicated and depend on critical metals and refining capacity. Whereas the unique use of an industrial mineral that we already produce in mass can be used. We’re not just making pallets of material, but sending out giant bulk trucks. The difference is substantive and uses a stable U.S. supply chain.”

Group1’s project isn’t commercialized yet, so the project remains mostly theoretical at this point. Much like the potash mine itself.

MPSC’s development of a potash mine outside of Evart has been more than 15 years in the making.

MPSC was scheduled to break ground in mid-2022 to supply more than 650,000 tons of potash and 1 million tons of food-grade salt by this year. Potash is one of three critical macronutrients required to sustain plant life found in fertilizers.

But raising $1.3 billion in capital toward the project proved difficult, as well as concerns over the mine’s environmental impact.

“The fact is, an average lifecycle to get a facility up and running in this industry, from discovery to when production starts, is 28 years,” Pagano said. “We are in the position we are in today because we have a supply chain that’s ultimately threatened. But because of the type of capital we need in this space, those providing the capital tend to be less patient in the U.S. than in competing nations.”

Pagano is referencing that financiers usually want their return on investment much sooner than in 30-plus years, making investing in infrastructure projects like this difficult.

Potash is a limited natural resource. It's only mined in 13 countries and is extracted from deep within the Earth's mantle. Potash mining in New Mexico and Utah is running low on the mineral salt high in potassium, as both deposits have been mined since around World War I.

Then in 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey announced it had discovered the purest known potash deposit on earth — roughly 7,800 feet below the surface in Evart. The potassium-rich rocks are a relic from the drying up of the Devonian Sea, a salt-rich sea like the Middle East's Dead Sea that covered much of Central Canada and the Northern U.S. 350 million years ago.

The deposit spans more than 15,000 acres in Osceola and Mecosta counties and has a projected value of $65 billion, according to the federal geology agency.

The rock core samples from Evart were given to the USGS by Canadian potash mine company Kalium and were retrieved from the earth in the 1980s.

Pagano created MPSC and worked alongside the USGS to test the old rock core samples in 2012 and has worked to start a mining operation in Evart ever since.

MPSC owns the 500 acres over the deposit. but has mineral leases on 5,000 acres from 450 different land owners.

The mine project gained traction in 2022 after the price of potash shot up more than 166% in the wake of sanctions against Belarus for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More than 40% of global production of potash comes from those two nations, and more than 96% of all potash used in the U.S. is imported.

The price of potash has since come down — $353.75 per metric ton last month.

But the project became a matter of national security under former President Joe Biden, whose U.S. Department of Energy authorized a conditional loan guarantee of up to $1.26 billion for the project late last year, solving its funding conundrum.

The mine project already had a $225 million bond from the state to lure investors, as well as inking a deal to sell its entire annual production to Chicago-based Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.

ADM is one of the largest food processors and commodities traders in the world. In 2024, the public company (NYSE: ADM) generated more than $85 billion in revenue.

The operation's slow start is also due to the potential environmental impact of the mining process. The company plans to drill holes to the deposit nearly 1.5 miles down and pump a brine solution to dissolve the potash, pump it back up to the surface, and then allow it to dry and re-enter a solid state.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy approved permits for the operation over the protests of environmental groups. But some permitting requirements do remain, Pagano said.

Pagano said he cannot provide a date for when construction of the mine will begin, other than to say “as soon as possible,” but when it does, it’ll take three years to complete.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/potash%20mine-main_i_1.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:03:31.720359

Every great river carries great stories in its flow.

Stories of exploration and commerce, yes, but also of connection and belonging, collective action and empowerment.

And so every great river also needs its story keepers.

For the past five years, the University of Michigan’s Detroit River Story Lab has been supporting local efforts to lift up river stories and amplify the voices of their tellers. David Porter, an English professor and founder of the story lab, says he became interested in this collaborative work when he recognized how often community leaders brought up the importance of place-based storytelling in the context of their relationships with the river.

What followed was the development of multiple story-centered projects combining humanities scholarship and community engagement. The lab emerged as a collaboration between an interdisciplinary group of U-M faculty and a variety of local partners. From the outset, Porter said, “the mission was about catalyzing ongoing narrative infrastructure work in river-facing communities. The lab’s initial grant focused explicitly on supporting community-based storytelling projects.”

Since it received that first internal funding in the fall of 2020, the lab has focused on developing three overlapping narrative channels along the Detroit River corridor: place-based education, community heritage, and local journalism.

Today the lab works with dozens of public schools, youth organizations, museums, government agencies, news organizations, and nonprofits to help research and share out a variety of river stories and to support residents’ engagement with the region’s defining waterway through educational programs, interpretive installations, and long-form media stories.

A great example is the Detroit River Skiff and Schooner Program, which was launched in 2021 and provides high school and college students with opportunities such as boat-building workshops and tall ship outings featuring conversations with community experts on the river’s cultural and environmental heritage.

The lab also works with Detroit partners to resurface submerged stories along the river, and to collaborate on site-specific projects at locations including Historic Fort Wayne and the new Gordie Howe Bridge. Oral histories, exhibits and public events all promote environmental stewardship and a greater sense of community. Some of the dozens of projects featured on the lab’s website include an Underground Railroad Research Guide, a Digital Mapping Project featuring historical maps of the Detroit River corridor, and a StoryMap called Lives of Leisure and Labor on the Detroit River.

Some of Porter’s favorite river stories include those about the local histories of Black journalism and Black boating along the river, historical figures like Sarah E. Ray and Thornton and Lucie Blackburn, and present-day community leaders like Hadassah Greensky, Tepfirah Rushdan, Bruce Ross, Jason McGuire, Taylor Mitchell, and Shakara Tyler.

The lab sponsors student internships with the nonprofit news organizations of BridgeDetroit and Planet Detroit to assist them in reporting community stories.

And through the Detroit River Stories Podcast, U-M students interview Detroit residents about their relationship with the river, offering insights on everything from the city’s buried creeks to climate and commerce along the river to the essential role the U.S. Coast Guard plays in the flow of the river.

Another student-led project features a collection of interview-based stories focused on Belle Isle – the swimmers, the walkers, the fishers and the boaters. Porter says: “It’s another important contribution, since for so many Detroiters, the isle is a sanctuary from the city sprawl, a place of peace and reflection and resilience and grounding.”

Units from across U-M have engaged with the lab’s work over the past five years, contributing research expertise, grant funding and program development support. That includes faculty from the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the School of Environment and Sustainability, the Marsal Family School of Education, and Taubman College.

Additional U-M partners have included Rackham Graduate School, the Vice Provost for Engaged Learning, the Museum of Anthropological Archeology, the Graham Sustainability Institute, Poverty Solutions, Wolverine Pathways, and the Great Lakes Writers Corps.",https://detroit.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cropped-UofMLogo-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:03:37.986086

Apple’s lead environmental strategist, Lisa Jackson, is retiring in late January 2026 after 13 years on the job.

A direct replacement was not named. Instead, Jackson’s responsibilities as vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives will be split between two senior-level Apple executives after her departure.

Jennifer Newstead, who will join Apple as general counsel in March after serving in a similar capacity at Meta, will take over Jackson’s policy work. Apple’s environmental and social initiatives will now report to the company’s new chief operating officer, Sabih Khan, a mechanical engineer who has been closely involved with many of Apple’s green manufacturing and circular design initiatives.

Both executives report to CEO Tim Cook, as does Jackson.

Respected legacy

Jackson, a chemical engineer by training, joined Apple in 2013 after four years as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama.

Under her leadership, Apple has managed to reduce its emissions by more than 60 percent through deliberate investments in renewable energy in its supply chain and by transitioning to recycled and renewable options for 15 priority materials, such as aluminum, rare earths and lithium.

“She has also been a critical strategic partner in engaging governments around the world, advocating for the best interests of our users on a myriad of topics, as well as advancing our values, from education and accessibility to privacy and security,” said Cook in a prepared statement.

For example, Jackson spearheaded the company’s Racial and Equity Justice Initiative, launched in 2020 and focused on investing $100 million in diverse entrepreneurs and in programs aimed at reducing pollution in low-income communities.

“I have been lucky to work with leaders who understand that reducing our environmental impact is not just good for the environment, but good for business, and that we can do well by doing good,” Jackson said in a prepared statement. “I have every confidence that Apple will continue to have a profoundly positive impact on the planet and its people.”

Strategic continuity

Khan, Apple’s new COO, has been directly involved in delivering on many of Jackson’s strategies for the company’s supply chain, including the materials-replacements initiatives that helped the company avoid 6.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2024 alone.

Cook touted Khan’s work on advanced manufacturing technologies that have reduced emissions when he announced his promotion in July.

Washington – In a letter sent to Congress today, more than 230 national, state and local organizations from across the country called for a full national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers. The letter cites massive and unsustainable consumption by data centers of energy and water resources, and skyrocking utility costs for families and small businesses. The letter was facilitated by the national environmental group Food & Water Watch, and signed by organizations including Physicians for Social Responsibility, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Progressive Democrats of America, Our Revolution and Americans for Financial Reform.

The letter states, in part:

“The rapid expansion of data centers across the United States, driven by the generative artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto booms, presents one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation. This expansion is rapidly increasing demand for energy, driving more fossil fuel pollution, straining water resources and raising electricity prices across the country… We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.”

“At a time when millions of Americans are already struggling with soaring utility costs, the sudden explosion of the Big Data industry represents an existential threat for communities ill-equipped to handle the massive environmental and economic hardships these data centers inflict,” said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch. “The only prudent action is to halt the unfettered expansion of this dangerous industry in order to properly examine all manner of potential harm before it’s too late.”

Already, energy demand from data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase up to threefold between 2023 and 2028. And recent analysis from Food & Water Watch found that by 2028, AI-supporting data centers could consume:

720 billion gallons of water annually simply to cool the facilities — equal to more than 1 million Olympic-size swimming pools, or enough water to meet the indoor needs of 18.5 million American households.

300 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy annually — enough electricity to power over 28 million American households.

Meanwhile, this summer the Trump administration released an “AI Action Plan,” which outlines its priorities related to the advancement of so-called “artificial intelligence” and the industries supporting it – including massive energy- and water-intensive data centers. Among other things, Trump’s plan seeks to dismantle existing environmental and land use rules that it views as a hindrance to the unfettered growth of these industries.

Morgan Stanley on Tesla: The electric vehicle giant was named the top automotive stock by Jonas for 2025. The analyst had held an Outperform rating since 2023 and had been bullish on many aspects of the company, including the new pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Percoco has a different idea going forward, suggesting that the AI opportunity for the company is offset by automotive headwinds and a full valuation.

""With downside to consensus estimates driven by pressures in the auto business and catalysts for it non-auto business priced in at its current valuation, we assume coverage at Equal-weight with a $424 price target and wait for a better entry point,"" Percoco said.

The analyst said Tesla is a leader in electric vehicles, renewable energy, manufacturing, and real-world AI, which should give it a premium valuation.

""However, high expectations on the latter (AI) have brought the stock closer to fair valuation.""

The analyst sees challenging catalysts for Tesla going forward, which could provide downside to estimates.

""We believe it will be increasingly challenging to support meaningful upside to Tesla shares barring an improvement, or at least stabilization, within its auto business.""

Along with the base case price target of $425, Percoco has a bull case valuation of $860 and a bear case valuation of $145 on Tesla stock.

Morgan Stanley on General Motors: While Percoco sees Tesla stock less favorable than Jonas, the new automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley sees a brighter short-term future for General Motors.

""Over the course of the last year, GM made strides in realigning their capital allocation strategy with a more tempered EV and AV growth curve,"" Percoco said.

The analyst said General Motors could benefit from reduced policy uncertainty, the ending of EV tax credits, and reductions in emissions-related requirements.

""We expect GM to manage through with an appropriately re-aligned capital allocation strategy and refreshed product lineup highlighting strength in GM's core ICE trucks and SUVs.""

Percoco said investors could see a ""prolongation of ‘ICE is Nice' narrative"" for traditional automakers.

""As a result of easing compliance requirements, OEMs can leverage consumer preference for higher-value ICE and hybrid vehicles.""

A shift back to ICE vehicles by consumers in 2026 could be a tailwind for General Motors.

While neither company has completely abandoned its electric vehicle presence, changes to growth plans and focusing on ICE vehicles could pay off in the short term, according to Percoco.

Morgan Stanley on Auto Sector: The analyst expects electric vehicle volume to be down 20% year-over-year in the United States for 2026, painting a cautious outlook on the pure-play EV companies like Tesla, Rivian and Lucid.

The analyst forecasts ICE vehicle sales in the U.S. market to be up 1% year-over-year in 2026.

""Position your portfolio toward best in class operators that can navigate a slower industry outlook by allocating capital effectively with a strong execution track record (General Motors),"" Percoco said.

The analyst warned investors to ""be wary"" of companies facing industry headwinds, such as EV deceleration.

GM, TSLA Price Action: General Motors stock is down 0.5% to $75.69 on Monday versus a 52-week trading range of $41.60 to $77.00. General Motors shares are up 47.3% year-to-date in 2025.

But to fully leverage natural gas, we need a permitting system that lets pipelines and storage facilities come online faster.
Permitting review should focus on supporting businesses looking to build critical energy infrastructure in the United States, rather than hindering them with petty litigation, lengthy review processes, and convoluted standards.
To do this, the NPC recommends a massive permitting system overhaul, focused on standardizing and expediting the review process.
Data proves that a strong majority of voters support updating the permitting process to speed up energy development.","Reducing litigation backlogs, expediting critical project timelines, and standardizing processes are critical steps to overhauling America’s broken permitting system, says a new report from the National Petroleum Council (NPC), issued at the request of Energy Secretary Chris Wright. The report comes amid rising energy costs as AI data centers and increased U.S. energy exports have skyrocketed demand. The NPC’s findings serve as a collaborative roadmap for government and industry to work together on streamlining permits.

NPC’s analysis points out that current permitting pitfalls don’t merely cause logistical issues, they also cause a structural vulnerability to the nation’s energy system, causing regional price volatility, supply insecurity, increased prices, and job loss. America is at a tipping point: we either overhaul the permitting process to build the infrastructure needed to keep up with energy demand, or face serious economic consequences.

Energy Secretary Wright, who ordered the NPC report in June, welcomed its findings as an important step toward reform:

“The National Petroleum Council’s findings confirm what President Trump has said from day one: America needs more energy infrastructure, less red tape, and serious permitting reform. These recommendations will help make energy more affordable for every American household.”

As Energy in Depth has examined in previous analysis, outdated permitting rules have slowed the development of projects critical for energy security and reliability. But momentum is building for change. In September, a diverse coalition of America’s energy and business leaders sent letters to congress, urging them to act quickly to modernize the permitting system: streamlining the system so that projects can better develop and everyday people can reap the benefit quickly of new infrastructure construction.

Getting It Done

The NPC report illustrates how demand is outpacing the capacity of our energy infrastructure, particularly for natural gas. Between 2013 and 2024, U.S. natural gas demand increased by 49 percent, while pipeline capacity grew only 26 percent and storage capacity rose an incremental two percent from 2013 to 2023.

Natural gas will continue to play a vital role in powering business and homes for the foreseeable future, thanks to its abundance and affordability. It is also the perfect partner for renewables, ready to fill in when wind and solar output dips. But to fully leverage natural gas, we need a permitting system that lets pipelines and storage facilities come online faster. Permitting reform is key to optimizing natural gas delivery and ensuring reliable, affordable energy when and where it’s needed.

The NPC report outlined several major pitfalls in the current permitting process that must be addressed:

Litigation Risk: Lengthy environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) leave projects incredibly vulnerable to lawsuits. On average, nearly one-third of projects which are mandated to perform an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) face a court challenge, with 90 percent of cases alleging a NEPA violation. Lawsuits delay projects by one to two years and can even take four years if appealed to circuit courts.

Convoluted Review: The current permitting framework is overly complex and project-specific, lacking standardization and the ability to expedite proposals. Developers must navigate a maze of agencies and reviews, often duplicating efforts. This process-heavy approach makes it difficult to advance even the most critical projects.

Slow (and Reversable) Approvals: The vast majority of EIS reviews take more than two years to complete, and that’s before accounting for multiagency permit sign-offs. This process can take four to five years not including litigation delays. Furthermore, even if a project is approved, its permit can be revoked on the basis of policy, meaning political changes can undo years of planning and investment.

Permitting review should focus on supporting businesses looking to build critical energy infrastructure in the United States, rather than hindering them with petty litigation, lengthy review processes, and convoluted standards.

To do this, the NPC recommends a massive permitting system overhaul, focused on standardizing and expediting the review process. In the near term, some pitfalls can be remedied by amending NEPA to focus on environmental impacts within its purview and reducing backlog in the judicial review process. In the long term, federal and state governments should shift from case-specific to standardized reviews that allow for expedited approval based on clearly articulated standards. Predictable permitting for routine oil and gas activities and expedited approval of electric power infrastructure development will be crucial to match increased energy demand.

As it stands, permitting review is needlessly convoluted and bogged down by political agenda. A standardized system would reorient development to focus on transparency and efficiency: giving America the tools it needs to maintain energy dominance and technological innovation.

The Way Forward

Fortunately, permitting reform has attracted many allies pushing hard for action in recent months. On top of the calls from business and industry groups this fall, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are actively pushing for permitting reform legislation— such as the SPEED Act— and Secretary Wrigth have welcomed the NPC’s recommendations, viewing them as a blueprint for constructive action. NPC Executive Director John Dabbar emphasized the collaborative nature of the report’s findings:

“These studies show what’s possible when industry, government and stakeholders work together to address complex energy challenges with facts and forward-looking solutions.”

The NPC report is an important step forward, shining a light on concrete actions that the federal government, lawmakers and individual agencies must take steps to address permitting inefficiencies.

Data proves that a strong majority of voters support updating the permitting process to speed up energy development. Not only does overhauling permitting have public support, but it is also the key to enhancing domestic infrastructure that can keep up with technological innovation and booming energy demand. A modernized permitting framework would enable critical projects such as pipelines, power plants, refineries, and LNG export terminals to be built in pace with demand, ensuring energy supply and maintaining U.S. global competitiveness.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EID-NPC-120825.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:04:20.609629

Of the 11.7 GW of total capacity added, utility-scale solar and battery storage accounted for 91% of the total, said a quarterly report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

Solar provided 6 GW, representing 51% of quarterly capacity additions. Energy storage capacity accounted for 4.7 GW resulting in 40% of additions for the quarter, said ACP.

Developers connected 5,932 MW of utility-scale solar capacity to the grid during the third quarter of 2025. Quarterly solar additions were 4% higher than the previous quarter. However, installations were about 5% lower than the third quarter of 2024, the report said.

The cumulative operational solar capacity in the U.S. reached 146,228 MW at the close of Q3 2025. This capacity delivers electricity to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The sector has maintained a high rate of construction, with developers connecting more than 71 GW of new capacity since the start of 2023.

The largest utility-scale solar project phase brought online in Q3 2025 was Excelsior Energy Capital’s Faraday B Solar. Located in Utah County, Utah, the project added 525 MW of generation capacity. The project features 1.2 million solar panels. Construction was completed in a period of under two years. This project alone contributed significantly to Utah joining the top ten states for clean power additions in the quarter.

Battery storage capacity surpassed 40 GW of operational capacity in Q3 2025. The quarter ended with a total operational capacity of 40,321 MW, corresponding to 112,002 MWh of energy storage.

Developers commissioned 50 new battery storage projects during the third quarter. These projects added 4,686 MW of new capacity to the grid. The addition of 4.7 GW established Q3 2025 as the strongest third-quarter on record for new storage capacity installations. It ranks as the second-largest quarter for new storage additions in U.S. history. Installations increased by 32% year-over-year compared to Q3 2024 installations.

The largest battery storage project to achieve commercial operation in Q3 was Enel Green Power North America’s 359 MW GulfStar Storage. The project is located in Wharton County, Texas. GulfStar Storage is co-located with a 450 MW solar phase, GulfStar Solar.

Texas remained the top state for clean power additions in Q3 2025. The state accounted for 39% of total added capacity in the U.S. during the quarter. The 63% growth in clean power capacity added by Texas in Q3 compared to Q2 was largely due to the increase in storage capacity, which the GulfStar Storage project contributed to.

The total clean power project pipeline reached186 GW at the close of Q3 2025. Battery storage and solar accounted for 90% of pipeline growth over the last year. Solar made up the largest share of the pipeline, accounting for 53% with nearly 100 GW of capacity under development.

The solar pipeline has grown at an average pace of 2% each quarter over the last two years. Battery storage represents the second largest share of the pipeline at 24% The storage pipeline contains over 45 GW of capacity.

The group says it views the proposal as an environmentally responsible and fiscally practical solution to Binghamton’s solid waste management challenges.

“Implementing a system that diverts food scraps and other organic materials from the landfill will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane, and extend the operational life of the county landfill, as well as reduce tipping fees for Binghamton,” the Sierra Club says.

The group added that the proposed three-stream approach, separating recyclables, compostables, and residential waste, aligns with guidance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and supports the intent of New York State’s Food Donation and Food Scraps Recycling Law.

According to the proposal filed with the Binghamton City council, the three-stream waste disposal system “provides the best solution to Binghamton’s blue bag concerns in an environmentally responsible way, addresses concerns raised by residents and financially benefitting both residents and the city.”

The proposed three-stream hybrid solid waste disposal solution would call for residents to use blue bags only for non-compostable waste in addition to the city addressing various issues of concern, recycling to remain as is and food scraps placed separately in a covered bin or a compostable bag.

In addition, garbage that does not fit in bags, like broken furniture, can be set out with or without stickers (as the council sees fit). The proposal notes that one of the reasons stickers were discontinued is because they were even less popular than the blue bags.

The news, of course, was not that Van Epps defeated Democrat Aftyn Behn, but that he only won by nine percentage points in a district that President Trump carried by 22 a year earlier.

You can read about the race here and here.

The Tennessee race, combined with last month’s elections in Virginia and New Jersey, have strengthened the Democrats’ belief they can take the House in 2026. (Democrats also did well in last month’s North Carolina municipal races.)

If Democrats can over-perform in Tennessee, can they flip a congressional seat in purpler North Carolina?

Let’s start with the state’s new congressional map, approved this year. The GOP further gerrymandered the map to bolster their chances of winning 11 of 14 seats instead of the 10 Republicans hold today.

The only changes were in the 1st and 3rd districts:

The Democrats now hold three safe seats: the 12th, 4th and 2nd. Don Davis also represents the 1st District in the northeast, but his district was redrawn this year and made more Republican. Despite the new map, he’s running for reelection.

Here are some of President Trump’s winning margins in 2024:

11th District (western NC/Asheville) Trump +9.5 (Republican Chuck Edwards)

1st District (northeastern NC/coast) Trump +11 (Democrat Don Davis in a redrawn district)

3rd District (Jacksonville) Trump +13 (Republican Greg Murphy)

7th District (Wilmington) Trump +14 (Republican David Rouzer)

14th District (west Mecklenburg/Gaston) Trump +15 (Republican Tim Moore)

Even before last week’s special election in Tennessee, national Democrats said they would invest in the 11th District, hoping to defeat Republican Chuck Edwards.

There are a few reasons for Democrats to have hope in the mountains.

The 2024 election represented a great year for Republicans. Almost every N.C. county shifted to the right compared to the 2020 election. But there were a few counties that bucked that trend, including three in the 11th: Henderson (suburban Asheville), Buncombe (Asheville) and Transylvania (Brevard).

Kamala Harris picked up about two percentage points more in each county compared to Joe Biden in 2020. Is that a sign of a real shift to the left?

Here is a New York Times map of the change in results from 2020 to 2024. Areas in blue didn’t necessarily vote for Harris, but they did become more Democratic:

The Democrats may have a good candidate in Jamie Ager. There are several people running in the March primary, but Ager is considered the leader.

His grandfather, Jamie Clarke, represented the district as a Democrat in Congress for three non-consecutive terms from 1983 to 1991. His father served in the state House, and his brother Eric Ager is currently a House member.

Moe Davis, who lost to Madison Cawthorn in 2020, left the race after a bitter dispute with party leaders about alleged favoritism toward Ager.

Finally, there is Hurricane Helene recovery. Are swing voters OK with the pace of reconstruction? Or do they punish Edwards and the GOP? President Trump named Republican U.S. Senate candidate Michael Whatley as the Helene “recovery czar” in January, and Democrats are going to hammer him for what they say is a lackluster recovery.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ca3e3d6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6016x3158+0+543/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwfae%2Ffiles%2F201904%2Fvoting_stock_photo.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 15:02:48.610811

He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.
“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said.
The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants.
That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.","CRAIG — The Cooper family knows how to work heavy machinery. The kids could run a hay baler by their early teens, and two of the three ran monster-sized drills at the coal mines along with their dad.

But learning to maneuver the shiny red drill they use to tap into underground heat feels different. It’s a critical part of the Colorado family’s new business, High Altitude Geothermal, which installs geothermal heat pumps that use the Earth’s constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. At stake is not just their livelihood but a century-long family legacy of producing energy in Moffat County.

Like many families in Craig, the Coopers have worked in coal for generations — and in oil before that. That’s ending for Matt Cooper and his son Matthew as one of three coal mines in the area closes in a statewide shift to cleaner energy.

“People have to start looking beyond coal,” said Matt Cooper. “And that can be a multitude of things. Our economy has been so focused on coal and coal-fired power plants. And we need the diversity.”

Many countries and about half of U.S. states are moving away from coal, citing environmental impacts and high costs. Burning coal emits carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

President Donald Trump has boosted coal as part of his agenda to promote fossil fuels. He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

That’s created uncertainty in places like Craig. As some families like the Coopers plan for the next stage of their careers, others hold out hope that Trump will save their plants, mines and high-paying jobs.

Matt and Matthew Cooper work at the Colowyo Mine near Meeker, though active mining has ended and site cleanup begins in January.

The mine employs about 130 workers and supplies Craig Generating Station, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired plant. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is planning to close Craig’s Unit 1 by year’s end for economic reasons and to meet legal requirements for reducing emissions. The other two units will close in 2028.

Xcel Energy owns coal-fired Hayden Station, about 30 minutes away. It said it doesn’t plan to change retirement dates for Hayden, though it’s extending another coal unit in Pueblo in part due to increased demand for electricity.

The Craig and Hayden plants together employ about 200 people.

Craig residents have always been entrepreneurial and that spirit will get them through this transition, said Kirstie McPherson, board president for the Craig Chamber of Commerce. Still, she said, just about everybody here is connected to coal.

“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said. “When that starts going away, beyond just the individuals that are having the identity crisis, you have an entire culture, an entire community that is also having that same crisis.”

Phasing out coal

Coal has been central to Colorado’s economy since before statehood, but it’s generally the most expensive energy on today’s grid, said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

“We are not going to let this administration drag us backwards into an overreliance on expensive fossil fuels,” Polis said in a statement.

Nationwide, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021, costing consumers $6.2 billion more, according to a June analysis from Energy Innovation. The nonpartisan think tank cited significant increases to run aging plants as well as inflation.

Colorado’s six remaining coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close or convert to natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal, by 2031. The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants. Renewable energy provides more than 40% of Colorado’s power now and will pass 70% by the end of the decade, according to statewide utility plans.

Nationwide, wind and solar growth has remained strong, producing more electricity than coal in 2025, as of the latest data in October, according to energy think tank Ember.

But some states want to increase or at least maintain coal production. That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.

Planning for the future

The Coopers have gone all-in on geothermal.

“Maybe we’ll never go back to coal,” Matt Cooper said. “We haven’t (gone) back to oil and gas, so we might just be geothermal people for quite some time, maybe generations, and then eventually something else will come along.”

While the Coopers were learning to use their drill in October, Wade Gerber was in downtown Craig distilling grain neutral spirits — used to make gin and vodka — on a day off from the Craig Station power plant. Gerber stepped over his corgis, Ali and Boss, and onto a stepladder to peer into a massive stainless steel pot where he was heating wheat and barley.

Gerber’s spent three decades in coal. When closure plans were announced four years ago, he, his wife Tenniel and their friend McPherson brainstormed business ideas.

“With my background in plumbing and electrical from the plant, it’s like, oh yeah, I can handle that part of it,” Gerber said about distilling. “This is the easy part.”

He used Tri-State’s education subsidies for classes in distilling, while other co-workers learned to fix vehicles or repair guns to find new careers. While some plan to leave town, Gerber is opening Bad Alibi Distillery. McPherson and Tenniel Gerber are opening a cocktail bar next door.

Everyone in town hopes Trump will step in to extend the plant’s life, Gerber said. Meanwhile, they’re trying to define a new future for Craig in a nerve-wracking time.

“For me, my products can go elsewhere. I don’t necessarily have to sell it in Craig, there’s that avenue. For someone relying on Craig, it’s even scarier,” he said.

Questioning the coal rollback

Tammy Villard owns a gift shop, Moffat Mercantile, with her husband. After the coal closures were announced, they opened a commercial print shop too, seeing it as a practical choice for when so many high-paying jobs go away.

Villard, who spent a decade at Colowyo as administrative staff, said she doesn’t understand how the state can throw the switch to turn off coal and still have reliable electricity. She wants the state to slow down.

Villard describes herself as a moderate Republican. She said political swings at the federal level — from the green energy push in the last administration to doubling down on fossil fuels in this one — aren’t helpful.

“The pendulum has to come back to the middle,” she said, “and we are so far out to either side that I don’t know how we get back to that middle.”

In the US, modernization of central utilities integrates workforce training and operational research, linking infrastructure investment to knowledge creation.","Across the world, the energy transition is reshaping the Industrial landscape determining where and how the next generation of infrastructure will emerge. Governments are setting net zero goals, industries are recalibrating around cleaner inputs, and investors are chasing technologies and regions best positioned to deliver. For companies that power, produce, and manufacture, the question is no longer if but how fast the transition will redefine their footprint—and where to invest next.

With global energy investment surpassing three trillion USD, two trillion of it in clean technologies and infrastructure, industrial developers and tenants are rethinking how facilities are planned and built to evolve as technologies mature. Sites must be flexible, resilient, low-carbon, and future-proof for new processes, products, and partnerships. From energy hubs to advanced manufacturing campuses, architecture and engineering help to define and critically enable industrial competitiveness.

Different Pathways, Shared Direction

In the UK, government policy and public and private investments are accelerating low-carbon transformation. Frameworks such as the Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy and Heat Network Transformation Programme are turning former industrial sites into low-carbon ecosystems. Our experience in consulting with one of Europe’s premier energy network and energy infrastructure leaders will result in two transformative, city-wide district heating systems, setting a new benchmark for sustainable urban energy. These energy centers are central to decarbonizing the large-scale heat networks and their ambitious net zero targets, translating policy ambition into built infrastructure—providing heating and cooling to a large portion of the city’s properties.

Canadian provinces are defining their own transition models. Alberta is leveraging its industrial base and infrastructure to pioneer clean hydrogen production, establish carbon-capture and storage hubs, and deploy modular clean-energy systems. Ontario is advancing electrification, grid modernization, and EV manufacturing, anchoring a corridor of innovation that connects utilities, manufacturers, and institutional users. Together, these efforts are reshaping Canada’s industrial landscape aligning investment, innovation, and infrastructure around a cleaner energy economy.

In the US, utilities and industrial operators are advancing clean-energy infrastructure through private investment. Companies in California have committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 and a climate-positive system by 2050, aligning corporate strategy with long-term resilience goals. Organizations are modernizing central utilities by uniting operational efficiency and resilience within an integrated, low-carbon design.

Different starting points, one shared direction: decarbonization and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions.

Urban-Integrated Energy Hubs: From Plant to Civic Asset

As compact, high-performance plants that distribute heat or power, urban energy centers are evolving from functional utilities into civic assets. They are now being designed as important landmarks integrated into the public realm. High-quality designs proudly demonstrating their positive, decarbonization values.

The UK embodies this shift. Borough councils are prioritizing new facilities that distribute low-carbon heat through rooftop air-source heat pumps, projected to cut emissions by more than 3,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually in a network’s first phase alone (equivalent to taking 2,000 cars off the road). Designed for tight urban sites, these energy centers balance technical precision with civic presence, integrating advanced systems within an architectural form that enhances its surroundings.

Design also activates impact at energy centers in retrofitted buildings. This approach preserves a building’s signature features while accommodating a new rooftop plant and acoustic screening. Air-source heat pumps are integrated into the existing facility, enabling measurable carbon savings while preserving the identity of an urban landmark.

Decarbonization, Efficiency, and Circular Energy Flows

Net zero requires more than cleaner fuels; it demands re-engineering how energy moves through systems. Circular energy models are creating closed loops where waste heat, renewables, and advanced controls work together to reduce demand and emissions.

The Bradford Energy Centre and regional data center show this integration in practice. The energy center generates hot water for the city’s district heating network. Adjacent to it, the data center captures waste heat from high-performance computing as heat energy to feed that network. It’s a symbiotic ecosystem linking digital and industrial infrastructure to decarbonize urban districts.

Beyond these new builds and energy or data centers, retrofit strategies are transforming other legacy assets. Modernized hospital systems are introducing low-carbon energy infrastructure even in remote island environments. In the Scotch whisky sector, distilleries integrating mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) technology now reuse process heat once lost to the atmosphere—an approach that is moving an energy-intensive industry toward lower-carbon production.

With integrated architectural and engineering design, efficiency is embedded from foundation to façade, reducing energy use, lowering emissions, and increasing resilience across the asset lifecycle.

Flexibility, Resilience, and Future-Proofing

Viability assessments, feasibility studies, and master plans are as critical to the energy transition as design. Technologies shift, markets adjust, and supply chains adapt, making flexibility a strategic advantage.

Our approach with energy centers incorporates water source heat pumps, electrolysis systems, and large-scale thermal storage in the design. Located at large power stations and manufacturing sites, the energy centers capture industrial waste heat from their cooling processes to provide heat, to support and further decarbonize the city-wide heat network.

The same principle is reshaping North America. For developers and operators, adaptable infrastructure hedges against both regulatory uncertainty and technological change, preserving asset value as markets evolve. Flexibility delivers continuity, resilience the return on investment.

Multi-Stakeholder and Community Value

Clean-energy infrastructure delivers more than carbon reduction. It creates shared civic and economic value. Collaboration across sectors is redefining how energy assets are financed, designed, and operated, reflecting the growing influence of ESG-driven investment priorities.

In the UK, operational energy plants merge with educational and exhibition spaces, connecting industrial innovation to workforce development and community engagement. Here, infrastructure inspires, informs, and strengthens regional economies—a growing priority for public funders and private investors.

Collaboration is also increasingly market driven. The path toward net zero and climate-positive goals includes partnerships with communities and suppliers to advance local resilience. In the US, modernization of central utilities integrates workforce training and operational research, linking infrastructure investment to knowledge creation.

Projects that deliver co-benefits (environmental, social, and economic) are not only more fundable, but they’re also more enduring. The infrastructure of transition succeeds when it serves both its operators and its communities.

Building the Infrastructure of Transition

Across regions, whether through retrofits that preserve identity or modular systems that scale with demand, design is both the expression and the engine of transition.

To make that transition real, our Industrial designers reflect occupancy behavior, schedules, and operating conditions to deliver systems that meet or exceed sustainability targets.",https://norr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IA-Clean-Energy-Infrastructure-Hero-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:02:42.892394

By Vallari Srivastava and Laila Kearney

Dec 8 (Reuters) - U.S. utility company NextEra Energy has expanded its partnership with Alphabet's Google Cloud to build new energy supplies for the company's operations across the U.S., the groups said on Monday.

NextEra and Google currently have ​3.5 gigawatts of electricity generation - enough to power about 2.5 million homes - in operation or contracted.

As part of the new deal, ‌the companies will develop multiple new large-scale data center campuses in the U.S. that will be built with new power plants. They did not specify how much extra capacity ‌would be added, or financial details of the agreement.

NextEra shares were down 1% by 1722 GMT, having risen in premarket trading.

The agreement comes as U.S. electricity demand reaches record highs from the proliferation of data centers needed to train and roll out artificial intelligence.

Without enough supplies readily available on the existing grid, giant technology companies are contracting to build new electricity sources to power their AI data center expansion.

""We are positioning our company around bring-your-own-generation, ⁠and we are uniquely positioned to win this,"" NextEra ‌CEO John Ketchum said at an investor conference.

NextEra and Google Cloud also plan to launch an AI-powered product by mid-2026 that will help manage work in the field, predicting energy equipment problems and other functions aimed at ‍increasing the reliability of the grid, the companies said.

NextEra said it expects to add 15 gigawatts, or possibly much more, of new power generation for data centers by 2035.

Also to serve that demand, NextEra will partner with ExxonMobil to develop natural-gas-fired power plants for data centers that use carbon capture technologies.

Plans with Exxon include ​an initial 1.2-gigawatt gas plant, which would be jointly marketed to data centers, that would be located near the oil major's carbon ‌dioxide-carrying pipeline in the Southeast U.S., NextEra said.

RENEWED INTEREST IN NUCLEAR POWER

In October, NextEra announced that it would restart its shut Duane Arnold nuclear power plant in Iowa to power Google data centers under a 25-year power purchase contract.

The technology industry's quest for massive amounts of electricity for AI processing has renewed interest in nuclear power supply, which includes restarting fully shut reactors, expanding the capacity of operating plants, and contracting for electricity from future small modular reactors.

That electricity demand has also propelled the development of natural-gas-fired power, which is quicker to build than nuclear, but ⁠produces global warming emissions.

NextEra said it expects to announce new natural-gas-fired power deals for ​data centers in 12–24 months.

NextEra said it had also signed 11 power purchase agreements ​and two energy storage agreements with Meta Platforms, totaling over 2.5 GW of energy contracts. The projects are scheduled to come online between 2026 and 2028.

The utility has also reached an agreement with WPPI Energy to continue supplying 168 ‍megawatts of the output from the ⁠Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Two Rivers into the 2050s.

NextEra forecast higher adjusted profit in 2026 as well as the current year as it continues to benefit from the power demand surge.

The company now expects adjusted earnings for 2025 of between $3.62 and $3.70 per ⁠share, compared with its prior view of between $3.45 and $3.70 per share.

For 2026, it expects adjusted profit between $3.92 and $4.02 per share, compared with its prior view of between $3.63 and $4.00 per ‌share.

The initiative will be carried out through the Center for Aquatic Technology Transfer, a Forest Service office in Blacksburg that focuses on aquatic ecosystem science and management in national forests.

Virginia Tech will lead the human resources component, hiring and training technicians and crew leaders to conduct fieldwork. With the ability to call on current graduate students as well as connections to alumni with experience conducting analysis in a forest environment, the university can rapidly contract 20 employees to form teams and begin critical data collection in early 2026.

The benefit to the university comes in the experience students receive in providing this vital field research.

“We facilitate the hiring process, and we also facilitate the science to allow all of our federal scientists to engage with the resources of the university, not only the people we work with at the Forest Service,” said Joel Snodgrass, head of the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation. “For the university, and especially for our students, we get this access to funding opportunities for experiential learning and opportunities for graduate student projects. It works a lot like most of the other embedded federal scientists that we have with us.”

Thousands of acres of national forest were damaged by Helene in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Most funding stems from damage in North Carolina, but the work spans the entire Southern Appalachian region.

The project aims to document, evaluate, and prioritize hurricane-related damage to aquatic and forest ecosystems. Field teams will assess entire watersheds, giving forest managers data to identify high-priority areas for remediation and plan interventions that restore ecological integrity, improve public safety, and support long-term forest health.

Colin Krause, a fisheries biologist at the Center for Aquatic Technology Transfer, said initial work will focus on North Carolina and Virginia.

“The teams are going to be focused initially on storm damage assessments, where the teams are able to walk the entire lengths of streams within watersheds, on Forest Service lands, trying to find out where these damaged feature locations are,” Krause said. “They're looking for damaged items. They're looking for sites that are damaged or under the threat of damage, such as things like ecological integrity and forest health, or things that might impact human life or health.”",https://news.vt.edu/content/news_vt_edu/en/articles/2025/12/cnre-heleneassessmentgrant/_jcr_content/image.transform/l-medium/image.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 14:02:35.087536

Major headaches.

The 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling inSackett v. EPA was supposed to make it easier for farmers and other landowners to navigate, no pun intended, Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) law. The 5-4 majority decision written by Justice Samuel A. Alito rejected the court’s tortured logic in Rapanos v. U.S. that left stakeholders without clarity in favor of something more straightforward:

“In sum, we hold that the [Clean Water Act] extends to only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are ‘waters of the United States’ in their own right,” so that they are ‘indistinguishable’ from those waters.”

There isn’t much wiggle room in Alito’s decision. Only wetlands that have a continuous and indistinguishable surface connection to a larger regulated body of water may be regulated by the CWA.

But that’s not how the Environmental Protection Agency sees it. Just ask Iowa landowner Dan Ward, who wanted to build a pond that would have torn up a farm ditch on his property. Under its amended WOTUS regulation in the wake of Sackett, EPA ruled Ward’s only-seasonally wet ditch qualified as a relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing body of water.

The goofy folk at EPA demanded Ward pay for an assessment. And an archaeology study. And a wildlife habitat study. And, oh yeah, submit a plan to restore or build a new stream of equal size to replace the farm ditch. That’s insane.

But now there’s a new proposal looking to conform Waters of the U.S. with the Sackett ruling; released last month, it provides fresh definitions for key terms including “relatively permanent”:

“In this proposal, the agencies define ‘relatively permanent’ to mean ‘standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year round or at least during the wet season.’ Consistent with the Sackett decision, ephemeral waters (i.e., those with surface water flowing or standing only in direct response to precipitation (e.g., rain or snow fall) ) are not jurisdictional because they are not relatively permanent.”

I imagine Ward is somewhere applauding a return to sanity.

But there’s more. The proposal also attempts to provide clarity to “continuous surface connection” language:

“In this proposal, however, the agencies would define ‘continuous surface connection’ for the first time to mean ‘having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.’ Thus, the agencies’ proposed definition of ‘continuous surface connection’ provides a two-prong test that requires both (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season.”

Certainly, agricultural interests must be heartened by EPA’s exclusions to “ditches dug in dry land regardless of flow,” prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems.

Environmental groups believe the WOTUS proposal is Armageddon. Just listen to Waterkeeper Alliance:

“By narrowing the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, this reinterpretation removes federal safeguards from many rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and other vital waterways. Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life.”

I’m not sure it’s all that. Generally speaking, I’m in favor of laws and regulations that everyone can wrap their heads around. Farmers shouldn’t have to hire a world-class law team to determine the legalities of digging a pond.

But you know as well as I, that whatever the EPA finally lands on in a final ruling sometime next year won’t be final. Not even close. If Democrats take back the White House in 2028, there will be another shiny new WOTUS proposal. Not to mention in the interim any number of lawsuits filed after EPA publishes WOTUS changes in the Federal Register.

What recent history has shown is that WOTUS regulations are temporal, amounting to a hamster spinning on its exercise wheel. A functioning Congress could codify WOTUS definitions. But it’s dysfunctional. Congress can’t even produce a federally-mandated new Farm Bill — instead relying on year-to-year extensions and, most recently, some updates Republicans snuck into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

None of this is lost on the nation’s farmers. Missouri Farm Bureau President Garrett Hawkins told EPA during a May listening session that “We’ve seen WOTUS definitions, guidance and legal arguments change with each administration” and that “farmers, land owners and small businesses are the ones who suffer the most when we don’t have clear rules.”

Unfortunately, EPA’s new WOTUS plan, no matter how well intended it might be, is at best a bandage for more systemic problems that can’t be solved with a rewrite. The feds have shown themselves incapable of reaching anything resembling a bipartisan solution. EPA says the new WOTUS plan inspires to give states a more significant role:

“This proposal recognizes that states and tribes know their local land and water resources best. The proposed definition of WOTUS protects water quality by affirming federal protections where appropriate and supporting the role of states and tribes as primary regulators managing their own land and water resources. Cooperative federalism has been a cornerstone of Clean Water Act implementation and the agency’s proposed WOTUS rule at last fulfills that commitment to real, shared federal and state responsibility.”

To that I say, we’ll see. It sounds noble, working together for the greater good. But it’s not outrageous to ask if EPA can actually deliver on that promise.

It makes me wonder if perhaps a better long-term solution is to turn over most of WOTUS regulation directly to state governments, and scale back the number of waterways and wetlands that fall under federal jurisdiction.

She added that testimony submitted to the USTR shows broad consensus among stakeholders, with most supporting a 16-year extension accompanied by targeted updates.","More than 500 US business, agricultural, and industrial organizations sent a letter to the US Trade Representative asking that USMCA remains in place as it is a foundation of North American competitiveness. They also stressed that any adjustments during the 2026 review should avoid jeopardizing economic integration with Mexico and Canada.

In their letter to Ambassador Jamieson Greer, the signatories acknowledged that some compliance issues remain but emphasize that the pact is still essential to the US economy. They highlight that the three-country partnership supports over 13 million US jobs and that Mexico and Canada continue to be the nation’s main export destinations.

They also emphasized that US manufacturers ship more goods to Canada and Mexico than to the next twelve markets combined, and that the two partners absorb one-third of all US agricultural exports. “ USMCA ensures that US manufacturers, farmers and service providers can continue to access the Canadian and Mexican markets.”

The message was endorsed by a wide coalition of national associations and state chambers representing manufacturing, agriculture, clean energy, transportation, technology, textiles, services and infrastructure.

USMCA Negotiation

The 2026 USMCA review will serve as a test of the region’s ability to coordinate policy and maintain economic cohesion. Under Art. 34.7 of the agreement, the three countries must decide in July 2026 whether to extend the agreement to 2042, keep it subject to annual reviews, or allow it to expire in 2036.

Wendy Cutler, Senior Vice President, Asia Society Policy Institute, described the USMCA review as an unprecedented phase for modern trade agreements. She noted that with three days of public hearings already underway, the process is set to become more dramatic once formal negotiations begin next year. Cutler highlighted that the review clause is unusual, challenging the conventional idea that trade agreements should last indefinitely.

She added that testimony submitted to the USTR shows broad consensus among stakeholders, with most supporting a 16-year extension accompanied by targeted updates. However, she warned of concerning signals from the United States, noting that the administration has hinted at the possibility of renegotiating separately with each neighbor or even withdrawing from the pact. Cutler urged business leaders to remain fully engaged, emphasizing that active participation is crucial to keeping the agreement effective and relevant.

Adrián González, President, Global Alliance Solutions, anticipates that Washington may adopt a high-pressure approach similar to former President Trump’s strategy, presenting a full list of demands alongside the threat of walking away. He suggested that a formal withdrawal notice could be used strategically to increase leverage before ultimately negotiating a resolution. “At the end of the day, we are going to keep USMCA,” he said, adding that Mexico likely willing to make concessions on issues such as China, regional security, and supply-chain integration.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/lucas-george-wendt-tOVt13dbLLY-unsplash.jpg?h=aecb35f5&itok=GNjSrm_R,N,,2025-12-08 17:01:32.030583

The national and state groups, including Greenpeace USA, Oil Change International, and the Nebraska-based Save Rural America, pointed to a number of harms associated with the expansion of data centers in places including rural Michigan, Wisconsin, and northern Virginia.
""The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate, and water security,"" the groups told Congress.
""We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment, and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.""
The groups noted that electricity costs have risen 21.3% since 2021, a rate that ""drastically"" outpaces inflation, driven by the ""rapid build-out of data centers.""","Environmental and economic justice advocates alike have been sounding the alarm for months regarding the Trump administration's push to built massive data centers to support artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency in communities across the United States—regardless of local opposition—and on Monday Congress heard from a coalition of more than 200 groups demanding action to stop what they called ""one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation.""

Led by Food and Water Watch (FWW), which originally demanded a moratorium on new AI data centers in October, more than 230 organizations have signed a letter warning that thus far, Congress has failed to take action to stop the rapid expansion despite the fact that ""the harms of data center growth are increasingly well-established, and they are massive.""

The national and state groups, including Greenpeace USA, Oil Change International, and the Nebraska-based Save Rural America, pointed to a number of harms associated with the expansion of data centers in places including rural Michigan, Wisconsin, and northern Virginia.

They warned that pushing the build-out onto communities—many of which have protested the approval of the centers to no avail—will lead to:

Enormous electricity consumption, with a tripling of data centers in the next five years projected to result in the facilities consuming as much electricity as about 30 million households;

Unsustainable water consumption, with those data centers requiring the amount of water normally used by 18.5 million households, just for cooling the computer servers;

The worsening of the climate emergency, with 56% of the energy used to power data centers sourced from planet-heating fossil fuels;

Surging electricity costs for people living in the vicinity of energy-sucking data centers; and

Skyrocketing job losses as half of all entry-level white-collar jobs are projected to become obsolete due to the growth of AI and companies' investments in the technology, even as corporations report they're not seeing a significant positive impact on their bottom lines.

""The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate, and water security,"" the groups told Congress. ""We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment, and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.""

The groups noted that electricity costs have risen 21.3% since 2021, a rate that ""drastically"" outpaces inflation, driven by the ""rapid build-out of data centers.""

As CNBC reported last month, residential utility bills rose 6% in August compared with last summer, and though price increases can be due to a host of reasons, electricity prices rose ""much faster than the national average"" this year in states with high concentrations of data centers. Consumers in Virginia paid 13% more, while those in Illinois paid 16% more and people in Ohio saw their costs go up 12%.

Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at FWW, told the Guardian that rising utility costs are driving much of the grassroots action against data centers in places like Wisconsin—where a woman was violently dragged out of a community meeting by police last week after speaking out against plans for a new facility in her town—and Tucson, Arizona, where residents successfully pushed the City Council this year to block a data center project linked to Amazon.

“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” Wurth told the Guardian. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water... We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”

Data center projects worth a total of $64 billion have been blocked or delayed in states including Texas, Oregon, and Tennessee, and Reuters reported last week that a sizable portion of the opposition is coming from parts of the country that heavily supported President Donald Trump in last year's election.

Hundreds of people attended a recent meeting in Montour County, Pennsylvania, where Trump won by 20 points last year, raising alarm over plans to rezone 1,300 acres for Talen Energy to build a data center.

While raising prices for households that are already coping with high grocery and healthcare bills, the unregulated growth in AI data centers is also expected to add up to 44 million tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in just the next five years—the equivalent of putting 10 million new fossil fuel-powered cars on the road at a time when planetary heating has already been linked to recent US weather disasters like Hurricane Helene and deadly heatwaves.

The groups appealed to Congress as Trump said he plans to sign an executive order preempting state-level AI regulations, saying that states, ""many of them bad actors,"" should not be ""involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS.”

Republicans in Congress have also recently suggested they could try to ban state-level AI regulations in the National Defense Authorization Act.

The Trump administration and its allies in the industry have issued warnings to communities that oppose the construction of AI data centers, with the White House's AI Action Plan demanding the fast-tracking of permits for building the facilities and former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) lobbying for the industry and recently telling local officials in Chandler, Arizona that ""federal preemption is coming"" and they must approve plans for a 20,000-square foot data center in the city.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62293769&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417,N,,2025-12-08 14:02:07.119639

Purdue University engineers and the Indiana Department of Transportation demonstrated wireless charging of an electric heavy-duty truck driving at highway speeds. This is the first time such a successful test has been accomplished in the U.S.

Engineers experimented on a 1/4-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 52/U.S. Highway 231 in West Lafayette, Indiana, near the university. Purdue’s system delivered 190 kilowatts of power to an electric semitractor as the vehicle was moving at 65 mph. “To put that in perspective, 200 kilowatts are on the scale of about a hundred homes,” said Steve Pekarek, a Purdie Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Charging EVs While Driving

Before the engineers at Purdue conducted their tests, the world’s first EV charging roadway was tested in France.

The “Charge as you drive” project, spearheaded by a consortium comprising VINCI Autoroutes, Electreon, VINCI Construction, Gustave Eiffel University, and Hutchinson, is testing a system that allows electric vehicles, ranging from heavy-duty trucks to passenger cars, to recharge directly from the road while in motion. This project was announced a few months ago, in October.

EV Charging Highway System

According to the engineers, the system is powered by magnetic transfer coils embedded in the pavement, which sends power to a single receiver coil assembly attached to the truck. Additionally, prioritizing high-power needs allows the system to support the lower power requirements of electric cars.

Aaron Brovont, a research assistant professor, said, “This is a system designed to work for the heaviest class of trucks all the way down to passenger vehicles.”

Ultimately, engineers believe the electrified highways could offer a solution to EV owners who are worried about the cost and “range anxiety.” If the road could charge the vehicle while driving, it would require a cost-effective and smaller battery. “A lot of that cost in electric vehicles is driven by the size of the battery packs,” said Purdue professor John Haddock. “With this system, you’d be able to drive your vehicle down the road, and it would charge the battery.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/U.S.-EV-Charging-Highway.png,N,,2025-12-08 13:04:18.543661

Additionally, as Congress is negotiating an extension of the enhanced PTCs, we urge you to reject any further attempts to restrict abortion coverage.
Any claims that additional restrictions on abortion coverage are needed to ensure that no federal funds are spent on abortion coverage are false.","On behalf of the National Women’s Law Center and 128 state and national organizations, we write to strongly urge you to pass a clean extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits (PTCs). It is imperative that Congress act without further delay—as insurers have already set premium rates for the upcoming year assuming the enhanced PTCs are expiring. The longer Congress waits, the harder it will be to offer relief to millions of Americans with skyrocketing premiums, with women and low- and middle-income people hit the hardest.

The enhanced PTCs, originally expanded under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and extended through 2025 in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, have made health coverage through the Marketplace more affordable and accessible than ever before. In 2025 we saw record-breaking Marketplace enrollment, with nearly 12.7 million women enrolled, a 95% increase in women’s enrollment since 2021. Ninety-two percent of all 2025 Marketplace enrollees received PTCs, with an estimated nearly 11.7 million women receiving PTCs to help pay for their health insurance premiums. Resulting in premium payments being cut by an estimated 44% ($705 annually) for enrollees receiving PTCs.

If these enhanced PTCs expire, the health and economic consequences will be devastating to women and low- and middle-income people. It is expected that Marketplace out-of-pocket premiums will skyrocket by over 75% if the enhanced PTCs expire:

Average net premiums will be more than four times higher ($919 versus $169) for people with subsidized Marketplace coverage and incomes below 250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL);

Net premiums will more than double, from $1,171 to $2,455, for those with incomes between 250% and 400% of the FPL.

Adults aged 50 to 64 are projected to see even higher premium increases, with annual premium spikes between $599 and $4,574.

These premium increases will undoubtedly compound existing barriers to affordable health care coverage for women, particularly women of color, and low- and middle-income people. Millions of people will be priced out of coverage and be at increased risk for uninsurance, negating monumental gains made in reducing uninsurance since the enactment of enhanced PTCs in 2021. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that failing to extend the enhanced PTCs will result in 4.2 million more uninsured people by 2034. An estimated nearly 2.2 million of those 4.2 million would be women and over 3.1 million would be people of color. This is in addition to the 10 million people who stand to lose their health coverage due to H.R. 1 (OBBBA), according to CBO.

Women and low- and middle-income people already face significant challenges affording health insurance and health care-related expenses. Unaffordable health care costs force people with fewer financial resources to delay or forgo critical care, exacerbating existing health disparities. Uninsured women are less likely than those with coverage to have consistent access to care and to receive essential preventive services, such as cancer screenings. Gaps in such care are particularly harmful for women, particularly women of color who already experience high rates of chronic conditions.

Additionally, as Congress is negotiating an extension of the enhanced PTCs, we urge you to reject any further attempts to restrict abortion coverage. Any such attempts would ultimately amount to a thinly-veiled effort to derail negotiations over these essential tax credits. Cost is a major factor in whether people are able to access the abortion care they seek, and often insurance coverage is the difference between a person getting the care they need and being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. Any claims that additional restrictions on abortion coverage are needed to ensure that no federal funds are spent on abortion coverage are false. The ACA already treats abortion different from other health care services; it explicitly prohibits federal funds from being used to pay for abortion coverage in Marketplace plans, with limited exceptions for cases of life endangerment, rape, and incest. Any attempt to further restrict coverage for abortion care in ACA Marketplace plans will ultimately deny people the freedom to make the best decisions for their bodies, lives, and futures.

Congress must extend the enhanced PTCs before the end of the year, or millions of women and low- and middle-income people’s health and financial wellbeing will bear the brunt of drastically higher premiums that will follow. It is critical that Congress act swiftly to preserve enhanced PTCs and ensure the millions of women and low- and middle-income people who rely on these PTCs continue to have access to affordable and comprehensive health coverage.

Last week, a Congressional hearing titled “Making health care affordable again: Healing a broken system,” placed affordability at the center of the national health care debate. Lawmakers, industry leaders and patient advocates gathered to address the urgent challenges facing millions of Americans—chief among them, the looming expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits and the broader need for systemic reform.

The ACA fundamentally reshaped U.S. health coverage by making premiums more affordable for millions through advance premium tax credits (APTCs). Enhanced APTCs, introduced under the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress intervenes. This policy crossroads carries enormous implications for consumers, insurers and health care providers.

Renewing these credits could cost an estimated $350 billion over the next decade, but letting them lapse risks a surge in uninsured rates and premium spikes. Nearly 24 million people are enrolled in ACA marketplace plans in 2025, double the number in 2020, and 93% rely on APTCs to keep coverage affordable. If enhanced credits disappear, affordability could collapse for millions, especially those with lower incomes.

Enhanced APTCs work by sending government payments directly to insurance companies to lower monthly premiums for eligible households, but insurers themselves set the underlying premium rates. As the enhanced credits expire, costs for many will spike as families lose subsidy support. And, regardless of the credits, premiums are rising sharply: insurers project an 18% increase for 2025, driven by inflation, labor costs, expensive drugs, and a shifting risk pool as healthier enrollees exit the exchanges.

For providers, the ripple effects could be profound. Hospitals and health systems, especially those serving rural areas, could see higher uncompensated care, deteriorating payer mix and rising bad debt as more patients lose coverage. Operational pressures will intensify as patient volumes shift unpredictably, compounded by broader policy changes like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

What should providers do?

Health systems should strengthen enrollment assistance, advocate for state-level safety nets, monitor financial indicators and invest in community partnerships to address social determinants of health. Strategic planning and nimble adaptation are essential as the policy landscape evolves.

Last week’s hearings underscore the complexity of U.S. health care, where rising premiums, inflation and labor pressures collide with consumer expectations for access and affordability.

While South Bay waits for an answer, one thing is clear: People are living with a gas problem.
Gas levels peaked for minutes at a time at 4,500 parts per billion between Sept. 5 and Sept. 9 of last year.","The toxic gas turns its victims’ blood green by chemically altering proteins. Hundreds of millions of years ago, after volcanic eruptions destroyed oxygen in the world’s oceans, bacteria took over and transferred so much of this lethal gas into the air that almost everything on the planet died.

But it’s also something the human body produces. This gas relaxes blood vessels, which is partly why scientists think it could cure erectile dysfunction or aid in slowing down bodily functions to keep someone alive.

Two molecules of hydrogen bound to one of sulfur create hydrogen sulfide gas, a stinky vapor that wafts from sewer grates, swamps and oil refineries. Decomposing organic matter release its widely identifiable odor of rotten eggs — the scent of death.

People living next to the sewage-polluted Tijuana River knew it well, but not by name.

That changed last summer when scientists and local politicians called the news media to a press conference and revealed hydrogen sulfide gas was spewing from the river water at alarming amounts.

The “toxic soup,” emanating from pollution that spills over the U.S.-Mexico border via the river “impacts people for miles,” claimed atmospheric chemist Kim Prather from the University of California-San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography on X back in September of 2024.

She discovered a gas “hot spot,” where the riverine waters tumble from a few concrete pipes. Whatever’s in the water mixes with the atmosphere. Air samples taken by her team showed hydrogen sulfide would, at times, reach concentrations almost 100 times above what California’s air quality standards say is OK.

Prather called it a crisis, perhaps, worse than the infamous case of drinking water contamination in Flint, Michigan. The news inspired panic. San Diego County’s public health department sent their HAZMAT crews to investigate. Some South Bay schools cancelled outdoor activities.

County politicians and public health officials sowed confusion by attempting to debunk the scientists’ claims. And all the while, reporters struggled to understand the science of hydrogen sulfide in real time.

When should the presence of hydrogen sulfide trigger emergency actions like closing outdoor activities at schools? Was it even safe to breathe in South Bay?

Since then, the county installed hydrogen sulfide-sniffing monitors in Tijuana River-adjacent communities. They’ve quietly been recording gas levels for the past year. Occasionally, usually overnight when Mexico’s wastewater is flowing over the border, the gas concentrations climb high enough to trigger an odor warning from air quality regulators, the San Diego Air Pollution Control District.

“The problem here is this is not just an odor,” said Richard Gersberg, a now retired professor at San Diego State University who studied how chemicals and other pollutants pose risks to human health. “This is a health risk. And there’s health effects at levels perhaps well below where people can smell it.”

A Voice of San Diego analysis of the Air Pollution Control District’s data shows South Bay’s hydrogen sulfide have stayed far below what Prather and her team detected last September. Even those concentrations wouldn’t instantly kill anyone – which hydrogen sulfide is more famously known to do.

But the data shows that, on average, San Diegans from San Ysidro to Imperial Beach are breathing levels of the gas the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says would cause harm to a person’s health in the long run.

More science is needed to definitively link the presence of this gas to South Bay residents’ current health issues.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control rolled into South Bay a month after the hydrogen sulfide scare to take stock of residents’ health concerns. They talked to about 200 families, and 40 percent listed air quality as their greatest concern.

“Many describe unpleasant odors and perceive the air quality as poor because of the contamination,” the CDC wrote in its final report. “Residents also report increased health concerns (including GI and respiratory issues), although there is limited evidence from syndromic surveillance.”

The Air Pollution Control District continues to record gas levels but refers all of its data to state and federal agencies. They’ll make the call on what to do to protect public health, not us, the district spokesperson said.

While South Bay waits for an answer, one thing is clear: People are living with a gas problem.

Steady Stream of Gas in South Bay

Following the revelations of the scientists last summer, the San Diego Air Pollution Control District set up three hydrogen sulfide monitors in South Bay: one at Berry Elementary School in Nestor and nearest to Prather’s riverine “hot spot;” another on a fire station in San Ysidro and another on the Imperial Beach Civic Center.

Voice of San Diego calculated how much hydrogen sulfide gas those monitors picked up on average each month from all the readings taken since last summer.

The results paint a grim picture for San Diegans living nearby.

At Berry Elementary School, hydrogen sulfide stayed at an unsafe level, above what the EPA warns could cause long term health problems, for almost a full year — from October 2024 to September 2025.

At the other two locations – San Ysidro and Imperial Beach – hydrogen sulfide rarely fell to a safe concentration.

“That does indicate a risk existed chronically,” said Gersberg. “A risk which may have been both unappreciated and uncontrolled by both local and state regulators.”

Nora Hernandez lives with it every day at her home near Berry Elementary School which three of her children attend. Two of her children have asthma and all three have complained of body aches which no doctor, she says, can explain.

“It almost always smells bad,” Hernandez said. “But what are we supposed to do? It’s coming from another country but it’s affecting us here.”

Antonio Cuevas lives across the street from Berry Elementary with his partner and two daughters who go to school there. They also smell the river’s stink daily and have to close their windows and run fans during hot days with little wind, which causes the smell to intensify. When the smell becomes unbearable, they sometimes sit in their car or drive to a shopping mall, he said.

“We’re thinking of moving somewhere else, maybe Chula Vista,” Cuevas said. “We cannot stay here.”

The South Bay Union School District purchased and installed over 400 air purifiers in Berry Elementary classrooms and office spaces in response to last fall’s gas scare, confirmed Amy Cooper, executive assistant to the superintendent.

The district keeps tabs on gas levels recorded by the monitor attached to the school building. If concentrations are elevated, Cooper wrote, the school moves children to an indoor “rainy day” schedule and runs air purifiers in all indoor spaces to improve air quality.

“We are doing everything possible to protect students and staff from any potential elevation in those levels,” Cooper wrote.

San Diego Air Pollution Control District’s community hydrogen sulfide guidance recommends school activities remain indoors when concentrations reach 30 hydrogen sulfide particles in 1 billion particles of air. That’s only happened once or twice this past school year because most gas levels spike overnight, Cooper wrote. But there have been several close calls when levels dropped rapidly around 6 a.m. just before the school day began.

But there’s wide disagreement among air quality and public health regulators over what amount of hydrogen sulfide should be tolerated. To some, the local air regulators’ guidance is, well, misguided.

Hard to Say How Hydrogen Sulfide Impacts Health

If you ask Gersberg, nobody was – or is – assessing the risk of the Tijuana River’s airborne pollution properly.

“The only way to really ask, is this causing health effects, is to do a risk assessment,” Gersberg said.

That’s done by monitoring the exposed population over a long period of time through an epidemiological study, which can take years and millions of dollars to complete. (San Diego County Supervisor Paloma Aguirre, the former mayor of polluted Imperial Beach, is pursuing money to do just that.)

The next best thing is to look at the county’s gas data and compare it to what Gersberg referred to as “the bible”: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Integrated Risk Information System. The EPA says if out of one billion particles of air, 1.4 of them are hydrogen sulfide, then prolonged exposure to that air – many weeks to months – could make someone sick.

This guideline is based on scientists exposing rats to hydrogen sulfide for six hours a day for 10 weeks. Those rats developed lesions in their nostrils. Few scientific studies, beyond the rat tests, have shown what could happen to the human body under such low-level gas exposure conditions over months to a year.

The residents of Rotorua, New Zealand, living near geothermal pools along a volcanic fault zone are a rare case of a population living under the constant fog of hydrogen sulfide. Scientists discovered more Roturans live with cardiovascular diseases compared to other New Zealanders. But they couldn’t pin the cause on the gas. The data didn’t accurately account for the residents’ socioeconomic status or whether they also smoked.

How H2S Can Kill

When there’s a whole lot of hydrogen sulfide in an enclosed or confined space, the gas can kill a person pretty quickly. It’s called “knock down.” The gas paralyzes the nerve in the nose that allows us to smell its signature rotten egg scent, robbing its victims of the main warning sign that it’s there at all.

Knock down happens when the gas reaches 500,000 parts per billion or more. It’s what scientists call “acute” exposure.

People have died within minutes from a single, large and concentrated exposure to the gas — even just one breath. The respiratory system shuts down or seizes; skin turns a bruised color at the lips, ears or fingernails. Some people have involuntary muscle convulsions that look like seizures, the heart can stop and the gas can send people into a coma.

Workers have died instantly from the gas after falling through a manhole into the sewer. Farm workers almost died after walking into a tank filled with pig manure. These dramatic deaths from mostly job-related exposures to a lot of the gas all at once are what color its reputation. It’s what most scientists study or what people in public health or emergency response know more about.

Even so, it took a while for the U.S. government to take hydrogen sulfide seriously.

Congress removed hydrogen sulfide from the EPA’s list of hazardous air pollutants (toxins that can cause death or serious, irreversible illness from routine exposure) in the early 1990s under pressure from the oil and gas industry, one of the largest man-made sources of the gas. Regulators slowly began compiling evidence on its toxicity after the rat study. ExxonMobil did its own in 2015 which showed low levels of the gas were associated with breathing impairment, eye and neurological effects.

Still, hydrogen sulfide isn’t officially considered a pollutant the federal government requires industries to manage. Low levels of hydrogen sulfide from typical emitters – refineries, confined animal feeding operations or CAFOS, and landfills – mix with other contaminants in the air. So it’s hard for scientists to isolate whether hydrogen sulfide is the culprit for a specific health problem, researchers say.

Even NASA isn’t totally sure how much hydrogen sulfide is safe for astronaut exposure. For its upcoming missions to the moon, NASA worries hydrogen sulfide trapped in moon rock ice taken from the lunar surface might sublime – turn from a solid to a gas – and release inside the spaceship. Almost all of the agency’s Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations for 24-hour to 180-day crew exposure to the gas during the upcoming Artemis III mission to send humans to the unexplored South Pole are based on those same rat studies.

“Spaceflight presents a unique environment…continuous exposure for limited duration (seven days to six months), (in a) completely enclosed environment and lack of escape, emphasizing the need for Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations to be established for standard spaceflight duration exposures to hydrogen sulfide,” NASA’s 2024 report on the matter reads.

At the Tijuana River “hot spot” where Prather was testing, the levels of hydrogen sulfide never reached a concentration that could cause sudden death or “knock-down.” State officials poo-pooed her alarms last fall.

“Hydrogen sulfide levels would have to be much higher (5,000 parts per billion or more) to expect widespread health impacts,” Amy MacPherson, a CARB, spokesperson told Voice of San Diego, referring to the levels Prather found.

Prather persisted.

“It’s really important to listen to the community. So many eye, ear, nose, throat infections… skin infections… heart and lung issues, mental issues, the list goes on,” she told Voice in an email.

Prather published her hydrogen sulfide data from the fall of 2024 in the journal Science. Gas levels peaked for minutes at a time at 4,500 parts per billion between Sept. 5 and Sept. 9 of last year. At least once, the gas reached an average hourly peak of around 2,100 parts per billion. That’s 70 times higher than the California Ambient Air Quality Standards say is detectable by the human nose.

But those high levels of gas production by the Tijuana River pollution didn’t last. By Sept. 11, spills into the river and, therefore, its flows, dramatically halted.

Since the installation of the San Diego Air Pollution Control District’s monitors shortly thereafter, hydrogen sulfide concentrations haven’t risen beyond around 500 parts per billion.

Still, Gersberg agrees with Prather: That doesn’t mean people aren’t getting sick.

“If the data continues like it did last summer, I wouldn’t want to live there and I certainly wouldn’t want my kids going to school there,” Gersberg said.",https://voiceofsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/San-Ysidro_0028.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 13:03:23.745600

Angeleno Group currently has 12 active investments across three funds within its portfolio.
Two decades ago, Angeleno Group was an idea born in the shadows of one crisis after another: the dot-com bust, 9/11 and California’s electricity meltdown, which became so severe that it led to the recall of Gov.
It “(was) the future of the sector … innovation technology, what was then called alternative energy,” Weiss said.
Angeleno Group is “exceedingly good at what they do,” said Sir Andrew Steer, a prominent climate expert and economist who was knighted for his contributions to sustainable development.","On an unseasonably warm Friday afternoon, Daniel Weiss and Yaniv Tepper gathered in a temporary Beverly Hills office. They instantly began reminiscing, walking through their years in a comfortable cadence – even ending each other’s sentences.

The two founders kicked off the chat by discussing their days as college roommates, heading out on separate yet similar career paths, and then reuniting in 2001 to launch and build one of the first clean-energy and climate-focused venture capital and growth equity investment firms: the Angeleno Group.

Together, it’s a journey that still surprises them even today.

“It’s been extraordinary,” said Weiss, co-founder and managing partner. “From what was really kind of a non-institutional area of investing 20-plus years ago, this has become one of the largest and fastest growing areas of venture investing in the world today.”

And “we’re kind of the oldest, deepest, most experienced firm in the space,” Tepper, co-founder and managing partner, chimed in – not as a boast but as a reminder of what time can do: crystallize a conviction.

Angeleno Group, founded in what they call “the white space” of clean-energy investing, is today a pillar of climate financing. In more than two decades, Tepper and Weiss’ firm has invested in nearly 40 companies and has led or co-led funding totaling about $3 billion. Angeleno Group currently has 12 active investments across three funds within its portfolio.

For Tepper and Weiss, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

The green investment boom continues to soar, driven by global urgency and trillions of dollars targeting decarbonization. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that global investment in renewable energy reached a record $386 billion in the first half of this year, up 10% from the previous first half of 2024.

That demand comes amid growing political challenges to climate change policy – including the U.S.’ withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, which celebrated its 10th year since enactment in 2015. At the start of the year, President Donald Trump signed executive orders altering energy production regulations. Then, he followed up with a new tax law – under his One Big Beautiful Bill Act – that rolled back many clean energy tax credits and imposed new restrictions.

Even with the brewing political headwinds, Weiss and Tepper remain optimistic about the market for clean energy and climate solutions. Achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 alone will require significant investment to address the economic and social shifts. Citing 2022 estimates from McKinsey, global investment may reach $9.2 trillion over the upcoming decades.

“The climate clock is ticking loudly,” Tepper said. “Given the fires that we’ve had, the unexpected economic rise post (the Covid-19 pandemic), a little bit of retrenchment that’s been happening, we don’t have 15 years to get it right,” Tepper said.

He added that the outlook to reach net-zero emissions in the next 25 years is a great objective to have in place – “But really, the next five years are the most critical in the history of climate (and renewable energy) investing.”

‘The white space’

Tepper and Weiss know firsthand the importance of timing within an evolving market.

Two decades ago, Angeleno Group was an idea born in the shadows of one crisis after another: the dot-com bust, 9/11 and California’s electricity meltdown, which became so severe that it led to the recall of Gov. Gray Davis. Enron Corp. had collapsed. Oil was trading at an average of above $20 a barrel. And the phrase “clean energy” was barely in the investment lexicon.

Most would’ve walked the other way. Weiss and Tepper – whose careers were steeped in energy, policy and finance – chose to walk straight into the fray.

“Energy and technology,” Tepper said, “probably didn’t exist together much.”

Energy was still the realm of utilities, refineries and pipelines, while technology was dedicated to dot-com startups – no one connected combustion with computing.

And no one saw the opportunity in the disarray – well, no one except for Weiss and Tepper.

“We really ought to have our heads examined,” quipped Weiss, laughing lightly at the memory of those early days.

But he swiftly acknowledged the seriousness of the early 2000s. The energy crisis had exposed the fragility of the grid; climate science was mounting; decades of innovations in computing and sensors were suddenly colliding with a century-old energy system.

He explained that on one end of the investing spectrum, private equity players were buying up hard assets such as power plants, drilling rigs, pipelines and the like. On the other end, hedge funds were “investing in commodity price arbitrage, in oil and natural gas.”

That middle inflection point – the so-called “white space” of that barbell – was the key spot that sparked their interest.

It “(was) the future of the sector … innovation technology, what was then called alternative energy,” Weiss said. “Who was going to invest in the future of transforming this important part of our global economy?”

Weiss said that they saw an opportunity and believed that investing in “sustainability could be good business. … so we set out to found a firm to invest against that white space, to invest in the next generation of sustainable technology companies that touch and help foster climate solutions.”

L.A. by design

Choosing Los Angeles as home for their investment firm was just as intentional. Aside from the fact that both were native Angelenos, thus the firm’s name.

“We were starting an investment firm in a city that was not known for its (venture capital) ecosystem,” Weiss said.

However, the two added that L.A. had something that Silicon Valley didn’t have – a convergence of engineering talent, aerospace know-how, global trade infrastructure through its two ports, its manufacturing footprint, and a deep understanding of solar and wind systems.

“L.A. is kind of natural, frankly, to have an industrial clean-energy practice come out of it,” said Tepper.

In the beginning, as investors, they considered themselves “more stage-agnostic” – investing in everything from early-stage venture capital to buyout deals.

Over the two decades, they honed their focus on “growth equity” and on companies ready to scale. These are ventures with proven technologies and early revenue – a company, in short, that’s at a turning point, with commercial breakthroughs, national expansions, strategic acquisitions and global partnerships.

“We’re in the scaling business,” said Tepper.

Their early discipline – sticking to industrial, clear energy and climate solutions – became their edge as the market matured and soon accelerated. The economics of the industry soon became a turning point, catching up to their hypotheses.

Solar costs collapsed by more than 90%. Wind fell by over 70%. Batteries followed similar cost curves.

“The costs came down by orders of magnitude,” Tepper said. “Demand inflected up.”

Climate tech venture investment alone soared between 2010 and 2022 – dramatically rising from nearly $2 billion to a peak of more than $70 billion by the end of 2022, according to HolonIQ, a New York-based data marketing intelligence platform.

Three key business traits

Angeleno Group now has seven focus areas: “clean energy transitions,” “next generation energy storage,” “resource efficiency,” “critical infrastructure and resiliency,” “industrial energy efficiency and digital manufacturing,” “carbon mitigation and climate adaptation,” and “sustainable mobility and smart cities.”

Weiss said they’ve built and defined their firm via three key traits in those early years and even today – “intellectual curiosity, humility and collaboration.”

John Payne, chief executive at Phoenix, Arizona-based Kinematics Manufacturing Inc., echoed that sentiment.

“Words like partnership and collaboration get thrown about a lot in industries … but with Angeleno, it genuinely does feel like a partnership,” said Payne. “I feel like I am standing shoulder to shoulder with these guys and we are 100% aligned on what we’re trying to do.”

Angeleno has owned a stake in Kinematics since 2014. With that backing, the developer and manufacturer of intelligent motion control systems for mission-critical applications has been able to strategically expand its business, Payne said.

That includes executing its first acquisition last year, when it purchased P4Q, a Spanish company specializing in electronics manufacturing for solar tracking controllers. Kinematics closed the deal in February.

“It was a big step forward for all of us,” Payne said. “But I think it epitomizes the way Angeleno thinks – they’re prepared to take calculated risks to really grow, (and) they’re looking at building sustainable, long-term value.”

Heavyweight network

Since its inception, Angeleno Group estimates that its portfolio companies have increased in value by $10 billion under its ownership. And they’ve generated $22 billion in cumulative revenues.

The firm also estimates that its portfolio companies have displaced 3 billion metric tons of carbon and added about 17,500 green-collar jobs. It also notes that five of their companies have won the Nobel Prize and that their portfolio companies have received about 1,000 patents.

Angeleno Group is “exceedingly good at what they do,” said Sir Andrew Steer, a prominent climate expert and economist who was knighted for his contributions to sustainable development. “They’ve got a track record … and they invest in a way that combines sort of looking at the long term but also recognizing the near-term issues …they’re deeply analytical, but they’re bold in the best sense of the word.”

Steer, who most recently served as the founding president and chief executive of the Bezos Earth Fund, is the most recent addition to the firm’s cadre of policy experts and thinkers on Angeleno Group’s board of advisers.

He joined a star roster including former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen; former Secretary of Energy and M.I.T. physicist Ernest Moniz; Nobel laureate and Alphabet Inc. board member Frances Arnold; and Laura Tyson, economist and former dean at U.C. Berkeley’s Haas School of Business.

All of those on the board are looking to the future of renewable energy and finding attainable solutions. Steer, who currently serves as a distinguished professor at Georgetown University and the London School of Economics, sees this as an excellent opportunity for clean energy and climate tech investment, even amid political disruptions.

“It’s paradoxically a very good time to invest,” as valuations of companies decline, Steer said, especially “given the abolition of some of the subsidies that (former President Joe Biden) put in place.”

A long road

Tepper and Weiss couldn’t agree more: this is a pivotal moment for their firm and the industry as a whole. The advisory board and the “combined perspectives underscore the seriousness of the work and the scale of the moment,” Tepper said.

But as they’ve done for two decades, they will continue to focus on the future – especially given the ongoing growth of the renewable energy market globally, coupled with the advent of rapidly emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.

The economic case for renewable energy once again outweighs the geopolitical conflicts.

Weiss noted that to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, “a number of third-party analysts put the capital spend at around $250 trillion … we will need to mobilize a massive amount of climate finance to get anywhere close to that number.”

What’s more, over the last 10 years, the two noted that there’s “a garden of innovation” in clean energy and climate-related companies – many of which Tepper said “have gone into the growth stage” right now.

“Deal flow is up, valuations are down,” Weiss added. “That is an attractive recipe for investors, and we’re seeing that today on an unprecedented scale.”",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/yaniv-tepper-and-daniel-weiss-angeleno-group-co-founders-and-managing-partners_54835074553_o.jpeg,N,,2025-12-08 15:02:04.250991

U.S. President Donald Trump was asked yesterday while speaking to reporters outside the Kennedy Center Honors gala in Washington, whether he would resume trade talks with Canada which he had halted earlier in the year. He responded non-committal at first with phrases like “we’ll see,” but then added optimistically: “We’ll work it out.” He described a recent meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney (and Mexico’s leader) as “very good, very productive,” and emphasized having a strong relationship with both Canada and Carney, despite calling Canadians “very tough traders” and noting that Canada produces many goods the U.S. already makes. Trump also made a light-hearted remark praising Canada’s ice hockey prowess.

This comes amid ongoing U.S.-Canada trade tensions in 2025, including earlier tariff disputes and suspended negotiations originally triggered by an Ontario ad criticizing tariffs. Trump’s comments suggest a willingness to resolve issues without immediate escalation, though no firm commitment to restart formal talks was made. Think of what you’re saying. You can get it wrong and still you think that it’s alright. We can work it out.

At the same time demand from China is improving. According to data released by the General Administration of Customs on Monday, China’s crude oil imports climbed by 4.88% year-over-year in November, with daily import volumes reaching their highest point since August 2023. Compared to October, imports increased by 5.24%, totaling 50.89 million metric tons, or about 12.38 million barrels per day (bpd). Kpler data indicates that imports from Saudi Arabia and Iran rose compared to October, while shipments from Russia declined.

Bloomberg reports that the Trump Administration will announce a $12 billion farm aid package to help farmers affected by tariffs and falling crop prices. The package includes up to $11 billion in one-time payments through the Department of Agriculture’s Farmer Bridge Assistance program, responding to farmer frustration over slow Chinese purchases following recent tariff disputes.

Oil prices weakened somewhat this morning, largely due to rising temperatures and ongoing uncertainty about the peace talks between the United States, Russia, and Ukraine. President Trump expressed mild disappointment with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but the market appears less worried about further supply disruptions, as reports indicate that no Russian oil infrastructure was damaged over the weekend.

Natural gas prices dipped due to an anticipated short-term temperature rise, but predictions for later in the month remain very cold.

Fox Weather reports that temperatures are starting to return to normal this weekend after millions of Americans felt the brunt of the extreme chill on Friday before another blast of arctic air rolls through the Northern Tier of the U.S. in the early part of next week. Temperatures from the Midwest to the Interstate 95 corridor on Thursday and Friday were some of the lowest seen so far this season, with nearly 80 record-low temperatures set between the two days. Another round of frigid air is on the way, especially for Americans in the Great Lakes and Northeast starting Monday and lasting through Wednesday.

Fox Weather also reports that another quick-hitting winter storm is brewing over the mid-Atlantic, just a few days after places in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia saw their first snow of the season, in what has been an active start to meteorological winter across the country. Snow and sleet are ongoing across southern Virginia and West Virginia and will spread over northern North Carolina through Monday, as a fast-moving storm system slides off the East Coast, taking advantage of arctic air in the region.

In addition, sleet along the rain-snow line made for a slick Monday morning commute, particularly for drivers traveling on Interstates 26, 65, 77 and 81. Some places, particularly in the western North Carolina mountains, were not cold enough for snow Monday morning, leading to cold rain and sleet, which can be more hazardous than snow for drivers. Meanwhile, snow will replace rain by midday across southern Virginia and northern North Carolina. People in Raleigh should expect at least a coating to an inch of snow, and those in Asheville will likely see some snow accumulation, with more snow farther north into the Blue Ridge Mountains.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 14:02:43.202075

Nebraska and Oklahoma Utilities Create Great Plains New Nuclear Consortium

Four utilities in Nebraska and Oklahoma have created a new consortium to examine the feasibility and potential for advanced nuclear energy in the region. While Nebraska has one nuclear plant and reactor, the state and utilities in the state have indicated interest in nuclear development and taken steps to examine potential sites for a new plant. While Oklahoma does not currently have a nuclear plant and largely uses natural gas and renewables for electricity. Initially, the agreement will explore deploying 1,000 to 2,000 megawatts of nuclear technology. According to the recent press release on the consortium, each utility will fund its own early-stage work but plans to leverage work across the group to reduce costs, share expertise, and meet demand across the two states.

The new Great Plains New Nuclear Consortium includes:

Nebraska Public Power District

Omaha Public Power District

The decision to repeal the limits on oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a pivotal moment in U.S. energy policy.","In a move that has reignited debates about energy and environmental priorities, the U.S. Congress voted to repeal a Biden-era policy that limited oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). This decision has significant implications for environmental preservation and energy development. The Arctic refuge, home to diverse wildlife and fragile ecosystems, has long been at the center of a tug-of-war between economic interests and environmental conservation. This recent legislative action, passed with a narrow Senate vote of 49-45, underscores the complexity and contentiousness of balancing economic growth with ecological responsibility.

The Legislative Shift: A Political Balancing Act

The recent congressional vote marks a significant shift in U.S. energy policy, effectively overturning a rule from the Department of the Interior that restricted leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The resolution needed a simple majority to pass, and it did so with a 49-45 vote. Notably, one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, sided with Democrats to oppose the resolution, highlighting the nuanced political landscape surrounding this issue. This decision aligns with former President Donald Trump’s agenda to expand domestic energy production, a stance that contrasts sharply with the Biden administration’s focus on environmental protection.

The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a 1.56-million-acre expanse on Alaska’s coastal plain, known for its pristine environment and rich biodiversity. Proponents of drilling argue that it could lead to job creation and increased revenue, particularly for local communities and tribal corporations. However, conservationists warn that such development could irreversibly damage delicate ecosystems and disrupt the habitat of numerous species. The legislative decision thus reflects broader ideological differences regarding the balance between economic development and environmental stewardship.

Economic Implications and Local Perspectives

The potential economic benefits of oil and gas development in the Arctic are substantial. Proponents argue that opening up the refuge for drilling could lead to significant job creation and boost the local economy. For many in Alaska, particularly tribal corporations and local businesses, the promise of increased revenue and employment opportunities is compelling. These economic incentives are crucial for a state that relies heavily on the oil and gas industry for its financial well-being.

However, this potential economic boon is not without its critics. Opponents, including numerous environmental groups, argue that the long-term ecological costs outweigh the short-term economic gains. They caution that drilling could lead to environmental degradation, affecting wildlife and the broader ecosystem. The debate is further complicated by the views of Indigenous communities, who are divided on the issue. While some see development as a path to economic empowerment, others fear it will compromise their traditional way of life and the land they consider sacred.

US Drillers Add Rigs Again: What This Growing Trend Means for Energy Markets and Local Communities

Environmental Concerns and Conservation Efforts

Environmentalists are deeply concerned about the potential impact of oil and gas development on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The region is home to a wide range of wildlife, including polar bears, caribou, and migratory birds. The introduction of industrial activities could disrupt these species’ habitats, leading to long-term ecological consequences. Conservationists argue that the Arctic refuge represents one of the last untouched wilderness areas in the United States, and they view its preservation as a moral and ecological imperative.

Efforts to protect the refuge have been ongoing for decades, with numerous legal and political battles fought over its future. The recent legislative decision to open it up for drilling is seen by many environmental groups as a setback. They argue that such actions undermine global conservation efforts and are inconsistent with the growing recognition of the need for sustainable and responsible environmental stewardship. This decision could also have broader implications for U.S. environmental policy, potentially setting a precedent for future decisions regarding protected lands.

The Future of U.S. Energy Policy

The repeal of the Biden-era limits on oil and gas development in the Arctic refuge raises critical questions about the future direction of U.S. energy policy. It highlights the ongoing tension between efforts to promote energy independence and the need to address climate change. As the country grapples with these competing priorities, the decision underscores the challenges of crafting a coherent energy strategy that balances economic, environmental, and social considerations.

This legislative shift may also influence future political debates and policy decisions. It reflects broader trends in U.S. politics, where energy policy remains a deeply divisive issue. As the nation moves forward, the challenge will be to find a path that accommodates economic growth while ensuring environmental sustainability. The decision to allow drilling in the Arctic refuge is a reminder of the complex and often contentious nature of these discussions.

The decision to repeal the limits on oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a pivotal moment in U.S. energy policy. It raises important questions about the balance between economic growth and environmental preservation. As the implications of this decision unfold, the nation faces a critical juncture: how can it reconcile these competing interests to create a sustainable and prosperous future?

Kia To America: No EV5 For You!

Recently, we reported that Kia has decided not to bring its EV4 sedan — a car that is a contender for Car Of The Year honors in Europe — to America, largely because of new tariffs on cars manufactured in South Korea imposed by the current US administration. A spokesperson for the company told the press last month, “As market conditions for EVs have changed, the release of the upcoming EV4 electric sedan will be delayed until further notice.”

In a recent press release, Kia announced pricing and the “start of online reservations for the highly anticipated Kia EV5, giving Canadians their first opportunity to order the new all-electric SUV. Exclusive to Canada for the North American market, the EV5 enters the largest vehicle segment in Canada and is the first of three affordable EVs arriving in Canada in 2026.”

Elias El-Achhab, the chief operating officer for Kia Canada, said, “The Kia EV5 is available in nine different trims, providing Canadians with plenty of options that meet a variety of preferences. Competing in the largest SUV segment in Canada as a dedicated EV, the EV5 truly is the revolution of the family SUV perfect for empowering modern families with all the technology and convenience they require.”

According to Electrive, the EV5 will start at CAD$50,662 (US$36,700) for the Light with a single motor driving the front wheels and a 60 kWh battery pack. The top of the line all-wheel drive GT-Line Limited with an 81 kWh battery will list for CAD 62,162 (US$43,600) Do you know anyone in the US who might want a fully optioned AWD midsize SUV for $43,600? Yeah, we bet you do! The car will also come standard with the NACS charging port. Here is a link to the Kia configurator for Canada for those who want to know more about prices.

Production of the Canadian-market EV5 will take place at Kia Autoland Gwangju in South Korea and begin with Wind FWD and GT-Line Limited AWD trims. The entry level Light FWD model will become available in Canada in late 2026. Kia expects to publish official range estimates early next year. The company says the EV5 will be the first of three affordable models it will introduce in Canada in the next year.

Canada has also suggested it may end the current 100% tariff on Chinese-made cars soon and replace it with something similar to the tariff structure used by the EU. Between Kia and China, Canada may soon be a Mecca for compelling electric cars that Americans are prohibited from owning, thanks to MAGA.

Scout Motors To Build Mostly Plug-in Vehicles

Bloomberg reports that Scout Motors now says most of its vehicles — which were supposed to herald a transition by Volkswagen Group to battery-electric vehicles for US customers — will be mostly plug-in hybrid vehicles. The company says nearly 80% of its pre-orders are for the PHEV version of the cars.

“The market clearly has spoken, without a doubt, and they like the EREV technology full stop,” Scott Keogh, Scout’s chief executive officer, said in an interview, noting that the hybrid can travel 500 miles on a combination of electricity and a tank of gas. “This is EV without the drama.”

Specs regarding battery and engine size as well as range have not been made official as of yet, although there are hints the battery-only Scouts will have an EPA range of 350 miles while the PHEV is said to be capable of traveling 600 miles without stopping — which is a beautiful thing if your bladder has similar endurance.

Volkswagen Group acquired Scout Motors when it purchased Navistar in 2021. Navistar was the successor to International Harvester, which debuted the Scout brand in 1960. Scouts were tough, rugged vehicles that aspired to capture some of the allure of the original Jeeps. In 1966, Ford introduced its Bronco, another “drive it through the mud, then hose it out” off-roader in the days when drivers still had to get out and manually engage the front hubs.

Decades later, Ford reintroduced the Bronco in updated form and it has been a sales success. Volkswagen saw what Ford did and thought it could get a piece of the action by creating new Scout products. Like Rivian, the Scout line-up included both a pickup truck and an SUV. Volkswagen thinks Scout may be the way for it to expand its market share in the US, where its current models account for about 5% of sales.

Scott Keogh, who used to be the head of Volkswagen of America, is undaunted by the shift in political winds in the US. He said the company will not reduce the current suggested starting price for Scout vehicles to make up for the repeal of the federal EV tax credit. “I will not take $7,500 off the price of the car,” Keogh said. “And frankly, I don’t think we need to.”

Scout has received more than 130,000 non-binding reservations over the past year. Of those, about three-quarters have been for the SUV, while just one quarter have been for the pickup truck. In fact, with sales of electric pickup trucks mostly disappointing and other US manufacturers such as Ford, GM, and Stellantis scaling back or canceling their plans to bring battery-powered pickups to market, Keogh says he is not ruling out doing the same. “Certainly, that’s something we could look at, but we’re not making that decision now.”

He pointed out that the Scout vehicles will compete in market segments that account for about 40% of profits in US new vehicle sales. “[Volkswagen Group] can plant a brand right in the heart of the US profit pool,” Keogh said. “Regardless of party, I think Americans do want things made in America. These segments are strongly dominated by a ‘Buy American’ mentality.”

Audi Production Is A Possibility

There is a possibility that the new $2 billion assembly plant in South Carolina could also build one or more Audi models alongside the Scout vehicles. Audi’s CEO said recently the brand is considering an SUV tailored to American tastes based in part on the platform being created for Scout.

That would make Audi more competitive, since locally produced vehicles would avoid some of the tariffs cars imported from Germany have to pay. “We are capable of making products for other brands, so the platform is capable and the factory is capable,” Keogh said. “But I have actually nothing to confirm on Audi. Audi can give you that answer.”

A cynical person might suggest this whole Scout adventure might collapse in on itself much as Tesla’s Cybertruck business did, in which case that spiffy new factory in South Carolina just might become a manufacturing hub for Audi. And if that happens, maybe Porsche might want to get in on the fun, since US sales account for a large portion of its business and they have dropped dramatically because of the tariff wars initiated by the current administration. Fortunately, there are no such cynical people here at CleanTechnica global headquarters.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kia-EV5.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:04:53.653091

Morgan Lewis partner Duke McCall provides additional insights on the Proposed Rule in the Law360 article Trump Admin May Be Overpromising WOTUS Clarity.","The recently proposed rule aims to align the definition of WOTUS with the US Supreme Court’s seminal decision in Sackett v. EPA in a manner that limits waters subject to federal regulation.

On November 20, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a Proposed Rule that once again revises the regulatory definition of “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act). The Proposed Rule, which would revise the “Conforming Rule” the Biden administration adopted after the US Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, seeks to (1) define key phrases articulated by the Court in its seminal Sackett decision, (2) further define certain regulatory exemptions to the waters covered by the Act, and (3) implement additional conforming changes.

It does so to “fully implement the direction provided by [the Court in Sackett],” to provide clarity to the regulated community, and to shift further responsibility to states and tribes to manage local water resources. However, like every effort to define the scope of WOTUS, it leaves some questions unanswered and will undoubtedly be the subject of litigation.

BACKGROUND

The CWA covers all “navigable waters,” which it defines only as “the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” This ambiguous definition of those waters covered by the CWA has long fueled an ever-shifting litigation and regulatory landscape as to the extent of the federal government’s reach in regulating the nation’s waters, resulting in four separate Supreme Court opinions and numerous sets of regulations from EPA and the Corps, grappling with the question of what non-traditional navigable waters constitute “waters of the United States.”

In 2023, the Supreme Court sought to resolve this question, holding that “waters of the United States” include only those relatively permanent, standing, or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographic[al] features that are described in ordinary parlance as “streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes” and “those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are ‘waters of the United States’ in their own right.” 598 U.S. ___, Slip Op. at 14, 27 (2023).

Following the Sackett decision, the Biden EPA promulgated a new Conforming Rule without notice-and-comment that it stated was intended to implement the Sackett decision. Many in the regulated community criticized the Conforming Rule as failing to fully implement the Sackett decision. The Proposed Rule seeks to do so and proposes additional revisions to clarify and limit those waters covered by the CWA.

KEY DEFINITIONAL CHANGES

The Proposed Rule defines two key phrases from the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett—“continuous surface connection” and “relatively permanent”—and further defines “tributaries” to clarify that the requirement of relatively permanent flow extends to tributaries as well as wetlands, which were the focus of the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett.

Relatively Permanent: Under the Proposed Rule, “relatively permanent” means “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.” This definition applies to tributaries, adjacent wetlands, as well as lakes and ponds. The “wet season” language, which imposes a temporal requirement to the jurisdictional test, is variably defined according to region and ecotype and proposes the use of existing agency tools and to define the wet season based on rates of precipitation versus evaporation in a water body. To be considered “relatively permanent,” water must flow or stand throughout the wet season. Intermittent flow during the wet season, even with consistent flow outside of the wet season, forecloses a water body from the “relatively permanent” definition.

Continuous surface connection: Under the Proposed Rule, a continuous surface connection exists if there is “surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.” This language calls for a two-pronged test: abutment of a jurisdictional water and presence of surface water during the wet season. According to the EPA, this limits the scope of jurisdictional wetlands to only those portions that have surface water that abuts or touches a jurisdictional water during the wet season.

Tributaries: The Proposed Rule also redefines tributaries as “bod[ies] of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.” The tributary must be connected to a downstream jurisdictional water by a feature that conveys relatively permanent flow, but such connection can be non-jurisdictional, and may include man-made streams, ditches, canals, and other man-made or man-altered connections.

CHANGES TO EXEMPTIONS

Under current regulations, there are eight exemptions to the definition of WOTUS: (1) waste treatment systems, including those designed to meet CWA requirements, (2) prior converted cropland, (3) ditches excavated wholly in and draining only dry land with no relatively permanent flow, (4) artificially irrigated areas, (5) artificial lakes or ponds created by excavating or diking dry land to collect and retain water, (6) artificial reflecting pools or swimming pools or other small ornamental, (7) waterfilled depressions created in dry land incidental to construction activity, and (8) swales and erosional features with low volume or intermittent flow.

The Proposed Rule further defines three exemptions for waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and ditches, and provides an additional exclusion related to groundwater:

Waste water systems: Under the Proposed Rule, the definition of “waste treatment systems” is expanded to include “all components of a waste treatment system,” including “lagoons and treatment ponds (such as settling or cooling ponds), designed to either convey or retain, concentrate, settle, reduce, or remove pollutants, either actively or passively, from wastewater prior to discharge (or eliminating any such discharge).”

Prior Converted Cropland: The Proposed Rule specifies that the prior converted cropland exclusion does not apply to abandoned cropland or cropland that is not used for agricultural purposes at least once in the five years immediately preceding the determination. Agricultural uses can include various conservation uses, and federal field staff may consult private or public sources if the proposed list of agricultural uses is ambiguous. If the abandoned cropland is converted back to wetlands, it can only be considered jurisdictional if the resulting wetland satisfies the jurisdictional test.

Ditches: The Proposed Rule clarifies that non-navigable ditches constructed or excavated “entirely in dry land” and not carrying a relatively permanent flow are not jurisdictional waters. However, ditches that connect to or relocate jurisdictional tributaries maintain their status if the tributary also continues to meet the regulatory definition of a jurisdictional tributary.

New Groundwater Exception: The Proposed Rule states that groundwater, which is by nature not navigable, does not qualify as jurisdictional waters. However, subsurface groundwater that emerges and becomes baseflow in a relatively permanent stream continues to be subject to federal jurisdiction if it otherwise meets the requirements of a WOTUS.

OTHER REVISIONS

Interstate Waters

The Proposed Rule removes “interstate waters” from the list of jurisdictional waters to clarify that a water body that crosses state boundaries but otherwise does not qualify as a WOTUS is not covered by the CWA simply because it crosses a state line.

Mosaic and Permafrost Wetlands

Currently, broad wetlands possessing various hydrologically connected wetland segments constitute a single wetland. Under the Proposed Rule, mosaic wetlands are restricted to the individual segments. The EPA and the Army Corps are also mulling the adoption of a definition of a wetland that excludes certain permafrost wetlands.

IMPLICATIONS

The Proposed Rule is intended to provide further clarity and ease certain regulatory and compliance burdens for projects impacting jurisdictional waters, including projects requiring Section 404 permits and 401 water quality certifications under the Clean Water Act. At the same time, its impact is likely to be incremental when compared to the significant regulatory changes that were already necessitated by the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision.

And, as with all attempts to define Waters of the United States, areas of uncertainty remain due to the inherent difficulty of providing a single regulatory definition that is applicable to infinitely varied and ever-changing bodies of water across the country. As just one example, the proposed rule specifies that a continuous surface connection must be present “at least during the wet season,” and it in turn provides a definition of “wet season.” But precisely how one determines the beginning and ending of the “wet season” is a complex question in practice that will vary in different locations and could even change over time. Further, like other WOTUS rules, the Proposed Rule is almost certain to be subject to legal challenges when it is finalized. Interested stakeholders who are likely to challenge a final rule include environmental groups, other public interest non-governmental organizations, and state attorneys general.

The Proposed Rule is open to comments until January 5, 2026. Morgan Lewis partner Duke McCall provides additional insights on the Proposed Rule in the Law360 article Trump Admin May Be Overpromising WOTUS Clarity.

Regional Review is a year-end series from caa that looks at key developments in a focused industry throughout the year and sets the stage for what’s to come in the near term.

December 2025 — Pittsburgh’s energy sector closed 2025 during one of the most significant shifts in U.S. power demand in almost two decades. National electricity consumption rose an estimated 4% year-over-year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration — the fastest annual increase since 2006.

Join us at the Invest: Pittsburgh 3rd Edition Leadership Summit! This premier event brings together hundreds of Pittsburgh’s business and regional leaders to discuss the challenges and opportunities for businesses and investors. Buy your ticket now!

The acceleration was largely driven by AI and digital infrastructure needs. S&P Global Commodity Insights projected a 22% jump in data-center electricity demand in 2025 alone.

Western Pennsylvania’s energy mix — abundant natural gas, a dense network of legacy pipelines, and a nationally recognized engineering talent pool — allowed Pittsburgh to position itself as a resilient, flexible power hub in a period of rising strain on the national grid.

“The unique aspect of our region is that there is a tremendous amount of natural gas production in the same footprint that is served by Peoples,” said Michael Huwar, president of Peoples Natural Gas. “We pass those savings on to customers while investing in modernization that keeps service safe, reliable and more sustainable.”

Peoples Natural Gas advanced one of the largest infrastructure revitalization efforts in the Northeast this year. In 2025, the utility replaced over 250 miles of aging pipeline and added approximately 75 miles of new mainline to support growing residential and industrial demand. Its 18-county service footprint sits directly atop prolific Marcellus Shale output, allowing the region’s natural gas to trade at about $1 below the national benchmark. Peoples’ cost advantage is directly reinvested into system upgrades.

As Huwar emphasized, “This also allows Peoples to invest into modernization efforts that help keep service safe and reliable while increasing the sustainability of our footprint and our system with minimal impact to the customers that we serve.”

Modernization and resilience under pressure

The rise of AI-driven computing is reshaping electricity demand across the country. A recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global data center electricity consumption will more than double by 2030, driven by rapid growth in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and digital infrastructure. This global trend is already influencing regional planning.

In Pittsburgh, utilities and grid operators are preparing for a new generation of power-intensive facilities, prompting long-term capacity upgrades, substation reinforcement, and system hardening to support the digital economy’s expanding footprint.

Sargent Electric Company remained deeply embedded in these modernization efforts.

“In the medium to long term, the biggest drivers for our growth are data centers and the rise of artificial intelligence,” said Rob Smith, CEO of Sargent Electric Company. “When we talk about data centers, we are also highly focused on the new power plants and sources required to support them.”

For Mike Brady, vice president of power generation execution at Liberty Energy, AI marks a fundamental shift in what the grid must be prepared to deliver. “We aren’t just trying to solve today’s problem; we are trying to solve generational challenges,” Brady said, noting that natural gas will remain essential for fast, flexible and low-latency power.

The industry, Brady added, is still at the very beginning of the curve. “We’re only scratching the surface of new possibilities in AI. The energy needed for the computing power, without latency issues, is enormous,” said Brady.

The opportunity for Pittsburgh extends beyond meeting rising demand and into shaping the foundation of the emerging AI economy. “Our goal is to use natural gas to improve the lives of people, create jobs and provide cleaner solutions,” said Brady, adding that powering AI-driven data centers is “one of the most exciting things” they are involved in.

Reclaiming global position

One of the most consequential energy trends of 2025 was the renewed rise of nuclear power. As a recent Goldman Sachs analysis highlights, accelerating AI adoption and the rapid build-out of data centers are reshaping global electricity demand, and meeting this surge could require 85–90 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity worldwide, underscoring why reliable, 24/7 baseload generation is becoming central to national energy strategies.

“In my 40-plus years in the nuclear business, I have never before witnessed such a pronounced need for nuclear power,” said Jacques Besnainou, chief commercial officer of Westinghouse Electric Company to Invest:.

Pittsburgh, the historic birthplace of commercial nuclear power, is once again at the center. The AP1000 reactor — designed in Cranberry and operating successfully in Georgia and China — is now slated for expansion. Federal policymakers signaled support for 10 new AP1000 large modular reactors to begin U.S. construction before 2030.

Westinghouse estimates that this nuclear buildout, coupled with global projects in Poland, Bulgaria and eventually Ukraine, could generate 15,000 new jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania over the next several years.",https://capitalanalyticsassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Pittburgh.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:03:14.193069

Lights, wipers, tires, that one mystery sound you hope no one hears.

Starting Dec. 1, 2025, drivers in North Carolina will have one less inspection hurdle to deal with: window tint is no longer checked during the state inspection process.

That does not mean it’s a free-for-all for blackout tint, though, because the legal limits still apply.

It also means traffic stops may feel a little different, since drivers with tinted windows now have to roll down the window when an officer approaches. If you live anywhere from New Bern to the mountains, the takeaway is the same: easier inspection day, but you still need to stay within the tint rules.

What changed in North Carolina’s window tint inspection rules on Dec. 1, 2025?

Starting Monday, Dec. 1, North Carolina drivers no longer have their window tint checked during state inspections under Senate Bill 43, according to the report from New Bern.

The owner of Craven Tire & Automotive Repair told WITN he supports the shift, saying tint checks were not really a roadworthiness issue for inspections.

The bill text itself describes the change as removing the safety inspection of tinted windows and adding a rule about lowering a tinted window when law enforcement approaches, with an effective date of Dec. 1, 2025.

Does this new law let you choose any window tint you want?

No. A vehicle’s tint percentage must be no darker than 32%. NCDMV’s guidance uses the same cutoff, stating tinted windows cannot measure darker than 32% light transmission using a North Carolina-approved window tint meter (basically, the device used to measure how much light gets through the glass).

The same NCDMV page also spells out a common gotcha on the front windshield: tint cannot extend more than 5 inches below the top of the windshield or below the AS1 line, whichever is longer (the AS1 line is the marking many windshields have near the top showing where factory tinting ends).

And while the page lists multiple exceptions for certain vehicle types and for windows behind the driver on some multipurpose vehicles like SUVs and pickups, the safest assumption for most drivers is still to keep your tint within the stated meter limit unless you know your vehicle qualifies for an exception.

What do drivers have to do during traffic stops if their windows are tinted?

The bill text says the driver of a vehicle with tinted windows must roll down the driver-side window when a law enforcement officer approaches, and if the officer approaches from the passenger side, the driver must roll down the passenger window. The report from New Bern also highlights the same rule as part of the new law.

The practical reason is simple: visibility. WITN reports that the New Bern Police Department’s traffic enforcement unit described the change as a safety measure for both the officer and the people inside the vehicle. And even though inspections won’t include tint checks anymore, law enforcement can still stop and test window tint, and if the tint is too dark, officers can still enforce its removal.

How can North Carolina drivers stay compliant?

Passing an inspection will no longer be sufficient to prove your tint is legal. So if your tint is borderline, you do not want your first measurement to happen on the shoulder of the road.

Here are practical steps drivers can take right now, based on what state guidance and the Dec. 1 changes require:

If you have after-factory tint, make sure it is not darker than 32% on a state-approved tint meter.

Keep your windshield tint within the allowed strip (no more than 5 inches below the top or below the AS1 line, whichever is longer).

If you have a medical exception, keep the permit with the vehicle and make sure the medical exception sticker is correctly displayed in the lower left corner of the rear window.

During any traffic stop, roll down the window on the side the officer approaches.

If you are unsure whether your vehicle type has different rules for windows behind the driver, check NCDMV’s exception categories before assuming you are covered.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/the-law-changing-how-your-car-inspected-has-come-into-effect.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 12:03:11.670936

Where mitigation is installed, prepare an operation, maintenance and monitoring plan that ties system performance metrics to the site-specific AF.","Vapor intrusion occurs when volatile chemicals in soil gas migrate into buildings and affect indoor air. California’s multiagency supplemental guidance on the subject uses attenuation factors, or AFs, to translate subsurface concentrations into predicted indoor air concentrations.

An AF of 0.03 assumes 3% of the contaminant in subslab or nearsource soil gas reaches indoor air. If subslab soil gas is 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter, the default predicts 30 μg/m³ indoors, often above typical screening targets.

When applied to remedy selection, the default can outpace the actual risk shown by building-specific data.

This article has two aims. On policy, it argues for keeping 0.03 as a screening value while centering cleanup on risk-based, site-specific AFs. On practice, it outlines steps regulated businesses, developers and lenders can take while the workshop process unfolds.

At the California Environmental Protection Agency’s July 24 kickoff workshop, CalEPA staff announced a series of additional public workshops, from September of this year through February 2026, to gather feedback and explain how California will evaluate vapor intrusion beyond initial screening.

The series, a follow-on to the agency’s February 2023 supplemental guidance and staff training, gives agencies a window to assess whether 0.03 should remain a screening value, and how California-specific, risk-based AFs might inform cleanup and closure. The State Water Board is compiling GeoTracker submittals to support this work.

Timing and Resourcing

A California-specific AF database may be years away. Submissions vary by contaminant, building type, sampling method and quality, and agencies must standardize and analyze them before statewide statistics become defensible.

CalEPA may not yet have a dedicated team or budget to process all GeoTracker vapor data. Even given sufficient staffing, the process of filtering outliers, treating nondetects, pairing samples, and stratifying by foundation and pathway conditions will take years.

Given these constraints, it makes sense for 0.03 to remain the screening factor, with site-specific AFs guiding cleanup.

In the interim, projects can improve the dataset by using consistent sampling rounds, documenting building pressure conditions, and reporting detection limits and qualifiers, so that future statewide analyses can separate method artifacts from actual concentration patterns.

Evidence

The national dataset behind 0.03 reflects colder climates, more basements and building stock that isn’t typical of California.

In-state compilations — hundreds to thousands of paired indoor-air and subslab or soil-gas samples from commercial, light industrial and residential buildings — show attenuation in the 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁴ range, with 95th-percentile values below 0.03.

A California empirical study by Rafat Abbasi and colleagues, published in 2022 and based on about 600 paired measurements from 32 sites, reported a 95th-percentile subslab-to-indoor AF of 0.005. Together, these data indicate that 0.03 is conservative for many California buildings.

In practice, the difference is material. For the same 1,000 μg/m³ subslab concentration, a 0.03 AF predicts 30 μg/m³ indoors, while a site-specific AF of 0.005 predicts 5 μg/m³. That shift often marks the boundary between requiring active mitigation as a remedy and confirming mitigation as a protective design choice.

Regulatory Posture

CalEPA must align vapor intrusion reviews across the Department of Toxic Substances Control, the State Water Resources Control Board, regional water boards across the state, and local programs, and stay consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s framework.

The EPA still treats 0.03 as an appropriate screening factor. Moving ahead of that structure before California’s database is complete and peer reviewed could invite challenges to the administrative record.

Retaining a conservative screen at the front end also serves a technical purpose. Even with conservative inputs, Johnson and Ettinger modeling, introduced in 1991, doesn’t always capture preferential utility pathways, intermittent depressurization or older slabs. A single screening value keeps potential outliers in the evaluation set while data remain limited.

These institutional and technical considerations explain why 0.03 remains the default screen. They also suggest that the most durable near-term change is not a new statewide number, but better documentation of site-specific AFs in individual decision files.

Practice Drift

The issue lies in letting the screen define the remedy, not in the conservative screen itself.

Some reviewers and counterparties treat 0.03 as a cleanup endpoint, fixing conservative assumptions in land-use approvals, closure targets and transactional terms.

That practice can divert resources to address modeled risk that building data don’t substantiate, and can delay infill projects that otherwise could proceed with engineered controls and monitoring tied to actual indoor-air conditions.

A Measured Path: Policy and Practice

The near-term policy course is to state plainly in guidance and case files that 0.03 is a screening value. Where building data exist, agencies should identify and document the sitespecific AF that will govern remedy selection and closure, rather than allow the default screen to migrate into an endpoint.

For regulated parties, the practical path is to build the record needed to support a site-specific AF.

After direct indoor-air measurements, a defined exposure pathway, control of preferential pathways, and a mitigation design that meets California standards, sponsors should use paired data and transparent Johnson and Ettinger model runs to justify a lower AF that reflects building conditions.

In that setting, continued reliance on 0.03 as the endpoint doesn’t provide added health protection.

Sponsors should also address indoor background and source apportionment in their files, so the record distinguishes ambient or tenant-related contributors from vapor intrusion.

Where This Is Headed

For redevelopment, developers should design vapor intrusion mitigation systems into new buildings at affected sites.

After occupancy, verify performance with seasonal, colocated indoor-air and subslab sampling. Use those results to establish the building-specific AF that will set operation, monitoring and contingency triggers.

For existing buildings, pair remediation with seasonal paired sampling. Combine results with Johnson and Ettinger modeling and the conceptual site model to establish a site-specific AF that sets risk-based cleanup and, when appropriate, closure.

Document inputs, assumptions and data quality so reviewers can rely on the number.

Where mitigation is installed, prepare an operation, maintenance and monitoring plan that ties system performance metrics to the site-specific AF. This linkage allows adjustments without reopening endpoint debates.

What to Do Now: Recommendations for Regulated Parties

Generate high-quality paired indoor-air and subslab or soil-gas data, and submit them in agency formats for GeoTracker. Maintain Johnson and Ettinger runs with California-realistic inputs as the post-screening alternative to 0.03.

In correspondence, state that 0.03 is for screening, and that site-specific, risk-based Afs should set remedies and closure once building data and controls exist.

Align lenders and insurers so that transaction documents don’t fix 0.03 as a remedial standard. When negotiating transactional terms, anchor representations and triggers to measured indoor-air results and the documented site-specific AF, not to the statewide screen.

Conclusion

CalEPA’s workshop series provides a forum to test methods while statewide AF work proceeds over a longer horizon. Keeping 0.03 at screening, while moving cleanup and closure to site-specific, risk-based AFs, protects occupants, supports infill and brownfield projects, and builds the record California needs for future guidance.

The approach also gives project sponsors and financiers a clearer framework: Design for protection, measure performance and let the building’s data — not a generic screen — set the remedy.

Rep. Ken Luttrell, R-Ponca City, vice chair of the Oklahoma House Energy Committee, traveled to Gulfport, Mississippi, where he joined legislators from across the United States and Canada for a multi-state conference examining the future of North American energy policy. Lawmakers gathered to confront rapidly shifting demands on the power grid and to identify strategies that keep states competitive and energy-secure.

Lawmakers Tackle Grid Reliability, Data Centers, and Energy Demand

Conference organizers built the sessions around the most urgent topics facing state energy leaders. Legislators addressed how states must reinforce grid resiliency as extreme weather, population growth, and industrial expansion increase strain on electric systems. Speakers also detailed how the explosive growth of data centers, driven by artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and high-density server farms, continues to reshape long-term energy planning.

Regulators, utility executives, and policy strategists explained the legal obstacles that states face when they attempt to modernize infrastructure or integrate large-load industrial customers. Participants reviewed real-world permitting timelines, courtroom challenges, and legislative solutions that other states already implemented.

Permitting Reform and LNG Export Momentum Take Center Stage

Lawmakers also explored ways to streamline permitting for major energy projects, a topic that touched everything from transmission lines to power plants to natural gas processing infrastructure. Presenters emphasized that long delays often increase project costs and block states from meeting economic development goals.

The conference also highlighted ongoing LNG export initiatives, particularly along the Gulf Coast. Experts explained how increasing global demand for U.S. natural gas continues to shape investment, workforce planning, and regional infrastructure development.

Luttrell Brings Oklahoma’s Perspective to National Discussions

Luttrell said he valued the opportunity to collaborate with policymakers who confront similar issues in their own states.

“This conference provided valuable insight into the challenges and opportunities ahead,” Luttrell said. “We’re all looking toward a future where reliable, affordable energy is essential for families, businesses and national security. These conversations help us make informed decisions for Oklahoma.”

He emphasized that he plans to bring the insights back to the Capitol as lawmakers craft policy to support electric reliability, responsible development, and long-term affordability.

Luttrell said he looks forward to applying what he learned as lawmakers continue working on policies that strengthen Oklahoma’s energy landscape.

Beijing Channels Capital into Global Energy Transition Markets

Chinese firms have pushed approximately USD 80 billion into overseas clean technology projects over the past year, according to new analysis from Climate Energy Finance (CEF) in Australia. The research places total outbound Chinese direct investments into green technology at more than USD 180 billion since the beginning of 2023, reflecting both commercial necessity and geopolitical recalibration.

The study describes a surge in foreign deployment of Chinese solar, battery, and critical minerals capacity. These outbound flows are shaped by one core pressure point inside China: domestic oversupply across the clean technology manufacturing sector. CEF China engagement lead Caroline Wang stated that the flood of outbound activity is partly driven by a simple structural imbalance. In her words, “China’s got a supply glut when it comes to green technology, like solar panels and batteries, because of a structural supply-demand mismatch, so they need overseas markets to absorb their products.”

Investments abroad are now performing a dual function for China. They deflect domestic margin pressure and extend global market share at a moment when clean technology realignment sits at the center of energy security, industrial competitiveness, and climate transition diplomacy.

Shifting Trade Dynamics After United States Tariffs

The report links the acceleration to new U.S. tariff policy implemented under President Donald Trump. Several markets strengthened cleantech cooperation with China rather than retreat from it, a result that has layered geopolitical complexity into supply chain diversification conversations occurring in Washington, Brussels, and Tokyo.

This trend has amplified China’s leverage in a sector where it already dominates refining, module production, and battery processing. Outbound infrastructure projects effectively create demand for Chinese-manufactured components and embed its technology across third countries’ grids, industrial zones, and transportation systems.

The governance context matters. Countries balancing energy affordability, industrial growth, and climate commitments are accepting Chinese capital, but those same investments cement dependencies that may shape global energy politics long past the current decade.

Opportunity and Risk for Emerging Economies

CEF’s findings indicate that these capital flows are disproportionately landing in emerging economies. Research from the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University estimates that 75 percent of China’s low-carbon foreign direct investment sits across Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.

Southeast Asia remained the strongest magnet for manufacturing-linked projects, particularly electric vehicles and energy storage. New solar manufacturing slowed due to U.S. trade measures, but power generation, battery plants, and EV assembly capacity continued to scale with momentum.

The Middle East and North Africa region delivered the fastest-growing deal volume. Here, state diversification strategies away from oil reliance intersect directly with Chinese cleantech capacity. Countries seeking to hedge hydrocarbon exposure are accelerating partnerships, often through joint venture structures and vertically integrated project plans.

Wang framed the opportunity clearly. She noted that expansion offers emerging markets a route to reduce fossil fuel import exposure while building new industrial capabilities. At the same time, she warned that participation is time sensitive. “China’s leading the world in the technologies, in the innovation, and if you don’t get into the supply chain quickly, there’s a risk you miss out on innovation opportunities,” she said.

Mega-Projects Reveal Supply Chain Strategy

The scale of recent investments reinforces China’s long-view industrial posture. Among the largest new commitments highlighted by CEF is an USD 8.28 billion green hydrogen venture in Nigeria led by Longi Green Energy. CATL is building a USD 6 billion battery plant in Indonesia that will anchor regional EV ecosystem development. The report notes that firms increasingly prefer upstream-to-downstream integration, locking in mineral inputs, refining capacity, module fabrication, and end-use product assembly under one umbrella.

These structures reduce risk exposure, insulate manufacturers from price swings, and deepen host-market dependency on imported Chinese technical standards and components. For investors, such configurations offer scale and continuity. For governments, they deliver rapid infrastructure but also shape long-term industrial policy.

What Global Leaders Should Track Next

For C-suite leaders, fund managers, and policymakers, the question now shifts from whether China will drive cleantech expansion abroad to how host nations position themselves within that growth. Countries able to absorb technology, develop local supply chains, and negotiate balanced industrial terms stand to gain. Those that rely solely on inbound capital may find themselves locked into externally controlled value chains.

As global transition spending intensifies, China’s USD 180 billion outbound footprint illustrates a redistribution of climate investment power. Emerging markets are becoming the next arena of scaling, competition, and innovation. The next decade of cleantech leadership will likely be defined in Lagos, Jakarta, Riyadh, and Hanoi as much as in Beijing, Brussels, and Washington.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/China-Drives-80-Billion-in-Overseas-Clean-Technology-Expansion.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:01:36.778764

Bottom Line The Ninth Circuit’s injunction offers temporary relief, but uncertainty looms.","California’s ambitious climate disclosure regime has hit a significant roadblock. On November 18, 2025, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted an injunction halting enforcement of SB 261, the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, pending resolution of a constitutional challenge. This ruling comes just weeks before the law’s first compliance deadline of January 1, 2026, creating uncertainty for thousands of companies doing business in the state.

What SB 261 Requires

SB 261 mandates that U.S. companies with over $500 million in annual revenue and operations in California publish a climate-related financial risk report every two years, starting January 2026. These reports must outline climate-related financial risks and strategies for mitigation and adaptation, aligning with frameworks such as TCFD or IFRS S2.

The Ninth Circuit’s Decision

The injunction stems from a lawsuit led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, arguing that SB 261—and its companion law, SB 253—violates the First Amendment by compelling speech on controversial policy matters. While SB 261 enforcement is paused, SB 253, which requires greenhouse gas emissions disclosures for companies with revenues over $1 billion, remains unaffected. CARB has proposed an initial SB 253 compliance deadline of August 10, 2026.

Oral arguments on the SB 261 appeal are scheduled for January 9, 2026, but the court could rule earlier or later, leaving companies in limbo. Meanwhile, CARB has delayed issuing final implementing regulations for both laws until Q1 2026, though statutory deadlines technically remain in place.

Legal Landscape

The Ninth Circuit’s injunction does not invalidate SB 261—it merely pauses enforcement. If lifted, compliance obligations could resume immediately. Adding to the complexity, ExxonMobil filed a separate challenge in October 2025, asserting similar constitutional claims and arguing federal preemption under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act. That case is now on hold pending the Ninth Circuit’s decision.

What Companies Should Watch

Ninth Circuit Ruling: A decision could come before or after January’s oral arguments.

CARB Rulemaking: Draft regulations expected in early 2026 will clarify scope, definitions, and enforcement.

Potential Supreme Court Review: If SB 261 survives appeal, plaintiffs may escalate.

SB 253 Compliance: No injunction applies—companies should continue preparing for emissions disclosures.

Recommendations

Despite the injunction, companies should maintain a “ready posture”:

Continue Preparations: Draft SB 261 reports using TCFD or IFRS S2 frameworks.

Assess Applicability: Review CARB’s preliminary list of covered entities and revenue thresholds.

Integrate ESG Strategy: Align SB 261 planning with SB 253 efforts for efficiency.

Monitor Developments: Stay alert for Ninth Circuit rulings and CARB updates in Q1 2026.

Senate Bill 54, introduced by Senator Liz Brown, would prevent cities, towns, and counties from creating new solar overlay districts after December 31, 2025, unless every underlying zoning district already permits commercial solar development. The measure would apply to all future projects and would require rezonings for any district that lacks explicit solar authorization.

Overlay districts have been a central tool for counties managing the growth of utility-scale solar. They allow officials to set standards—such as setbacks, vegetative buffers, road use requirements, and decommissioning rules—without overhauling long-standing zoning classifications. In many rural counties, agricultural zoning is the default land use, and overlays have helped bridge the gap between traditional land-use maps and modern energy infrastructure needs.

SB 54 would eliminate that flexibility. Any county hoping to use an overlay in the future would need to address zoning first, bringing solar-related decisions into a more formal—and often more contentious—rezoning process. Rezoning requires public hearings before plan commissions and local legislative bodies, which typically draws greater attention and offers opponents more opportunities to slow or block a project.

The potential impact on Indiana’s solar development pipeline is considerable. Many counties have not updated their zoning codes in years, and several lack clear definitions for commercial solar use. Under SB 54, those gaps become barriers. Developers may face longer timelines, while local agencies will need to reconcile outdated maps with growing interest in renewable energy.

The bill does not prohibit commercial solar, but it shifts critical decision-making upstream, turning land classification—not overlay standards—into the deciding factor for project viability. For Indiana, where energy markets are expanding and counties vary widely in their approach to renewable siting, SB 54 represents a notable recalibration of local authority and a more structured framework for governing where utility-scale solar can be built.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251208-070744-79c-Panoramic%20view%20of%20rural%20solar%20panels%20and%20agricultural%20fields%20under%20blue%20sky..jpg,N,,2025-12-08 12:03:29.423156

Among other things, it requested commitments be made to transition the existing local skilled labour supply into the Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme, under which the UK Government hosts its annual renewable energy auctions.

MPs also want to see more measures to encourage local governments to accelerate the roll-out of retrofit and take the lead on place-based approaches to net-zero; and accelerate the adoption of clean energy and retrofit skills policies in the UK Government’s Spending Review, creating a ten-year horizon for initiatives and funding, to be revised every five years.

The ESNZ Committee called for the Government to launch new initiatives promoting clean energy and retrofit careers for underrepresented groups, and bring forward the Warm Homes Plan, to determine the workforce needed for the project and how that workforce will be found.

The Plan should be published before Christmas. It will detail more than £13bn of spending to benefit predominantly low-income and social homes with energy efficiency improvements and electric heating.

Given the fact that around 70% of individuals studying construction-related further education courses either do not complete the course or do not enter the sector once qualified, the Committee recommended that the Government expands ‘try before you buy’ training opportunities.

Currently, the UK needs a further 250,000 workers to meet new housing targets, and more will be needed to accelerate retrofit. While the Climate Change Committee estimates a gain of between 135,000 and 725,000 jobs created from the energy transition in the next four years, most of these workers will be required to retrain or reskill, with some specifically skilled workers needing to be imported from overseas, at least short term.

Clean energy jobs

The recommendations from the ESNZ Committee come shortly after the UK Government published its first clean energy jobs plan, building on the 10-year Industrial Strategy and with an aim to train and recruit workers for the energy transition. The headline ambition is doubling employment in clean energy and energy transition sectors to more than 850,000 roles by 2030.

The clean energy jobs plan identifies 31 occupations which will suffer severe skills gaps in the near future, including welding, carpentry, joining and electrical engineering. The new plan forecasts a total of 400,000 new full-time equivalent roles, including 20,000 in Scotland and 20,000 in the East of England.

ESNZ Committee chair Bill Esterson, the Labour MP for Sefton Central, stated: “It is essential that we build the workforce for the energy transition so that the Government can hit its clean energy targets and, importantly, ensure that the UK makes the most of the growth opportunity of the century.

“The Committee has found that market forces alone cannot overcome the skills gap. We need policy certainty for the long-term, locally directed investment in training, and policies that make clean energy careers attractive and accessible.

“For British workers this isn’t about hitting deadlines; it’s about securing good jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring Britain leads in the global race for clean energy.”

As winter approaches, so do reports of electric vehicles being stranded in frigid temperatures at charger stations or along the road. The same can happen to gas-powered vehicles, but it's EVs that make the headlines, since the cold has a more pronounced effect on range, efficiency, and charging speeds. They have their own driving style, which requires some adjusting to.

A cold weather study of EVs in freezing temperatures by Recurrent Auto, an EV battery research firm, examined over 10,000 vehicles and found that, on average, electric vehicles lose nearly 30% of their range (find further tips for improving your range here). With this in mind, CarMax partnered with the car experts at Edmunds to round up some tips on how to improve your EV's range in cold weather.

How does the cold affect EVs?

There are three main factors that determine how cold weather can impact an EV.

Cold temperatures slow down the chemical reactions that occur in an EV battery. Electrolytes are the battery component that transfers ions-charge-carrying particles-back and forth between the two electrodes, causing the battery to charge and discharge. In colder conditions, these electrolytes become thick or viscous, making it harder for the ions to travel to the cathode, reducing efficiency. Put differently, imagine that you were thirsty and needed a bottle of water. However, you accidentally left the bottle in the freezer too long, and the water is now slushy, making it a lot harder to drink than if it were at room temperature.

The second is charging, and the same viscous electrolyte problem applies here, too. If the temperature is too low, the battery will have trouble storing the energy from the charge plug. The battery must be brought up to the proper temperature to charge at its full potential. If the EV has not been preconditioned (heating the battery to a more ideal temperature), or if it isn't equipped with a thermal management system, Recurrent says that the first 30-45 minutes of your charging session may not add any charge but instead just raise the battery's temperature to prepare for the actual charging.

The third factor is that when it's cold, most people will usually run the heater. However, an EV needs to use more energy to create that heat, whereas a gas-powered car can redirect the heat naturally generated from the engine.

Tips to extend an EV's range in the cold

Precondition both the battery and the cabin.

Ideally, you should charge the car in your garage to minimize the impact of the cold. Many EVs will allow you to schedule charging. Set it to finish shortly before you plan on leaving the house. You'll also want to turn on the car's heaters while it is still charging. This approach ensures that both the cabin and battery will be warm without affecting the range.

If you're on the road and need to fast-charge, make sure to set the EV to precondition the battery to get to the proper temperature for charging. You can manually set it to precondition in the charge settings, but some newer EVs do it automatically when you use the in-car navigation to route to a charger. This feature does use up some energy, so avoid using it if you're running low on range. However, it can save you time and money spent on public chargers.

Use seat and steering wheel heaters.

If you're on the road and need to fast-charge, make sure to set the EV to precondition the battery to get the proper temperature for charging.

These accessories consume less power than a typical heater and can still keep you warm on your journey. If it's not too bulky, you might also consider leaving your jacket on, which should help with keeping warm in combination with the seat heaters.

Check your tire pressure.

As a rule of thumb, every 10-degree drop in temperature can reduce the pressure of your tires by 1 pound per square inch (psi). Tires that are low on pressure can not only reduce grip but can also reduce your vehicle's range.

Always be charging.

Even if your EV has a sufficient charge for your commute, it can be a good idea to keep it plugged in as much as possible during the colder months. Recurrent recommends setting the charge limit anywhere between 70% and 80% because this keeps the battery at an ideal temperature. With this method, the vehicle will use the power from the outlet to keep it warm rather than drawing from the battery itself.

Consider an EV with a heat pump.

An EV heat pump is a device that generates heat for the cabin more efficiently than a basic EV heater. Having a heat pump puts less strain on the battery and reduces the range penalty that would otherwise occur, also potentially reducing maintenance costs. Some cars have better thermal management than others and will lose less range in freezing temperatures.

Heat pumps are standard in many, but not all, modern electric vehicles. Unfortunately, it can be hard to tell which models have a heat pump just by looking at them. You'll need to do some research on the year, make, and model of the EV you're interested in. Some notable models with heat pumps include the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and EV9, Subaru Solterra, Toyota bZ4X, 2021 and newer Teslas, Jaguar I-Pace, the recent BMW i models, and more.

Consider winter EV tires.

If you live in an area that regularly experiences freezing temperatures, a good set of winter tires designed for an EV will help maximize its range since there is less rolling resistance. Additionally, winter tires are typically noisier than non-winter tires, and given that EVs operate quietly, a good-quality winter tire can help minimize road noise that would be more noticeable in an EV.

Don't let the cold scare you

We're not pointing this issue out to scare you off from buying an EV if you live in a colder climate, but rather to educate you on how the cold affects them in distinctly different ways than gas cars. For perspective, the cold hasn't scared people off in Norway, where EV adoption is over 80%, and the average winter temperature is about 19.8 degrees Fahrenheit. In other words, with proper precautions, most people should be able to manage an EV in the winter.

This year has been hard — and that’s an understatement. As we predicted, this second Trump administration is worse than the first; much, much worse.

But incredible people like you have banded together and shown up in force to protect what we love — our neighbors, our communities, our country, our planet — even in the face of steep odds.

The Trump administration is destroying critical food, water, and climate programs at breakneck speed. It’s threatening our chance for a clean energy future by canceling wind and solar projects, some already under construction. It’s threatening our access to clean drinking water by gutting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the main federal regulator and defender of clean water. And it’s threatening the health and lives of millions of people by cutting life-saving food assistance.

Your support powered our work to counter Trump’s dangerous actions and made a real difference. Read further to see how you joined with others across the country to strengthen our movement in 2025.

You’re strengthening our Food & Water Watch community!

The stakes for our food, water, and climate are higher than ever, which means people power is more important than ever.

As more people get involved, together we can more effectively pressure elected officials and decision makers to stand up for people over corporate profits and choose democracy over authoritarianism.

Our Food & Water Watch community is growing, and so is our ability to secure strong protections for the resources we all need to live and thrive.

You’re powering victories for our food, water, and climate!

By growing our movement throughout the year, you powered many meaningful victories. This speaks volumes given the unprecedented political headwinds we’re facing.

Your acts of generosity, resistance, and perseverance led to wins that bring real relief to our families, our communities, and our planet — relief that can be felt by all of us.

Here are just a few accomplishments you made possible this year.

Together we:

1. Protected a key water safety rule for lead-free water

Intense nationwide grassroots pressure, led by Food & Water Watch, stopped a dangerous attempt by House Republicans to strip away the Lead Out of Water Rule, officially called Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI). This rule mandates the elimination of toxic lead service lines in most communities over the next decade.

This means that many cities and towns across the country that rely on federal funding to replace lead service lines can make their water safer for their communities. Every person deserves safe, lead-free water.

2. Drove support for the Climate Change Superfund Act in states coast to coast

Together, we’re working to pass Climate Change Superfund Acts in Massachusetts, New Jersey, California, and Maryland. Modeled after similar laws passed in New York and Vermont, these bills would ensure the fossil fuel industry, not taxpayers, foots the bill for infrastructure projects to help states become more resilient to flooding, severe storms, and other climate impacts.

You powered campaigns that drove over 60 New Jersey municipalities — and counting! — to support its version of the bill, and passed nearly 20 resolutions in California.

3. Protected our oceans from industrial fish farming

Food & Water Watch and a coalition of allies solidified a legal win from late last year when a federal judge invalidated a nationwide factory fish farming permit, which threatened to pave the way for dirty offshore aquaculture projects.

This permit would have allowed for the construction of industrial fish farms in U.S. federal ocean waters to produce massive quantities of finfish such as salmon, trout, and bass — along with massive amounts of pollution.

Fish farming threatens marine ecosystems as well as endangered whales, salmon, sea turtles, and many other imperiled species. It also threatens traditional fishing economies, Tribal Nations’ food security, and public health.

We can’t emphasize enough how incredible these achievements are, given the terrible political climate we’re facing. Thank you for stepping up when our movement needed you most.

HARRISBURG — Attorney General Dave Sunday is leading a coalition of 36 Attorneys General in urging Congress to pass into law H.R. 1633 — the Workforce Reentry Act, sponsored by Congressman Lloyd Smucker (R-Lancaster) — which will equip individuals released from prison with resources and skills to successfully reintegrate into society.

The legislation would increase public safety by reducing recidivism rates, while cutting taxpayer burdens related to incarceration costs, and empowering the paroled individuals to lead fulfilling lives.

H.R. 1633 would make permanent grant funding opportunities for resources and programming, while ensuring efficient use of those funds by attaching new requirements to the grants.

“Successful reentry benefits everyone, so we need to do all we can to provide people leaving incarceration the tools they need to land on their feet and be contributors for their families and communities,” Attorney General Sunday said. “We are asking Congress to recognize the essential resources and services made available to reentrants under the Workforce Reentry Act. Employment provides a person with an identity, a sense of self-worth and pride that positively impacts everything they do.”

According to federal data, the national recidivism rate is around 68 percent for individuals within three years of completion of incarceration. That number soars to 83 percent over nine years.

Recidivism not only potentially endangers every person, family, and community when a new crime is committed, it also results in tremendous taxpayer costs associated with arrest, prosecution, and incarceration.

Recidivism, however, is not inevitable. Research shows the impetus for recidivism is lack of opportunities and skills for those leaving prison — including employment opportunities.

Currently, funding for programs that bolster those skills and opportunities is in flux and oftentimes not available at all. The Workforce Reentry Act would make permanent grant funding streams to stabilize resources related to successful reentry.

The same can happen to gas-powered vehicles, but it's EVs that make the headlines, since the cold has a more pronounced effect on range, efficiency, and charging speeds. They have their own driving style, which requires some adjusting to.

A cold weather study of EVs in freezing temperatures by Recurrent Auto, an EV battery research firm, examined over 10,000 vehicles and found that, on average, electric vehicles lose nearly 30% of their range (find further tips for improving your range here). With this in mind, CarMax partnered with the car experts at Edmunds to round up some tips on how to improve your EV's range in cold weather.

How does the cold affect EVs?

There are three main factors that determine how cold weather can impact an EV.

Cold temperatures slow down the chemical reactions that occur in an EV battery. Electrolytes are the battery component that transfers ions—charge-carrying particles—back and forth between the two electrodes, causing the battery to charge and discharge. In colder conditions, these electrolytes become thick or viscous, making it harder for the ions to travel to the cathode, reducing efficiency. Put differently, imagine that you were thirsty and needed a bottle of water. However, you accidentally left the bottle in the freezer too long, and the water is now slushy, making it a lot harder to drink than if it were at room temperature.

The second is charging, and the same viscous electrolyte problem applies here, too. If the temperature is too low, the battery will have trouble storing the energy from the charge plug. The battery must be brought up to the proper temperature to charge at its full potential. If the EV has not been preconditioned (heating the battery to a more ideal temperature), or if it isn't equipped with a thermal management system, Recurrent says that the first 30-45 minutes of your charging session may not add any charge but instead just raise the battery's temperature to prepare for the actual charging.

The third factor is that when it’s cold, most people will usually run the heater. However, an EV needs to use more energy to create that heat, whereas a gas-powered car can redirect the heat naturally generated from the engine.

Tips to extend an EV's range in the cold

Precondition both the battery and the cabin.

Ideally, you should charge the car in your garage to minimize the impact of the cold. Many EVs will allow you to schedule charging. Set it to finish shortly before you plan on leaving the house. You'll also want to turn on the car's heaters while it is still charging. This approach ensures that both the cabin and battery will be warm without affecting the range.

If you're on the road and need to fast-charge, make sure to set the EV to precondition the battery to get to the proper temperature for charging. You can manually set it to precondition in the charge settings, but some newer EVs do it automatically when you use the in-car navigation to route to a charger. This feature does use up some energy, so avoid using it if you're running low on range. However, it can save you time and money spent on public chargers.

Use seat and steering wheel heaters.

If you're on the road and need to fast-charge, make sure to set the EV to precondition the battery to get the proper temperature for charging.

These accessories consume less power than a typical heater and can still keep you warm on your journey. If it's not too bulky, you might also consider leaving your jacket on, which should help with keeping warm in combination with the seat heaters.

Check your tire pressure.

As a rule of thumb, every 10-degree drop in temperature can reduce the pressure of your tires by 1 pound per square inch (psi). Tires that are low on pressure can not only reduce grip but can also reduce your vehicle's range.

Always be charging.

Even if your EV has a sufficient charge for your commute, it can be a good idea to keep it plugged in as much as possible during the colder months. Recurrent recommends setting the charge limit anywhere between 70% and 80% because this keeps the battery at an ideal temperature. With this method, the vehicle will use the power from the outlet to keep it warm rather than drawing from the battery itself.

Consider an EV with a heat pump.

An EV heat pump is a device that generates heat for the cabin more efficiently than a basic EV heater. Having a heat pump puts less strain on the battery and reduces the range penalty that would otherwise occur, also potentially reducing maintenance costs. Some cars have better thermal management than others and will lose less range in freezing temperatures.

Heat pumps are standard in many, but not all, modern electric vehicles. Unfortunately, it can be hard to tell which models have a heat pump just by looking at them. You'll need to do some research on the year, make, and model of the EV you're interested in. Some notable models with heat pumps include the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6 and EV9, Subaru Solterra, Toyota bZ4X, 2021 and newer Teslas, Jaguar I-Pace, the recent BMW i models, and more.

Consider winter EV tires.

If you live in an area that regularly experiences freezing temperatures, a good set of winter tires designed for an EV will help maximize its range since there is less rolling resistance. Additionally, winter tires are typically noisier than non-winter tires, and given that EVs operate quietly, a good-quality winter tire can help minimize road noise that would be more noticeable in an EV.

Don't let the cold scare you

We're not pointing this issue out to scare you off from buying an EV if you live in a colder climate, but rather to educate you on how the cold affects them in distinctly different ways than gas cars. For perspective, the cold hasn't scared people off in Norway, where EV adoption is over 80%, and the average winter temperature is about 19.8 degrees Fahrenheit. In other words, with proper precautions, most people should be able to manage an EV in the winter.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/32/63254b6c-45d4-517c-89d8-4872562f7184/6936f9c969143.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C23&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-08 12:03:33.462166

Southern is a U.S.-based developer of low-cost, biomass-derived clean fuels, best known for its flagship project in Louisiana that plans to transform regional wood-waste feedstock into green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on a large commercial scale. The two organizations will merge under a newly formed, U.S.-domiciled parent company that is expected to be listed on Nasdaq after fulfilling all customary closing requirements.

The new combined entity aims to play a central role in helping global aviation and maritime operators comply with increasingly stringent decarbonization mandates issued under frameworks such as ReFuelEU and by global regulatory bodies like the International Maritime Organization (IMO). By developing a fully integrated clean-fuels platform anchored in Louisiana, the company intends to use domestic resources, secure supply chains, and a local workforce to manufacture carbon-negative SAF and green methanol at competitive prices.

Under the proposed structure, the combined organization will operate through two core divisions. The first will focus on climate-oriented solutions that generate environmental assets such as carbon credits. The second division will concentrate on clean-fuel production, with its initial emphasis on the previously announced Louisiana biomass-to-fuel project. By merging DevvStream's environmental-asset expertise with Southern's biomass-conversion technology, the new company seeks to lower production costs and remove a major barrier that has slowed alternative fuel adoption across the aviation and maritime industries.

Management anticipates that by taking advantage of early federal incentives, combined with co-products generated during fuel production, the platform can ultimately achieve cost competitiveness even without government subsidies. Additionally, the company plans to leverage early engagement from airlines and maritime offtakers who are preparing to meet future carbon-reduction obligations. For investors, this strategic move signifies a transformation of DevvStream—from a smaller services-oriented company into a scalable industrial clean-fuels producer with long-term revenue visibility.

Leadership of the newly formed company is expected to be headed by Carl Stanton, who will assume the role of CEO. The organization will operate under the name Southern Energy Renewables. The transaction is currently expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory clearances and shareholder approvals.

By Lakshita Dey

Electric vehicles (EVs) are powering a transformative revolution, paving the way for a cleaner, greener future. EVs offer a significant environmental advantage by eliminating the reliance on fossil fuels, but their widespread adoption faces challenges related to high costs and limited accessibility.[1] As society pushes for these technological advancements, two critical legal questions arise: are incentives working as intended, and are the benefits of these incentives distributed equitably across income groups?

Governments are accelerating EV adoption by providing tax credits and rebates, as they recognize the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions and foster a clean energy future.[2]￼ The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) extends tax credits for new and used EV purchases through 2032, offers credit for commercial EVs, and revives credits for charging infrastructure.[3] The IRA has demonstrated the government’s commitment to the EV transition, which has significantly boosted the market by reassuring consumers and businesses.[4] Automakers are responding by announcing massive investments in EV production.[5]

Despite these legislative efforts and progressive market shifts, equity challenges remain. The price of an EV presents a hurdle for many families. Even though the average price of an EV is falling, it is still notably higher than the price of a gas-powered car.[6] This economic reality highlights a fundamental issue of deep-seated financial barriers which hinder equitable access. By their very nature, tax credits only benefit those with sufficient tax liability to claim them, which means that many of these incentives provide little to no direct benefit for low-income families. Consequently, the cost of EV ownership remains a financial burden, even with governmental assistance.

Beyond the purchase price, EV infrastructure presents another barrier to fair access. Owning an EV comes with the challenge of charging. Uneven geographic distribution of public charging stations furthers the lack of accessibility. Research consistently shows that residents of low-income and minority neighborhoods have significantly less access to reliable public charging stations.[7] This inequitable distribution creates “charging deserts,” making EV ownership impractical for those without consistent home charging.[8]

Solving these challenges requires an approach that addresses both the upfront costs of EVs and the inequity of charging infrastructure. Federal bills provide grants to companies that prioritize projects in rural areas and low-to-moderate-income communities.[9] Point-of-sale rebates can solve the issue of the current tax credit model benefiting only those with sufficient tax liability.[10] This approach is more equitable because it offers a direct, immediate discount at the time of purchase, making the financial benefit accessible to all households, regardless of their tax burden. For instance, the HOMES rebate program allows for a point-of-sale rebate that provides an immediate discount on the EV’s price at the dealership, eliminating tax return[11] This shift represents a significant improvement in legislation and policy, directly addressing a key barrier to equitable access.

Alongside tax rebates, holistic strategies are essential to ensure an equitable EV transition. For example, California’s “Clean Cars 4 All” program addresses two major issues: it promotes access to clean transportation and improves local air quality by getting old, high-polluting vehicles off the road.[12] The program provides significant incentives for low-income residents who trade in their gas-powered cars for cleaner options.[13] This targeted approach promotes equitable access while also directly improving local air quality in disadvantaged communities.

Another crucial strategy is implementing community-based solutions. Specifically, EV car-sharing services provide on-demand access to electric vehicles without the burden of full ownership, insurance, or maintenance.[14] Likewise, investing in and electrifying public transportation directly benefits low-income communities by improving local air quality and providing a clean, affordable alternative to personal vehicle ownership.[15] By combining these diverse strategies, policymakers and communities can achieve a truly sustainable future, ensuring that the benefits of the EV revolution are accessible to all, not just a privileged few.

While community-based solutions are vital, they cannot succeed without an extensive upgrade to charging infrastructure. The success of the EV revolution also depends on closing the charging infrastructure gap. Federal and state governments should continue to prioritize the deployment of affordable and publicly accessible charging stations in low-income neighborhoods and rural areas.[16] To offset profitability issues, charging manufacturers can be incentivized to accept a longer return on investment for charging stations that may not be immediately profitable through tax rebates.[17] Furthermore, the state legislature could also create a subsidized charging card payment for lower-income residents to access public chargers.[18] The solution is not just about individual car ownership; it’s about providing access to clean mobility.

The legal and policy challenges of EVs demand a holistic approach that acknowledges the economic and infrastructural barriers. While the IRA and subsequent statutes represent a commitment to EV transition, achieving equitable access depends on continued legislative and community efforts. This means not just more incentives, but effective ones that are accessible and wide-reaching. Only then can the ongoing EV revolution be truly transformative, with benefits that reach everyone.

At the heart of this new generation is a state-of-the-art architecture that not only fundamentally influences vehicle design, but is also intended to take the electric powertrain to a new level.

BMW boosts EV intelligence with new super brains

A central element of this new e-platform is the high-voltage battery. It is equipped with a highly intelligent control unit called the Energy Master, which manages all essential functions in the area of high- and low-voltage power supply as well as data communication relating to the electric drive. At the same time, BMW is introducing a high-performance computing module that, together with other super brains, is designed to deliver the typical BMW driving experience. With the New Class, BMW is switching to a highly networked and software-centric vehicle architecture that redefines the character of driving.

These four completely new super brains will be at work in the BMW of the future: high-performance computers that intelligently bundle what previously ran separately. The Heart of Joy super brain was developed entirely in-house. Three other super brains are responsible for automated and highly automated driving, infotainment, and basic functions such as climate and comfort, vehicle access, and interior and exterior lighting.

“The Heart of Joy takes driving pleasure to the next level. We are also achieving a further efficiency boost and thus greater range, as the driver will in future brake almost exclusively via recuperation,” comments Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management responsible for Development. And incidentally, the superbrains not only make the New Class future-proof because such an architecture is easier to update and upgrade than many individual control units. BMW also retains control over all key functions because, for the first time, the hardware and software were developed exclusively and independently in Munich.

Neue Klasse centralises power control with the in-house Energy Master

In previous electric vehicles, the power electronics were often distributed, for example in separate components or in modules within the battery. In the New Class, however, a central part of the electric drive's super brains is moving to the penthouse – i.e., the top of the battery pack.

The control center for all power flows in the vehicle is located on the roof of the high-voltage battery system. BMW refers to this unit as the Energy Master, which is developed and produced entirely in-house. It is the interface to the on-board power supply, monitors the battery, and controls the electric motor(s) as well as communication between the high-voltage and low-voltage systems. This proximity to all relevant components allows the vehicle's energy management to be handled particularly effectively.

Cell-to-pack design cuts weight and boosts BMW’s driving dynamics

The decision to dispense with classic battery module production and to insert the new round cells directly – BMW refers to this as cell-to-pack – also saves space, weight, and costs. The fact that the battery is structurally integrated into the vehicle floor (pack-to-open body) enables a flatter design. All of this contributes to a lower centre of gravity and thus to greater driving dynamics, a classic BMW characteristic that is to be retained in the fully electric era.

800-volt design delivers sharper response and faster charging

The combination of high system voltage, short response times, and highly integrated control logic results in immediate, direct drive behavior. The New Class is designed to feel more lively, especially during intermediate sprints or spontaneous evasive maneuvers in critical situations, because control interventions – for example, in the event of traction loss – take place in real time.

In addition, the 800-volt architecture allows for remarkable ranges to be recharged in very short periods of time. Short charging breaks and continuously available power ensure a completely new ease of travel.

The sound is also different: instead of a classic engine sound, there is a subtle hum that BMW can tune for different models. This creates a new, futuristic sound that, according to the manufacturer, is more emotionally appealing than simple silence.

In-house battery and Energy Master development strengthens BMW’s EV control

By deciding to keep the development and production of the high-voltage battery and the Energy Master in-house, BMW ensures maximum control over quality, technology, and costs. The BMW plant in Landshut plays a central role in this, producing the highly complex control unit in a highly automated process. Production is being continuously expanded – by 2026, up to 700 employees are expected to be working in the Energy Master production area.

Inside BMW’s smart logistics strategy at Debrecen

BMW is redefining automotive logistics with direct delivery systems, real-time tracking, digital twins, and autonomous transport at its Debrecen plant. The OEM’s tech-driven approach integrates production, quality, and sustainability – setting a new standard for next-gen vehicle manufacturing.

The New Class focuses on a holistic electric concept in which highly integrated battery cells, central control units (Penthouse), and powerful computers (Heart of Joy) provide a completely new driving experience. The Power of Joy results from the sum of technological innovations and is reflected in increased dynamics, comfort, and range.

The key feature here is the close integration of the electric motor, battery, energy distribution, and vehicle architecture. The fact that the key systems—from the Energy Master to the motor and battery control systems—were largely developed in-house gives BMW a high degree of freedom and flexibility. This means that the driving experience can be continuously enhanced via software updates, which is just as new as the combination of driving dynamics and state-of-the-art electric drive technology.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/2574605.jpg?imageId=2574605&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-12-08 13:03:47.465748

“When I think about PFAS, I tend to think through the whole PFAS life cycle – from upstream, to preventing the spread, detection, remediation, and ultimately destruction,” Roos said.
“For me, that is a helpful frame to consider the scope of the challenge, where we have focused our energies, and where we still need to go.” Following is a summary of Director Roos’ comments on the PFAS life cycle: Upstream There’s no naturally occurring level of PFAS, it’s a man-made chemical.
Some states have been active on PFAS product bans, but Michigan has not made this move yet.

Over 2,250 participants registered for the event, representing 50 states, two U.S. territories, and 11 countries.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – also known as “forever chemicals” – continue to present some of the biggest challenges in chemical contamination across the world. States throughout the nation, including the Great Lakes region, are finding PFAS contamination in a growing number of locations where these persistent chemicals pose a threat to human health and the environment.

“When I think about PFAS, I tend to think through the whole PFAS life cycle – from upstream, to preventing the spread, detection, remediation, and ultimately destruction,” Roos said. “For me, that is a helpful frame to consider the scope of the challenge, where we have focused our energies, and where we still need to go.”

Following is a summary of Director Roos’ comments on the PFAS life cycle:

Upstream

There’s no naturally occurring level of PFAS, it’s a man-made chemical. And it’s still being produced and used in lots of products. Some states have been active on PFAS product bans, but Michigan has not made this move yet.

Prevention

The next step is PFAS prevention. Once PFAS is out in the world, we have the challenge of preventing it from spreading, and specifically keeping it out of our lakes, streams, and groundwater

EGLE’s Water Resources Division has been working with wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), through the Michigan Industrial Pretreatment Program, to drive decreases in PFAS discharges:

Since implementation, 20 municipal WWTPs have adopted PFAS restrictions on the industrial users discharging into their municipal systems, and 86 industrial facilities have installed pretreatment or other source control measures.

This has resulted in a 59% reduction of PFOS discharges to surface waters for participating WWTP since 2018.

Michigan’s Biosolids Interim Strategy also continues to show successes and is serving as a model for other states. This program requires WWTP to test all biosolids for PFAS and places limits on what material can be land applied. That gives WWTP a huge incentive to control PFAS at the source.[RP1]

This year, we had to tackle a big challenge related to dredging. Michigan has more than 80 active harbors, many of them managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Seventeen of those harbors are impacted by PFAS, and we are worried about spreading PFAS from the sediment that is dredged out of those harbors. We were able to work with USACE to develop a clear set of guidelines for testing and placement of sediment that allowed our harbors to stay open while preventing the spread of PFAS from dredging activities.

Detection and Remediation

This is one of the areas where MPART has placed a lot of its focus. MPART just released their annual Fast Facts, a report showing what they accomplished in 2025.

In Fiscal Year 2025, MPART added another 32 MPART sites and eight “Areas of Interest,” for a total of 40 investigations that revealed areas where groundwater is contaminated by PFAS.

The team maintained and grew their PFAS monitoring activities, including collecting 702 water samples, 1,860 fish samples from 64 waterways, and instituting monitoring at 124 wastewater treatment plants.

The state has had success in completing enforcement and litigation actions. Michigan’s Attorney General settled three big cases.

MPART has also highlighted the importance of coordination and collaboration within state government. For example, when PFAS contamination is discovered over drinking water criteria, MPART coordinates between EGLE, local health and state health officials to test and notify nearby drinking water well users.

We’re also learning from other states. Maine hosted several staff from Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and Michigan State University staff for three full days, where they toured farms and shared information about their farmer assistance program, which helps farmers impacted by PFAS contamination.

Destruction

Finally, there’s PFAS destruction. We ultimately need to stop moving PFAS around and find economically viable ways to destroy it.

Our partners at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were leading the research on this topic, and unfortunately the cuts to the EPA Office of Research and Development are really going to hurt our ability to make progress on emerging contaminants.

There is still good research happening at states, at universities, and new technologies being piloted in the private sector that will advance our capabilities to address PFAS at every step of its life cycle — whether that’s replacing it in products, improving filtration and detection, better understanding things like crop uptake, and working on permanently eliminating “forever chemicals” from our lives.",https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Images/EGLE-Logos/Social.jpg?rev=fa9af8ebc6cc48f4ab7777c144d928b5&hash=AD089C78988ABC2E4DD23E2D36B9B8E6,N,,2025-12-08 12:02:43.515381

Senate Bill 54, introduced by Senator Liz Brown, would prevent cities, towns, and counties from creating new solar overlay districts after December 31, 2025, unless every underlying zoning district already permits commercial solar development. The measure would apply to all future projects and would require rezonings for any district that lacks explicit solar authorization.

Overlay districts have been a central tool for counties managing the growth of utility-scale solar. They allow officials to set standards—such as setbacks, vegetative buffers, road use requirements, and decommissioning rules—without overhauling long-standing zoning classifications. In many rural counties, agricultural zoning is the default land use, and overlays have helped bridge the gap between traditional land-use maps and modern energy infrastructure needs.

SB 54 would eliminate that flexibility. Any county hoping to use an overlay in the future would need to address zoning first, bringing solar-related decisions into a more formal—and often more contentious—rezoning process. Rezoning requires public hearings before plan commissions and local legislative bodies, which typically draws greater attention and offers opponents more opportunities to slow or block a project.

The potential impact on Indiana’s solar development pipeline is considerable. Many counties have not updated their zoning codes in years, and several lack clear definitions for commercial solar use. Under SB 54, those gaps become barriers. Developers may face longer timelines, while local agencies will need to reconcile outdated maps with growing interest in renewable energy.

The bill does not prohibit commercial solar, but it shifts critical decision-making upstream, turning land classification—not overlay standards—into the deciding factor for project viability. For Indiana, where energy markets are expanding and counties vary widely in their approach to renewable siting, SB 54 represents a notable recalibration of local authority and a more structured framework for governing where utility-scale solar can be built.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251208-070744-79c-Panoramic%20view%20of%20rural%20solar%20panels%20and%20agricultural%20fields%20under%20blue%20sky..jpg,N,,2025-12-08 11:04:07.881069

25%: Car Sales Sink As Americans Target ‘Affordability’

2026 Ford Mustang Mach-E California Special

This spike in car prices is nothing new, unfortunately. They've been on the rise for years but significantly increased during and after the pandemic. But for the past two years or so, EVs represented a bright spot in the affordability landscape. Aggressive lease deals, the $7,500 tax credit and other incentives often made going electric the cheapest and best way to get a decent new car.

When all of that went away, I wondered if they’d take the entire new-car market down with them. And November sales data show this to be happening, according to Automotive News:

Light-vehicle deliveries fell 6.3% in November from the same month last year, when there was one additional selling day, GlobalData said in a preliminary report. On a selling day-adjusted basis, sales dropped 2.6 percent.

Sales of most EVs declined significantly, continuing a recent trend. While the overall market fell for the second consecutive month, some brands such as Toyota and Kia posted modest gains driven by strong demand for hybrids and lower-priced models.

“People are looking for affordability right now,” Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, told Automotive News. “We know there’s higher prices, interest rates are still high from a historical perspective, and that is kind of coming to roost at this point in the year where people are more deal-oriented.

It is certainly and unfortunately true that without the tax credits, the biggest sales declines are in the EV segment. But it’s key to know that it’s not just EVs that are sliding: people everywhere are saying no to high prices, especially with big trucks and SUVs. How else do you explain this, from Ford?

Overall, the automaker’s utility vehicle sales slid 4.9 percent while truck sales were flat. Sales of entry-level trims on the Maverick, Ranger, Bronco Sport and Explorer all surged by double digits.

Sales slid 15 percent at Honda Motor Co., with volume down 17 percent at the Honda division and 1.4 percent at Acura.

The company blamed global semiconductor shortages, mostly at Nexperia, which have reduced output and inventories. The company said it ended November with 145,634 Honda-branded models in stock, down from 169,063 at the end of October and 173,704 a year earlier.

Not everyone who scored a sub-$200 monthly lease on a Honda Prologue was passionate about Honda’s road to electrification (with General Motors’ help, of course). Many of them just wanted a great deal. And those deals helped to prove to those buyers—who may not have considered this otherwise—that it is possible to break up with gasoline.

Now, the American car market is without EV incentives, and it also faces record-high prices and broader economic uncertainty. On the plus side, the holiday deals are here, but what happens after that?

50%: Hyundai’s Advanced Vehicle Chief Resigns, Laments Slow Growth In Autonomous Tech

2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 XRT

Photo by: Patrick George

The EVs from the Hyundai Motor Group like the Ioniq 5, Kia EV9 and so on tend to be some of my go-to recommendations for anyone looking to go electric. The Korean automaker's offerings generally have excellent range, class-leading fast charging and tons of style.

But as advanced as they are, Hyundai’s cars tend to lag behind rivals in advanced software—and especially in autonomous driving technologies. An Ioniq 5 is a great car, but forget hands-free highway driving as you’d get from GM’s Super Cruise.

Now, Song Chang-hyeon, head of Hyundai Motor Group's Advanced Vehicle Platform division and chief of the group's software research arm 42dot, is apparently falling on his sword and leaving the company. Here’s more from Korea’s Yonhap News Agency:

Song appears to be taking responsibility for the group's limited progress in autonomous driving technologies, as Hyundai Motor Group has been viewed as falling short of expectations compared with rivals despite significant investment in the AVP division.

""We have been preparing for the future automobile market, where only software-defined vehicles (SDVs) and autonomous driving technologies will remain after global automakers have spent tens of trillions of won only to fall short,"" Song said in the message.

Hyundai Motor Group appears to be lagging behind rivals, including Tesla Inc., which has been strengthening its presence in South Korea by adopting its supervised Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Other global carmakers, such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW, have already incorporated Level 3 autonomous driving capabilities into their production models.

At the very least, Hyundai continues to partner with several autonomous taxi firms in the U.S. and beyond, including Waymo, Motional and Avride. And the Korean automaker seems to have some slick next-generation software due out next year.

For now, the company is definitely playing catch-up on driverless technology—not just with Tesla but also GM, Ford, Rivian and any number of Chinese players.

75%: Can GM’s Sterling Anderson Deliver A Long-Promised Tech Revolution?

GM Escalade IQ Lidar

Photo by: General Motors

Over the years, GM has poached several big names from Silicon Valley tech companies and startups like Tesla as it seeks to position itself as a leader in autonomy, batteries, software and innovation. But it’s not always great at keeping those folks around. At least two executives I chatted with at the GM Forward tech event in New York City in October have since moved on from the company.

But GM says that its secret weapon is Sterling Anderson, the roboticist, former Tesla executive and co-founder of the autonomous trucking firm Aurora Innovation. Anderson is now GM’s Chief Product Officer, and as CNBC puts it, “he oversees the company’s vast product portfolio—from the vehicles themselves to the software powering them.” And at least some recent tech departures at GM seem tied to his reorganization efforts. From CNBC:

He has consolidated power to oversee “the end-to-end product lifecycle” of GM vehicles, including manufacturing engineering, battery, software and services product management, and engineering teams, according to GM.

“My priority is to accelerate the pace of innovation. One of the ways we do that is with this disaggregation of, or this abstraction of, software from hardware,” he told CNBC during an Oct. 22 technology event in New York. “That’s the point of the role, I think, is it brings together all of these pieces into a unified approach to how we do product going forward.”

Since then, the company’s acclaimed heads of software and artificial intelligence have unexpectedly exited the company after relatively short tenures. Their main responsibilities related to vehicles now fall under Anderson.

GM attributed the abrupt departures of Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, and Barak Turovsky, head of AI, to restructuring efforts.

Another software executive, Baris Cetinok, reportedly left to pursue another opportunity. But as CNBC points out, several other high-profile poaches from Apple and Google and others haven’t lasted long at GM—often for the same reasons that most “legacy” automakers struggle to become nimble, software- and tech-focused operations:

″[Traditional U.S. automakers] have very much had a significant struggle with understanding software and electronics technology, and that has caused them to have a parade of experts quote ‘coming in to help,’” said Peter Abowd, an engineer turned automotive and technology consultant.

“It’s just kind of setting the person up for a bit of failure,” Abowd said. “In a couple years, you can’t culturally shift an organization ... so the best thing to do is to part ways.”

Anderson is an incredibly smart guy, but he’s got his work cut out for him. I do think GM's made big strides in recent years on both autonomy and software efforts (if you can live without Apple CarPlay, of course). But creating a true software ecosystem that can power a connected, increasingly automated future for its giant fleet is a very tall order.

100%: What's The Most You'd Pay For A New Car?

Nissan Leaf Chevy Equinox EV Edmunds

This is a personal question that's unique to everyone. But I feel like for most Americans, the fact that the ""average"" new car is now about $50,000 doesn't make that pill go down more easily. What's the most you would ever pay at the new-car lot? I've always bought used (or leased, with my Kia EV6) and if car prices keep going the way they are, my current fleet is going to stick around for a while.

The copper supply chain is under strain, tight from mining to concentrate production.
But until there is any clarity on the tariff front, the tariff risk will keep ex-US supply tight and global prices elevated.
Major copper smelters in China recently pledged to jointly cut intake of copper concentrate as falling processing fees squeezed margins.
In addition, although similar pledges were made last year, they didn’t result in significant reductions in refined copper output.","Copper supply has seen a wave of disruptions this year, tightening the 2025 and 2026 balance, most recently Freeport’s declaration of force majeure at its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia. Grasberg is the world’s second-largest copper mine, contributing around 4% of global production. Two minor mining areas recovered production as planned in November, while the main area, which is responsible for 70% of output, is expected to slowly resume operations next year. A full recovery is expected in 2027.

The disruption at Grasberg has added to the already high number of supply disruptions this year, including the flooding of the Kamoa-Kakula mine in the DRC in May and an accident hitting the El Teniente mine in Chile in July.

Chile, the world’s largest copper producer, continues to struggle with falling ore grades and operational setbacks. Meanwhile, Ivanhoe Mines trimmed the outlook for production from its Kamoa-Kakula mine as it continues to recover from the flooding earlier this year.

The copper supply chain is under strain, tight from mining to concentrate production. Meanwhile, the refined metal flows are being disrupted by tariff risks and unusually high US stockpiles.

Our refined copper balance for 2026 is now showing a deficit of around 600kt for 2026, following a deficit of around 200kt in 2025.

The recent update by the US Geological Survey to its list of critical minerals, which has added 10, including copper, lead, metallurgical coal, and silver, is a strategic move to strengthen US mineral supply chains and national security. This development, which expanded the list to 60 minerals, may reinforce speculation about a potential increase in US import tariffs in 2027. If implemented, tariffs could widen the price difference between COMEX and LME markets, mirroring trends seen in July 2025.

But if Trump decides against tariffs on refined copper once again, significant volumes of US copper stockpiles could flow back to the global market. This would lead to a collapse of the COMEX premium, pushing US prices lower, and moving the global refined balance into a surplus.

But until there is any clarity on the tariff front, the tariff risk will keep ex-US supply tight and global prices elevated.

China’s copper smelters posted a succession of record production figures this year despite a tightening feedstock market and despite the government’s campaign against industrial overcapacity and excessive competition. The copper industry has been granted more leniency due to its strategic role in high-tech and clean energy manufacturing. Chinese smelters’ advantage also comes from higher prices of sulfuric acid, a byproduct of copper smelting, as well as ownership stakes in mines.

Meanwhile, smelters abroad are struggling to keep their operations running amid rising cost pressures and aggressive Chinese competition. Earlier this year, Glencore received a government bailout to keep its Mount Isa smelter and refinery in Australia running for another three years.

TC/RCs are likely to remain under pressure next year as concentrate supply growth lags expanding smelter capacity. Unless new mine projects ramp up quicker than expected, smelters will continue to face margin compression and may curtail output.

Major copper smelters in China recently pledged to jointly cut intake of copper concentrate as falling processing fees squeezed margins. The China Copper Smelters Purchasing Team (CSPT), a group of 13 major smelters, said it will cut concentrate processing rates by more than 10% next year. Still, while CSPT’s proposed 10% smelter cut reflects tight concentrate availability, it does not necessarily imply a meaningful change in the global refined copper balance, with the concentrate that China does not process simply reallocated to other smelters globally.

In addition, although similar pledges were made last year, they didn’t result in significant reductions in refined copper output. This year, China has produced almost 10% more refined copper through October.

In the near term, supply disruptions should keep a floor under prices around the $11,000/t level. However, for the rally to extend, stronger demand – particularly from China, the largest consumer – will be crucial. For now, prices will remain rangebound.

We see prices peaking in Q2 at $12,000/t as copper stockpiles keep building in the US, tightening ex-US markets before losing a bit of momentum in H2 as tariff policy should become clearer. The downside risk here is the reversal of these flows if the refined metal is exempt from tariffs once again.

We see prices averaging $11,500/t in 2026.

Upside risks include potential cuts to Chinese domestic output, additional supply disruptions and stronger investment momentum in energy transition sectors and AI.

On the downside, risks include further weakening in demand, a potential US tariff change that could push inventory onto global markets, and wider macro headwinds.

The long-term bullish narrative remains intact for copper, supported by structural demand from the grid, electrification and renewable infrastructure and, increasingly, from data centres and AI infrastructure.",https://think.ing.com/uploads/hero/_w800h450/shutterstock_editorial_15335370b.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 13:02:58.658662

*IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT*

The American Action Forum (AAF) is proud to announce a revamped version of our Regulation Rodeo (or RegRodeo) project. For those unfamiliar with it, AAF’s RegRodeo database houses information on federal regulations going back to 2005. Launched in 2015, RegRodeo tracks every proposed and final rule published in the Federal Register that includes a quantified economic impact or paperwork burden estimate. This version makes the following improvements to the site:

Clearer graphics and layout;

An updated, more intuitive user interface;

Enhanced ability to share findings across social media platforms;

The opportunity to export selected sets of regulatory cost/savings data; and

Direct links to additional AAF material on regulatory policy matters such as the Congressional Review Act (CRA).

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week was the DOT proposed rule on “The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule III for Model Years [MY] 2022 to 2031 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks.” This proposal represents the Trump Administration’s latest salvo regarding the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, markedly reducing the rate at which MY-over-MY fuel efficiency targets increase. DOT estimates that this would yield total cost reductions of $219.5 billion dollars through 2050 (or $18.3 billion on an annualized basis). Much as with the Biden-era set of CAFE standards it seeks to replace, it represents a substantial rulemaking that is nevertheless dwarfed by associated Environmental Protection Agency vehicle standards.

As noted in this current rulemaking, this shift in the overall standards for affected MYs comes on the heels of the provision in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) legislation that zeroed out the civil penalties levied against manufacturers that are out of compliance with relevant CAFE standards. This provision would seem to essentially neuter the effective enforcement of any level of standards, thereby throwing the projected manufacturer decisions – and the resulting economic effects – into doubt. Yet in its analysis DOT expects that, based upon previous manufacturer statements, affected entities will continue to follow the relevant standards to remain in legal compliance.

The other major rulemaking of the week was the HHS interim final rule on “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Repeal of Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities.” As the title plainly suggests, the rulemaking would repeal the standards set by the Biden Administration in May 2024. HHS is implementing the rule directly as an interim final rule under the auspices of (another) OBBBA provision that restricts the agency from “implementing, administering, or enforcing the minimum staffing standards…until after September 30, 2034.” The agency estimates that this will result in $55.1 billion in total cost savings for affected facilities over a 10-year window. As HHS itself notes, this savings total exceeds the net-cost total of the original Biden-era rule by a sizable margin. This divergence is due to:

A shift in the analytical window, with the Biden rule examining a 2024–2033 window vs. this current window that assumes an additional $6.6 billion in projected economic impacts in 2034; and

Adjusting “all estimates to 2024 dollars” whereas the Biden rule used 2021 dollars in its calculations.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

The main non-rulemaking regulatory policy news of the week was the Senate passing another CRA resolution of disapproval. The upper chamber passed H.J. Res 131 by a 49-45 vote this past Thursday. The resolution would repeal another Biden-era Department of Interior oil and gas leasing determination. It now joins the recently passed H.J. Res 130 at the White House for President Trump’s expected signature.

The AAF CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 69 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

TOTAL BURDENS

Since January 1, the federal government has published $976.1 billion in total regulatory net cost savings (with $128.5 billion in cost savings from finalized rules) and 75.1 million hours of net annual paperwork cuts (with 50.9 million hours coming from final rules).",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/regrodeo-12-5-25.png,N,,2025-12-08 11:03:32.064813

(PLUG), resulting in a post-trade position valued at approximately $5.9 million per a November 14 SEC filing.

What Happened

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated November 14, Manatuck Hill Partners, LLC acquired 2.5 million additional shares of Plug Power Inc. (PLUG). The estimated value increase of $5.84 million reflects both the new share purchases and changes in Plug Power’s market price during the third quarter. The fund now holds just over 2.5 million shares valued at $5.9 million at quarter-end.

What Else to Know

This buy brings the Plug Power stake to 1.9% of Manatuck's $302.3 million in reportable U.S. equity holdings as of September 30.

Top holdings after filing:

NYSE: ZETA: $14 million (4.6% of AUM)

NASDAQ: REAL: $13.6 million (4.6% of AUM)

NYSE: IMAX: $11.1 million (3.8% of AUM)

NASDAQ: OPRX: $9.7 million (3.3% of AUM)

NYSE: HLF: $8.4 million (2.9% of AUM)

As of Friday, Plug Power shares were priced at $2.20, up 10% over the past year and slightly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 13% in the same period.

Plug Power's integrated approach and robust infrastructure position it as a key player in the transition to zero-emissions power solutions.

Foolish Take

Manatuck's buoyed interest in Plug Power seemingly signals a willingness to underwrite a potential multiyear turnaround rather than treat recent volatility as a permanent state. Plug is still absolutely nowhere near historical highs, but its latest quarter showed operational progress that could influence future sentiment. Revenue climbed to $177 million, driven by electrolyzers and hydrogen fuel sales, and the company sharply improved operating cash burn, cutting usage by 49% year over year to about $90 million. Management also highlighted record hydrogen production uptime at the Georgia Green Hydrogen Plant and a $370 million capital raise — moves that extend liquidity as Plug works toward its EBITDAS-positive target in 2026.

Still, losses remain substantial, with a GAAP gross loss of roughly $120 million and a net loss of $363.5 million for the quarter. In that context, Plug’s modest position within Manatuck’s portfolio — far smaller than Zeta, The RealReal, or IMAX — suggests the fund views the stock as an asymmetric option rather than a core holding.

NEW YORK, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RK Equity today released a new policy white paper titled ""The USA Strategic Lithium Reserve: Stabilizing Price Volatility from China-Dominated Oversupply.” The report outlines a practical, rapidly deployable mechanism the United States can use to counter extreme lithium price volatility and reduce dependence on Chinese chemical conversion.

The paper argues that a U.S. Strategic Lithium Reserve (SLR)-modeled on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve-could provide the price stability needed for private capital to finance new lithium mining and conversion projects across the Western Hemisphere.

A Market-Based Alternative to Subsidies and Price Floors

Lithium prices have swung 10-15× in recent cycles-far beyond what most long-term capital can withstand. Much of this volatility stems from China’s dominance of lithium chemical conversion, where oversupply and subsidized lepidolite production exert sustained downward pressure on global prices. The result: U.S., Canadian, and allied projects struggle to reach Final Investment Decision (FID) even when resource quality and management execution are strong.

""A Strategic Lithium Reserve is the simplest, fairest, and fastest policy tool available,” said Howard Klein, Founder of RK Equity.

""It doesn’t pick technologies or subsidize risky projects. It neutralizes volatility so private capital can back the best projects.”

How the SLR Works

The SLR would operate as a rules-based reserve of lithium carbonate, purchasing material when prices fall below incentive levels-typically around $20,000-25,000 per tonne-and releasing it during extreme price spikes, supply disruptions, or export restrictions.

Establishing a 170,000-tonne reserve today would cost approximately $3.4-4.25 billion. A fully built-out 300,000-tonnereserve by 2030 would cost $6.0-7.5 billion. These sums are modest compared to existing U.S. industrial policy initiatives such as:

DOE Loan Programs Office: >$100B

Inflation Reduction Act clean energy incentives: >$400B

CHIPS Act: ~$50B

Immediate Strategic Impact

The white paper highlights that the Americas-particularly Chile and Argentina-are already the largest non-China producers of lithium carbonate. Redirecting a portion of these flows away from China and toward a U.S. reserve would provide immediate strategic supply security.

""Unlike permitting a new mine or building a U.S. refinery, which takes years, the SLR can begin stabilizing the market within months,” Klein added.

""It is the lithium-age analogue to the SPR.”

Complementary Industrial Strategy

In addition to the SLR, the paper recommends:

Continued use of the 45X Production Tax Credit, a broad-based, non-distortive incentive

Targeted LPO, EXIM Bank, or Department of the Navy’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) support for nationally significant, long-lived strategic projects

Limited, performance-linked incentives for companies with demonstrated ability to build and operate large-scale conversion capacity

The white paper also presents a three-phase implementation roadmap, beginning with authorization and early purchases, followed by hemispheric project alignment, and culminating in a fully operational SLR capable of dampening market extremes across cycles.

In a letter sent to Congress today, more than 50 organizations from across New York State called for a full national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers. The letter cites massive and unsustainable consumption by data centers of energy and water resources, and skyrocking utility costs for families and small businesses. The letter was facilitated by the national environmental organization Food & Water Watch, and signed by national and statewide groups including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Americans for Financial Reform, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Citizen Action of NY, NY Communities for Change, and For the Many.

The letter states, in part:

“The rapid expansion of data centers across the United States, driven by the generative artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto booms, presents one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation. This expansion is rapidly increasing demand for energy, driving more fossil fuel pollution, straining water resources and raising electricity prices across the country… We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.”

“At a time when New Yorkers are struggling with soaring utility bills, data centers threaten to inflict even more costs on our communities,” said Eric Weltman, senior New York organizer at Food & Water Watch. “It’s prudent that we press the pause button on Big Data’s voracious and expanding appetite for energy and water before it’s too late to prevent massive harm.”

Already, energy demand from data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase up to threefold between 2023 and 2028. And recent analysis from Food & Water Watch found that by 2028, AI-supporting data centers could consume:

720 billion gallons of water annually simply to cool the facilities — equal to more than 1 million Olympic-size swimming pools, or enough water to meet the indoor needs of 18.5 million American households.

300 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy annually — enough electricity to power over 28 million American households.

“Communities across the country are being inundated with this unchecked expansion of data centers, leaving residents to bear the burden of skyrocketing utility rates, worsening water and air pollution, and serious public health concerns.” said Yvonne Taylor, Vice President of Seneca Lake Guardian. “When an AI data center comes to town, our communities are promised an economic boost. Instead they are steamrolled, with developers depleting natural resources and refusing to take accountability for the harm they inflict. For too long, our representatives have sat back and watched as we are taken advantage of. We need leaders who will step in to protect residents against this exploitation, and put public health and safety above corporate profit.”

“Data Centers have quickly emerged as a false solution, as these new massive industrial projects create very few permanent jobs, introduce new environmental justice concerns for nearby residents, jack up energy and water costs for communities, and create headaches for local governments,” said Bridge Rauch, Environmental Justice Organizer with Clean Air Coalition of Western New York. “We need a federal moratorium on new data centers to give state and local governments a chance to work with their constituents to develop regulations that work for their communities.”

Meanwhile, this summer the Trump administration released an “AI Action Plan,” which outlines its priorities related to the advancement of so-called “artificial intelligence” and the industries supporting it – including massive energy- and water-intensive data centers. Among other things, Trump’s plan seeks to dismantle existing environmental and land use rules that it views as a hindrance to the unfettered growth of these industries.

They are data centers for local customers willing to pay for low latency. Data centers cluster in Santa Clara because that city’s power has been the cheapest in Silicon Valley. The San Jose Mercury News recently reported that two data centers in Santa Clara are empty, waiting for a $450 million upgrade to be completed in 2028 — three years out. Power is a limiting constraint for data centers across the USA.

Figure 1: One of dozens of data centers in Santa Clara, California (Silicon Valley)

Morgan Stanley recently projected a US power shortfall through 2028, totaling 45 gigawatts (20% of total data center demand), some of which can be handled by on-site power generation. It will get worse. OpenAI alone is projecting 250 GW just for its data centers by 2033.

The good news is that semiconductor innovations exist that can probably close the gap.

GenAI demand continues to grow exponentially

GenAI demand growth to date has been stunning. And projections are for further fast growth.

OpenAI’s ARR (annual run rate) has soared from $1 billion in 2023, to $5 billion in 2024, and now is expected to be $20 billion+ by the end of this year. OpenAI’s projections are bullish enough to enter into $1.4 trillion of capacity contracts over the coming 7 years.

Anthropic is keeping pace with $1 billion last year and expecting to end this year with $9 billion. Anthropic recently projected $70 billion in revenue in 2028 with positive cash flow!

Google TPU and AWS Trainium volumes have moved into millions of units.

Nvidia is asking TSMC to ramp production to satisfy rapidly growing Blackwell demand.

The major hyperscalers continue to ramp up their CapEx plans and report huge increases in tokens processed year-over-year.

Meanwhile, adoption of GenAI is still low with <10% of companies and probably <10% of people at those companies using AI really well. That means the upside for GenAI usage is huge as others catch up (or the leaders take the market share of the laggards).

The US power grid can’t keep up

The US power grid hasn’t grown much for years. Demand increases were offset by efficiencies. But now data centers are starting to significantly increase the demand on the US power grid.

In the US, the lead time for major transmission lines or natural gas pipelines is over a decade. New power generation plants take 5+ years to approve, longer for nuclear. Solar is now the cheapest form of power, but most panels are made in China and are now subject to very large tariffs. And the places with lots of space in the USA have limited transmission capacity. (Contrast this to China with the world’s largest solar and wind installations in northwest China carried by >40 new ultra-high-voltage transmission lines to the populous East).

Data centers now are being built where grid power is available.

The next step is for data centers to generate their own power on-site or near-site. The demand for gas turbines has capacity booked through 2030. Once-unloved fuel cells are now in huge demand. Airplane engines are being converted to power generation. At some point, data centers may be built in locations where very large solar and wind fields can be sited, if water is available, or at natural gas fields that have capacity in excess of the pipelines they feed.

The challenge in acquiring power will cause data centers to shift to more power-efficient chips (even when power is available, electricity costs are a major factor that is good to reduce).

Chips that can get more GenAI throughput from scarce watts

There are several ways semiconductors can help new data centers get more throughput per watt: power electronics, more memory with less latency, larger pod sizes, more efficient accelerators.

SiC/GaN FETs increase power converter efficiency & reduce cooling requirements

Power supply units (PSUs) in the data center take in AC power and convert it to DC power for the chips. Traditional PSUs are 90% to 95% efficient (5% to 10% of the AC power is lost to heat in conversion, which is a double whammy as more power-hungry cooling is required).

SiC (Silicon Carbide) MOSFETs and GaN (Gallium Nitride) FETs from Wolfspeed, STM, Infineon, On Semi, Navitas, and TI can boost PSU efficiency to 98% or more.

A data center with SiC/GaN PSUs can cut AC power requirements by ~5% to 10%.

800V HVDC replacing existing 48-54V

TI, ADI, Infineon, Renesas, and others are enabling 800V HVDC (high-voltage DC) architectures for next-gen data centers.

Until now, data centers have distributed DC power at 48 to 54V. Power loss in transmission is proportional to the square of the current (Ploss = I2R). Increasing the voltage from 48/54V to 800V reduces the current required by about 6%. 800V HVDC reduces power requirements by ~5%. It also means cables are thinner and lighter for the same amount of power, cutting copper use by half. (Initial NVL72 racks shipped with 54V, but are designed to shift to 800V.)

CXL-attached Memory

In GPU pods now, aggregate HBM is often not enough to handle growing KV-Caches (cache memory to store earlier computations to avoid re-computation) and growing context windows (that enable the model to remember past interactions, key data, etc.).

Astera Labs recently announced that Microsoft is the first to deploy its CXL Smart Memory Controllers into Microsoft’s Azure M-Series VMs. This provides up to an additional 2TB of DDR5 memory capacity with relatively low latency. (An NVL72 GB200 rack has 13.5TB of HBM3e memory).

Figure 2: Astera Labs Leo A1000 CXL Smart Memory Add-in Card

Astera claims this boosts throughput by 40% for LLMs (not clear if this is for 1 card or multiple). Since GPUs spend a lot of time idle, increasing throughput means increased utilization of the GPUs. Getting the results 40% faster roughly means using 40% less power for the same throughput. The additional DDR5 DRAM burns incremental power, but that’s relatively small compared to the NVL72 Blackwells. And the CXL-connected DRAM means that the higher latency DRAM can be reduced in size.

Nvidia recently bought Enfabrica for $900 million for its Accelerated Compute Fabric, which creates a high-speed network to connect GPUs with large pools of DDR expansion memory.

Optimized AI Accelerators

GPUs can run any kind of model and do training as well as inference.

LLMs today are primarily transformer models, and the growing majority of demand is for inference. AI accelerators that are optimized for what the main market needs can be more efficient for those applications. For example, Anthropic, in a recent press release, stated that Google’s TPUs are typically more power-efficient than Nvidia’s GPUs.

Figure 3: Google Ironwood Rack with Optical Inter-rack connection (Source: Hot Chips 2025)

Larger pods using SoW-X (system-on-wafer, 2nd generation)

Nvidia and others have been increasing GenAI throughput/watt with more powerful AI Accelerators, more per package, and scale-up networks connecting more AI accelerators. Nvidia introduced NVL72 this year, and its roadmap grows pods to NVL144, then NVL576. GPUs are going from 1 to 2 to 4 per package. All this uses copper, which is constrained to 1 to 2 meters within a single rack.

As long as copper is the backbone of the scale-up network, a logical next step is to use an entire wafer as an interposer to squeeze more GPUs into a single rack. TSMC in 2020 introduced the first solution called InFO-SoW, which was used by Tesla’s Dojo. More recently, it introduced SoW-X, which adds HBM integration. At the IEEE ECTC (Electronic Components and Technology Conference), TSMC presented a paper on SoW-X describing integration of 16 full-reticle-sized ASICs, 80 HBM4, and 2,800 224Gb/s long-range SerDes, providing massive bandwidth. Clustering more GPUs closer together boosts performance. TSMC estimates SoW-X delivers almost 2X better power efficiency (AI throughput per watt). The number of GPUs per compute tray will double or quadruple (depending on packaging and power density constraints). The GPU 2X efficiency increase is amplified by a 2 to 4X larger pod, which will deliver very roughly a 4 to 8X improvement in throughput/watt. (The rack power is way up, but throughput is up a lot more.)

Figure 4: Nvidia CEO holding what looks like a System on Wafer (GTC March 2025)

There is another TSMC technology, CoWoP (Chip on Wafer on Platform), which removes the package substrate and connects the interposer directly onto the motherboard. Digitimes reports that Nvidia is considering CoWoP. Reducing a layer in the interconnect stack will improve signaling performance at lower power and improve power management.

CPO (co-packaged optics) for scale-out networks

CPO cuts power substantially in scale-out networks. It uses 1/3 the power of pluggable optics and is cheaper and smaller. Roughly 5% to 10% of data center power today is used by pluggable optics. CPO for scale-out networks can reduce this by two-thirds. Broadcom and Nvidia have already introduced CPO switches in parallel with copper versions.

Larger pods using CPO (co-packaged optics)

CPO improves throughput/watt versus copper by enabling pod-size to span multiple racks – whatever copper can do, CPO can enable 4 to 10X increases in pod size, which dramatically reduces the power for a given level of GenAI throughput.

CPO is not an alternative to SoW-X. Both can be used together. If a 2-XPU package can have 256+ optical links, an SoW-X with 16 XPUs could have 1,024 to 2,048 optical links, enabling potentially much larger, much more power-efficient pod sizes.

SoW-X isn’t limited to compute. Imagine a SoW-X switch with 2,048 optical links connecting to 2,048 SoW-X accelerators, each with 16 XPU dies. This creates a 32,000 GPU pod with single hop latency. This would provide much higher throughput/watt for the largest models.

Replace older AI racks

All of the above lead to much greater power efficiency than was available in the past. If power is otherwise unavailable, Hyperscalers will be incentivized to replace older Nvidia GPUs with the latest to get a doubling or quadrupling of throughput per watt. This will be economically feasible if the demand is there.

Software can help too: small language models (SLMs)

The leading-edge models have giant compute requirements and a huge database of knowhow. But if you have a focused application, you don’t need the ability to speak Chinese, quote every line of Shakespeare, or list the Kings of England since 1066. A small language model (SLM) is trained on a focused database optimized for a specific task. It will therefore have one or two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and corresponding lower compute cost and power, but can answer the questions needed about the focused database.

Nature Magazine recently reported on Tiny Recursive Models that outperformed the best LLMs on visual logic puzzles like sudoku and mazes using 1/1,000th the compute.

Emerald.AI’s Conductor Platform is software that works with the data center and the power grids. It appears to give the power grid the ability to, among other things, pause/slow down batch processes to temporarily reduce grid demand. This gives the power provider a lot more flexibility that Emerald AI says will enable the power provider to provide grid access in months, not years. They are working with Nvidia and Digital Realty on the first power-flexible AI factory in Virginia.

Power-efficient AI chips will maximize the US grid & save $

There are numerous options for significant improvements in GenAI power efficiency with ICs.

Even in places where power is plentiful (China, Saudi Arabia), electricity is still a significant cost factor in data center operations.

Power constraints in the USA will spur development of more power-efficient AI chips that should enable the demand for rapidly growing GenAI capacity to be met and save money on electricity. This is also important to reduce the political backlash that will come with rising residential electricity rates.",https://semiengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tate1.jpg?fit=1430%2C840&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 12:01:57.286106

We start with this month’s theme, fermentation, and move on to policy, flex-fuel vehicles and solar energy. Our editors are equally excited about all of them.

First, we look at the evolution of fermentation in ethanol production, specifically how glucoamylase-expressing yeast changed the game. When Lallemand Biofuels & Distilled Spirits introduced the first such product onto the market in 2012, it was a tough sell. As an LBDS spokesperson told us, “Ethanol producers like to be first to be second.” The assessment is quite accurate, in our experience. Today, GA-expressing yeast are a regular and even prominent offering in fermentation product portfolios. Our feature on the evolution and its impacts on yield maximation starts on page 16.

Our second feature this month, starting on page 22, explores the approval of E15 in California, as the California Air Resources Board continues its research into the fuel’s sustainability. It was the last holdout allowing E10, but not E15. It’s an important step for the industry and will help drivers in the state save some money at the pump, as fuel prices continue to rise. The accomplishment is a result of work from trade groups and industry, as well as retailers. A combined effort and significant win.

But as the ethanol industry has focused on E15, what happened to the push for flex-fuel vehicles? While they’ve continued to roll off the assembly line for consumers in other parts of the world, their production stalled in the U.S., swapped for electric vehicles to satisfy Biden-era mandates. But 2025 saw a resurgence, bringing six FFV models onto the market. The ethanol industry has not abandoned the battle to ensure FFVs are a standard option, and the fight continues.

But it will bring the plant’s CI score down a couple points, and comes with cost savings and tax credits. Take a look, on page 36.

North Carolina’s rapid population growth is reshaping the state, creating new opportunities but also straining housing, transportation, schools, and healthcare — challenges that will define the next several decades.

Growth is uneven, with metro areas booming while many rural counties face population loss, declining services, and widening disparities that threaten statewide cohesion and competitiveness.

Meeting the moment requires a coordinated statewide strategy, including major investments in housing, transit, schools, and healthcare, paired with intentional support for rural communities to ensure North Carolina’s future prosperity is shared by all.

Today, Carolina Forward is releasing our latest policy report: North Carolina’s Next Chapter: Harnessing Growth and Shared Prosperity. Our state is entering a defining new era – one that demands clarity, resolve, and long-term thinking.

Policy

North Carolina’s Next Chapter

A strategy for North Carolina’s future

North Carolina is growing at a remarkable pace. The state recently surpassed 11 million residents and added more than 165,000 people in a single year, one of the largest increases in the nation. Demographers project that North Carolina will become the 7th most populous state by the early 2030s, adding between 1 and 3 million residents over the next two decades.

This rapid growth underscores what so many already know: North Carolina is an exceptional place to live, work, and raise a family. But growth also brings real challenges. Housing costs are rising faster than wages. Roads and transit systems are straining under demand. Schools are overcrowded in some areas and under-enrolled in others. Rural communities face shrinking populations and fewer healthcare options. The choices we make now will define the state’s future for decades.

Uneven Growth and Diverging Futures

Population growth in our state is increasingly concentrated in major metro areas such as Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham, and Wilmington. Raleigh alone surpassed 500,000 residents in 2024. Coastal and mountain counties are also attracting new residents, particularly retirees and remote workers seeking natural amenities.

In contrast, many rural counties are experiencing economic stagnation and population decline, especially in the northeast and far west of the state. Younger residents continue to leave these areas in search of opportunity in metro areas; in their place, nearly all rural population growth is coming from out-of-state retirees. These dual effects worsen birthrates and worsen the long-term demographic challenges rural communities face. These shifts make it harder for local governments to maintain schools, roads, and essential services.

Without a statewide strategy, the divide between fast-growing and struggling counties will deepen. That divide will make it harder to pass the investments North Carolina needs to remain competitive.

Housing: A Crisis Touching Every Region

Housing affordability is now one of the state’s most pressing issues. More than one million North Carolinians spend over a third of their income on housing. Median home prices have risen 58 percent since 2017, while incomes have not kept pace. The statewide shortfall now exceeds 764,000 homes through 2029.

Urban regions face bidding wars, soaring rents, and rapid gentrification. Rural areas struggle with aging housing stock and wages that are too low for even modest homes. Without a significant increase in supply and updated zoning laws, affordability will continue to erode.

Transportation: A System Falling Behind

North Carolina maintains the second-largest state-run road system in the United States. A third of major roads are in poor or mediocre condition. Congestion is worsening, too. Raleigh drivers lose 36 hours per year in traffic, and Charlotte commuters lose 47.

Transit expansion has stalled. Projects such as Charlotte’s Silver Line and the Triangle commuter rail have run into political and funding barriers. Rural counties face even more severe challenges with limited public transit and long distances to jobs and healthcare.

North Carolina, if it fails to modernize funding and invest in both roads and transit, will face worsening bottlenecks that harm economic growth.

Education: Overcrowding, Decline, and a Shrinking Teacher Pipeline

Fast-growing counties struggle with overcrowded schools, while rural districts face declining enrollment and shrinking tax bases. North Carolina has not passed a statewide school construction bond since 1996, even though unmet school capital needs now exceed $13.5 billion.

The teacher pipeline has also weakened significantly. Enrollment in UNC education programs has declined 35 percent. Districts across the state cannot fill positions in subjects such as math, science, and special education. Rural schools, which cannot match urban salary supplements, struggle the most.

These trends threaten North Carolina’s long-term workforce and economic competitiveness.

Healthcare: Metro Expansion and Rural Loss

Urban regions are dominated by large hospital systems, many of which have merged and reduced competition, contributing to higher prices for patients. Rural communities face the opposite problem. Eight rural hospitals have closed since 2010, leaving some counties without emergency rooms or maternity care.

Medicaid expansion increased coverage for hundreds of thousands, but recent federal policy changes have put that progress at risk. Many rural counties already face severe shortages of providers. Losing hospitals accelerates economic decline and worsens health outcomes.

Building One Stronger North Carolina

North Carolina stands at a turning point. The decisions we make today will shape our state’s future for decades to come. In North Carolina’s Next Chapter, we provide a policy roadmap for lawmakers to make the key investments today that will harness growth to serve all our state’s people:

Build more housing and modernize zoning.

Modernize transportation funding and expand transit.

Pass a statewide school construction bond and rebuild the teacher pipeline.

Stabilize rural healthcare and protect Medicaid expansion.

Reform the tax structure so counties are not forced to carry the burden alone.

Invest intentionally in rural communities so growth is shared.

North Carolina has the momentum and the talent to build a stronger future. With thoughtful leadership and smart investments, we can ensure that every community, from Murphy to Manteo, shares in the state’s success.",https://carolinaforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fork.webp,N,,2025-12-08 11:03:49.854934
,Clean Energy ,2025-12-08 14:18:34+00:00,Richmond Confidential,State grant spurs possibility of wind turbines off the Richmond coast,Patricio Provencio,,,,,https://richmondconfidential.org/2025/12/08/state-grant-spurs-possibility-of-wind-turbines-off-the-richmond-coast/,"The California Energy Commission awarded Richmond a $750,000 grant to study the feasibility of bringing wind turbine manufacturing to the city’s port.
More specifically, exploring the development of a fabrication and logistics facility for floating offshore wind turbines.
Richmond, too, has been looking at bringing offshore wind infrastructure to the city for a few years.
When presented with the report that June, Richmond City Council was taken with the idea.
“The state of California has a new industry being created with offshore wind that requires all ports to make it work,” said Mayor Eduardo Martinez.","First in a two-part series on Richmond’s exploration into wind turbine manufacturing. This series is part of “The Stakes,” a UC Berkeley Journalism project on executive orders and actions affecting Californians and their communities.

After decades of manufacturing declines, Richmond leaders have a new pitch: retool the city’s industrial legacy for clean energy.

In October, California placed a bet on that vision. The California Energy Commission awarded Richmond a $750,000 grant to study the feasibility of bringing wind turbine manufacturing to the city’s port. More specifically, exploring the development of a fabrication and logistics facility for floating offshore wind turbines.

While the grant covers the cost of the planning phase, the actual construction of a facility capable of handling and manufacturing floating turbine components is a significant financial undertaking. For context, a similar project in California focused on staging and assembly has an estimated cost of $4.7 billion.

The development of this type of facility is heavily reliant on public investment, as the required infrastructure upgrades are often too costly for private entities alone, making state funding critical for “de-risking” the investment and attracting private capital.

Proponents, however, remain supportive of the proposal and argue the long-term benefits of the facility justify the effort.

“A project like this will bring revenue and jobs to the city, and by building green infrastructure we’re also going to have a better environment,” said Richmond Vice Mayor Cesar Zepeda, a champion of city environmental initiatives.

While wind turbines produce green energy, they are not entirely good for the environment. For example, construction of an offshore platform requires dredging, which would disturb marine habitats and kick up contaminants that have settled on the sea floor. Such a project also would bring more vessels — and subsequent air, water and noise pollution — as platforms and turbines are assembled and installed. Once in operation, turbines would be hazardous to birds. And eventually, they would need to be decommissioned, posing additional environmental concerns.

For the past several years, California’s long coastline has been seen as an asset to transitioning the state to alternative energy. In 2021, the Biden administration announced the development of first-of-a-kind offshore wind energy projects in central and northern California, aiming to deploy 4.6 gigawatts by 2030, enough energy to power 1.6 million homes.

By December 2022, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management secured over $750 million in bids from energy companies willing to jump in the water, and began leasing sites. It seemed only a matter of time before the Biden era industrial policy spurred a wind production boom, setting off a race between cities to attract the industry.

But investment was abruptly halted by the Trump administration, which canceled $679 million in nationwide funding for offshore wind infrastructure projects in August. To recoup some of those losses, California legislators authorized $225.7 million in state funds in September for offshore wind ports and related facilities.

Adam Stern, executive director of the advocacy group Offshore Wind California, said in a Sept. 12 statement that despite “the unfortunate federal headwinds this year,” the grants were a “proof point of California’s progress and continued support for offshore wind.”

The Energy Commission’s award to Richmond is part of a larger $42.5 million package for wind energy projects at five ports: Long Beach, $20 million; Humboldt Bay, $18.25 million; Port San Luis, $3 million; and Oakland, $750,000.

Much like Richmond, the Port of Oakland will use its grant money for a feasibility study to identify, evaluate and design port areas for a potential offshore wind manufacturing and staging facility.

If the facility does get built, skilled workers would be welding and fabricating blades that are nearly as long as a football field, over 330 feet long, weigh up to 77,000 pounds, and are made from materials such as fiberglass and carbon fiber reinforced polymers to keep them from breaking down in the ocean. The blades would then be staged and pre-assembled at the port before being shipped out for installation on platforms at sea.

Green-blue jobs

Richmond has long ties to the fossil fuel industry. The Chevron Refinery, which opened in 1902 as Standard Oil Co., pre-dates the city itself. Today, Chevron is the city’s largest employer, with 2,500 workers and its refinery produces 257,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

Two decades ago, nearly 20% of the city’s workforce was employed in manufacturing, the highest rate in the East Bay, according to Richmond’s economic development plan. But Richmond has lost at least 500 manufacturing jobs since then and has become increasingly reliant on Chevron, which also is the city’s biggest taxpayer.

City leaders want to position the port and its skilled workforce for the next generation of clean energy jobs, setting the goal in the city’s “Green-Blue New Deal” of creating 1,000 of these jobs by 2040. The term “green-blue” is meant to center sustainable ocean practices as part of greening the economy. The city also pledged to end all fossil fuel use by the same date.

Tim Sbranti, executive director of the Contra Costa Building and Construction Trades Council, described the grant — and the potential manufacturing facilities it could help unlock — as a “great opportunity” for Richmond’s work force.

Richmond’s advantages

The agreement between Richmond and the state Energy Commission is about planning, identifying potential sites and taking development up to 30% of the design stage. Potential sites at Richmond’s port include Terminal 1, Terminal 2, Terminal 3 and Point Potrero Marine Terminal.

The yet-to-be-named contractor, which is currently awaiting City Council approval, also will assess permitting and environmental challenges, develop a strategy for local workforce training and make inroads with community stakeholders. The study is slated for completion by March 2030.

Charles Gerard, Richmond port director, said that the approval process will be completed this month and the contractor’s name will be made public once City Council approves the project. Gerard added that the development of a terminal could take five to 10 years.

“There’s a lot of variables related to the development and deployment of offshore wind and many of those are hard to predict,” Gerard said, adding that the lack of federal support would create delays.

If all goes well, there’s no guarantee manufacturers will move in. Officials positioned the Port of San Francisco as a potential hub for developing offshore wind infrastructure, self-funding a conceptual plan in 2023. However, according to Eric Young, port spokesperson, the project has not secured any additional funding since then.

Richmond, too, has been looking at bringing offshore wind infrastructure to the city for a few years.

In April 2022, the city awarded a $300,000 contract to consulting firm Appraccel, LLC, which published a report about a year later recommending offshore wind turbine manufacturing as key to bringing in new jobs. That helped Richmond leaders boost their case for the state grant, Zepeda said.

In June 2023, the City Council received an assessment by the consultant firm Moffatt & Nichol about the potential to host an offshore wind manufacturing facility. The assessment, which was part of a regional study paid for by the U.S. Interior Department, identified a few hurdles, particularly manufacturing constraints in the port and uncertainties around the assembly process.

It found Richmond had several advantages, including a navigable channel, a sheltered harbor, large assembly yards and a skilled workforce.

When presented with the report that June, Richmond City Council was taken with the idea.

“The state of California has a new industry being created with offshore wind that requires all ports to make it work,” said Mayor Eduardo Martinez. “Richmond is set to be one of those ports.”

Michigan Potash's proposed mine would draw almost 800,000 tons of potash, an agricultural fertilizer, from a facility in mid-Michigan's Osceola County.

Here's what to know about potash mining in Michigan.

What's happening with Michigan Potash?

Michigan Potash is partnering with Group1 Inc., an Austin-based startup, which is developing a potassium-ion battery that it says will be safer than lithium-ion batteries and will help America meet its exponentially growing power needs without critical minerals from foreign sources not always friendly to the U.S.

""From agriculture to energy, we're proving that the same element that powers our crops can power our critical infrastructure,"" said Group1 CEO Alexander Girau in a release.

Under the memorandum of understanding, the companies will explore not only long-term supply and co-investment opportunities, but strategic links between Michigan Potash's production and processing infrastructure and Group1's advanced potassium-ion battery manufacturing. The agreement envisions Group1 battery backup systems in use at the potash mine in Evart.

What is potash?

Potash is a trade name for potassium-bearing minerals typically used for agricultural fertilizer, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management said. Potash includes potassium nitrate, potassium chloride and potassium sulfate.

Potassium-ion batteries are considered an alternative to lithium-ion batteries.

Where is potash found in Michigan?

Large reserves of high-grade potash are more than a mile and a half underground in north-central Michigan.

The Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the American multinational food processing and commodities trading giant, also has partnered with Michigan Potash to sell its fertilizer directly to farmers and the U.S. agricultural industry.

What is the Michigan Potash project?

Michigan Potash is seeking to open a potash mine that would extract nearly 800,000 tons per year of potash and 1 million tons per year of table salt. The mine, which would use a fracking-like process, has been in the works for more than a decade.

Michigan Potash would use a process known as solution mining, which would pump heated water and brine (concentrated salt water) into a deep geologic formation known as the A1 Evaporite.

The fluids would dissolve salt and potash, which would be pumped back to the surface. The process would require millions of gallons of water.

Where would Michigan Potash's mine be located?

The proposed potash mine would be near Schofield Road and 120th Avenue in Evart Township in Osceola County, in mid-Michigan.

Where do Michigan Potash's permits stand?

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy's Air Quality Division last approved an air permit ""to install"" for Michigan Potash on March 28, according to the MiEnviro Portal map.

The status of wetland permits could not be found on the state's interactive map.

Policy delays are starting to bite.
During our ongoing dialogue with government, BEAMA is consistently calling for policy action to catch-up with the UK’s ambitions to inspire business confidence again.","With the government’s Industrial Strategy, clean jobs growth plan and commitment to Clean Power 2030 setting a solid foundation for growth, BEAMA’s latest Pulse Report shows room for industry optimism, while warning of the effects of greater policy and political uncertainty upon the industry; a point raised at its conference by BEAMA CEO Yselkla Farmer.

The reports findings show a bounce back in sales for Q3 vs Q2 across many sectors of the electrotechnical industry. However, continued policy delays, bottlenecks in construction approvals, and long network infrastructure lead times has dragged back optimism to a five year average.

The government has set ambitious goals for decarbonising the UK energy system by 2030, banning the sale of new ICE vehicles from 2035, and accelerating progress towards Net Zero 2050 – all measures which should increase industry confidence in reliable demand for electrification products over the coming decades. However, lack of detailed implementation plans and policy reversals, such as the government’s decision to water down the ZEV mandate, have undermined causes for optimism, which should be some cause for concern for government.

Industry optimism is not a theoretical metric but translates into tangible benefits for the UK economy: a more optimistic industry – confident in the demand for its products – can invest in UK manufacturing capacity, creating thousands of high skilled jobs. Greater investment leads to a more efficient industry, driving down the cost to consumers of essential upgrades to UK energy, transport and heating infrastructure.

BEAMA CEO, Yselkla Farmer, outlined the challenges the industry is facing:

Whilst we are very pleased to see sales growth in the last reported quarter, we must be mindful that members’ lukewarm optimism could soon undermine investor confidence if the UK government does not address growing political uncertainty and a lack of clarity on market delivery. Construction and network investment are both coming under pressure from Gateway 2 and 3 delays. Electrical network business plans must prioritise more consistent and predictable order patterns under Ofgem’s supervision. To accelerate progress towards Clean Power 2030, the government must urgently address these challenges and follow through with credible delivery plans.

Policy delays are starting to bite. Repeated delays to the Future Homes Standard and the Warm Homes Plan do not inspire confidence. Couple these with the lack of a sustainable long-term resolution to electricity pricing other than the ‘quick fix’ budget intervention and we can see there is much more government can be doing to promote growth.

Amongst the greater concerns for our sector is the average underutilisation of manufacturing capacity across our industry; operating between 67.8% and 76.8% depending on the specific BEAMA sector measured. With at least 25% of manufacturing capacity sitting idle and unproductive, our industry is not experiencing a one-in-a-generation ‘all hands to the pump’ coordinated effort often described in Government rhetoric. During our ongoing dialogue with government, BEAMA is consistently calling for policy action to catch-up with the UK’s ambitions to inspire business confidence again.",https://elementallondon.show/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BEAMA-Market-Pulse-Cover-q3-2025.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 13:03:04.632152

OSLO, Norway (P&GJ) — Carbon-capture company Capsol Technologies has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a major U.S. utility to develop the first commercial-scale gas-fired power plant using the company’s CapsolGT® technology.

The agreement grants the Norwegian firm exclusivity to advance project development for what would mark Capsol’s entry into the North American utility market. The project aims to demonstrate a low-carbon, dispatchable power solution for natural-gas generation using direct carbon capture.

“In the U.S. utility market, decarbonization must go hand in hand with affordability and reliability,” said Philipp Staggat, Chief Product Officer at Capsol Technologies. “CapsolGT® is engineered to be the cost leader for decarbonizing existing gas turbine plants, giving utilities and large power users a practical route to low-carbon, dispatchable power.”

CapsolGT® is designed to capture more than 95% of CO₂ directly from turbine exhaust while reusing waste heat to produce additional electricity—without the need for steam or combined-cycle systems. The company said the solution is well-suited for high-demand applications such as data centers, where energy use is rapidly increasing due to AI and cloud computing.

Natural gas currently accounts for about 36% of U.S. power generation, making it the country’s dominant and most durable hydrocarbon energy source. Capsol said the MoU also includes an assessment of additional opportunities to deploy the technology across the utility’s existing and planned power projects.

Generators 'take advantage' of market Nationally, the Australian Energy Regulator's (AER) last market report found electricity prices were staying relatively high despite increasing renewable generation, which is cheaper.
That's in part because some generators were withholding electricity from the market, which can artificially drive up prices.","The cost of electricity is being driven up by tens of millions of dollars by some Western Australian power producers breaking the rules and charging more than they're allowed, the state's economic watchdog alleges.

In the latest alleged breach, WA's largest privately-owned generator, Bluewaters Power, hiked the wholesale price of electricity by about $30 million over eight months, the Economic Regulation Authority (ERA) claims.

Wholesale costs make up about 40 per cent of the average household power bill.

In WA, the state government shields households from the immediate impacts of spikes in wholesale prices, but the more they happen, the more they can trickle down to bills.

A complex market

The ERA's chair Steve Edwell said the Bluewaters blowout was part of an ""increasing number"" of electricity generators using their power in a concentrated market to charge higher prices than they should.

Such behaviour is not allowed in WA as generators are only allowed to sell electricity to retailers, like Synergy, at-cost.

But the Japanese-owned company said its pricing was necessary to ensure it could reliably power the WA electricity grid, and argues its market impact was only a fraction of the $30 million claimed by the ERA.

""The alleged breaches relate to periods of time when Bluewaters faced coal and water shortages and was managing its generation,"" a Bluewaters spokesperson said.

Supply shortages can lead to reduced production capacity, which is often reflected in the market with higher prices.

Bluewaters claimed the ERA had ""misunderstood the relevant facts"" and incorrectly applied the law.

It follows another case earlier this year, where the ERA found Alinta had increased the cost of generation by $66 million over a similar time span, which the company is also disputing.

One thing both the regulator and industry can agree on is the market, and the rules, have become increasingly complex with the uptake of renewable energy.

Generators 'take advantage' of market

Nationally, the Australian Energy Regulator's (AER) last market report found electricity prices were staying relatively high despite increasing renewable generation, which is cheaper.

That's in part because some generators were withholding electricity from the market, which can artificially drive up prices.

""Participants can take advantage of market conditions to make significant financial returns,"" the report said.

In a statement, an AER spokesperson said the practice of setting higher prices ""cannot be false or misleading"", but was otherwise allowed.

""However patterns of this kind of behaviour could lead to inefficiencies in the market and may not be in the best interests of energy consumers,"" the spokesperson said.

Cost of living concerns

The market behaviour noted by the AER is not allowed in Western Australia, where generators are only allowed to sell electricity to retailers at cost price.

Instead, they are paid to be available on demand, such as in times of high need — a sort of insurance policy in what's called a capacity market.

Mr Edwell acknowledged the energy market was becoming increasingly complex with the onset of renewables, which may be contributing to some market breaches.

But he warned those companies still had to ensure they ""only recover their legitimate costs"".

""It's important that we pay no more than we need to, and that's no more apparent than now with the cost pressures we're all facing,"" he said.

WA Energy Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said it was not appropriate for her to comment on the Bluewaters case while it was being considered by the regulator, and did not respond to questions about reforms to regulation.

""It is my expectation that all generators operate lawfully to ensure customers are not disadvantaged,"" she said.

Griffin uncertainty

Bluewaters' alleged breach comes amid uncertainty about the future of its power plants in WA, as the coal mine that fuels them, operated by Griffin Coal, approaches the end of its government lifeline.

Indian-owned Griffin Coal has been kept afloat by $308 million in taxpayer subsidies since entering receivership in 2022, with debts of about $1.5 billion.

The WA Government has committed to ending its funding of Griffin Coal by June 2026.

Griffin Coal has continued to pay off some of its debt to Indian lenders since receiving the government payouts, raising concerns about WA taxpayer dollars being used to offset the losses of foreign investors.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3e69493bce26a00deed71ca6d61beda0?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=574&cropW=1021&xPos=0&yPos=53&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-12-08 10:01:22.645186

India has installed 39,485 public EV chargers across the country under the PM E-DRIVE Scheme, according to inputs provided by Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), the project implementation agency. Of these, 8,414 are fast chargers for electric cars, marking a significant step in addressing charging accessibility and range anxiety among EV users.

Advt

To further strengthen the ecosystem, the Ministry of Power has issued the 2024 Guidelines for EV Charging Infrastructure, outlining standards, interoperability norms and protocols for both charging and battery-swapping stations. Setting up charging stations remains an unlicensed activity, allowing private entrepreneurs to participate freely. The PM E-DRIVE Scheme has also earmarked ₹2,000 crore exclusively for public charging infrastructure.

The Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) highlighted ongoing efforts to boost electric mobility and manufacturing. Under the PM E-DRIVE’s electric bus procurement programme, 10,900 e-buses have been allocated to five cities in Phase I, with bids opened on 14 November 2025. Another 2,900 e-buses have been sanctioned under Phase II.

While no fixed national EV targets have been set, the Centre is implementing multiple incentive-led schemes:

Advt

PLI Auto & Auto Component Scheme (₹25,938 crore) to promote domestic manufacturing of advanced automotive technology, including EVs.

PLI for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Batteries (₹18,100 crore) to build a 50 GWh battery manufacturing ecosystem.

PM E-DRIVE Scheme (₹10,900 crore) supporting e-2W, e-3W, e-trucks, e-buses, e-ambulances and public charging infrastructure.

PM e-Bus Sewa–PSM Scheme (₹3,435 crore) enabling deployment of over 38,000 electric buses with payment security support.

Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI) requiring minimum investment of ₹4,150 crore and localisation milestones of 25 per cent (Year 3) and 50 per cent (Year 5).

Minister of State for Heavy Industries Bhupathiraju Srinivasa Varma shared these updates in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, noting that the government’s multi-scheme approach is aimed at accelerating EV adoption, strengthening domestic manufacturing and building a reliable charging network nationwide.

The journey continues next year, when the Eurocities Economic Development Forum heads to Barcelona in 2026.","For more than a century and a half, the progress and prosperity of Europe’s cities has been driven by the railway, a way to channel collaboration and communication, to exchange ideas and talent and, ultimately, to connect people and reduce distance.

It is therefore especially fitting that the 2025 Eurocities Economic Development Forum took place at OGR Torino, a former railway repair depot in the heart of the city, now transformed into a hub for creativity and entrepreneurship.

This year, Eurocities joined forces with the European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency (EISMEA) to organise the Cities Innovate Summit, bringing together the Economic Development Forum and the iCapital Awards under one roof on 3-4 December 2025. It was a unique opportunity to gather cities from across Europe to discuss talent, innovation, inclusion and sustainability.

Cities driving Europe’s new innovation agenda

The Cities Innovate Summit in Turin came at a crucial moment for Europe. Cities are expected to lead on climate neutrality, industrial transformation and social cohesion, while competing globally with innovation powerhouses in the United States and China.

Innovation is truly effective when people are at the centre

— Stefano Lo Russo, Mayor of Turin

From the start, the message was clear: innovation only works when it focuses on supporting people. “Innovation is truly effective when people are at the centre,” said Stefano Lo Russo, Mayor of Turin, underlining the city’s ambition to remain an open and connected place that attracts talent, ideas and investment while creating social inclusion. “Technology accelerates this process, but real change comes from working together.”

This approach reflects Turin’s legacy as European Capital of Innovation: winning through innovation, growing through collaboration, lasting through legacy. Participants in the forum explored how cities can combine innovation, inclusion and competitiveness, ensuring no one is left behind while powering Europe’s industrial and green transition.

“Cities are where Europe’s industrial future will be built,” said André Sobczak, Secretary General of Eurocities. “They are already innovating on the ground, but they need more recognition, skills and resources to keep leading the way.”

The power of place and identity

Identity and visibility are strong assets for cities to thrive. Barcelona offered a compelling example. As Marc Sans from the city explained, “The Barcelona Brand is now one of the most powerful city brands in the world, but it’s based on collaboration, not competition.”

Working hand in hand with the Catalan government, Barcelona has developed joint initiatives such as the Barcelona Catalonia Startup Ecosystem, promoting startups and research centres abroad.

Elsewhere, Ghent showed how smaller cities can make a global mark. With a strong biotech and cleantech ecosystem, the city has turned its regional identity into an advantage. “Start with who you are, find your edge and never forget that it’s a people’s game,” said Frederik van Hacke, from the municipality of Ghent. “The stronger your network, the stronger your ecosystem.”

Cities are already innovating on the ground, but they need more recognition, skills and resources to keep leading the way

— André Sobczak, Secretary General of Eurocities

Cities also shared strategies to balance tourism and liveability. In Spain, where housing affordability tops public concerns, Barcelona is tightening rules on short-term rentals and redirecting tourist tax revenue to retrofit public buildings. Genoa, Ghent and Frankfurt, meanwhile, are using similar taxes to fund maintenance or diversify visitor flows beyond crowded areas, redefining tourism as a driver of balanced and sustainable urban economies.

Lenka Kolarova from Prague, Chair of the Economic Development Forum for 2025–2026, set the priorities for the coming year: “City attractiveness, skills for the green and digital transitions, balanced tourism and reindustrialisation. Our goal is to make these priorities practical for city managers.”

Innovation districts where creativity meets technology

If collaboration is the engine of innovation, innovation districts are where that engine comes to life. The OGR Torino venue itself embodies this shift.

Through programmes like Hello Torino, ToTem for Founders and Ignite Torino, the municipality helps innovators settle in the city, offering mentoring, legal support and access to accelerators and urban testing. Over 450 startups have already benefited from the initiative, which blends municipal support with private partnerships.

Gavin Poole, CEO of Here East in London, shared how East London transformed the 2012 Olympic Park into a living innovation ecosystem. “What if all these buildings became engines for innovation?” he asked. The result is a campus for games design, fashion and tech that has created over 10,000 jobs. “If you leave culture out of your innovation district, you weaken your ability to create and grow,” he said.

Across Europe, cities are experimenting with similar models. San Sebastian’s dense innovation ecosystem, Bologna’s Tecnopolo and Innovation Square and the collaborative platforms in Aalborg, Grenoble Alpes Metropole and Nicosia all show how urban spaces can become testbeds for sustainable industry, driven by public-private partnerships and local talent.

We must electrify our whole economy, rebuild our industrial base, and do it in a social way so that people don’t lose their jobs.

— Willem van Winden, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences

Building cities that attract and keep talent

Innovation is meaningless without people. Cities are now focusing on how to attract, develop and retain talent in ways that improve quality of life.

San Sebastian’s experience stood out. Through its municipal development agency Fomento de San Sebastian, the city supports researchers and entrepreneurs with housing, co-working and training spaces. Its EKINN programme even facilitates accommodation for people looking to start a business. “We want people not only to work here, but to live here,” said Yesenia Otamendi, from the city of San Sebastian. The quality of life is also boosted by the Basque city.

In Bologna, the Innovation Square brings together local firms, universities and startups in challenge-based programmes that foster collaboration and showcase the city’s creative potential. Regional laws in Emilia-Romagna now link new investment to talent retention, ensuring that economic growth benefits residents.

Europe’s next industrial transformation starts in cities

The next decade will define how Europe’s industry adapts to a green and digital future. Cities are leading this shift: redesigning grids, rethinking manufacturing and investing in clean technologies. But they cannot do it alone.

Willem van Winden, from Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, summarised the challenge: “We must electrify our whole economy, rebuild our industrial base, and do it in a social way so that people don’t lose their jobs. Cities are where this transformation will actually happen.”

Across the sessions, the consensus was that cities need long-term competences, funding and partnerships to bridge the gap between innovation policy and real change on the ground. Europe’s strength lies in its diversity of cities: large and small, northern and southern, where ambition and creativity drive local innovation for the benefit of all.

Celebrating innovation: the 2026 iCapital Awards

The Cities Innovate Summit also hosted this year’s European Capital of Innovation Awards, celebrating cities that excel in adopting innovative solutions to improve residents’ lives.

If you leave culture out of your innovation district, you weaken your ability to create and grow

— Gavin Poole, CEO of Here East in London

Grenoble Alpes Metropole was crowned European Capital of Innovation 2026 for its forward-thinking approach to sustainable urban development, renewable energy, smart infrastructure and community-driven innovation. Rotterdam and Liverpool followed in second and third place.

In the European Rising Innovative City category, the city of Aalborg took first place, recognised for integrating technology into urban planning and fostering cross-sector collaboration across education, healthcare and clean energy. San Sebastian and Nicosia were awarded second and third place respectively.

Looking ahead to Barcelona 2026

The forum in Turin closed with a shared sense of purpose: to continue leading Europe’s green and digital transformation, cities need the right tools, resources and recognition at every level. The journey continues next year, when the Eurocities Economic Development Forum heads to Barcelona in 2026.

From the railways that once connected Europe’s industrial past to today’s innovation districts, the message remains the same: cities drive a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous future for all.

I started my career at V.C. Summer, working alongside hundreds of dedicated engineers, technicians and community leaders who believed deeply in the promise of nuclear energy. We believed in what the project could mean for the state — reliable power, good-paying jobs, and a long-term investment in South Carolina’s economic resilience.

Those early years shaped not only my professional path but my commitment to advancing nuclear energy as a force for progress.

Seeing momentum return to V.C. Summer brings both pride and hope.

Pride because I know the caliber of the people who poured their expertise, sweat and heart into the site.

Hope because the renewed attention signals something bigger — a second chance to fulfill the potential this project has always held.

The future of V.C. Summer isn’t just about reactors, concrete, or systems.

It’s about people. It’s about the workforce that will be trained, the families who will thrive on new opportunities, and the communities that will benefit.

When a state commits to developing nuclear infrastructure, it commits to stability, innovation, and economic strength for decades to come.

That’s why events like the 2nd Annual South Carolina Nuclear Summit are so important to our state and industry.

Leaders from across the country will gather here in South Carolina to discuss the future of nuclear energy, the electric grid and the role our state can play in strengthening the energy landscape.

As someone who began his career at V.C. Summer, I see this summit as a powerful opportunity for professionals to come together, share ideas and advance the conversations that will shape our region’s growing need for nuclear infrastructure, reactor development, and reliable clean energy.

New nuclear power plants don’t make sense for South Carolina

South Carolina is uniquely positioned right now.

With the right vision, V.C. Summer can be a catalyst — not only for energy generation but for job creation, technology development, and statewide economic growth.

As someone who has spent nearly two decades in nuclear development, both in the field and through years of research leadership, I’ve seen firsthand what successful deployment requires.

It takes technical excellence, committed leadership, intentional planning, and a shared belief in the long-term value of clean, reliable energy.

It also takes experienced teams who understand the complexities of nuclear development from design to deployment — and who know how to get the work done safely and responsibly.

V.C. Summer shaped the beginning of my career.

Who foots the bill? - CalMatters,"Alejandro Lazo, Alejandro Lazo Climate",,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/12/data-center-energy-san-jose/,"How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?
The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need.
According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity.
No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.
PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers.","San Jose, the symbolic capital of Silicon Valley, is now ground zero in California’s battle over how to govern the rise of data centers used to power artificial intelligence.

The county seat of Santa Clara is touting its partnership with Pacific Gas & Electric, claiming the city is “the West Coast’s premier destination for data center development.” The investor-owned utility now estimates it has enough capacity in its planning pipeline to push the city’s electricity use to almost three times its current peak.

Those plans are forcing major grid upgrades, PG&E and city officials say, while raising questions about who pays for them and whether the state can keep the power clean.

Panelists at a CalMatters event in downtown San Jose clashed over key issues. They included a local official working with PG&E on the city’s data-center buildout, a tech advocate urging California to seize the economic moment, a Stanford energy expert pressing for a more modernized grid and a utility watchdog skeptical of AI’s promised benefits.

Their discussion centered on how quickly California should move to accommodate new demand, what information the public should be entitled to and how to keep customers from shouldering the cost of infrastructure that may never be fully used.

Proposals to more strictly regulate data center development died in the Legislature this year. Going forward, several state agencies and commissions are expected to take up further discussions, including the California Energy Commission, the Little Hoover Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission.

How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?

The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need. Companies can propose large facilities without committing to build them, the computing demands behind AI are changing quickly and cooling needs vary across the state. These factors make long-term energy needs hard to pin down.

According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity. That’s enough to power roughly 18 million homes, compared with California’s estimated 14 to 15 million. Regulators don’t expect all of those projects to be built, and assume the ones that do will come online gradually and operate at less than their requested capacity, producing a forecast of between 4 and 6 gigawatts by 2040.

Liang Min, who directs Stanford’s Bits & Watts Initiative, and a speaker on CalMatters’ panel, said that forecasting is particularly tough because companies are rolling out new AI apps — or “application layers,” as he put it — at breakneck speed. They include products like ChatGPT that use large language models. No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.

“Right now we’re really struggling,” Min said. “The risk is extremely high in the application layers.”

The Public Advocates Office, an independent consumer watchdog within the California Public Utilities Commission, recently warned that rapid data-center growth could leave Californians paying for billions of dollars in grid upgrades if projects never materialize or use far less power than promised.

“Ratepayers could end up paying for costly infrastructure upgrades that may not be needed for many years – or at all,” the office said in its commentary.

Min said forecasting data-center load is a national challenge, but California will need better tools to keep rates in check, meet its clean-energy targets and stay competitive with states racing to attract data centers and high-paying tech jobs.

Local officials have also begun to grapple with the uncertainty. In San Jose, city energy officials say they are reluctant to procure additional power until they know which projects will actually be built. “We do not want to buy more power than we need,” said panelist Lori Mitchell, director of San Jose Clean Energy, the city’s publicly-owned electricity provider. “That’s job No. 1.”

What are the environmental concerns around the data center boom?

California’s data-center boom is bringing a wave of environmental concerns that state officials are only beginning to understand. Those concerns center on water use, the carbon emissions tied to rising energy demand and the air pollution from diesel backup generators.

Air quality is a particular concern. While back-up generators run only intermittently, their presence is concentrated in a handful of regions. In Santa Clara County, where many facilities sit close together in dense industrial areas, the local impacts could be greater simply because so much equipment is packed into a small space.

Yet the state still has limited visibility into what data centers are doing. Attempts to require more transparency stalled this year amid tech industry opposition. The only measure that became law gives regulators the authority to determine whether data centers are driving up costs — but stops short of requiring environmental reporting.

Ahmad Thomas, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and another panelist, said his group opposed the electricity disclosure and water reporting measures because they would make California less competitive.

“It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states,” he added.

Consumer advocates say the lack of information leaves communities unprotected. “We certainly think there needs to be more transparency — that’s a good thing,” said panelist Mark Toney, the executive director of the The Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group..

Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy?

The rapid growth of data centers could slow California’s clean-energy transition if it keeps the state tied to natural gas. And some of the carbon-free alternative energy sources that could meet their power needs are deeply controversial among environmentalists.

The state has pledged to reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, yet it still depends heavily on natural-gas plants during hot summer days. A recent report by the environmental think tank Next 10 and UC Riverside estimated that data-center carbon emissions nearly doubled from 2019 to 2023 — largely from gas-fired generation — underscoring how even a relatively clean grid may struggle to absorb AI-driven load without higher emissions.

State leaders are making policy shifts as AI demand grows. California this year approved joining a broader Western power market, a move driven in part by new demands on the grid, including data centers. Critics warn the change could expose the state to dirtier electricity from other states and weaken its control over clean-energy rules.

Min of Stanford argues that California will need to rely on options some environmentalists would rather avoid. That includes holding onto existing resources like the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. In a recent report, Min argued the state will also need more “clean, firm” power — resources that can operate around the clock — such as geothermal energy or natural-gas plants with carbon capture.

PG&E agrees. Spokesperson Stephanie Magallon told CalMatters in an email that nuclear power, carbon-capture systems and large solar-plus-battery projects are all options under consideration for powering data centers in its region. But environmental justice critics in California have opposed carbon capture technology calling it unproven tech that risks extending fossil-fuel use.

Mitchell said community choice aggregators can manage new data-center load while keeping power clean and affordable. San Jose’s mix is already 60% renewable, and she said the biggest opportunity is flexibility — getting data centers to shift use off the hottest afternoons so the city can avoid buying additional power.

Will data centers raise your electric bill?

California’s data-center boom is reshaping the fight over electricity bills, exposing a divide over whether these new customers will lower costs — or drive them higher for everyone else.

PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers. It also claims the grid is underutilized on average — operating at about 45% of capacity — although the grid faces real strain during the hottest hours and in parts of the system that routinely run close to their limits. If data centers can be connected in places with available capacity, PG&E argues, they could help spread costs without worsening congestion.

Toney, another panelist, urged the state to slow down, warning that California is planning major infrastructure without knowing which data centers are real or how their costs will land on customer bills.

“I’m worried that we’re engaged in what I call faith-based policymaking,” he said. “The benefits are very speculative, but the costs are very real.”

Some states, said Toney, have begun tightening rules around the growth of data centers. One law in Oregon will require data-center grid costs to remain off household bills. A Minnesota law will give very large data centers their own billing category so regulators can keep their costs separate from other customers’ electric bills.

“This issue of data centers and the connection between affordability and clean energy is of national concern, and California is actually behind on this,” Toney said. “There’s this mythology about California being the leader all the time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120425_Edgecloud-Link-Data-Center_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 10:01:00.918424

Hawk Dunlap isn’t used to being cold. On a gray day last January when I visited him in West Texas to tour abandoned oil wells, Dunlap—in his mid-50s with a James Brolin vibe—was bundled up, a sweatshirt pulled over his signature red coveralls.

As we drove, Dunlap told me, with a note of sorrow in his deep Texas drawl, that he used to live in Bali, where he went days without wearing a shirt or shoes and swam in a pool he’d installed with the shape of Texas tiled on its bottom. Outside the windshield of his white pickup was an endless expanse of desert scrub and red dirt. Sweeping his arm toward the flat land and looming sky, he laughed and asked, “You see any blue water out here?”

For me, a climate journalist interested in the wreckage of oil and gas drilling, Dunlap is a microcelebrity. For a few years, I have watched videos from him and his partner, lawyer Sarah Stogner, on TikTok. They have gained an avid following by documenting the environmental disasters caused by abandoned wells here in the Permian Basin, one of the most productive oil and gas fields in the world. The two make the blight charming—even funny. One of the first posts that I recall seeing showed Dunlap visiting a sea of wellhead wastewater in the middle of scrubland, wearing that same red boiler suit he donned in January, set over the 2002 hip-hop anthem “Ooh Ahh (My Life Be Like).”

For more than a century, oil companies have sunk wells in this desert looking for liquid gold, leaving countless scars behind. Dunlap showed me wells ensconced by rusted-red pipes and decrepit pumpjacks strewn about the desert. These thousands of forgotten wells are not just inert fossils of economic history. Many emit ­methane­—a greenhouse gas that’s nearly 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide—and leach chemicals, including benzene, a human carcinogen. Recently, another problem has emerged: Old, dormant wells have begun mysteriously leaking—oozing brine onto the land—and shooting geysers of toxic water into the sky.

So far, well cleanup efforts have been haphazard. Many of the original owners never registered their drilling and abandoned their wells when they ran dry. The more conscientious owners plugged them as best they could, but early attempts sometimes used sand or wood—far from the best practice today. Ideally, wells should be plugged with cement deep in the ground, and pumpjacks removed. But landowners say state regulators weren’t motivated enough to make sure that happened. The result has been a mess.

Dunlap is well acquainted with the problem. For 30 years, he worked for oil and gas companies to fix and plug wells all over the world. “I enjoy the outdoors,” he explained. “I used to hunt. I fish, I scuba dive, I play golf. I’m not housebroke, so I’m not inside an awful lot. I care about land, I care about landowners’ rights, I care about water. If that makes me an environmentalist, then so be it. That’s a label that, you know”—his tone turned mocking—“‘Oh, you’re an environmentalist.’ Yeah, okay, I’m a tree hugger. I’ll hug any tree that doesn’t have thorns.”

Dunlap has become part of an unlikely band of folks living in West Texas who are trying to force the government and industry to address the abandoned oil well catastrophe. There’s Ashley Watt, the owner of Antina Ranch, who’s suing oil companies, including Chevron, for the damage they allegedly did to her land. There’s Laura Briggs, whose family runs two local newspapers and who has been a critic of state regulators for years. There’s Schuyler Wight, a fourth-generation rancher, who for the past three years has traveled hundreds of miles to Austin almost every month to give officials a piece of his mind. And there’s Stogner, a take-no-prisoners attorney whose talent for making viral videos—including a campaign ad she filmed of herself straddling a pumpjack wearing nothing but star-shaped pasties and a cowboy hat—has gotten tens of thousands of people to pay attention to this complex issue.

This small crew has spoken to national and local news outlets, spent hundreds of hours on social media, traveled around Texas raising awareness and nagging regulators, and even run for office. Far from being stereotypical lefty climate activists, they have a uniquely Texan approach to safeguarding the land. Each wants the oil industry to thrive. But the lack of accountability has turned them into reluctant, if determined, warriors.

In Texas, where landowners often do not control the rights to the minerals under their property, and oil and gas companies regularly do, a unique political identity has emerged. “I’m not necessarily an environmentalist on all land, but I’m definitely an environmentalist on my land,” Watt said. “That is a very common flavor of West Texas landowner. As you can imagine, West Texas ranchers skew conservative. From an environmental perspective, they could probably care less about saving the whales, but they care a whole lot about their land.”

For Dunlap, it is personal. He is determined to hold an industry that has provided four generations of his family with employment to account. “We’ve been doing things wrong for a very long time,” he said, “and now that we know we’re doing things wrong, we need to start fixing it.”

The exact scope of the abandoned wells problem is hard to pin down but is undeniably enormous. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the number of abandoned oil and gas wells in the US at about 3.9 million, with 2.2 million unplugged. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) says that tackling the abandoned well problem could be equal to removing up to 4.3 million cars from the road for a year.

In recent years, attending to old wells seemed like a rare practical climate solution that everyone could agree on. In 2021, the Biden administration pledged $4.7 billion to help states remediate their orphan wells, more than $300 million of which has been slated for Texas.

Still, that is not nearly enough to address the problem. Regulators report there are more than 10,000 orphan wells—sites with no known owner who could be held responsible for cleaning them up—in the Lone Star State alone. That’s on top of more than 147,000 inactive wells with an identified owner.

The state should be ahead of the curve, with a program created in the 1980s to plug abandoned wells, funded by fees collected from producers. But landowners say Texas continues to be slow in plugging some wells, while refusing to touch others that cause massive problems, from leaks to blowouts.

A big issue is cost. Plugging runs into the mid–five figures, or more, per well. The money needed to tackle the country’s well problem “is staggering,” noted Adam Peltz, a lawyer and director of EDF’s energy program. “It’s at least an order of magnitude more than we have set out now.”

The initial $25 million federal grant given to Texas paid for just 737 wells. When I visited Texas last January, regulators reported the 82 wells it had plugged that month cost more than $2.7 million.

This void has left room for people like Dunlap. After flying from Bali to visit his mother in Houston in late 2021, coronavirus travel restrictions prevented him from returning. An old colleague, with whom Dunlap still talked, had been contacted by residents in Crane County, where a well drilled in the 1940s suddenly shot out a 100-foot geyser of brine on New Year’s Day 2022.

One of those residents was Watt, a former Marine and Harvard Business School graduate who owns Antina Ranch, a 22,000-acre property that spans Crane and Ward counties, 45 minutes southwest of Odessa. Watt was increasingly sounding the alarm about busted wells on her property after one owned by Chevron had mysteriously sprung a leak the year before, causing toxic water to gush to the surface.

Dunlap’s colleague, sensing his friend was cooped up in his mom’s house, recommended him as someone who could help with the blowouts. A stir-crazy ­Dunlap agreed to forfeit his usual fee. “I said, ‘Look, fly me out, put me up, feed me some Allsup’s burritos and some Dr Pepper, and get me what I need to work with, and it won’t be nothing.’”

When he first visited Antina Ranch in January 2022, Dunlap began to realize how big the well problem in the Permian Basin ­really was. Giving me a version of a tour of the ranch he first received from Watt back then, Dunlap showed me one of the things that he first noticed: The mesquite trees—spiny desert scrubs that are nearly impossible to kill—were all dead near sites of the old wells. “When I first put my feet on the ground out here,” he recalled, “I knew something was wrong.”

Watt hired Dunlap to help excavate and investigate the old wells on her property. It was a far cry from what he was used to earning from helping major industry players plug wells. But, he explained, “I wanted to understand what was happening.” From there, the interest grew. “Once I understood what was happening, I started seeing how much of a bigger problem it was across the state—and across the nation.”

Perhaps the most extreme example is a site that locals call Lake Boehmer: a massive, briny, sulfuric, radioactive pool of toxic water springing from a cluster of abandoned wells near the tiny town of Imperial. Lake Boehmer’s original wells were drilled in the 1950s for oil, then later repurposed for water to irrigate farmland—a not-uncommon practice for unproductive oil wells.

All was quiet until the early 2000s, when the wells suddenly began churning up a poisonous mix of oil, arsenic, refuse, and water saltier than the ocean from deep underground. Over the past two decades, the lake, named after its absentee owner, has grown into a 60-plus-acre bright cerulean sea, noted even on Google Maps. In the lake, you can see one well bubbling up like a massive jet of a Jacuzzi, spewing 200 gallons per minute.

Lake Boehmer is perhaps the most ­visually shocking disaster in the region, but it’s far from the only one. In October 2024, residents in Reeves County smelled rotten eggs. Soon after, a 100-foot geyser shot out of an old well. (It took almost three weeks to seal it.) In Upton County, a 200-foot-wide, 40-foot-deep sinkhole appeared around a well—the air around it stunk like crude oil.

Experts suspect that fracking, which ramped up significantly in the Permian in the 2010s, is the cause. At drill sites, the fracking process involves pumping millions of gallons of water—along with sand and chemicals—down into tight rock formations. The water pressure creates cracks and releases natural gas and oil; the wastewater then travels back up to the surface. In Texas, most of that wastewater is reinjected underground. Initially, frackers sent this water deep into the earth. But geologists said that practice caused earthquakes. So oil and gas companies began to reinject the water closer to the surface, which, growing research suggests, causes the leaks and blowouts in old wells, as the wastewater travels unpredictably through geological faults. (A 2024 study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found that the 2022 New Year’s Day geyser was likely the result of overpressurization of a local aquifer, thanks to wastewater injection several miles away.)

The wells on Antina Ranch present yet another aspect of the problem around the Permian. Many of the wells on Watt’s property are technically not orphaned. In fact, most have been registered as plugged and fixed in state databases. But, for the most part, owners of those wells haven’t been required to do maintenance or check on them. ­Dunlap discovered, when he started digging on Antina, all of the wells he looked at that the state counted as plugged were leaking. The plug jobs had steadily eroded after decades in the elements, and trash had been poured down some of them. Dunlap calls these “zombie wells.”

“[Some of] these wells are 70 years old,” he explained. “If you take a 70-year-old man, and he’s in the hospital and he’s having multiple failures, you’re not going to be able to heal him for cheap. It’s going to be days in the hospital, treatments, it’s going to be medication, it’s going to be surgery…and it’s going to run into the millions. You can’t really just give him a can of ­Gatorade and a can of Vienna sausages [and say], ‘Take one of these, drink one of these, you’ll be fine.’”

Despite the varied issues, the problem of the wells can be traced back to an original sin. “We’ve drilled a lot of wells that we didn’t take proper care of,” said Peltz, the EDF attorney. “If you don’t deal with them, you get stuff like Boehmer Lake.”

When Stogner first came to West Texas, she couldn’t believe what she was seeing. She visited Lake Boehmer and “was like, ‘What the fuckity fuck is this?’” she recalled. “How are we all not like, ‘This is not okay, guys’?”

Like Dunlap, Stogner also used to work for the industry, providing legal services for oil and gas companies for more than 10 years in Louisiana before moving to Texas in 2017. During the first wave of Covid, she befriended Watt on Twitter. As Stogner went through a separation from her husband, Watt let her move into her pool house in 2021. Living on Watt’s ranch, Stogner, now in her early 40s, started making TikToks about bad plugging jobs and the ensuing pollution, which began amassing views.

She soon focused on what she saw as a key problem: the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC), the confusingly named state regulatory body that oversees oil and gas production and the plugging of wells. ­Officially, abandoned wells are plugged in order of urgency, determined by the risks they pose to the environment and human populations. But because the RRC lacks serious enforcement mechanisms—critics say there are minimal fines and a lack of monitoring for lax operators—few incentives exist for companies to clean up their messes. Bigger operators often end up selling aging wells to smaller entities as less oil is produced; those smaller firms tend to lack resources to clean things up.

The RRC has said in the past that it is working “aggressively” to plug wells and that it enforces strict rules and stringent regulations around plugging. In a statement, the agency also told me that officials “remain steadfastly committed to addressing issues related to produced water injection through diligent monitoring and scientific research.” Still, landowners and advocates I spoke with ­believe the agency is far too cozy with the industry to be an effective regulator. A 2023 Texas Monthly investigation found that the family of Christi Craddick, who has served on the three-person RRC board since 2012, raked in $10 million in 2022 alone from oil and gas royalties.

By late 2021, Stogner was pissed off enough to challenge RRC Commissioner Wayne Christian for office. With little to lose, she filmed the campaign video of herself, nearly nude, straddling a pumpjack—an approach, she told me, that was thought up over a couple of beers on Super Bowl Sunday. The spot went viral and caused an uproar: The San Antonio Express-News even pulled its endorsement of her. But Stogner didn’t much care what the public thought of her, so long as her message was getting out.

“My only regret is that I didn’t do it sooner,” she told me at the time. “I thought, ‘I am confident that I’ve got the substance behind me, so if I can just get their attention, I’ll win them over.’ Like, ‘Vote for anybody but Wayne [Christian]—take a look.’” She was right. A month later, the San Antonio Express-News re-endorsed her, contrasting Stogner’s solid critiques of the orphan well problem with Christian’s “heavy ethical baggage” in taking funds from polluting companies.

Stogner lost the primary in 2022, but by then, she had a fan base. Her TikTok videos about old wells had amassed tens of thousands of followers. She was now a force to be reckoned with. Using evidence Dunlap was collecting on the ranch, Stogner helped Watt file a lawsuit alleging that Chevron and other operators had left behind hundreds of improperly plugged wells on Antina. Stogner thinks the companies should clean up the wells and compensate owners for the damage. The lawsuit is set to go to trial in 2026 and, if successful, could open the door for other landowners to hold big oil companies accountable.

When I first got to Antina Ranch, ­Dunlap and Stogner took me out to the remnants of a well drilled in the 1950s and later plugged. It’s a big hole surrounded by chunks of crumbled concrete; at the bottom, a rusted pipe sticks a foot up from the dirt, vile liquid pooling around a cap in the top. Dunlap dipped in his pinkie, and it came away black and slick with oil.

“They need to spend about a million dollars on this just to replug it,” Stogner said. “Then they need to spend probably another million or $2 million delineating and remediating the extent of pollution…If they’d done it right in the first place, they probably could have done it for a couple hundred thousand. But because they tried to do it for $5,000 or $10,000—this is what we get.”

After examining the well, Dunlap and Stogner drove me to a low-slung ranch house on Antina that they refer to as the “headquarters” for its well operations. Over Topo Chicos, they told me the story of how they first started working together in early 2022. Following ­Dunlap’s first visit to Antina, as Stogner’s RRC campaign heated up, she began peppering him with questions over text about various issues with wells on the ranch. Dunlap, who’d returned to his mom’s house back in Houston, had all the time in the world to answer.

“Hawk had nothing else to do, and he was very knowledgeable—he was bored,” Stogner explained. “He was responsive, and I trusted what he had to say. I knew that he wasn’t trying to mess with me.”

Dunlap, in turn, found himself with an unexpectedly eager wellhead pupil. “She was running around out here, putting her fingers in wellheads and stuff—well, I was telling her to,” he remembered. “She’d send me a picture and say: What is this?Well, put your finger in it.” He was surprised, he said, when she took the joke literally: “She’d go, wait a minute, I’ll be back. No, no, no—don’t do that.”

Dunlap’s jobs overseas kept getting canceled due to Covid. Eventually, he figured he’d tag along on Stogner’s campaign and give her a crash course in abandoned wells. They hit it off on the road. Stogner told me later that she knew she had a potential social media darling on her hands, comparing him to famous oil well firefighter Red Adair.

“People loved the well stuff, but they hated me because I was a woman—what do I know?” she said. “But when the messenger is him, and his accent, and the lip of tobacco, yes, I knew he was going to hit.”

Stogner encouraged Dunlap to begin making his own TikToks. Now, his account has nearly 120,000 followers. The two began to design their own online gags together, too. They put up signs near Lake Boehmer labeling two leaking wells as Lake Craddick and Christian Springs, after the RRC commissioners. They filmed mock tourism videos of the sites for ­TikTok. They put Dunlap up on a pumpjack in a callback to Stogner’s infamous campaign video, his red boiler suit pulled seductively down to his waist.

Stogner also helped Dunlap launch his own bid for an RRC seat. In 2024, he ran as a Libertarian against Craddick, a Republican. Craddick won handily, raising $10 million, with hefty donations from oil and gas powerhouses.

But the pair did not give up on politics. That same year, Stogner ran for office again, courted by the local GOP despite her criticisms of Big Oil and distaste for President Donald Trump. With a tough-on-crime platform that highlighted her bona fides in protecting landowner rights, she challenged the long-serving Democratic district attorney in Texas’ 143rd Judicial District—and won.

Talking in the living room, where a cozy fire was burning to offset the chill of the day, the pair clearly were exhausted. As Stogner stretched out in front of the fire, the toll of driving hundreds of miles each week for her new job, which covers three counties and entails an intense caseload, was apparent. Stogner now only has time to work on oil well issues in her spare hours.

“We excavate [a well],” she said. “We’re like, wow, that’s clearly fucked. And then Chevron’s like, ‘Nothing to see here.’ And the Railroad Commission [is] like, ‘We’ll get back to you.’ I’m tired, because it’s like, okay—and now I’m having to deal with little girls [who] are getting raped. So I come back and [Chevron’s] lawyers are bitching about something and I’m just like, get over yourselves. Like, we have real problems in the world. Why can’t you just admit that this was a fuckup and fix it and do the right thing?”

And then she answers her own question: “They can’t, because it bankrupts the industry as we know it.”

Until coming to Texas, I wasn’t prepared for the scale of its landscape, how empty the desert can feel driving between the ranches and tiny towns, with little except gas stations. As I made my way toward Laura Briggs’ property, about a half-hour from Antina Ranch, I could barely focus on the road. I was so distracted by what I could see out of my car: ancient pumpjacks toiling away, bobbing slowly up and down as they produce small amounts of oil for tiny operators. Tall, spindly flare stacks dotted the horizon, some topped with bright flames as excess gas burned off into the sky in a fiery smear.

So many political ideas collide in this part of Texas: the desire to preserve the rights of landowners, the eagerness to offer subsidies and favors to an industry that provides jobs and tax revenue, and an almost religious commitment to a hands-off government. When a business that controls the mineral rights deep underground wrecks a property, the owners of the land above have few options. For residents like Briggs, that means dealing with strangers routinely coming onto her land, sometimes leaving messes of equipment; spills of mysterious, toxic liquids; and poorly plugged wells.

Briggs and her husband, Smokey, live on 900 acres they bought in the late 2000s after the previous owner died when an old pumpjack fell on him as he attempted to escape a group of aggressive hogs. When I pulled up to the bright, chaotic ranch house—which the couple built themselves—friendly dogs rushed up to greet me; pens containing goats, pigs, and cows surrounded the driveway. A slight woman with a mass of blond hair tucked into a braid, Briggs has the welcoming smile of a favorite elementary school teacher. Inside the kitchen, she offered me raspberries she freeze-dried herself. Her new ­Chihuahua puppy, Amigo, nipped at my feet. As we talked about her various well problems, Briggs dug into a file cabinet full of binders, pulling out court filings and reams of correspondence with regulators.

Briggs noticed that long-dormant wells on their property were leaking. Noxious water seeped out of the ground. Smears of oily liquid muddied the loose dirt. In 2024, a sulfuric spring appeared a few hundred yards from their house. “It is like whack-a-mole,” she said of trying to clean up the wells. Briggs laid the blame on careless fracking: “All the orphan wells [weren’t] a problem until this produced water injection started.”

During our conversation, Briggs, who seemingly can make a friend everywhere she goes, rattled off a list of names of RRC inspectors who have been on her land. “I used to bake cookies and hang them on the gate and be like, ‘If my cows are any problems, please let me know,’” she said. But to date, she said the RRC has plugged only six wells on her property—leaving more than two dozen untouched.

With so few folks around, it’s important to get to know your neighbors. And when the Earth itself seems to be revolting beneath your feet—when the big industry in town won’t clean up its messes on your land and regulators seem to be deliberately unresponsive—people tend to start talking to each other about how to fix it.

In 2022, Briggs and Smokey traveled to report on a leaking well for their newspapers. On the trip, they met Watt and Stogner. A few months later, Briggs’ neighbor, Schuyler Wight, asked her to host some of his ranch hands for Thanksgiving. Briggs invited Watt, Stogner, and Dunlap to dinner. That night, over turkey and wine, the neighbors all compared notes about the well problems on their land.

“We realized this wasn’t just something happening on my property—it was happening on Schuyler’s property, it was happening on Antina, it was happening on neighboring ranches,” Briggs said. “I was like, ‘You know, God put us all together for a reason, so we should work on this together.’”

Briggs has been bugging the RRC for years about her well problems; she’s spoken to national and local media and driven to Austin to talk with regulators directly. But working alone, she was “easy to write off.” As we drove to look at the mess of wells on her land, the dogs trailing behind her truck, she told me that it was their collective power that was now making a difference. “I tell you what, it was so nice meeting people who understood what I was talking about,” she said. “I think what the Railroad Commission didn’t count on was somebody with Schuyler’s time and knowledge and somebody with Ashley’s money.” (In addition to funding the lawsuit, Watt put $2 million into Stogner’s first campaign for the RRC.) “And I’m grateful for the media coverage.”

In August 2024, after yet another well on her property sprang a leak, Briggs started her own TikTok series. And she called ­Dunlap, whom she’d come to rely on for help. The RRC has a 24-hour emergency ­hotline, but Dunlap was able to get there first to dig an emergency pit to divert the flow of oily water. (The RRC eventually plugged the well.)

“It’s kind of gotten to the point where people will call me before the Railroad Commission, because I’ll come,” Dunlap said. “I’ll answer the phone. It’s kind of an honor that they do that, but at the same time, it’s sad.” (The RRC has said it “takes immediate action to eliminate any pollution threats” from leaking wells.)

In May, the well near Briggs’ house—on the orphan list for 23 years—sprang another leak, creating another pool of murky water; Dunlap was again one of the first on the scene to help stem some of the damage. It took the RRC almost four months to permanently plug the well. “This should be illegal,” Briggs told me. “Like, somebody should be in trouble for this.”

I wanted to see for myself how the RRC worked, so I hopped on a plane to Austin to attend its monthly public meeting. They are usually overwhelmingly dry ­affairs, packed with updates on permit applications and waste reports. But the public comment period can get heated, especially when Wight shows up.

Which he has, nearly every month, for the past three years. On the day I was there, Wight, a fourth-generation rancher, wore neat Wrangler jeans and a button-up checked shirt, his white cattleman’s hat tucked next to his briefcase on the chair next to him. A few people came over to shake his hand, updating him on their own business or simply asking how he was.

Wight’s family has been working as ranchers in West Texas since the late 1800s. He knew there were abandoned wells scattered over the thousands of acres he owns. But he kept discovering more over time. Many are leaking briny water or letting off toxic emissions—and some aren’t on the official RRC lists of orphan wells.

When I visited his property a year ­earlier, we stopped by a crater in the desert, with a dusty waterslide running into the parched ground. Wight pulled up photos on his phone of the same spot from less than a decade ago, when the crater was a lush swimming hole fed from a local spring; in the photo, his daughter swam happily in the water. He suspected that the water-thirsty process used in certain fracking techniques was responsible for depleting the groundwater that fed his spring. (Stogner made a TikTok of the site with the voiceover: “When you use all the fresh water for fracking instead of recycling it, you lose Redneck Riviera.”)

“I don’t think they’re gonna get serious about policy until we flat run out of water,” he told me. “I don’t want to sound like, ‘The world’s falling, the sky’s falling, we’re all gonna die.’ But just in my lifetime since I’ve been down here ranching, I’ve seen it change so much.”

Wight isn’t typically a man of many words. Standing before the RRC commissioners, he got right to the point. “Why do I have to do your job for you? Why is that?” he said, before adding, “That’s a rhetorical question, and I’m not asking that in a mean way.” (RRC Commissioner Craddick, accustomed to Wight’s presence at these meetings, thanked him for his time before moving on to the next public commenter.)

“One thing’s for sure, I’ve got them stirred up,” he told me flatly. “They’re not happy with me.”

All the hard work this band of neighbors has put in seems like it is starting to yield some results. In 2025, Texas passed a law forcing companies to plug or reactivate wells that have been dormant for more than 15 years. The legislature also allocated $100 million to help plug wells and an additional $1.3 million to establish a team to investigate issues with underground water injection.

The law was drafted with support from an oil and gas industry coalition. “It’s a marker that industry has said, ‘Okay, this is a real problem and we need to curb our worst excesses here,’” EDF lawyer Peltz said.

But the law has industry-friendly loopholes, too. Operators can delay plugging their wells until the early 2040s. Experts worry the next 20 years could see many of the same problems. And while the RRC also passed new restrictions that could help to stop injected water from blowing out old wells, fracking itself isn’t going away anytime soon. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has loosened the Biden administration’s original requirements around the well-plugging grants, removing environmental reviews and methane measurement requirements. Texas regulators applauded the move, saying it will help speed up well plugging.

But Dunlap is dismissive of the new Texas law, describing it as “nothing.” He’s running again against RRC Chair Jim Wright in 2026, this time as a Republican. (Dunlap’s TikTok bio now reads: “4th generation TX Oilfield Republican Candidate Texas Railroad Commission.”) He posted his campaign announcement video on—where else?—TikTok in early August. “Fuck it! I’m running again for Railroad Commission in 2026,” he announced. The video has more than 33,000 likes.

He was further frustrated after talking with landowners in East Texas, where the RRC had granted permits to build an oil field waste site to an operator with a lengthy list of violations. “I just woke up pissed off one morning and I said, ‘Okay, that’s it. I’m running. I’ll give it one more shot to fix this.’ Texas is waking up to the Railroad Commission. There are things that Sarah and I have been raising hell about for the last three years—I think people are starting to see it.” He chuckled. “If it doesn’t work, I’ll go back to Bali and play golf again.”

Here’s How Other Groups Across the Country Are Finding and Capping Old Wells

By Henry Carnell

The Moms in Pennsylvania

In 1859, Edwin Drake sunk a well in Northwest Pennsylvania and kicked off the world’s first oil boom. Back then, “people would go out literally in their backyard and just start drilling,” says Patrice Tomcik of Moms Clean Air Force, which searches for orphan wells. Today, Pennsylvania has 30,000 documented abandoned oil wells. (Experts think the total could be up to 700,000.) To do this work, Moms Clean Air Force has teamed up with the Environmental Defense Fund and state regulators with plans to use everything from drones equipped with magnetometers to college students with backpacks full of monitoring equipment. So far, even without all of these upgrades, these sleuths have discovered 250 orphan wells.

The Kids in North Carolina

In 2024, three high schoolers in Cary, North Carolina, raised $11,000 to plug an orphan well more than 500 miles away in Ohio. Sebastian Ng, one of the students, says the project made him realize that “we could help make a real difference.” The plug was completed by Montana’s Well Done Foundation, a nonprofit founded by retired oil executive Curtis Shuck. “We hope that our work inspires people to find their own ways of creating positive impacts,” Shuck says.

The Grad Student in Alaska

University of Alaska Anchorage graduate student Hoyt Thomas uses lidar—the terrain-­scanning tech behind most self-driving cars—and a machine learning algorithm to locate orphan wells that cannot be caught otherwise. “Not all of these wells are emitting methane, and they still pose risks,” Thomas says. The next step? Make the algorithm scalable so it can be applied in other communities.

The Scientists in California

At Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, geochemists have scoured through old maps for evidence of abandoned wells. It’s like “finding a needle in a haystack,” says Charuleka Varadharajan, a scientist involved with the project. Researchers trained an AI model on handmarked US Geological Survey maps to find more than 1,300 potential orphan wells in California and Oklahoma, where they’re working with the Osage Nation to document wells in their territory.

The Lost Satellite in Space

MethaneSAT, a satellite launched in March 2024 by the EDF and the New Zealand Space Agency, tracks global methane pollution—in part to “name and shame” the world’s worst polluters. Its data, freely available online, reveals previously untraceable emissions across the world. A major setback occurred in July 2025, when the satellite was declared lost in space. But even as scientists aim to replace it, they’re sifting through the enormous data set from MethaneSAT’s 15 months in orbit. “It’s early days yet,” principal investigator Steven Wofsy told the Harvard Gazette.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/511_WELLWATCHERS_A_2000.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-12-08 11:03:39.075699

This farm will be 3,000 acres, have five hundred megawatts of renewable energy, and one million solar panels. It will be able to power the town of Elba and the village of Oakfield in Genesee County when finished.

This is an important milestone towards New York’s climate goals

According to Greenbacker Capital, Cider Solar Farm is the start of many important milestones toward completing New York’s challenging climate goals. It will allow the state to remain on track to New York’s 2030 goal to have 70% of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources. These large-scale solar farms are becoming the best way to meet these goals.

The farm will be able to provide enough electricity to power 125,000 homes, which will tremendously help to reduce the use of fossil fuels and carbon emissions. New York is becoming one of the leaders in sustainable infrastructure, and the use of solar energy on farms like this will allow it to maintain this leadership role.

The enormity of the Cider Solar Farm demonstrates the market’s need for clean energy sources. The facility will have one million solar panels and will be one of the largest in New York’s Northeast. The farm will also produce energy at a considerable scale and employ hundreds for construction and periodic maintenance.

Maximal solar contact will be achieved through the specific positioning of the panels

The solar farm will also economically benefit the region as well as the local populations through the creation of new jobs and the increased available tax revenue, which will allow for new investments to be made in the local economies.

According to Greenbacker Capital, the Cider Solar Farm complements the independence of the national energy grid and revitalizes economically depressed rural areas.

The farm will also have the positive externality of sequestering hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, the equivalent of removing thousands of cars from the road. It will therefore help to transition the economy to a low-carbon one and mitigate climate change.

The risks of the project: What could go wrong?

While these solar farms do provide a multitude of benefits and are the starting point for greener solar energy in the U.S, these solar farms do not come without challenges. Without a doubt, one of the biggest challenges is land use. These farms take up a lot of land, and in an effort to minimize disruption of the land, including disruption of agriculture and wildlife, developers work with the local authorities to figure out a solution that is suitable for all parties.

Another of these challenges is the requirement of the electrical infrastructure feeding the power to the electrical grid of the state, and the subsequent planning that needs to go into it in order not to adversely impact the electrical grid’s reliability. There is always a risk of the solar energy systems producing energy and not being able to use it all, because of the risk of having the energy banked.

New York is setting an example in the renewable energy sphere

Battery systems are installed to mitigate fluctuations that can occur in solar energy output and ensure a reliable supply. Like Cider Solar Farm, many other solar farms are also the starting point of the use of solar power on a large scale in the U.S, and they are also the beginning of the use of solar power with minimal impact on the economy. The construction of Cider Solar Farm has begun, and with it, New York is starting to show how it can lead other states in the U.S in achieving a high level of sustainability.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/36.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 09:00:27.046127

The project, developed under Basin Electric's Large Load Commercial Program, would serve as the foundation for a multi-gigawatt data center campus.

In October, the companies submitted an application to the Southwest Power Pool Expedited Resource Adequacy Study process to evaluate interconnection and transmission requirements, a key milestone in advancing the project.

North Dakota continues to attract businesses and industries seeking reliable, cost-effective electricity and robust energy infrastructure. With a planned capacity of approximately 1,450 megawatts, the proposed facility would help meet demand from large-scale technology infrastructure such as data centers. If successful, the project is expected to create significant job opportunities and generate substantial tax revenue for local communities, all while working to minimize electricity rate impacts across the region.

""Basin Electric and NextEra Energy Resources' collaboration reflects the Trump Administration's forward-thinking approach needed to responsibly support technology growth,"" said U.S. Department of Interior Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Leslie Beyer. ""Under Secretary Burgum's leadership, we are enabling data centers and other large-scale technology users to fund their own generation. This model supports innovation, strengthens America's energy security and helps keep electricity affordable for consumers – all while positioning the U.S. to lead in the global AI race.""

""This is a win-win for North Dakota,"" said North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong. ""We've always been a leader in responsible growth.

Final marketing and distribution agreement for renewable ammonia from the Saudi Arabian project (NEOM Green Hydrogen Project) is targeted for the first half of 2026.

LEHIGH VALLEY, PA USA / OSLO, NORWAY (December 8, 2025) - World-leading hydrogen supplier and global industrial gases company Air Products (NYSE:APD) and world-leading crop nutrition and ammonia company Yara International ASA (OSE:YAR) are working to combine Air Products’ industrial gas capabilities and low-emission hydrogen with Yara’s ammonia production and distribution network:

Louisiana Clean Energy Complex: Air Products is developing the world’s largest low-carbon energy complex in the state of Louisiana. The complex is designed to produce >750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen, capturing 95 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during normal operation.

Air Products is the project developer and once the ammonia plant has achieved agreed upon performance levels, Yara would acquire the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities for approximately 25 percent of the total project cost (estimated between $8-9 billion). Yara would assume responsibility for related operations and integrate the entire ammonia output into its global distribution network.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tonnes of low-carbon ammonia per year. The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products’ customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products’ 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system. About five million tonnes per year of high purity CO2 captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Project: The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia is more than 90 percent complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tonnes per year of renewable ammonia.

Air Products and Yara anticipate entering into a marketing and distribution agreement where Yara would commercialize, on a commission basis, the ammonia not sold by Air Products as renewable hydrogen in Europe. The model maximizes value for both companies and enables ammonia from the world’s first large-scale renewable ammonia plant to be delivered worldwide by Yara’s unparalleled shipping fleet. The marketing and distribution agreement is targeted to be completed during the first half of 2026.

Leveraging complementary strengths to drive value creation in low-emission ammonia

Yara is the world’s largest trader and shipper of ammonia, currently transporting over four million metric tonnes annually, which is supported by Yara’s 12 ammonia vessels and 18 import terminals. In addition, Yara has a significant internal ammonia demand. Air Products is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and brings leading low-emission hydrogen and ammonia production at scale. The collaboration would enable the companies to meet the increasing demand for low-emission ammonia in the coming years, particularly in Europe both for Yara's internal consumption and other customers.

“We are pleased to be working with Yara, the world’s leading fertilizer company, as we advance the global low-emission ammonia market and maximize value from our projects in Louisiana and Saudi Arabia,” said Air Products’ Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Menezes.

“Air Products’ two advanced projects are a strong strategic fit with Yara’s flexible nitrogen system – enabling energy diversification and profitable decarbonization while aligning with our disciplined capital allocation policy. The Louisiana project builds on a proven, capital-efficient model; producing ammonia from externally sourced hydrogen and delivering strong returns,” said Yara’s CEO Svein Tore Holsether.

Based in Brazil, da Rocha Oliveira will lead Electric Hydrogen’s commercial and partnership strategies across Brazil and the broader region.

Electric Hydrogen’s entry into the market comes at a pivotal time for the region, as Brazil is advancing ambitious strategies to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and strengthen its position in the global energy landscape. Da Rocha Oliveira will support customers with projects in Brazil and across Latin America.

Electric Hydrogen’s HYPRPlant technology, a powerful, low-cost electrolyser plant, leverages proprietary proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology and renewable electricity to produce cost-competitive fossil-free hydrogen at industrial scale. The entire hydrogen production plant is shipped on factory-fabricated skids and assembled by local partners on an expedited schedule. This complete turnkey system is designed for rapid deployment at project sites around the world and has been selected for projects with diverse industrial partners such as Infinium, HIF Global, and Uniper. Electric Hydrogen is currently deploying its first 100 MW HYPRPlant at Infinium’s Project Roadrunner site in Pecos, Texas.

This technology is uniquely suited to support Latin American markets, where green hydrogen projects are advancing at GW scale. The company will partner with local project developers to accelerate domestic production of green fertilizer, e-fuels, and decarbonisation of heavy industry.

“Latin America offers one of the most compelling economic cases for domestic green hydrogen production at industrial scale,” said Raffi Garabedian, Co-Founder and CEO of Electric Hydrogen. “The combination of abundant renewable energy and heavy reliance on imported nitrogen fertilizer creates a clear opportunity for competitive domestic production. We look forward to creating pathways for the region to unlock this potential with Maria Gabriela’s deep expertise in the market.”

It says targeting consumer demand is necessary but not sufficient, and public funding to address the supply of skills directly is needed now.

The Committee calls for ‘local skilled labour’ conditions in Contracts for Difference, an expanded skills passport scheme, a leading role for local authorities, and greater clarity for industry on levies, EPC ratings and the Warm Homes Plan.

The UK needs an estimated 250,000 additional workers just to meet new housing targets, and many more for retrofit. After shocking failures in previous Government-backed retrofit and insulation schemes, the Committee calls for a new, nationally recognised, industry-backed construction and retrofit skills programme.

The energy transition offers substantial opportunity. The Climate Change Committee estimates net employment gains from the energy transition of between 135,000 and 725,000 jobs in the next four years . But the vast majority of these workers will have to train or reskill. The UK may need to import some specific skilled workers from overseas, at least in the short term, to meet its targets.

With up to 70% of those embarking on construction-related FE qualifications not completing or not entering the sector, the Committee says Government should expand and formalise ‘try-before-you-buy’ training opportunities. SMEs, the backbone of the construction and retrofit supply chain, will need support in taking on inexperienced trainees.

Bill Esterson MP, Chair of the Committee, said: “It is essential that we build the workforce for the energy transition so that the Government can hit its clean energy targets and, importantly, ensure that the UK makes the most of the growth opportunity of the century.

“The Committee has found that market forces alone cannot overcome the skills gap. We need policy certainty for the long-term, locally directed investment in training, and policies that make clean energy careers attractive and accessible.

“For British workers this isn’t about hitting deadlines; it’s about securing good jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring Britain leads in the global race for clean energy.”

The Committee calls on Government to:

Put commitments to transition the existing local skilled labour supply into Contracts for Difference, leveraging UK manufacturing content requirements where possible.

By the end of 2026, set out the options for conditionality that can leverage more skilled immigration in the short-term and crucially boost support for home-grown talent longer-term.

Empower devolved government across the UK to lead on approaches tailored to local and regional strengths or weaknesses – and facilitate a greater role for local authorities to accelerate the roll-out of retrofit.

Give the Office for Clean Energy Jobs and Skills England the authority and resources to ensure the necessary consistency that will make skills portable across the country, in both the clean energy and the retrofit workforces.

Accelerate the adoption of clean energy and retrofit skills policies in the Spending Review, with a ten-year horizon for initiatives and funding which is revised and extended every five years. -Identify how new technologies can bring increases in productivity to help meet the scale of labour demand identified in this inquiry.

Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality D. Reid Wilson recognized FRCE for its 20th year as an Environmental Steward in the program Oct. 14. During the visit to the facility, Wilson presented FRCE Commanding Officer Capt. Randy Berti with a plaque to commemorate the accomplishment. Berti said the achievement is a testament to the depot’s dedication to environmental sustainability, regulatory compliance and stewardship.

“We have made it a priority to go above and beyond because we understand the importance of taking care of our planet,” said Berti. “We want to do everything we can do be good stewards of the environment and our community. We live, work and eat here and we want to continue to do so safely, well into the future. That is why we do everything we can to protect the health of our workforce and our neighbors, and the natural beauty here on the Crystal Coast.”

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Environmental Stewardship Initiative recognizes and supports companies and facilities that go above and beyond to reduce their impact on the environment. The program’s mission is to assist organizations in reducing their environmental impacts beyond regulatory requirements and recognize those that achieve and maintain this commitment.

FRCE Environmental Division Director Andrew Krelie said the depot was one of the earliest organizations in the state to earn the title of Environmental Steward in 2004 and is the only Department of War facility participating in the Environmental Stewardship Initiative. He said maintaining the Environmental Steward title for 20 years has been a collaborative effort among the entire workforce.

“FRC East sets aggressive environmental objectives that go far above the minimum compliance requirements because we are committed to being good stewards of the environment,” said Krelie. “To be able to say we have continued to raise the bar, met all our compliance requirements and gone above and beyond every year for 20 years straight is quite the achievement, one that has taken the entire workforce banding together to accomplish.”

The Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers three member levels: Partner, Rising Steward and Steward. Each level is designed to fit the organization’s needs based on the maturity of its environmental management system and performance success. The Partner level is the beginner level for organizations that are interested in developing a systematic approach to improving their environmental performance, whereas the Steward designation is given to organizations that have mature environmental management systems and are committed to exemplary environmental performance beyond what is required by law.

Stephen Azok, program manager for the depot’s environmental management system, said as a Steward, FRCE establishes at least three long-term objectives to improve its environmental performance. The depot’s current objectives focus on reducing the facility’s energy usage, decreasing how much industrial wastewater it generates, and increasing its landfill diversion efforts, he said.

“This year, we are putting two of our three goals in sustainment, which means we have reached those goals, but need to continue monitoring results to make sure we can maintain them,” said Azok. “In the meantime, we are now looking to establish new goals that are more aggressive. For example, we’re always looking to reduce our solid waste. If we find a way to avoid generating solid waste altogether, then we wouldn’t have to recycle it, which aids our landfill diversion efforts. It’s a harder objective to establish because it involves so many elements but if find a way to do it, we are going to.”

Azok said FRCE exceeded its landfill diversion goal for this year, achieving a 64% rate compared to the 62% target. He said FRCE actively seeks opportunities to donate reusable materials to local businesses and groups, which helps reduce waste and support the community.

“We are always looking for ways we can aid the community,” said Azok. “We reach out to local businesses to see if there’s anything that we generate that we can provide them, such as scrap wood or pallets. At one point, we were even donating our toner cartridges to churches and schools because they could recycle them. We are always looking for those kinds of partnerships. They help the community and help us be better stewards of the environment.”

FRCE aims to use 25% less energy in 2025 than it did in 2024, a target the facility is on track to achieve, said Azok. Krelie said the depot has taken many steps to reduce the amount of energy it uses daily to achieve this goal, many of which have been simple fixes, such as replacing the facility’s old sodium vapor light bulbs with energy efficient LED bulbs. Additionally, FRCE has partnered with Duke Energy to help assess the facility’s energy usage and provide insight to reduce it, he said.

“Part of going above and beyond means doing everything we can to reduce our environmental footprint, even if it’s not required of us by law,” said Krelie. “Replacing the lead-acid batteries with lithium in our battery-powered carts because they are more energy efficient is a great example. With the old batteries, the carts had to be plugged in daily, which constantly used energy. Duke Energy also helped us find that we have lost a lot of energy in our compressed air system. We are working on getting that replaced now. Not having any leaks in our compressed air system will save a significant amount of energy and cost savings.”

Krelie said FRCE has reduced its wastewater generation by 65% this year, nearly doubling its original reduction goal of 36%. He said they were able to achieve such a significant reduction by closely monitoring each building’s usage and identifying areas of overuse.

“One of our buildings was using upwards of 70,000 to 80,000 gallons of processed water a day,” said Krelie. “The clean lines in that building were using a lot of rinse water when cleaning aircraft parts, and the water was running constantly. We were able to reduce that down to less than 10,000 gallons a day by simply analyzing the input and output and implementing simple controls, such as having the artisans shut the water valve at the end of the day. “We smashed our wastewater reduction goal with just the savings in that building,” he continued. “Even though we met our desired end state, we need to stay aggressive. We don’t want to hang our hat on the fact that we met our goal early when we know we can do more. We tweaked that goal a little bit because it became easy once we saw how simple it was to effect change.”

Not only have these changes helped FRCE become more environmentally friendly, but many of them have helped save the depot money, allowing additional funds to be refocused on supporting warfighter readiness, said Krelie. “There’s a huge financial benefit to all of this,” Krelie said. “We received a significant credit on our utility bill when we reduced that 70,000 gallons of wastewater per day to 10,000 gallons. And replacing the lightbulbs with LED meant our electric bill went down. Because we are a working capital fund, these savings go back to our total operating expenses at the end of the year. We remain good stewards of the environment so we can continue to do what we do best, and we love hearing the sound of freedom in this local community.”

Azok said the facility has developed and implemented many workflows and regulations into its operations to mitigate their potential effect on the environment.

“We have strict controls in place in our shops that use these materials to control their usage,” said Azok. “There’s a lot of testing involved to make sure we’re not sending out anything that could negatively affect the wastewater treatment plant. We also have emission control devices, such as the air filtration system in our aircraft paint barn, to help protect our air from any chemicals. All chemicals are strictly managed so that no one can check them out unless they are trained, authorized and have demonstrated that they can maintain positive control over them from the time they are purchased, to when they are used and disposed.”

FRCE also requires employees to complete annual environmental training courses to increase awareness and effectiveness, said Azok.

“Everyone, no matter what they are hired as, has to participate in annual environmental training,” said Azok. “There is the environmental management system training that offers a high-level overview of the environmental regulations that we have here at FRC East, and the hazardous communication course that teaches you how hazardous materials interact with each other, with the environment and how they are managed. There are also many other required courses that many of us take, depending on our job descriptions and the areas we work. Our goal with these is to teach employees about the products we work with and our processes so we can properly identify and mitigate any potential issues and continue to be good stewards of our environment, all while keeping the workforce safe.”

Being a part of the Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers FRCE many benefits, Azok said, including mentorship and collaboration opportunities with other businesses within North Carolina.

“At the Steward level, not only are you at the highest level in the program, but you also have the opportunity to coach those who are in the lower levels and problem solve with other companies at the Steward level,” said Azok. “It opens up the ability to reach out and get information from other members. For example, another Steward reached out to us and asked how we manage our lithium batteries, since we’re one of the few organizations in the state that deal with that amount of those size and type of lithium batteries. We provided that information, along with some of our emergency procedures. It’s a great avenue for networking.”

Krelie said although FRCE has seen many environmental successes this past year, the focus remains on continuous improvement.

“We take a proactive stance because we want to make sure that we are not doing anything that can cause damage,” said Krelie. “Our first priority is to protect and preserve our environment, our workforce and the people in our community. We stay on top of new technology and research because if we can make changes to improve our green procurement of chemicals or find a better way to dispose of something, even if it’s not a regulatory requirement, we want to do that. We don’t want to have to play catch up later on down the road.”

FRCE is North Carolina's largest maintenance, repair, overhaul and technical services provider, with more than 4,000 civilian, military and contract workers. Its annual revenue exceeds $865 million.

Russel Honoré and Livingston Parish Councilman Dean Coates, Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré",,,,,https://thelensnola.org/2025/12/08/air-products-carbon-capture-risks-lake-maurepas/,"That’s the future that Air Products, the giant industrial gas corporation, has planned for Lake Maurepas.
In 2023, the company was so gung ho about carbon capture that it hired 25 lobbyists to block more than a dozen Louisiana bills related to limiting carbon capture.
Here’s the kicker: now, even Air Products doesn’t seem to want the carbon capturepart of the project anymore.
Air Products is still barreling forward to secure permits for the full project — including carbon capture and storage.
Air Products’ carbon capture project is a bad deal for Louisiana.","At dawn in the Maurepas Swamp, you can see 11 pink Roseate spoonbills rise into daybreak, off to feast on a lavish buffet of Louisiana shrimp and crabs. The swamp is one of the last wild places left in south Louisiana. It’s a place that still remembers what this land once was and still is — a living, breathing estuary.

But this quiet sanctuary could soon be spoiled by injection wells, pipelines and industrial noise. That’s the future that Air Products, the giant industrial gas corporation, has planned for Lake Maurepas.

Within this area, one of the most conservative in the state, the opposition to the project is high. But there’s still a possibility that the governor may approve permits for it. That’s why it’s important to understand what’s behind the scenes, in Air Products board rooms and on the ground in Louisiana community meetings.

In November, hundreds of people packed into a church in St. John the Baptist Parish for a public hearing on the company’s massive “blue hydrogen” and carbon capture scheme.

Air Products calls it clean energy. But there’s nothing clean about building a hydrogen and ammonia plant in Ascension Parish, capturing some CO₂, and piping it 38 miles for injection beneath Lake Maurepas. It was once touted as the world’s largest carbon-storage project.

In 2023, the company was so gung ho about carbon capture that it hired 25 lobbyists to block more than a dozen Louisiana bills related to limiting carbon capture.

Here’s the kicker: now, even Air Products doesn’t seem to want the carbon capturepart of the project anymore.

Last spring, the company’s CEO told investors that Air Products was “actively working to de-risk” its Louisiana project and was in “ongoing discussions to divest the carbon sequestration and ammonia production elements.”

Let us translate that for you: Air Products wants to offload the liability for its company but has no problem leaving it with Louisiana’s people and wetlands.

If it’s too risky for Air Products, we’re going to venture to say it’s too damn risky for Louisiana.

Air Products is still barreling forward to secure permits for the full project — including carbon capture and storage. But from what the company told its investors, once those permits are issued, the project becomes a hot potato — so dangerous, expensive, and politically toxic that Air Products plans to sell the carbon-capture portion of the project. And with billions in federal tax breaks for so-called “clean energy” on the table, another company might take the bait.

Meanwhile, communities across the five-parish footprint are united in opposition to the entire project.

At a hearing attended by nearly 300 residents, everyone was opposed to the proposed plant, pipeline, and carbon capture scheme except for two paid representatives from economic development groups.

The proposed CO₂ pipeline could run just half a mile from Sorrento Primary School, a mother told the crowd, describing her fears. “Imagine your child playing on the playground within feet of that [CO2] pipeline, with flares from the facility in the background,” she said. “No child deserves poison in their playground.”

She’s right to worry! If this pipeline were to rupture so close to her son’s elementary school, 660 students could be enveloped by CO2 in minutes, according to a recent report.

In 2020, a CO₂ pipeline ruptured near Satartia, Mississippi, sending a suffocating cloud of CO2 through the community. Forty-five people were hospitalized; some were found unconscious more than a mile away. People gasped for air on the side of the road after their cars stalled — CO₂ had displaced oxygen in their lungs and their combustion engines.

When Yazoo County emergency director Jack Willingham arrived, he was stunned: “It looked like you were going through the zombie apocalypse,” he said.

We’ll say it again: it’s too damn risky for Louisiana.

At least six elected officials — a mayor, two parish councilors, two state representatives and a state senator — spoke against Air Products’ plan to invade Lake Maurepas and the surrounding swamp. Because they have watched industry in Louisiana, they know how this story ends: once one company drills, others follow. Soon, the serene waters could echo with compressors, barges and drilling rigs — all in the name of “clean energy.”

Carbon capture and storage is being sold as a climate solution. But the reality is clear to climate groups across Louisiana: this new technology is a costly distraction that prolongs pollution rather than stopping it.

Public opposition to carbon capture is spreading fast from Republicans and Democrats alike, driven by communities who refuse to be sacrificed for a corporate experiment. And leaders are listening.

In October, Councilman Coates proposed a resolution opposing carbon sequestration wells and pipelines in Livingston Parish and the Council passed it unanimously. Altogether, the Council represents more than 152,000 people!

On October 15th, Gov. Jeff Landry — no stranger to siding with industry — showed that he, too, is feeling the political pressure, as he declared a temporary moratorium on new carbon capture injection well applications.

Gov. Landry’s moratorium was lifted last Sunday, but the fate of Air Product’s project still rests with the Governor and state agencies. Our experience tells us that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will likely follow the state’s lead in deciding whether Air Products gets the green light to break ground in our quiet swamp.

Since he’s taken office, Gov. Landry often talks about protecting Louisiana’s way of life. Well, this is his chance to protect this part of Louisiana, by denying the permits for this project.

In this matter, the governor has a choice: side with the people of Louisiana, or with corporate interests trying to bury their waste beneath our land and public waters.

Instead of energy that relies on hydrogen and ammonia and requires a PR campaign and dozens of lobbyists to hide its true impacts, Louisiana deserves real clean energy — solar, wind and efficient power.

Louisiana can’t afford to get stuck on stupid again, as Gen. Honoré often says.

Air Products’ carbon capture project is a bad deal for Louisiana. Now Air Products — the company that dreamed it up — wants to walk away. Doesn’t that tell us everything we need to know?

Nobody wants carbon capture. Not the public. Not the parishes. Not even Air Products itself.",https://i0.wp.com/thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/pexels-photo-10885355.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1253,N,,2025-12-08 10:02:03.750832

Read the full report Australian graphite: A path to a global battery market opportunity PDF (1 MB),","Australia stands on the brink of a significant opportunity in the global battery market, driven by the increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems.

At the heart of this opportunity lies graphite, a critical material for lithium-ion batteries. As the world moves to cleaner energy solutions, graphite is becoming all the more important.

In our new report, Australian graphite: A path to a global battery market opportunity PDF (1 MB), co-authored by CSIRO, Geoscience Australia and Stanford University, we highlight the immense potential of Australia's graphite resources and the strategic importance of developing a robust graphite industry.

The strategic importance of graphite

Graphite is the primary anode material for lithium-ion batteries, which are essential for the rapidly expanding EV market. Graphite's unique properties, including high conductivity, mechanical stability and compatibility with battery cathodes, make it indispensable in battery production.

Despite holding substantial natural graphite resources, Australia currently lacks large-scale production capability for battery-grade graphite. Thus, we have a significant opportunity to establish domestic manufacturing capabilities and become a preferred supplier of graphite in the global market.

Australia's graphite resources

Geoscience Australia data, as of December 2023, ranks Australia 8th in the world for natural graphite with around 4% of the world's resource. Our graphite is predominantly located in South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, with recent discoveries in the Northern Territory expected to add to the resource base.

However, Australia's current lack of large-scale production capability for battery-grade graphite shows the need for strategic investment and development.

Economic and market opportunities

The substantial price jump from graphite concentrate to anode materials highlights the economic potential of downstream processing. Developing domestic processing capabilities could add significant value to Australia's graphite resources.

Moreover, global market dynamics present a unique opportunity for Australia. China currently dominates 95 per cent of the downstream processing market for anode materials, posing a risk to supply chain stability.

So, enhancing our processing capabilities, international collaborations, support by targeted government initiatives, and industry-research partnerships will be essential to building a resilient and sustainable graphite supply chain.

Environmental and technological advancements

Integrating renewable energy into graphite processing could pose a competitive advantage for Australia. Technologies such as solar, wind and thermal storage could drive down the cost of the energy needed for graphite processing and deliver 'emissions-free' graphite. Additionally, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning could help identify graphite deposits, improving the efficiency and yield of mining operations. These innovations could not only make the graphite industry more sustainable but also position Australia as a leader in environmentally responsible mining practices.

A timely opportunity for action

In the report, we're encouraging industry leaders across Australia to recognise the strategic importance of developing a robust graphite industry. By investing in domestic processing capabilities, leveraging technological advancements and fostering strategic collaborations, Australia could secure a stable supply of critical battery materials. We’d be able to better support the growing energy storage systems and EV industries and position ourselves as a key player in the global battery anode market. Potential benefits include increased energy security, job creation and technological advancements in battery manufacturing.

In conclusion, the development of a graphite industry in Australia represents not just an economic opportunity but a strategic investment in a secure domestic supply chain and national resilience. The opportunity is here for the graphite industry to contribute to a sustainable and secure energy future.

Stephen Azok, program manager for the depot’s environmental management system, said as a Steward, FRCE establishes at least three long-term objectives to improve its environmental performance.","Fleet Readiness Center East (FRCE) recently reached a milestone, marking 20 consecutive years of participation in the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Environmental Stewardship Initiative and demonstrating a long-standing commitment to environmental conservation and protection efforts.

Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality D. Reid Wilson recognized FRCE for its 20th year as an Environmental Steward in the program Oct. 14. During the visit to the facility, Wilson presented FRCE Commanding Officer Capt. Randy Berti with a plaque to commemorate the accomplishment.

Berti said the achievement is a testament to the depot’s dedication to environmental sustainability, regulatory compliance and stewardship.

“We have made it a priority to go above and beyond because we understand the importance of taking care of our planet,” said Berti. “We want to do everything we can do be good stewards of the environment and our community. We live, work and eat here and we want to continue to do so safely, well into the future. That is why we do everything we can to protect the health of our workforce and our neighbors, and the natural beauty here on the Crystal Coast.”

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Environmental Stewardship Initiative recognizes and supports companies and facilities that go above and beyond to reduce their impact on the environment. The program’s mission is to assist organizations in reducing their environmental impacts beyond regulatory requirements and recognize those that achieve and maintain this commitment.

FRCE Environmental Division Director Andrew Krelie said the depot was one of the earliest organizations in the state to earn the title of Environmental Steward in 2004 and is the only Department of War facility participating in the Environmental Stewardship Initiative. He said maintaining the Environmental Steward title for 20 years has been a collaborative effort among the entire workforce.

“FRC East sets aggressive environmental objectives that go far above the minimum compliance requirements because we are committed to being good stewards of the environment,” said Krelie. “To be able to say we have continued to raise the bar, met all our compliance requirements and gone above and beyond every year for 20 years straight is quite the achievement, one that has taken the entire workforce banding together to accomplish.”

The Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers three member levels: Partner, Rising Steward and Steward. Each level is designed to fit the organization’s needs based on the maturity of its environmental management system and performance success. The Partner level is the beginner level for organizations that are interested in developing a systematic approach to improving their environmental performance, whereas the Steward designation is given to organizations that have mature environmental management systems and are committed to exemplary environmental performance beyond what is required by law.

Stephen Azok, program manager for the depot’s environmental management system, said as a Steward, FRCE establishes at least three long-term objectives to improve its environmental performance. The depot’s current objectives focus on reducing the facility’s energy usage, decreasing how much industrial wastewater it generates, and increasing its landfill diversion efforts, he said.

“This year, we are putting two of our three goals in sustainment, which means we have reached those goals, but need to continue monitoring results to make sure we can maintain them,” said Azok. “In the meantime, we are now looking to establish new goals that are more aggressive. For example, we’re always looking to reduce our solid waste. If we find a way to avoid generating solid waste altogether, then we wouldn’t have to recycle it, which aids our landfill diversion efforts. It’s a harder objective to establish because it involves so many elements but if find a way to do it, we are going to.”

Azok said FRCE exceeded its landfill diversion goal for this year, achieving a 64% rate compared to the 62% target. He said FRCE actively seeks opportunities to donate reusable materials to local businesses and groups, which helps reduce waste and support the community.

“We are always looking for ways we can aid the community,” said Azok. “We reach out to local businesses to see if there’s anything that we generate that we can provide them, such as scrap wood or pallets. At one point, we were even donating our toner cartridges to churches and schools because they could recycle them. We are always looking for those kinds of partnerships. They help the community and help us be better stewards of the environment.”

FRCE aims to use 25% less energy in 2025 than it did in 2024, a target the facility is on track to achieve, said Azok.

Krelie said the depot has taken many steps to reduce the amount of energy it uses daily to achieve this goal, many of which have been simple fixes, such as replacing the facility’s old sodium vapor light bulbs with energy efficient LED bulbs. Additionally, FRCE has partnered with Duke Energy to help assess the facility’s energy usage and provide insight to reduce it, he said.

“Part of going above and beyond means doing everything we can to reduce our environmental footprint, even if it’s not required of us by law,” said Krelie. “Replacing the lead-acid batteries with lithium in our battery-powered carts because they are more energy efficient is a great example. With the old batteries, the carts had to be plugged in daily, which constantly used energy. Duke Energy also helped us find that we have lost a lot of energy in our compressed air system. We are working on getting that replaced now. Not having any leaks in our compressed air system will save a significant amount of energy and cost savings.”

Krelie said FRCE has reduced its wastewater generation by 65% this year, nearly doubling its original reduction goal of 36%. He said they were able to achieve such a significant reduction by closely monitoring each building’s usage and identifying areas of overuse.

“One of our buildings was using upwards of 70,000 to 80,000 gallons of processed water a day,” said Krelie. “The clean lines in that building were using a lot of rinse water when cleaning aircraft parts, and the water was running constantly. We were able to reduce that down to less than 10,000 gallons a day by simply analyzing the input and output and implementing simple controls, such as having the artisans shut the water valve at the end of the day.

“We smashed our wastewater reduction goal with just the savings in that building,” he continued. “Even though we met our desired end state, we need to stay aggressive. We don’t want to hang our hat on the fact that we met our goal early when we know we can do more. We tweaked that goal a little bit because it became easy once we saw how simple it was to effect change.”

Not only have these changes helped FRCE become more environmentally friendly, but many of them have helped save the depot money, allowing additional funds to be refocused on supporting warfighter readiness, said Krelie.

“There’s a huge financial benefit to all of this,” Krelie said. “We received a significant credit on our utility bill when we reduced that 70,000 gallons of wastewater per day to 10,000 gallons. And replacing the lightbulbs with LED meant our electric bill went down. Because we are a working capital fund, these savings go back to our total operating expenses at the end of the year. We remain good stewards of the environment so we can continue to do what we do best, and we love hearing the sound of freedom in this local community.”

Azok said the facility has developed and implemented many workflows and regulations into its operations to mitigate their potential effect on the environment.

“We have strict controls in place in our shops that use these materials to control their usage,” said Azok. “There’s a lot of testing involved to make sure we’re not sending out anything that could negatively affect the wastewater treatment plant. We also have emission control devices, such as the air filtration system in our aircraft paint barn, to help protect our air from any chemicals. All chemicals are strictly managed so that no one can check them out unless they are trained, authorized and have demonstrated that they can maintain positive control over them from the time they are purchased, to when they are used and disposed.”

FRCE also requires employees to complete annual environmental training courses to increase awareness and effectiveness, said Azok.

“Everyone, no matter what they are hired as, has to participate in annual environmental training,” said Azok. “There is the environmental management system training that offers a high-level overview of the environmental regulations that we have here at FRC East, and the hazardous communication course that teaches you how hazardous materials interact with each other, with the environment and how they are managed. There are also many other required courses that many of us take, depending on our job descriptions and the areas we work. Our goal with these is to teach employees about the products we work with and our processes so we can properly identify and mitigate any potential issues and continue to be good stewards of our environment, all while keeping the workforce safe.”

Being a part of the Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers FRCE many benefits, Azok said, including mentorship and collaboration opportunities with other businesses within North Carolina.

“At the Steward level, not only are you at the highest level in the program, but you also have the opportunity to coach those who are in the lower levels and problem solve with other companies at the Steward level,” said Azok. “It opens up the ability to reach out and get information from other members. For example, another Steward reached out to us and asked how we manage our lithium batteries, since we’re one of the few organizations in the state that deal with that amount of those size and type of lithium batteries. We provided that information, along with some of our emergency procedures. It’s a great avenue for networking.”

Krelie said although FRCE has seen many environmental successes this past year, the focus remains on continuous improvement.

“We take a proactive stance because we want to make sure that we are not doing anything that can cause damage,” said Krelie. “Our first priority is to protect and preserve our environment, our workforce and the people in our community. We stay on top of new technology and research because if we can make changes to improve our green procurement of chemicals or find a better way to dispose of something, even if it’s not a regulatory requirement, we want to do that. We don’t want to have to play catch up later on down the road.”",https://www.navair.navy.mil/themes/custom/navy/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-08 09:00:44.659540

""Together, the three platforms create a fully integrated clean-energy flywheel from Manufacturing to Storage to Renewable Generation to Digital Energy Solutions.","New Delhi [India], December 8 (ANI): The Reliance Group unveiled a pivotal new phase of transformation driven by two high-impact national opportunity areas under its flagship company, Reliance Infrastructure--Integrated Solar Manufacturing, and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)--complemented by the rapid expansion of Reliance NU Energies, the integrated renewable energy platform of Reliance Power, the company said in a statement on Monday.

""Together, these next-generation growth engines place the Group at the forefront of India's clean-energy revolution,"" it said.

Reliance Group is setting up Integrated Solar Manufacturing Giga Factory an advanced, fully integrated solar manufacturing ecosystems spanning ingots, wafers, cells and modules.The key highlights include Next-gen technology using TopCon+ with future-ready configurations for back-contact and tandem cell technologies, the company said.

Plugged into policy tailwinds with Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) expansion to ingots, wafers and cells; PLI incentives; domestic content-mandated schemes.

It further said India will need 55-60 GW of solar modules annually by 2030, while upstream capacity remains significantly short. A high-value, vertically integrated platform to reduce import dependence and strengthen India's clean energy security.

The Group is establishing an end-to-end battery manufacturing ecosystem covering cell manufacturing, pack assembly and grid-scale containerised BESS systems, the statement said.

With India's installed stationary storage capacity currently below 1 GWh and projected to surge to nearly 250 GWh by 2032, the Group aims to address a massive supply gap, as domestic manufacturing today meets less than 10% of anticipated demand.

Strong policy incentives--including VGF support, PLI schemes and mandated storage requirements for renewable projects--further reinforce the strategic timing of this investment. Additionally, capacity constraints among global Tier-1 manufacturers create a unique India-centric opportunity, allowing Reliance to capture value through a midstream-focused BESS business that accounts for 60-70% of the total storage value chain, the statement said.

Alongside its manufacturing thrust, the Group is accelerating the growth of Reliance NU Energies, its premium, integrated renewable energy platform, the statement said.

""Reliance NU Energies is powering the shift from plain-vanilla solar to hybrid and firm, round-the-clock (RTC) renewable energy,"" the company said in its statement.

Over the past 12 months, the platform has secured a sizeable portfolio comprising 4.0 GW of solar capacity, 6.5 GWh of BESS installations and 770 MW of hydropower capacity in Bhutan backed by long-term, high-quality 25-year power purchase agreements.

Highlighting the platform's strategic edge, the company said it has the ability to deliver dispatchable green power through Solar + Wind + BESS hybrids, High-quality revenues through peak/RTC tenders, Digital optimisation for energy trading, forecasting and arbitrage as well as the multi-revenue stack leading to superior IRRs vs conventional renewables.

""Together, the three platforms create a fully integrated clean-energy flywheel from Manufacturing to Storage to Renewable Generation to Digital Energy Solutions. This positions the Group as a future-ready energy leader capable of supporting India's 500 GW non-fossil target and its broader Atmanirbhar Bharat vision,"" it said. (ANI)

He envisioned replacing America’s level of 1975 energy consumption with a 100 percent renewable system that does not replace 100 percent of the 1975 energy.
His view is that we should be substantially reducing per capita energy consumption as an integral element of the energy transition.
This seems like an awfully roundabout way of saying “do a carbon tax,” which is a fine idea, but it isn’t going to make electricity cheaper.
growth, then you clearly want a lot more electricity infrastructure, not just better demand-management.","I had an odd dispute with an energy policy wonk a few months ago in which I was saying that electricity is expensive in California — meaning that the price of electricity is high — and he was saying that it’s cheap, by which he meant the average household’s monthly electricity bill is not particularly high.

His point is true because the average California household uses a below-average amount of electricity compared to residents of other states. That’s in part because of energy efficiency standards, but it’s in part a function of weather and infrastructure.

They don’t use a lot of electricity for air conditioning in California because in large swaths of the state it’s generally not that hot in the summer. In the South, where you might think the mild winters would balance out the incredibly hot summers in terms of relative energy use, people tend to have inefficient, “good enough” electric resistance heaters for the occasional cold snaps (compared to places where it’s really cold, where people tend to burn gas or oil for home heat). So even though electricity is much cheaper in Alabama than in California, the average monthly electricity bill in Alabama is a lot higher.

Why does this matter?

Well, it’s a reminder that influential elements of the environmental movement are driven by their roots as a conservation movement. The core desire expressed here is to shrink the human footprint: to use less energy, build less stuff, and live more humbly and in harmony with a somewhat superstitious conception of “nature.”

You also see this in the Sierra Club’s strange journey on immigration, which they used to be very hostile to because of their degrowth values. They eventually dropped their anti-immigration stance and later became good progressive allies to the immigration advocates because of the awkward coalition politics.

But the Sierra Club and many other environmental groups didn’t drop the degrowth ideology.

They often say that they’ve dropped it, and I think they sometimes genuinely believe they’ve dropped it. But whenever the rubber hits the road, they are fundamentally more interested in learning to get by with less than in developing abundant clean energy.

And this is popping up in a serious way as the movement wrestles with rising electricity demand. Building a clean energy economy is going to require huge amounts of new electricity. That means tons of new generation and tons of new transmission infrastructure — gargantuan projects that will allow us to use electricity to power our cars, to cook our food, to heat our homes, and maybe eventually to ship our freight or provide heat for industrial purposes.

But instead of focusing on how to get all that electricity built as quickly and cleanly as possible, the greens want to impose tighter price controls on utilities, minimize infrastructure investment, and meet household energy needs with rationing.

The long war on utilities

Almost no one thinks that market competition works for electrical utilities. There are too many complexities involving public rights of way, and it’s too expensive to maintain multiple overlapping sets of transmission and distribution infrastructure that compete with each other.

There are a few ways to handle this non-competitive situation. One is public power, like you see with the Tennessee Valley Authority. Another is electric co-ops, of which there are many in the United States, but they’re generally small. A third is a regulated utility, where a private company acts as a monopoly provider but its rates are regulated by the government.

The utility model itself comes in two forms: “vertically integrated,” where the utility also owns power plants (this is most common in the Southeast), and “deregulated,” where, despite the name, the utility is highly regulated but purchases its actual electricity at market prices from competing generators. In both the vertically integrated and deregulated models, though, the utility’s profit margins and rate of return are capped.

What’s not capped is that if you build more infrastructure and sell people more electricity, you make more money. The point, traditionally, of utility regulation was to make electricity abundantly available. You prevent the utility from gouging its customers, but you encourage it to sell them more electricity.

Environmentalists have always hated this model, because they don’t think we should sell people more electricity. Amory Lovins and the Rocky Mountain Institute, for instance, spread the idea that the cheapest and greenest kilowatt-hour is the one you never use. Environmentalists want to promote conservation. They acknowledge that people need electricity, but they think that’s bad. If everyone can switch to different kinds of light bulbs so they don’t need as much electricity, that’s the win. They think the point of utility regulation should be to provide people with an adequate amount of energy to get by. That means there should be a positive financial incentive to get people to use less, rather than a positive financial incentive for the utility to build more and supply more.

Lovins — regarded as an authority by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra, and other major green groups — illustrates this well in his “soft energy path” charts. He envisioned replacing America’s level of 1975 energy consumption with a 100 percent renewable system that does not replace 100 percent of the 1975 energy. His view is that we should be substantially reducing per capita energy consumption as an integral element of the energy transition.

You can’t really make sense of anything these groups do without understanding that as the goal.

And of course it’s great to be less wasteful. But I think this is a fundamentally unappealing vision, which is why the groups that are promoting it tend not to state it as clearly as Lovins does. But with public anxiety about electricity prices rising, the opportunity has presented itself to kill two birds with one stone: if you can force utilities to accept a lower rate of return, you’ll address consumer demand for relief and achieve the long-term goal of handicapping energy infrastructure growth.

As you see greens try to address the political demand for affordability, keep your eyes peeled. There’s a big difference between an agenda to make energy more affordable through abundance and more affordable through rationing.

The soft path to rationing

Leah Stokes’s recent Atlantic article outlining ideas to make electricity cheaper is an example of both the agenda, and the tendency to rhetorically soft-pedal what the agenda actually is.

She writes that you could make electricity prices lower by cutting utilities’ rates of return, and that one benefit of this policy is that it would cause them to invest less.

Legislators could trim these profits directly by more closely aligning utilities’ guaranteed rates of return with their actual costs. Such adjustments could also limit utilities’ endless quest for more infrastructure.

I’m glad she said it so clearly here. Recently, Neale Mahoney and Bharat Ramamurti wrote an op-ed trying to convince people like me to worry less about price controls and see that those controls could be part of a one-two package of immediate consumer relief plus long-term supply-side measures.

And they definitely could be! But to understand the landscape, you have to understand that Stokes (a favorite at Sierra, League of Conservation Voters, Evergreen, and other mainstream green groups) doesn’t see the anti-supply impact of price controls as an undesirable downside — she sees it as a benefit. In their view, utilities are problematically overbuilding infrastructure, and we need to cut their rates of return, not just to save consumers money in the short term but to slow down utilities’ pace of investment.

Stokes offers two other ideas to make electricity cheaper. One is to take the portion of infrastructure costs that can be plausibly related to climate change off the ratepayers’ books, and instead allocate the blame for them to fossil fuel companies who will then be charged a fee. This seems like an awfully roundabout way of saying “do a carbon tax,” which is a fine idea, but it isn’t going to make electricity cheaper.

Then last but not least, she wants utilities to vary their pricing by the time of day.

In places with a lot of solar, including California, some installations are producing more energy than is being consumed, so some power is being wasted. If people shifted more of their electricity use toward the middle of the day, the grid’s overall costs would go down, because demand would decrease in later hours, when prices are the highest. And the easiest way to nudge people toward using that midday power is to make it cheaper — or even free.

Variable pricing seems like a reasonable idea to me (my uncle co-authored a paper advocating this a few years ago if you want a much more detailed version of the case), but it’s disingenuous to act like this is just going to be a case of cheap electricity in the early afternoon. To make this work, you need to have symmetrically higher prices at other times. More to the point, the green wing of the energy wonk community is suddenly buzzing in a frenzied way about responsive demand, as if this is some kind of magic alternative to major new capital investment, in a way that doesn’t make any sense to me.

Imagine if you electrified everything

A tell here, in my opinion, is that these takes often emphasize the question of data centers as drivers of new electricity demand. But imagine everyone decides tomorrow that AI is fake and nobody ever wants to build a data center again.

The climate movement itself has spent years prepping people to replace fossil fuels in cars, stoves, and furnaces with electricity. They want to ban gas leaf blowers and have people use electric ones instead. Electric boats aren’t quite ready for the mass market, but people are working on it. Electrifying heavy construction equipment, trucking, or freight rail seems further off, but one can imagine it happening and, again, it is specifically the climate movement that wants to do this.

Well, that means we’re gonna need a lot of electricity!

A small price nudge to encourage people to charge their electric vehicles at midday rather than in the evening is not going to replace the need for new infrastructure if you imagine a world where 100 percent of the cars are electric. And it’s definitely not going to work if you’re also electrifying home heating and larger and larger swaths of industry.

You of course do want to use infrastructure efficiently rather than inefficiently, but if you want to electrify large parts of the economy in the context of population growth and per capita G.D.P. growth, then you clearly want a lot more electricity infrastructure, not just better demand-management. That’s the appealing, optimistic vision of a modern dynamic approach to climate change.

But people who favor such an approach to climate change need to understand that the Stokes/Lovins vision that the green groups embrace is fundamentally different — they want decarbonization by rationing to avoid new infrastructure.

It’s important to be clear about the goal here because I think the progressive community raises reasonable questions about the whole regulated investor-owned utility model. There’s a lot to be said for the public power alternative!

But how we organize the utility sector is fundamentally less important than to what end we’re organizing it. If we replaced the investor-owned utilities of the Northeast with a T.V.A.-style agency, I think the goal should be to promote emissions reduction by making electricity cheaper and more abundant via a mix of natural gas, renewables, and transmission while hoping to participate in breakthroughs in nuclear and geothermal. And if we stuck with regulated utilities, I think the goal should also be to promote emissions reduction by making electricity cheaper and more abundant. We can debate the best policy mix to promote that goal, but we also need to debate the goal, and it’s one the green groups fundamentally reject.

They’d like you to see their posture as being more hardcore about climate change, but if you have a halfway realistic view of the politics, it’s not even that. People aren’t going to switch to electric cars and electric home heating if doing so raises their fuel costs, and you’re not going to have enough electricity to keep prices low in the context of electrification unless you build the infrastructure.

The case for ambition

Beyond the weeds of utility regulation, I’d like to motivate people to get off the soft path by reminding the world of the potential upsides of truly abundant energy.

One of the really big ones is the ability to do vertical farming.

This is a thing that people get excited about every few years because the benefits would be massive. Not only do vertical farms have a dramatically smaller geographical footprint than conventional farms, they are also wildly more resource efficient in terms of things like water and pesticides. The agriculture sector is responsible for dramatically more consumption of these resources than the overhyped data centers, but obviously people can’t just not eat food. The problem is that, offsetting all these benefits, a vertical farm would require lots of electricity to run, so it’s not within light-years from being cost-effective right now.

Similarly, if we could grow animal protein in a factory rather than raise livestock, we would achieve incredible ecological benefits and a massive reduction in cruelty. Powering such a factory with electricity is also in some sense more energy-efficient than growing crops to manufacture animal feed to give to chickens we then slaughter. But in a more literal sense, it would mean you’d need a ton of electricity.

It would also be nice to be able to actually do carbon removal to mitigate the harms of the global emissions overshoot that the world is all-but-certain to engage in. Perhaps this is doable, but it requires energy.

These somewhat utopian dreams are not policies for 2029 or even necessarily for 2050, but we ought to set high aspirations for a dynamic, cleaner, high-energy future. Sure, we should use our infrastructure as efficiently as we reasonably can. But the future ought to involve dramatically more electricity, which is going to mean dramatically more supportive infrastructure. A vision for utilities that doesn’t support that isn’t going to work.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBpD!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13c59467-5f25-4182-810e-b283c0133762_8000x5998.jpeg",N,,2025-12-08 10:01:40.640451

The milestone follows years of foundational support the startup received through riidl Somaiya Vidyavihar University, an incubation centre which nurtures startups by providing them with resources, labs, facilitating government grants, investor connections, funding and mentorship. A joint initiative of Somaiya Trust and Somaiya Vidyavihar, riidl provides mentorship through, early prototyping infrastructure, and access to government-backed programmes. Business incubators of riidl Somaiya Vidyavihar University are supported by the Department of Science & Technology; BIRAC, Department of Biotechnology; MeitY, Government of India and Maharashtra State Innovation Society, Government of Maharashtra. It has incubated over 300 startups and facilitated in creating 1000+ jobs and internship opportunities, while the total revenue generated by the startups is over INR 400 Cr. riidl Somaiya Vidyavihar University has been bestowed with the National Award for the year 2020 in the Emerging Technology Business Incubator category by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.

ACS Energy benefitted from the NIDHI Prayas prototyping grant by the Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India and its participation in the HDFC Parivartan Manufacturing Accelerator by HDFC Bank and riidl Somaiya Vidyavihar University, which enabled the team to build its early systems, engineering processes, and core charging technology, all while being supported by the Maharashtra State Innovation Society, Government of Maharashtra.

ACS Energy develops modular, user-friendly EV charging solutions for residential townships and high-rise buildings — an underserved but rapidly growing segment in India’s EV ecosystem. With this investment, the company aims to expand its charging network across Mumbai and other urban markets, strengthen its hardware-software stack, and accelerate deployments in gated communities and residential societies.

ACS’s chargers have already helped avoid more than 80 tonnes of tailpipe CO₂ emissions by shifting daily commuting from ICE vehicles to EVs charged on its network. Based on the total kWh delivered and average EV efficiency, this is equivalent to over 6,00,000 green kilometres of cleaner travel powered through ACS.

Founded by SVU alumni, ACS Energy traces its research roots to riidl and the ecosystem at Somaiya Vidyavihar University, where the team first began exploring EV technologies, system design, and early prototypes. The university’s research culture, engineering labs, and sustained incubation support through riidl Somaiya Vidyavihar University helped the founders transition from an academic project into a commercially deployable venture. ACS Energy’s first EV charging station was deployed on the Somaiya Vidyavihar University campus, providing the team with a live environment to test, validate, and optimise the technology before commercial rollout.

The green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress halt the proliferation of energy-hungry data centers, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and for exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.

“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.

The push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new data centers, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 data center projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.

These seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing data centers.

This threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.

However, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”

Yet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming data centers for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a nonpartisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.

“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.

“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”

Hua said the causes of the electricity cost rises are nuanced, with aging transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.

But it is the growth of data centers to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.

More broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.

This focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.

At the current rate of growth, data centers could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars onto the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.

But it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, one of the groups behind the letter to lawmakers.

“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.

“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7487c3a8c1ce3e04080db3f644342c8d03f0a1c9/250_0_7493_5995/master/7493.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1485952012d8787a058afb4ae905f485",N,,2025-12-08 08:01:04.738153

This article was produced in collaboration with the Environmental Justice Oral History Project.

Whitney Parker can’t escape the steady stream of trash that flows into his rural hometown.

From sunrise to sundown, six days a week, heavy-duty garbage trucks rumble past his home en route to the approximately 1,000-acre Sampson County Landfill in Roseboro. The trucks deliver roughly 1.8 million tons of waste each year from 44 counties across North Carolina. The air in the surrounding area is permanently tinged with the odor of rotting meat, sewage, and chemicals that lasts long after the trucks are gone.

“I sit in my yard and watch 18-wheelers full of toxic waste drive by—20 or 30 trucks within an hour,” Parker said. “And people say, ‘That’s just how it is.’”

In addition to the landfill, animal feeding operations and processing facilities have long contributed to environmental challenges in Sampson County, placing a heavy burden on the predominantly and historically Black communities that call the area home.

Decades of advocacy by residents of Roseboro’s Snow Hill neighborhood—plus a lawsuit filed by an environmental legal group—culminated in a landmark cooperative agreement in December 2024 between the Canadian solid waste company GFL Environmental and the local group, Environmental Justice Community Action Network.

Since that deal was inked last year, GFL has updated its pollution and odor monitoring procedures surrounding the landfill and agreed to establish several recycling programs and water filtration systems across the Sampson County School District.

“It’s not to say that the problems have been completely eliminated; residents are still reporting some issues,” said Kyron Williams, the Snow Hill community liaison for the network. “But I think generally speaking, at least as far as has been expressed to me, there’s been pretty good satisfaction between now and last year.”

More recently, the company and community representatives have also begun to establish a new community center and a nonprofit organization. But GFL has missed key deadlines to acquire property for the community center.

And some residents say concerns about the landfill, which are supposed to be handled through a new complaint system, aren’t being meaningfully addressed. The odor from the landfill is still unbearable, locals say.

GFL Environmental did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the cooperative agreement or ongoing community concerns.

“Every time we demand A, B, C, D, we’re told, ‘Calm down, give them time.’ But this is a billion-dollar company,” Parker said. “It’s been a lot of promises and press releases—but if anybody wants to challenge what we’re saying, show us the receipts.”

From Farm to Foul

The last time Paul Fisher saw Snow Hill in its original state was in 1966, when he left to serve in the military. He remembers it as idyllic.

“It was a nice, quiet community. It was clean. Everybody knew everybody,” he said.

In 1970, Sampson County commissioners first allocated funds for a new solid waste program. The original plan called for several smaller municipal dumps scattered throughout the county. However, after a wave of resistance from majority-white neighborhoods, officials quietly shifted direction.

By 1973, with little public notice or community consultation, they selected the rural, predominantly Black community of Snow Hill as the site for a consolidated county landfill. Construction began in 1975, the same year Fisher returned from military service.

Fisher brought his two daughters and built a home on land about a mile away from the landfill that had been in his family since the early 1900s, hoping they could experience a similar childhood. But as they settled in, he noticed many of his former neighbors moving out.

Though ownership and operators of the landfill have changed hands over the years, eventually landing under the management of GFL Environmental, the burden of the county’s decision has remained with Snow Hill’s residents for nearly half a century.

Eventually, Fisher’s children moved away as well. “My children are a little skeptical about retiring and moving back here … and I wouldn’t blame them if they decided not to come back,” he said.

Maia Hutt, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the lawsuit sought to force GFL to address problems stemming from generations of deferred action by the facility.

“Prior to this court-enforceable settlement agreement, community members expressed that complaints of nuisance conditions—odor, vermin, traffic, and garbage truck spills—were going unaddressed,” Hutt said in an email.

According to the original 2024 lawsuit, PFAS, a family chemicals known to accumulate in the human body, have been sent to the landfill for years.

The lawsuit also claimed that significant methane emissions, groundwater and soil contamination, and other nuisances—such as roadway waste and pests attracted to the rotting smells—reduced the wealth and quality of life for residents.

The provisions in the cooperative agreement aim to help make Snow Hill livable again. “This was the product of a multiyear effort by residents, scientists, and local activists,” Hutt wrote.

Fisher says he knows better than to blindly trust GFL. “I think GFL wants to do things for the community—not just because they want to, but because the laws have been changed and they don’t have too much choice,” he said.

The Agreement at a Glance

Williams, who was one of the network’s founding board members and formally joined the staff in November 2024, has been working to ensure GFL lives up to its commitments. According to him, the agreement requires GFL to take action to curb pollution and provide economic and health support for residents. “We used the environmental laws we had access to to bring some relief to the residents of Snow Hill,” Williams said.

The agreement does this by requiring GFL to stop discharging PFAS into nearby surface waters and enacting strict limits and monitoring to ensure that discharges meet Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards. The company also must get state approval to temporarily treat contaminated water discharged from two landfill points. During the first two months, GFL was supposed to remove at least 50% of five key forever chemicals; within three months to a year, it must remove 80%; and after one year, the treated water must meet the EPA’s official drinking water limits for those chemicals.

Additionally, the agreement requires GFL to remove PFAS from its leachate, or the water contaminated when filtered through the facility’s waste, a historical first for North Carolina landfills. The landfill is also required to expand its air quality tracking by deploying methane-sensing drones and hiring an outside consultant to design a continuous monitoring system.

To date, GFL has submitted applications to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality requesting permits to remove the vast majority of PFAS in its wastewater. On September 24, the state responded by issuing a public notice requiring the installation of a groundwater remediation system to reduce PFAS discharge levels by 90%. The order took effect on November 15.

The facility has also begun installing a perimeter odor management system to collect data that the public can use to better understand what’s being emitted in real time. GFL launched a complaint hotline and website where residents can report offensive odors, truck spills, reckless trash truck driving, or any other problem causing harm or nuisance from the facility. GFL must respond to complaints within seven business days and meaningfully address them within 14 business days.

Guarded Optimism

There are signs of progress as the agreement approaches its one-year mark. A public-facing dashboard to monitor odor surrounding the facility went live in November. In addition to the updated pollution monitoring procedures, the landfill has established 10 recycling programs and agreed to implement water filtration systems across the Sampson County School District.

Jamie King, superintendent of the Sampson County School District, said GFL initially approached him about supporting a recycling program at all Sampson County schools, one of the original terms of the settlement agreement. GFL representatives also suggested a composting system, but King told them he didn’t see the purpose.

As a regular attendee of county commission meetings, King was familiar with residents’ concerns about potential water contamination near the Sampson County Landfill. He believed new water filtration systems would provide a far greater benefit for students. “I came across water filtration systems for that area of the county and asked if it was something [GFL] would consider for students,” King said.

Although routine testing had not detected pollutants in the district’s water systems, King said the new filtration systems, currently installed only in Lakewood High School with plans for expansion districtwide if funding allows, provide added assurance for students and staff while serving as a critical environmental education tool on local water quality.

Born from this community agreement will be a new nonprofit organization, the Snow Hill 501(c)(3), whose primary function will be to administer community development projects funded through this community agreement. The agreement requires GFL to establish a community-controlled fund, the Snow Hill Community Fund, to support Snow Hill revitalization efforts and a regular public meeting cadence for consistent updates and feedback.

“This component of the settlement will be what the people of Snow Hill make it, and I am heartened to see the community coming together to start the process,” wrote Hutt.

According to Hutt, the community and GFL have begun the joint process of selecting a site for a new community center and allocating the first round of Community Fund grants.

However, the company has missed key deadlines for property acquisition for the community center, and no architectural plans are available for broader community input. Williams attributes the delay to factors beyond GFL’s and the community’s control.

“I know a lot of the residents were generally concerned that GFL was refusing to be compliant. But it’s actually a question of finding someone in an area with suitable land that they want to sell,” Williams said.

GFL and the lawyers representing the community are currently in negotiations to extend the deadline for land acquisition given the lack of available land. There’s also concern about the cost of remediation and the quality of a center that’s located on polluted land. “This is a landfill, so you’re talking everything from possible contamination to diesel spills from all the trucks. There’s some mess there that just may be cost prohibitive.”

Parker says the community meetings held to date haven’t allowed for accountability, with representatives arriving unprepared to present and providing minimal tangible updates. Although GFL established a complaint system, all responses from the landfill have been limited to explanations of the problem or the odor’s cause; community members say there have been no escalations or meaningful steps to address complaints.

Combined with still-unbearable odors and industrial dump trucks that speed through the neighborhood at the expense of residents’ and children’s safety, many in the community remain skeptical that this agreement will bring change.

“The phrase we keep hearing is, ‘We’re working in good faith,’ but there’s no documentation, no proof,” Parker said. “A year later, we’re still waiting.”

Now in his 40s, Parker has lived in the Snow Hill neighborhood his entire life. While he doesn’t remember a time before the landfill dominated his family’s ancestral land, he does recall when the acrid stench and unending parade of garbage trucks didn’t define daily life in his community.

“We went from thriving and living in technicolor to existing in black and white,” Parker said.

As a child, Parker remembers helping his mother till her garden for their daily produce and riding ATVs through the woods. But he says fresh food and outdoor play were quickly replaced by burning eyes, sore throats, and restless nights that could only be soothed by the constant hum of fans and a rotating collection of air fresheners.

It wasn’t long before daily discomfort turned into health problems; many residents, Parker included, link the landfill to pervasive respiratory illness, cancer, and kidney disease among Snow Hill residents. “Middle school was when we started seeing family with bone cancer, asthma, lung disease,” he recalled. In 2021, Parker’s parents died after years of battling unexplained illnesses.

Williams said Fisher and Parker are not the first nor will they be the last to raise concerns about the agreement, noting that some would have preferred a more aggressive legal approach against GFL in pursuit of reparations for the decades of hardship the community has endured.

“The existing environmental laws and regulations are not really designed to compensate the people that have been harmed. If they want a more aggressive approach, or they’re seeking financial damages … they would need to find outside attorneys that specialize in those types of lawsuits,” Williams said. “There was definitely anger … and even some mistrust, and that’s perfectly understandable and valid.”

After nearly three decades fighting landfill expansion, Fisher continues to attend public meetings convened under the cooperative agreement.

Fisher says he feels especially compelled to stay tuned in to ensure that the money allocated for community use is appropriately spent. “One of my biggest concerns is making sure nobody is doing anything to advance themselves,” he said. “The agreement is for the people.”

Fisher remains hopeful that if this agreement leads to lasting change, his children might return home.

“I feel tied to the property itself and would love to stay around here, pass it on to my children,” he said.

The National Security Strategy (NSS) of the United States, released on December 4, 2025, by the Trump administration, outlines a fundamental reorientation of U.S. foreign policy centered on an “America First” doctrine.

The 33-page document replaces the previous administration’s focus on global competition between democracies and autocracies with a highly transactional approach prioritizing core national interests: homeland security, domestic economic strength, and unilateral action.

Here is a summary of the strategy’s core priorities and shifts:

1. Core Strategic Priorities

Elevating the Western Hemisphere: The strategy declares the Western Hemisphere as the United States’ top priority. It calls for asserting and enforcing a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the region, focusing on securing the border, controlling illegal migration, and using lethal force to combat drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations.

Economic Reindustrialization: Economic security is defined as national security. The NSS pushes for an aggressive reindustrialization effort, tax cuts, deregulation, and “energy unleashing” to bolster the domestic industrial and manufacturing base, secure supply chains, and protect against predatory trade practices and grand-scale intellectual property theft.

A New Military Focus: The strategy emphasizes building the world’s most powerful military, including a robust nuclear deterrent and next-generation missile defenses dubbed the “Golden Dome.”

2. Realigned Global Posture

Europe and NATO (Burden-Shifting): The document marks a sharp departure from traditional alliances, explicitly tying U.S. support for NATO to a massive increase in defense spending and burden-sharing by European allies. It contains highly critical language, warning of “civilizational erasure” in Europe due to migration and stating the U.S. will focus on “cultivating resistance” to Europe’s current trajectory.

China and the Indo-Pacific: While China remains a key competitor, the strategy redirects focus away from the previous administration’s view of it as the “primary threat.” It calls for containing China’s global ambitions and addressing issues like IP theft and supply chain vulnerabilities. A priority remains deterring conflict over Taiwan by maintaining military overmatch in the First Island Chain and pushing allies like Japan and South Korea to step up their defense investments.

Russia: The document is restrained in its treatment of Russia compared to the previous NSS. It largely positions the U.S. as an arbiter, stating that the U.S. will prioritize “managing European relations with Russia” to mitigate the risk of conflict between Russia and European states.

Middle East: The strategy significantly downgrades the Middle East, stating that the historic reason for U.S. focus (energy reserves) is obsolete due to U.S. energy self-sufficiency. It advocates for accepting the region and its leaders “as they are,” reducing long-term commitments.

The investment bank — which also downgraded Tesla but raised its price target — cited concerns over slowing EV adoption and the loss of federal tax credits.

Morgan Stanley’s auto research coverage is now led by analyst Andrew Percoco, who took over from Adam Jonas.

Jonas said last August he would switch roles within the firm to focus on physical and embodied artificial intelligence (AI), including autonomous vehicles, electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, space and humanoid robots.

Rivian

Percoco downgraded Rivian from Equalweight to Underweight with a price target of $12.00 — implying a downside of 33.1% based on the Friday’s closing price.

The analyst said the company faces significant challenges as it prepares to launch its mid-sized SUV R2 into a difficult market environment.

The $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired on the last day of September, removing a key purchase incentive for consumers.

“Rivian faces outsized risk heading into 2026 as it launches its lower-priced R2 into a challenging EV market, where slowing adoption, loss of the $7,500 tax credit, and persistent consumer concerns (range anxiety, charging infrastructure, residual values, battery tech, affordability) create headwinds that a mass-market vehicle may struggle to overcome in the near-term,” Percoco wrote.

While the R2 expands the EV maker’s addressable market, the analyst warned of additional pressures on Rivian‘s existing lineup.

“We believe the company will also face residual-value pressure from R1 lease returns and potential demand cannibalization,” he added.

The company founded and led by RJ Scaringe says it will have annual production capacity for more than 150,000 R2 vehicles once ramped up, with an R2 completed on average every two minutes.

Percoco acknowledged Rivian‘s strengths but noted competition from Tesla‘s autonomous driving technology remains a concern.

“Rivian‘s strong design and performance help, but Tesla‘s rapidly advancing FSD will require greater conviction in Rivian‘s AV capabilities,” he wrote, adding that investors should “expect more details at Rivian‘s upcoming AI day on December 11th.”

Over the last few weeks, Tesla has been accelerating the rollout of new FSD (Supervised) versions in the US while starting test rides in several key European markets.

Looking at Rivian‘s financial outlook, Percoco forecasts that auto gross margins excluding credits will remain relatively stable in 2026 as R2 scaling reduces bill-of-materials costs, with software and services contributing incremental high-margin revenue.

The analyst projected a $2.9 billion adjusted EBIT loss for the year.

After approximately $300 million of working capital needs and $1.6 billion of capital expenditures, Percoco expects Rivian to burn $4.2 billion of free cash flow, though he noted the company should receive its next tranche of capital from Volkswagen upon completion of winter testing in the first quarter of 2026.

Rivian ranked first for the third consecutive year in Consumer Reports’ Owner Satisfaction ratings, which evaluates vehicles based on performance, comfort and usability.

According to the survey, 85% of Rivian owners would buy the company’s vehicles again, the highest score among the 26 automakers evaluated.

BMW ranked second with a 71% rate, while Tesla followed closely in fourth place with 69%.

Tesla

Percoco downgraded Tesla from Overweight to Equalweight with a price target of $425.00, up from $410.00.

Tesla shares closed at $455 on Friday and are up 12.7% year to date.

The stock reached its 2025 high at $474 in early November, just $14 below the all-time high of $488.54 registered exactly a year ago.

Following the Morgan Stanley note, shares traded 1.2% lower in Monday’s pre-market session.

Aside from the note, Chief Executive Elon Musk escalated over the weekend political tensions, urging to “Dissolve the EU and return power to the people.”

Morgan Stanley’s analyst said Tesla deserves a premium valuation given its leadership position across multiple sectors but noted the stock has moved closer to fair value.

“Tesla is a clear global leader in electric vehicles, manufacturing, renewable energy, and real world AI and thus deserving of a premium valuation,” Percoco wrote. “However, high expectations on the latter have brought the stock closer to fair valuation.”

The new price target implies 6% downside from current levels.

While acknowledging that Tesla is more than an auto manufacturer, Percoco cautioned investors to expect volatility ahead.

“We expect a choppy trading environment for the TSLA shares over the next 12 months, as we see downside to estimates, while the catalysts for its non-auto businesses appear priced at current levels, driving our EW rating,” he wrote.

The analyst said Morgan Stanley conducted a comprehensive review of its Tesla model, adding humanoid robot valuation supported by the firm’s Global Humanoid team’s total addressable market analysis, expanding its robotaxi model with proprietary market research, broadening its Network Services model including Full Self-Driving, and moderating its Auto and Energy forecasts.

Lucid

Percoco downgraded Lucid from Equalweight to Underweight with a price target of $10.00, down sharply from $30.00.

The new target is equivalent to $1.00 when adjusted for the 1-for-10 reverse stock split that became effective in September.

Based on Lucid‘s closing price last Friday, the revised target implies downside of 25.5% and would represent a new all-time low for the California-based EV maker.

The analyst said Lucid‘s premium positioning offers some protection against near-term volatility from the expiration of federal EV tax credits compared to mass-market competitors.

“Lucid‘s premium positioning and higher ASPs help buffer near-term volatility from the loss of EV tax credits relative to other mass-market EV OEMs,” Percoco wrote.

He highlighted the company’s industry-leading battery efficiency, which led to a technology-licensing agreement with Aston Martin, but said long-term success depends on executing its expansion into more affordable vehicles.

“Its path to profitability hinges on successfully scaling its more affordable midsize platform,” the analyst wrote, noting start of production is expected in late 2026 with production ramping in 2027.

Percoco does not forecast Lucid reaching gross profitability until 2028. While operating expenses are expected to remain stable and EBIT losses per vehicle should improve from $216,000 in 2025 to $126,000 in 2026, he projects losses will persist until 2031.

The analyst also flagged significant dilution risk for shareholders, estimating the company will need to raise approximately $2 billion in equity by the second half of 2026 relative to its $4.6 billion market cap.

The bearish outlook contrasts with recent comments from Lucid management.

Chief Financial Officer Taoufiq Boussaid said last week in a fireside chat that the company will register a new sales record in the fourth quarter as new orders trend as expected.

Asked about the usual stronger quarter in the final months of each year, Boussaid said: “There is definitely some seasonality. So we tend to compare versus last year, obviously, versus previous quarter. So as it trends now, I mean, we will see quarter-over-quarter growth.”

The CFO did not provide specific sales or production targets for the quarter, nor did he reference the company’s 18,000-unit annual production guidance.

Meeting that target would require approximately 8,034 units in the fourth quarter — more than double the third quarter’s 3,891 units — based on the 9,966 vehicles produced in the first three quarters.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rivian_R3X_Ext_01.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 07:00:37.281298

The action is a major step on the road to a broad permitting compromise that members of both parties want to pass this Congress. But deep divisions persist between and within parties.

House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-W.Va.), for example, has been looking to secure support for the “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” H.R. 4776, which would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act. It’s scheduled to reach the floor next week.

Many Democrats say it would go too far in cutting oversight of polluters and public participation. Far-right conservatives are now saying it would continue federal incentives for renewable energy.

Bills on the floor agenda this week are likely to pass easily. Some are even expected to advance with broad bipartisan backing under a process called suspension of the rules.

One sweeping measure, H.R. 3898, the “Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today (PERMIT) Act,” cobbles together several Republican bills to facilitate Clean Water Act reviews.

The bill would limit state authority to block projects like pipelines, would add limits for environmental suits and would restrict EPA’s ability to veto Army Corps of Engineers permits.

The package has the backing of major trade groups. Environmentalists and most Democrats, on the other hand, argue the legislation would tie the hands of EPA and state regulators.

Also on deck this week, H.R. 3668, from Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), would amend the Natural Gas Act to empower the Federal Regulatory Agency Commission to accelerate pipeline reviews.

On the suspension calendar are: H.R. 4503, the “ePermit Act,” which would better digitize the permit process, and H.R. 573, the “Studying NEPA’s Impact on Projects Act,” which would direct the Council on Environmental Quality to publish an annual report.

NEPA bill drama

This week’s legislation includes key Republican demands in the broader permitting discussions. A bipartisan trade-off, in theory, could include a mix of faster reviews, litigation limits, permitting certainty for specific renewable projects, a transmission build-out and perks for mining.

Republicans have succeeded in rolling back NEPA’s reach on Capitol Hill and in the Supreme Court. But they want more. Democrats, for their part, are focused on promoting renewable energy, making sure that green generation can reach population centers and stopping President Donald Trump from attacking projects.

Westerman, trying to corral both sides, is running into trouble with House Freedom Caucus members who say his bill would give Democrats too much. They find a bipartisan committee amendment on permit certainty particularly egregious.

“The last thing we need to do with offshore wind is to tie the administration’s hands in stopping that ridiculously expensive source of energy that enriches foreign companies with American taxpayer dollars,” said Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) last week. “Unfortunately, that’s exactly what the ‘SPEED Act’ would do.”

Last week, Westerman went on the Newt Gingrich’s podcast to talk about the need for NEPA reform, echoing an argument that has been blaring from the White House: affordability.

“There’s probably not any one issue that effects every American more than NEPA other than tax policy,” he said, pointing to its impact on ports, airports, pipelines and the grid. “Some way or another the NEPA process effects all Americans,” he said.

Tom Pyle, president of the conservative American Energy Alliance, said the measure “shouldn’t be controversial since it is seeking to get NEPA back to its original intent.”

But he argued it should not be used as a bargaining chip for socializing the cost of transmission. “That would be a lopsided trade,” he said. “We would need way more than that.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/31/e8/d4341b0a4a118a9e48e27a6f1744/u-s-congress-78047.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 08:01:19.457063

Upholding the law to protect them isn’t a threat to our prosperity, it is its very source.","We are told we face a difficult choice: protect our water or secure our energy. This is a false narrative, manufactured by a foreign corporation and its allies to disguise their illegal occupation of our Great Lakes. The real choice before us, and the urgent duty before our state officials, is between upholding the law or capitulating to corporate power.

My remarks are directed to those in Lansing with the power to act.

An orderly, planned shutdown of Line 5 is not a concession; it is an affirmation. It is how we uphold the laws that protect the Public Trust Doctrine enshrined in our state constitution. It is how we defend state sovereignty by enforcing our Governor’s valid revocation of an easement that a corporation continues to violate with impunity. It is how we honor Tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, respecting the original stewards of these waters whose survival and culture are non-negotiable.

Critically, moving forward with a shutdown is how we boost jobs and domestic energy security. Since the Snyder administration, studies have confirmed that alternatives exist, but corporate greed has blinded our decision makers. Shutting Line 5 means investing in Michigan labor to build and maintain modern, safer energy infrastructure, not relying on a 70-year-old line in the heart of our Straits to send Canadian oil to foreign markets. True energy independence is built on innovation and resilience, not on doubling down on a risky, outdated conduit.

Yet, we are trapped in a cycle of unreasonable court delays, a strategy employed by Enbridge to run out the clock and amplify their threats to our communities. Every day our state wavers in its political will to enforce its own laws is a day we normalize this illegality.

This moment sets a national precedent. If Michigan, surrounded by the world’s greatest freshwater system, cannot summon the courage to prioritize the Great Lakes over a Canadian oil giant’s profits, what state can? We are signaling to every corporation that they can defy environmental orders, manipulate legal systems, and place their infrastructure above the public interest. As a wave of data centers enters the chat, Enbridge is paving their way for lawlessness. We are telling our citizens and Tribal nations that their rights are secondary to corporate convenience.

We do not need more grandstanding. We need the bold leadership that was promised when the shutdown was ordered. We need leaders who see that enforcing the law is the pro-jobs, pro-sovereignty, and pro-American energy path.

The call is clear. Use every tool of State government to end this illegal occupation and manage a transition that protects our water and our workers. Demonstrate to the nation that when the health of the Great Lakes and the rule of law are at stake, Michigan will lead.

Our Great Lakes are not a bargaining chip. They are the foundation of our identity, economy, and future. Upholding the law to protect them isn’t a threat to our prosperity, it is its very source.

While unconfirmed, various media reports suggest that the battery supply now under negotiation is intended for Mercedes’ mid-range and entry-level electric vehicles.
Korean media, however, reported that the contract was based on 46-series cylindrical cells, which are to be supplied from 2028 onwards.
Here, too, media reports identified the 46-series cylindrical cells as the subject of the contract.
Since the newly announced deal spans similar timeframes as the two aforementioned contracts, it seems logical that Mercedes has not ordered 46-series cylindrical cells again—though this is not yet certain.","Several Korean media outlets report, citing a regulatory filing from LG Energy Solution (LGES), that the new contract provides for the supply of LG batteries to Mercedes-Benz in North America and Europe over a period of seven years, from 1 March 2028 to 30 June 2035. However, LGES stated in its filing that the contract value and duration may still change, and no further details are currently available. For now, it remains unclear whether only battery cells or complete battery packs will be supplied.

The contract value of two trillion won, as reported by Pulse, the English-language edition of Maeil Business News Korea, represents around eight per cent of LGES’s revenue in the previous year. At that time, the company generated 25.62 trillion won. While unconfirmed, various media reports suggest that the battery supply now under negotiation is intended for Mercedes’ mid-range and entry-level electric vehicles. “Considering that the three major supply deals between the companies over the past two years were believed to involve cylindrical 46-series batteries for high-performance, high-end models, analysts view this new deal as targeted toward mid-priced vehicles,” the newspaper report states. No further details—such as form factor or cell chemistries—have been disclosed.

One thing is clear: the ties between both parties are strengthening. As early as October 2024, LG Energy Solution signed a contract with Mercedes-Benz for 50.5 GWh of batteries. Details remained scarce at the time, and it was unclear whether only cells or ready-to-install battery packs would be delivered. Korean media, however, reported that the contract was based on 46-series cylindrical cells, which are to be supplied from 2028 onwards. This September, another major deal covering 107 GWh was announced (75 GWh for delivery to the USA between mid-2029 and the end of 2037; 32 GWh for Europe between mid-2028 and the end of 2035). Here, too, media reports identified the 46-series cylindrical cells as the subject of the contract. If all details are confirmed, the total volume of the two contracts amounts to nearly 160 GWh of large cylindrical cells. Since the newly announced deal spans similar timeframes as the two aforementioned contracts, it seems logical that Mercedes has not ordered 46-series cylindrical cells again—though this is not yet certain.

Incidentally, according to further information from Korean portals, the September contract was only awarded after intense competition with Chinese battery manufacturers such as CATL and Farasis. Both companies, along with LGES, are already regular battery suppliers to the Stuttgart-based automaker. While Mercedes is also involved in a battery manufacturing joint venture, namely ACC, its demand far exceeds the planned output of ACC. This is particularly true as plans for two of the three ACC plants are currently on hold, and the proposed factory in Italy is reportedly on the verge of being scrapped.

Mercedes CEO Ola Källenius is therefore seeking stability in supplier relations: in mid-November, Källenius met with representatives of the LG Group in Seoul to discuss future collaboration in the mobility sector. The Mercedes top executive subsequently stated that Mercedes-Benz and LG share a common vision based on innovation, quality, and sustainability—and that they are working together to set new standards in the global automotive industry.

The bipartisan state law that created the program doesn’t mandate that HUB-certified businesses are granted state contracts, but sets goals that state agencies are encouraged to meet.
West disputed Hancock’s ability to alter the HUB program in such a significant way without the approval of the Legislature.
She credited the HUB program with her success winning government contracts soon after starting her business in 2016 and said she believes the Comptroller’s decision will cause her business to lose money.
Many companies use their HUB certification as a marketing tool, but now they will have to find other ways to attract customers, she said.","Julie Irvin Hartman started her Tuesday with welcome, but confusing news.

The application she had submitted weeks ago to renew her business’s certification as a Historically Underutilized Business had been approved, despite acting state Comptroller Kelly Hancock’s late October announcement that he was freezing the program intended to give businesses owned by women, minorities and disabled veterans a boost when seeking state government contracts.

But hours later, the comptroller’s office emailed Hartman again, notifying her and more than 15,000 other small businesses — nearly 97% of the certified HUB businesses in Texas — that they were being removed from the HUB program entirely.

Then her phone notifications exploded.

The owner of Tomball-based B2G Victory, Hartman has built her business around advising other small businesses about how to navigate the world of government contracting, making her the first call for many of her confused clients who also received the comptroller’s email.

“I’m the expert in this space and I’m charging expert fees, and telling people, ‘I don’t know,” Hartman said. “So what value am I providing? It’s tough right now … I’ve had a lot of sleepless nights.”

Hartman and thousands of other HUB-certified businesses have faced uncertainty since Hancock first announced the freeze of the decades-old program, arguing that it may run afoul of both the state and U.S. constitutions, without pointing to any specific violation. No state or federal judge has ruled the program unconstitutional.

The program launched in the 1990s and is administered by the Comptroller’s office, which certifies HUB businesses that can show a majority of their ownership is “economically disadvantaged” people — including women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Americans and service-disabled veterans.

The bipartisan state law that created the program doesn’t mandate that HUB-certified businesses are granted state contracts, but sets goals that state agencies are encouraged to meet.

Hancock said it was necessary to freeze and review the program to ensure it complies with Gov. Greg Abbott’s January executive order banning programs that promote “diversity, equity and inclusion” from state agencies. Then the Comptroller’s office announced Tuesday that the HUB program will now only be available to small businesses controlled by veterans with a 20% percent or higher service-connected disability.

That decision excludes the vast majority of the previously HUB-certified businesses while maintaining the status quo for 485 disabled veteran-owned businesses, according to a May comptroller’s report. All 485 are owned by men, according to the report.

“Our nation’s veterans have always stepped up for us,” Hancock wrote in a statement Tuesday. “VetHUB is Texas’ way of stepping up for them — cutting red tape, restoring constitutional integrity and opening doors for the men and women who wore our nation’s uniform. These emergency rules ensure Texas’ state contracting is free from gender or race discrimination and keep the program centered on those who earned this support through their service.”

A frequently asked questions page on the Comptroller’s website assured HUB businesses with current government contracts that those agreements would be honored for the duration of the contract.

Garry Olson, owner of Austin-based IT solutions company Semper Feye Solutions and a service-disabled veteran, had spent weeks fretting over the possibility of losing his ongoing state contracts if the HUB freeze did not end before his certification expires in February.

“I have heard that there were issues with the program before, but I’ve never had any problems with it,” Olson said. “I was thankful to be a part of it, and I’m thankful to still be a part of it.”

Efforts to kill HUB program failed in Legislature

State Sen. Royce West, a Dallas Democrat who co-authored the 1999 bill that created the HUB program, said it’s a necessary tool to correct historical discrimination in government contracting.

“Black businesses, Hispanic businesses, women-owned businesses, all the other categories in the HUB statute were not able to have meaningful participation for procurement opportunities with the state,” West said. “Recognizing quotas would be illegal, we put together a good faith program to look at whether or not agencies are making good faith efforts to bring in those categories that have been historically discriminated against.”

Several Republican bills aimed at killing the HUB program entirely were filed earlier this year in the Legislature. They all died without making progress in either chamber.

West disputed Hancock’s ability to alter the HUB program in such a significant way without the approval of the Legislature.

“If we allow an officer not associated with the legislative body that passed the law signed by the governor to do this to this program, what else will they attempt to do that is outside the scope of their statutory authority?” West said.

Companies scrambling to adjust without HUB

Kate Kossack’s staffing agency, Cedar Park-based HireOps Staffing, was HUB-certified as a woman-owned business and is a subcontractor on a state contract in the health care field. She credited the HUB program with her success winning government contracts soon after starting her business in 2016 and said she believes the Comptroller’s decision will cause her business to lose money.

“In staffing, it’s hard to compete with bigger firms … Not having restrictions from the state will open the door to let (larger companies) do absolutely whatever they want,” Kossack said. “We could just be left in the dust.”

Helen Callier, who owns Kingwood-based BradLink LLC, a HUB-certified architectural design and project management firm, said she knows she will still be able to find work despite losing her HUB status, but her company will have to make changes. Many companies use their HUB certification as a marketing tool, but now they will have to find other ways to attract customers, she said.

“I know some folks that are sweating because they see their certification as the only means of doing business at the state level,” Callier said. “The bottom line is that’s not the case, but you have to suit up and go after it now.”

Hartman, the government contracting adviser, said losing her HUB status is unlikely to put her out of business, but she saw her revenue drop after the Comptroller’s office froze the program.

Hartman’s company is paid by procurement offices and chambers of commerce to host seminars explaining the certification process to other small businesses, and she said many of them have been canceled since the freeze began. Clients have hesitated to renew their contracts with her company after the freeze began, she added, and the company stands to lose as much as 25% of its annual revenue this year alone.

As she fields calls from confused clients and works to interpret the latest guidance from the Comptroller, Hartman has spent the past week driving back and forth between the Houston area and Austin as she moves her father into hospice care.

“I’m having to make a decision between what’s right for my industry, what’s right for my company, what’s right for my clients and what’s right for me as a daughter being there for my family,” Hartman said. “I’ve been an entrepreneur for 23 years … this has been the hardest year.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251204-Julie-Irvin-Hartman-HUB-LS-07.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 07:01:16.507030

For us at Rolec and other businesses in the marina sector, it is a mindset and an ongoing commitment that combines ethical responsibility with practical business sense. Done properly, it is about anchoring changes that last and not simply ticking boxes.

‍We all know that the marina sector is closely tied to nature. Coastal and inland waters are delicate ecosystems and those who manage, operate and develop marinas cannot ignore their duty to protect and preserve. Visitors increasingly expect clean energy, waste reduction and sustainable infrastructure and not as optional extras. The challenge is not whether we can afford to act, but whether we can afford not to.

A longstanding commitment

The most responsible companies were already taking steps that aligned with environmental stewardship long before “sustainability” became a boardroom talking point. At the time, many of these decisions weren’t branded as such, we simply viewed them as good practice.

For example, using local supply chains reduced unnecessary transport miles and supported regional economies. Engineering products for durability meant fewer replacements, lower material usage and extended product life cycles. Minimising waste was about efficiency and diligence. On Rolec’s part, these principles were quietly embedded into the company’s operations long before they became part of environmental, social and governance (ESG) checklists.

At its core, sustainability has always been about consciously building for the future. Decisions made in design, sourcing and manufacturing directly affect customers, industry and future generations. ISO 14001 certification - as we achieved in 2015 - can formalise our environmental management systems and give structure to future sustainability initiatives.

The strength of manufacturing control

The strength of manufacturing contro

As UK manufacturers, Rolec maintains full control over the build and development of our core product range. This visibility across the entire life cycle - from concept to creation, delivery and ongoing maintenance - gives us opportunities to implement positive innovations at every stage.

For example, by upgrading our solar array and reducing our consumption of heating oil across the site, we achieved an estimated annual CO₂ saving of 76,410kg. Battery storage can also capture excess solar energy to power factories and charge electric vehicles without drawing from the grid. These steps not only reduce emissions but also improve energy resilience, something that many marinas are equally striving to achieve as energy prices fluctuate and sustainability targets tighten.

Reducing the size of packaging is another simple way that companies can become more sustainable. After we reduced the size of our packaging, we could ship 50 percent more products per pallet, which has cut transport-related emissions by 33 percent and lowered logistical costs. This benefits both our operations and operators who are conscious of supply chain impact. At the same time, we ensured all materials used in preparing products for shipping are certified by the UK’s Forest Stewardship Council and 100 percent recyclable. A switch to water-based inks further reduced our carbon footprint by nearly 40 percent. These measures may sound incremental, but collectively they demonstrate how small, thoughtful decisions build towards meaningful results.

Closing the loop

Waste is another area where continuous improvement can deliver change for sustainability-conscious companies across the marina industry. Not only should manufacturing refuse be diverted to recycling facilities, but any remaining waste can be converted into solid recovered fuel (SRF) to avoid sending things to landfill. At Rolec, at the time of writing, 70 percent of our manufacturing refuse is diverted to recycling facilities, and the remaining 30 percent of waste material is converted into SRF.

This approach reduces environmental burden while supporting a circular economy, meaning one where raw materials are continuously repurposed. For the marina sector, the concept of circularity has particular resonance. Marinas generate waste ranging from packaging and plastics to maintenance residues, and every site has a role to play in ensuring these materials are handled with care throughout multiple life cycles.

ESG beyond compliance

Today, ESG factors dominate the conversation around a green future. But the real test is ensuring that these commitments go beyond compliance. ESG for show does nothing to serve the long-term interests of businesses, communities or natural environments.For marinas, ESG must be genuine and measurable. Coastal protection, biodiversity, energy efficiency and the experience of berth holders all intersect in ways that cannot be managed through surface-level initiatives. Customers are discerning and regulators are watching.

The businesses that will thrive are those that view ESG not as a hurdle, but as an opportunity to enhance operations and work towards an ever more sustainable future.Our role as manufacturers is to align our processes and supply chains with these long-term goals. That means designing durable products, reducing emissions, managing waste ethically and providing infrastructure that helps marinas meet their own sustainability goals.

‍Looking ahead

‍No single company can claim to have “solved” sustainability. The nature of the challenge is that it demands constant progress, adaptation and shared responsibility. The real impact comes from working together, and collaborations across the industry can deliver holistic solutions that help marinas achieve better energy management, more effective solar initiatives, measured resource consumption and long-term strategic development.

As Rolec’s Commercial Director, Holly Brown, put it: “Sustainability in practice is about doing what’s right because we always have and because we always will.” That’s why sustainability efforts should not be a finite project, but instead an ongoing process. Each year brings new opportunities to reimagine, refine, reduce and renew no matter what the industry, and the marina sector is no different. The real measure is not in what one says, but in what one does. Only by prioritising substance over image can we ensure that progress is genuine and lasting, rooted in practice and not in PR.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67d04d17b92017a1fbdd0547/6936aa1a379959f9e2a19718_Marina.avif,N,,2025-12-08 07:00:55.753230

Ottawa, Ontario--(ACN Newswire - December 8, 2025) - Focus Graphite Inc. (TSXV: FMS) (OTCQB: FCSMF) (FSE: FKC0) (""Focus"" or the ""Company""), a leading developer of high-grade flake graphite deposits and innovator of next-generation lithium-ion battery technology, is pleased to announce that it has moved from conditional approval to a fully executed, non-repayable contribution agreement (the ""Agreement"") with Natural Resources Canada (""NRCan"") for funding up to $14,062,500 under the Global Partnerships Initiative (""GPI"").

The Agreement formalizes the federal government's support for Focus Graphite's project titled: ""Transformation of Canadian Flake Graphite into Ultra-High Purity Battery & Advanced Materials Using Electrothermal Fluidized Bed Technology"" (the ""Project""). The Project unites Canadian, Ukrainian, and U.S. partners to produce ultra-high purity graphite for global battery, aerospace, defence, and advanced material markets.

The Agreement provides non-dilutive funding for the development, piloting, and commercial demonstration of Focus's clean electrothermal purification process, enabling conversion of Quebec sourced natural flake graphite into ultra-high purity anode and advanced materials products. The Project also advances broader NATO, G7, and European policy objectives for secure, diversified, and ESG aligned critical mineral supply chains.

Once complete, the demonstration system is expected to produce purified graphite at volumes sufficient not only for downstream qualification, but also scalable to supply meaningful quantities to defence, aerospace, energy storage, and advanced materials markets. This production capability represents a major step toward commercial readiness and supports the Company's downstream strategy by enabling Focus to deliver high purity material for evaluation and early market entry while continuing to advance its mining projects and longer-term processing infrastructure.

""Execution of this Agreement significantly strengthens Focus Graphite's ability to help supply our allies with secure, ESG aligned, high purity graphite,"" said Dean Hanisch, Chief Executive Officer. ""Chinese graphite is currently embedded throughout North American military, aerospace, and energy systems, creating strategic vulnerabilities across the entire allied value chain. The ability to produce ultra-high purity material domestically, and process it using a clean, chemical free purification method, positions Focus to directly support the shift toward reliable, non-Chinese sources of strategic critical minerals.""

""This Agreement unlocks our ability to move qualified graphite samples to international partners at a much faster pace, which is essential for advancing offtake discussions,"" said Jason Latkowcer, Vice President of Corporate Development. ""We will continue to advance our Lac Knife and Lac Tetepisca projects while simultaneously delivering the high-purity material that allied partners require to validate Canadian graphite within their defence, aerospace, energy storage, and advanced-materials supply chains.""

""Advancing research and development is essential to securing resilient and sustainable critical mineral supply chains. Through the G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan, we continue to work with trusted partners to deliver innovative projects—like the progress achieved by Focus Graphite-that reinforce Canada's decades-long leadership in the mining space, which allows us to supply our allies and become an energy superpower while reducing emissions,"" said the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.

Federal Funding Details

Under the executed Agreement, NRCan will provide up to $14,062,600 in non-repayable funding, representing approximately 73.6% of total eligible project costs. Focus Graphite will contribute $4,787,500 in cash and an additional $250,000 in in-kind contributions toward the Project. The eligible expenditures period extends from October 14, 2025 through March 31, 2028, during which the Company will execute all approved Project activities.

Funding will support the full work program outlined in the Agreement, including feedstock preparation, pilot-scale metallurgical processing, electrothermal purification trials, feasibility study, and the engineering, procurement, installation, and commissioning, and demonstration of a commercial demonstration furnace.

Advancing a North American, Sovereign Supply Chain

This federal investment advances Focus Graphite's objective of establishing a secure, fully North American graphite and advanced materials supply chain. The Project is specifically structured to reduce reliance on Chinese processing routes and aligns with critical mineral strategies aimed at enhancing energy security, industrial resilience, and defence readiness. The ultra-high purity graphite produced through this initiative is expected to supply key downstream sectors prioritized by Canada and its allies, including defence and aerospace, energy storage, electric vehicles, advanced materials, and anode production.

For years, North Carolina did this, taking a broad view on whether isolated and semi-dry wetlands deserved additional protections.
Thus if the proposed EPA rule becomes law, it would strip protections from North Carolina wetlands that previously had to meet more stringent state regulations.","Environmentalists worry the change could increase flooding risks and allow unsafe development in North Carolina.

Supporters of the new rule state it will provide clarity for landowners and reduce regulatory burdens.

North Carolina law now mirrors federal wetland protections, meaning the state will not offer more stringent regulations.

Following a trend that started in 2023 with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, it's been a rough few years for North Carolina's wetlands and their supporters.

Now an announcement by the Trump administration that it could further water down federal protections for certain types of wetlands has raised more red flags among environmentalists, emergency managers, and local officials. They are worried about what losing even more marsh areas could mean in a state that's shown itself to be vulnerable to flooding from heavy storm events like 2016's Hurricane Matthew and 2018's Hurricane Florence − weather events that are expected to increase in coming years and decades thanks to climate change.

Some officials also fear the removal of wetland protections will see development allowed in these historically ""wet"" areas, putting additional people and properties in harm's way.

""Wetlands are an important line of defense in North Carolina’s flood-prone communities,"" said Will McDow, associate vice president with Environmental Defense Fund, in a news release. ""With this ruling, we may see significant decline in healthy wetlands and watch developers build unsafe housing that either floods or increases flooding to neighbors.”

What's new?

Two years ago the Supreme Court released a decision that dramatically reduced the protections offered to wetlands under the federal Clean Water Act. The court said only wetlands that have a ""continuous surface connection"" that make it ""indistinguishable"" from a federally protected waterway should be protected by the law. That meant isolated wetlands or areas that are only ""wet"" during certain times of year could lose their protections.

Prior to the ruling, isolated wetlands and wetlands that are only wet for part of the year, like pocosin wetlands that are common in many areas of Eastern N.C., had been protected in many states, including North Carolina, through a broad interpretation of what constitutes a federally protected wetland.

While the Supreme Court said what the requirement for federal protections of wetlands should be, it didn't define what constitutes a surface connection or what makes one wetland indistinguishable from another.

On Nov. 17, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to float a new rule that ""would establish a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.""

What would be the impact of the proposed rule?

The EPA's proposed new definition would exclude wetlands that abut or touch streams that do not flow during dry periods. It also could exclude ephemeral streams and ponds, which sit dry for much of the year and only fill up only after rains. The National Resources Defense Council has estimated up to 55 million acres of wetlands nationwide could lose federal protections under the new language.

According to an EPA release, the proposal ""will cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act.""

Lee Zedlin, head of the EPA, said the new rule would return control of private property back to landowners and out of the hands of bureaucrats and regulators.

""We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule,"" he said. ""No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.""

For years, farmers and developers have claimed the environmental community has overstated the economic, wildlife, water quality, and flood-control benefits of isolated and ""pocket"" wetlands that aren't part of larger natural systems.

They also said the old interpretation of which wetlands, like manmade drainage ditches, should receive federal protection made life difficult for farmers and limited what property owners could do with their land, hampering economic development opportunities in many communities.

What about flooding?

But environmentalists and others say stripping protections from many inland wetlands will worsen an already worrisome situation.

They say North Carolina has millions of acres of isolated and semi-dry wetlands that will see their protections watered down According to the Southern Environmental Law Center, that includes an estimated 527,000 acres of wetlands in the Cape Fear River watershed. But that number could increase even more if the EPA's narrow interpretation of what wetlands deserve protection becomes law.

From an environmental point of view, scientists say non-tidal wetlands are among Mother Nature's most valuable natural resources. They act like sponges, absorbing floodwaters and allowing the water to seep back into the ground, recharging groundwater supplies and eventually deep aquifers. Wetlands also provide vital habitat for a wide swathe of flora and fauna species.

Because they slow down water flows, wetlands also are very effective in removing contaminants. They also help store carbon in their soils, something that's seen as increasingly important as the world continues to pump more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change.

“Water moves in ways we can’t always see, and wetlands that look isolated can still be connected to other bodies of water,"" said Dr. Stacy Woods, a research director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, in a release. ""The revised definition will leave these wetlands at risk of further degradation, which could harm the rivers and streams that people in the United States depend on daily for clean water.""

Opponents of the pared-down definition of wetlands said there's also an economic component involved in the EPA's proposal.

McDow with Environmental Defense Fund said the U.S. already spends billions annually responding to disasters created by allowing development in risky areas. This new proposal could see that figure increase exponentially.

Weren't N.C.'s semi-dry and isolated wetlands previously protected?

While federal rules are the minimum requirements, states have the option of adopting additional protections and requirements, something California often does with its environmental regulations.

For years, North Carolina did this, taking a broad view on whether isolated and semi-dry wetlands deserved additional protections.

But the N.C. Farm Act of 2023 limits state protections of “wetlands” to essentially those enshrined in the federal Clean Water Act, and thus now mirrors the watered-down federal protections. Thus if the proposed EPA rule becomes law, it would strip protections from North Carolina wetlands that previously had to meet more stringent state regulations.

After a public comment period and some public hearings, the proposed EPA rule could become law early next year.

Nearly lost to memory is how the National Renewable Energy Laboratory authorized by President George H. W. Bush in 1991 was preceded by the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI), which opened in 1977 on the mesa east of Golden. It was Chris Wright, a Colorado oil-and-gas fracking mogul appointed as the Secretary of Energy by the Trump White House, who announced this most recent name change. Originally created in the wake of the Arab oil embargo of 1973, NREL’s research focus has been development of ever more efficient energy alternatives to fossil fuels. Nearly every president during the past 35 years has made at least one visit to this premiere sustainable energy research facility.

It’s apparent more than a name change is now in store for the laboratory. DOE’s announcement explains, “The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL. We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources.” It seems likely this means much of the lab’s current work enabling a sustainable energy future will be mothballed in favor of “clean coal” and petroleum technologies reflecting… the Trump administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research.” This policy trajectory from pioneering the search for an environmentally sound energy strategy to a “burn it while you have it” philosophy represents a Republican about-face over the past half-century, both nationally and here in Colorado. It was President Richard Nixon and congressional Republicans who created the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, proudly pointing out the joint origin of the terms conservative and conservation. It was Ronald Reagan who observed, “Preservation of our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge, it’s common sense.”

In 1979 both chambers of the Colorado legislature, which each enjoyed a two-thirds Republican majority, created the Colorado Energy Research Institute (CERI) located at the School of Mines in Golden. It was another legislative response to long lines statewide at gas pumps resulting from the Arab embargo and was initially focused on conservation measures, including social behavioral programs like carpooling. At the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency was focused primarily on pollution clean-ups following the 1969 fires on the surface of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio, and a decade later the Love Canal poisoning of domestic water supplies detected in 1980. At the same time, acid rain destruction of northeastern forests followed by the 1981 Montreal protocol to protect and restore the ozone holes over the poles enhanced the credibility of environmental regulation. This attention was abruptly reversed with the arrival of the Reagan administration and the appointment of another Coloradan, Anne Gorsuch (mother of Supreme Court Justice Neil), as the administrator of the EPA.

Gorsuch cut the agency’s budget by 20% and its staff by 25%. Rita Lavelle, her deputy, so mismanaged the superfund program she would later be sent to a federal prison. Resigning in 1983, Anne Gorsuch was replaced with the original EPA administrator appointed by Nixon in 1969, well-regarded former Republican Congressman Willam Ruckelshaus with a charge to restore environmental competency for the Reagan administration. Although there had been sporadic scientific indications since mid-century carbon dioxide build-up in the atmosphere was likely contributing to climate change and/or “global warming,” it wasn’t until the 1990s national attention turned to this economic and public health threat. Early in the decade, Colorado’s Republican legislators quietly shuttered CERI, although its remnants live on in comparable research efforts at CSU and the University of Colorado. The United Nations began to pay attention in the 1980s to climate issues, convening a periodic policy roundelay that has mostly sounded alarms with little concrete action.

As the public debate between environmental groups and the fossil fuel industry heated up, along with annual average temperatures, congressional Republicans began to migrate toward climate skepticism while Democrats placed renewable energy and sustainable policy as centerpieces of their political agenda. Nonetheless, it was George W. Bush’s administration when EPA identified carbon dioxide as a pollutant shortly after the turn of the 21st century. This designation was affirmed by the Supreme Court, although it is expected to be challenged again now that the Supreme Court has overturned its Chevron precedent. Stripping the EPA of the authority to regulate CO2 in our atmosphere would throw open the door to unlimited fossil-fuel emissions. With a president who labels climate change a hoax and a Democratic “con”, and his Department of Energy claiming, “Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs and help this country meet its energy demand. The National Laboratory of the Rockies will play a vital role in those efforts,” We can guess where national energy policy is headed.

I suspect a sizeable share of Republicans harbor doubts about this change in direction. At the same time, some Democrats have begun to question whether voters really care about climate change. That may be a misreading of polls where an overwhelming majority express their concern even if they don’t make it a priority. When 95% of climate scientists confirm climate change is real, our planet is warming, it seems there would be wisdom in taking the side of caution. Even if this prediction proves wrong, there seems to be both logic and prudence in pursuing sustainable energy technologies. NREL and its partners have already driven the cost of renewable energy generation substantially cheaper than fossil-fuel power.

Since 1973, the United States has become the world’s largest petro-carbon producer, so we no longer face the risk of fuel shortages from an embargo. Good for us, we’re now energy independent. My advice to the NLR staff is to save their NREL letterhead. It won’t be long before a new president restores their name and international reputation for excellence.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/e14624bd66e223ef3f050d5b1a37255d.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 06:00:39.925027

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has circulated detailed data on India’s installed solar manufacturing capacities to the Finance Ministry and key non-banking financial companies.

The move is aimed at improving the quality of loan assessments for new clean energy manufacturing proposals.

The information has been shared with the Department of Financial Services and major lenders, including PFC, REC, and IREDA. It covers the entire solar photovoltaic value chain, including modules, solar cells, ingots and wafers, and polysilicon. Details of supporting industries, such as solar glass and aluminium frames, have also been included.

Officials say the data will help financial institutions take an informed approach when reviewing loan applications. It is expected to encourage lenders to support manufacturing projects across upstream segments, rather than confining their exposure to module-making units.

The guidance will also make it easier to evaluate proposals for ancillary components essential to the sector’s growth.

The Ministry stressed that it has not instructed banks or NBFCs to halt lending to renewable energy developers or to equipment manufacturers. Instead, the exercise is meant to expand confidence in the sector and guide future financing decisions.

“It is hereby clarified that MNRE has not issued any advisory to Financial Institutions for stopping lending to either renewable energy power projects or to renewable energy equipment manufacturing facilities,” said the official statement.

The government has reiterated its goal of building a self-reliant and globally competitive solar manufacturing ecosystem. Several policy tools support this mission, including the Production Linked Incentive scheme for high-efficiency modules and measures designed to strengthen the position of domestic producers.

These interventions have delivered significant results. India’s solar module manufacturing capacity has grown from 2.3GW in 2014 to around 122GW now listed in MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers.

MNRE says it will continue to work with stakeholders to strengthen infrastructure, promote innovation and ensure India remains on track to achieve 500GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.

As of 31 October 2025, the installed capacity from non-fossil sources stands at about 259GW, with 31.2GW added in the current financial year up to October 2025.",https://www.electronicsforyou.biz/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solar-Panel-880x579.jpeg,N,,2025-12-08 08:00:59.986249

For more than a century, Big Oil lobbying has tyrannized American climate and tax policy, driving climate catastrophe while deepening economic inequality. Lavish tax breaks and subsidies for fossil fuel companies help explain why corporate giants like Chevron enjoy single-digit tax rates – lower than what many nurses or firefighters pay. After fossil fuel lobbyists flooded COP30 in unprecedented numbers, outnumbering nearly every other country’s delegation and stalling calls for a rapid fossil fuel phaseout, it’s more transparent than ever how the fossil fuel industry maintains its grip on global climate policy.

In the U.S., aggressive Big Oil lobbying has secured enormous government giveaways so extensive that the largest U.S. oil and gas companies now pay more in taxes to foreign governments than to the U.S. Treasury, finds a recent report by the FACT Coalition.

The report analyzed the financial disclosures of 11 U.S. oil and gas companies with extensive overseas operations and concluded that decades of heavy industry lobbying has engineered a U.S. tax code that pays for a dying fossil fuel industry, specifically for new oil and gas development abroad.

At the report’s launch in D.C. earlier this fall, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) explained how U.S.taxpayers are effectively forced to subsidize fossil fuel production through a tax code highly favorable to Big Oil. The report’s researchers explained that under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) regime, multinational companies that shift operations offshore already receive a 50 percent income tax deduction. But Big Oil lobbying has successfully created special exemptions allowing the largest fossil fuel companies to bypass all U.S. tax on foreign oil and gas extraction income.

As a result, despite producing more oil and gas domestically than in all other countries combined, American multinational oil and gas companies collectively pay more in taxes to foreign governments than to the U.S. While domestic operations account for more than 57 percent of total upstream production among the companies studied in the report, they generate less than a quarter of total taxes due.

ExxonMobil, for example, extracts 31 percent of its global oil and gas domestically, but owes only 10 percent of its total taxes in the U.S. Instead, ExxonMobil reported paying nearly five times as much tax to the U.A.E as to the U.S. in 2023 and 2024. Similarly, in 2023 Chevron paid a combined $6.25 billion to Nigeria, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea, compared to just under $2 billion paid to the U.S. government.

Before Trump’s 2017 tax law, corporate income earned abroad from refining, transporting, and selling oil was taxed immediately at the full U.S. rate. But Trump’s Big Oil tax breaks shifted this income into GILTI. Although the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tried to curtail government subsidies to fossil fuels, the 2025 “One Big Beautiful Bill” expanded 2017-level tax giveaways, including more direct incentives for foreign drilling. To secure the sweeping benefits contained in the 2025 tax law, the industry’s largest players spent nearly $20 million lobbying Congress in the six months preceding the bill’s passage.

The bill adds $30.8 billion per year in existing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, restores federal royalty rates to their pre-IRA levels of 12.5-16.7 percent, and introduces a new carveout allowing oil and gas companies to deduct intangible drilling costs (IDCs) – which represent 60-80 percent of total well expenses – from income subject to the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) (a 15% minimum tax on corporations earning more than $1 billion in book profits). The president of the American Petroleum Institute (API), said that Trump’s 2025 tax reform “includes almost all of our priorities.”

Allowing the wishes of Big Oil to take precedent over the wellbeing of people and the planet is dooming our shared ecosystem. Today, U.S. taxpayers not only subsidize the fossil-fuel industry by nearly $35 billion every year, they also shoulder more than $100 billion annually in climate-related costs. A Brookings study estimates that climate change now costs the average U.S. household $220 to $570 per year.

Meanwhile, the companies driving these damages continue to profit. Chevron and ExxonMobil rank among the world’s five highest-emitting corporations, and a 2025 Nature study estimates that each is responsible for nearly $2 trillion in climate damages. The report notes that federal handouts to U.S. fossil fuel companies operating overseas are especially damaging. They erode the U.S. tax base, accelerate the climate crisis, undermine American energy independence, and fail to generate well-paying domestic jobs.

Working-class people are paying for the continued life-support of an already dying industry that’s fueling the climate crisis. Erich Pica, President of Friends of the Earth, noted during the report launch that without federal subsidies, 60 percent of U.S. oil and gas production would be economically unviable. This sentiment has been well known by economic and political advisors across the political spectrum for decades. For instance, the report quotes Kevin Hassett, a current Trump top economic advisor, who said in a 2006 article that, “ending subsidies for fossil fuel production would level the playing field among energy sources and shift us from a policy of promoting fossil fuel supply to encouraging a reduction in fossil fuel consumption.” The entrenched government support incentivizing our current extractive economy starves the renewable energy sector of crucial federal investment necessary to curb polluting emissions. And eliminating these tax breaks would save U.S. taxpayers more than $75 billion over the next decade.

The FACT Coalition recommends several essential reforms to counter traditional pro-oil tax policies. Eliminating domestic fossil fuel tax preferences and subsidies that fund oil and gas production abroad, ensuring that multinational corporations cannot shift production overseas to scapegoat domestic tax rates, and strengthening corporate tax transparency policy to include how much companies pay in taxes country-by-country.

“Tax fairness is climate justice,” Whitehouse concluded his remarks at the report launch.

Corporate and political greed deepens multigenerational economic vulnerability by eroding safety nets like SNAP and Medicaid, while financially and politically killing the potential of a thriving renewable energy sector that could create stable, well-paying jobs to replace those declining under Big Oil. Our government continues to prop up oil and gas companies over people and the planet, and is fueling climate disaster at home and abroad. We must refuse to let our paychecks fund the industry that is destroying our homes, our lands, and our loved ones.

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-12-08 09:08:14+00:00,Canary Media,Duke Energy wants to spend on battery incentives to save on power plants - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/north-carolina-duke-utility-battery-incentives,"Duke Energy has already paid hundreds of North Carolinians to let it tap power from their home storage systems when electricity demand is highest.
The recognition signals a way forward for distributed renewable energy and storage as state and national politicians back away from the clean energy transition.
​“I’m hopeful that [regulators] see it the same way.” Duke’s trial residential battery incentives grew out of a compromise with rooftop solar installers.
That’s significantly more than the cost of providing and administering the incentives, which Duke places at nearly $11.8 million.
It recommends a cap tied to a customer’s peak demand; for example, a business that consumes more energy at once should get incentives for a bigger battery.","Since spring of last year, North Carolina’s largest utility has been testing whether household batteries can help the electric grid in times of need — and now the company wants to roll out the plan to businesses, local governments, and nonprofits, too.

Duke Energy has already paid hundreds of North Carolinians to let it tap power from their home storage systems when electricity demand is highest. It’s Duke’s first foray into running a ​“virtual power plant,” in which the company manages electricity produced and stored by consumers, much as it would control generation from its own facilities.

In September, the utility proposed a similar model for its nonresidential customers, asserting that the scheme will save money by shrinking the need for new power plants and expensive upgrades to the grid. The recognition signals a way forward for distributed renewable energy and storage as state and national politicians back away from the clean energy transition.

The initiative now needs approval from the five-member North Carolina Utilities Commission, where the virtual-power-plant model has faced some skepticism. But the apparent merits of Duke’s plan, which has broad backing, may be too enticing for commissioners to ignore — especially when the state is grappling with rising rates and voracious demand from data centers and other heavy electricity users.

“In an era of massive load growth, something that should lower costs to customers while helping meet peak demand — to me, it’s an absolute no-brainer,” said Ethan Blumenthal, regulatory counsel for the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an advocacy group. ​“I’m hopeful that [regulators] see it the same way.”

Duke’s trial residential battery incentives grew out of a compromise with rooftop solar installers. Like many investor-owned utilities around the country, the company sought to lower bill credits for the electrons that solar owners add to the grid. When the solar industry and clean energy advocates fought back, the scheme dubbed PowerPair was born.

The test program provides rebates of up to $9,000 for a battery paired with rooftop photovoltaic panels. It’s capped at roughly 6,000 participants, or however many it takes to reach a limit of 60 megawatts of solar. Half of the households agree to let Duke access their batteries up to 18 times each year, earning an extra $37 per month on average; the other half enroll in electric rates that discourage use when demand peaks.

The incentives have been crucial for rooftop solar installers, who’ve faced a torrent of policy and macroeconomic headwinds this year, and they’ve proved vital for customers who couldn’t otherwise afford the up-front costs of installing cheap, clean energy.

But the PowerPair enrollees already make up 30 megawatts in one of Duke’s two North Carolina utility territories and could hit their limit in the central part of the state early next year, leaving both consumers and the rooftop solar industry anxious about what’s next.

Duke’s latest proposal for nonresidential customers — which, unlike the PowerPair test, would be permanent — is one answer.

Battery incentives for businesses: ​“A long time coming”

The proposed program is similar to PowerPair in that it’s born of compromise: Last summer, the state-sanctioned customer advocate, clean energy companies, and others agreed to drop their objections to Duke’s carbon-reduction plan under several conditions, including that the utility develop incentives for battery storage for commercial and industrial customers. The Utilities Commission later blessed the deal.

“This was pursuant to the settlement in last year’s carbon plan,” said Blumenthal, ​“so it’s been a long time coming.”

While many industry and nonprofit insiders refer to the scheme as ​“Commercial PowerPair,” its official title is the Non-Residential Storage Demand Response Program.

That name reflects the incentives’ focus on storage, with solar as only a minor factor: Duke wants to offer businesses, local governments, and nonprofits $120 per kilowatt of battery capacity installed on its own and just $30 more if it’s paired with photovoltaics.

The maximum up-front inducement of $150 per storage kilowatt is much less than the $360 per kilowatt offered under PowerPair. But more significant for nonresidential customers could be monthly bill credits: about $250 for a 100-kilowatt battery that could be tapped 36 times a year, plus extra if the battery is actually discharged.

Unlike households participating in PowerPair, which must install solar and storage at the same time to get rebates, nonresidential customers can also get the incentives for adding a battery to pair with existing solar arrays.

“That could be very important for municipalities around North Carolina that have already installed a very significant amount of solar, but very little of that is paired with battery storage,” said Blumenthal.

Duke has high hopes for the program, projecting that five years in, over 26,000 participants will enroll statewide. The company says that level of engagement would help it avoid building nearly 28 megawatts of new power plants to meet peak demand, saving over $13.6 million. That’s significantly more than the cost of providing and administering the incentives, which Duke places at nearly $11.8 million.

“The Program provides a source of cost-effective capacity that the Company’s system operators can use at their discretion in situations to deliver economic benefits for all customers,” Duke said in its September filing to regulators. ​“Importantly, the Company received positive feedback from its customers … when sharing the details of the Program.”

Indeed, the proposal has been met with support not just from the Sustainable Energy Association and other clean energy groups but also organizations like the North Carolina Justice Center, which advocates for low-income households. It earned praise from local governments represented by the Southeast Sustainability Directors Network and conditional support from the state-sanctioned customer advocate, known as Public Staff, too.

Tipping the scales for more and bigger batteries

The good vibes continued last week, when Duke responded positively to detailed suggestions from these parties on how to improve the program. That included a request from Public Staff that the company raise the per-customer limit on battery capacity to align with the maximum amount of solar that a business or other nonresidential consumer can connect to the grid, which is currently 5 megawatts.

“Larger batteries sited at larger customer sites can help provide more significant system benefits and can reduce the need for incremental utility-owned energy storage installed at all ratepayers’ expense,” the agency told regulators in its November comments. It recommends a cap tied to a customer’s peak demand; for example, a business that consumes more energy at once should get incentives for a bigger battery. Duke agreed in its Dec. 5 comments, calling that limit ​“reasonable.”

Still, questions remain about how to make the incentives most impactful.

Public Staff, for instance, believes Duke should increase its monthly payment to customers for keeping their batteries charged and ready to deploy. This ​“capacity credit” is now set at $3.50 per kilowatt but effectively reduced to $2.48, because the utility assumes that a percentage of users won’t properly maintain their systems, based on its experience with households. The company calls that a ​“capability factor,” but the agency dubs it ​“collective punishment” for all customers and says it should be eliminated or recalibrated for ​“more sophisticated” nonresidential participants.

Raleigh, North Carolina–based 8MSolar, a member of the Sustainable Energy Association, is among the many installers that have been eagerly anticipating Duke’s proposal.

The program on its own likely won’t ​“move the needle unless the incentives get bumped up,” said Bryce Bruncati, the company’s director of sales. However, the scheme could tip the scales for large customers when stacked on top of two federal tax opportunities: a 30% incentive available through the end of 2027 and a deduction tied to the depreciation value of the system — up to 100% thanks to the Republican budget law passed this summer.

“The combined three could really have a big impact for small- to medium-sized commercial projects,” Bruncati said. The Duke program would represent ​“a little bit of icing on the cake.”

Whatever their size and design, the fate of the incentives rests entirely with the Utilities Commission, now that the final round of comments from Duke and other stakeholders is in. There’s no timeline for a decision.

At least one commissioner, Tommy Tucker, has voiced skepticism about leveraging customer-owned equipment to serve the grid at large. ​“I’m not a big fan of the [demand-side management] or virtual power plants because you’re dependent upon somebody else,” the former Republican state senator said at a recent hearing, albeit one not connected to the Duke program.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Duke-Energy-Power-Lines.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=de0aca3f7267ce8e449e408628d4d27e,N,,2025-12-08 06:00:48.895447

BP's decision to pull out of building a hydrogen plant has been described as ""discouraging"" by scientists working on decarbonisation.

Last week, the energy giant backed out of its plans at Teesworks in Redcar following a row with landowners over whether the site would be better suited to housing a data centre.

Prof Simone Abraham, Durham Energy Institute executive director, said the decision raised ""a lot of questions about the commitment to hydrogen development among industry and government"".

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said the government had backed the industry with £500m. BP has been approached for comment.

Prof Abraham said the move was ""discouraging"" but that she still believed hydrogen would play an important role in future energy systems.

BP backed out of the HSTeesside project ahead of a government decision on the plans, citing a ""material change in circumstances"" to the land it had been due to be built on.

At the time, a spokesperson said: ""We continue to move forward with other projects on Teesside, including our investments in Net Zero Teesside Power and the Northern Endurance Partnership, and remain an active partner in the region.""

Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said he would continue to work with the BP on that project, which aims to be ""the world's first gas-fired power station with carbon capture and storage"".

'Economic case collapses'

Decarbonisation expert Prof Dawid Hanak, from Teesside University, said BP's decision to pull out of the scheme would make it ""challenging"" to meet the country's goal of producing up to 10GW of low carbon hydrogen by 2030.

Prof Maria Sharmina at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research pointed to the fact that BP had also suggested one reason it pulled out of the scheme was because the companies which it planned to sell its hydrogen to had ""postponed decarbonisation plans"".

She said: ""You can build all the supply infrastructure you like, but if the industrial users who were meant to switch to hydrogen are pulling back, then the economic case collapses.""

A DESNZ spokesperson said the hydrogen industry would ""play a key role"" in delivering its Industrial Strategy and its ""mission to become a clean energy superpower"".

""That's why this government backed the industry with £500m in the summer spending review,"" they said.

""Our ambitious Hydrogen Strategy will set out our vision and clear intentions for the UK's industry, driving clean energy investment and unlocking thousands of skilled jobs up and down the country.""

The reports had surfaced following an office memorandum dated November 28 from MNRE that called for Prudence in Lending for Solar PV Modules. The memorandum had flagged representations made by the All India Solar Industries Association (AISIA), an association of solar manufacturers that claimed a looming overcapacity issue for the sector, especially the module sector. The MNRE, in its memorandum, acknowledged the AISIA representation with key points, and urged relevant stakeholders in the Ministry of Finance and others to exercise due diligence accordingly when evaluating solar module financing. Not a proposal to freeze lending by any stretch.

The AISIA has also made a representation to the Indian Banking Association (IBA) with the same issues. The AISIA focus also seems to have been limited to solar modules, and no cells, wafers or the rest of the constituents of the solar cycle, including projects etc. The AISIA site lists 18 members in the body, with Waaree Energies, Vikram Solar, Emmvee and Goldi Solar among the notable majors, even as it has notable misses like Adani Solar, Solex Energy, Premier Energies etc.

No pause on green energy financing

MNRE stated that it has not advised any bank or financial institution to suspend or restrict lending to renewable energy power projects or solar equipment manufacturing facilities.

It stressed that continued policy support and financing will be essential to maintain the country’s growth momentum and to ensure that India emerges as a major, resilient player across the solar PV manufacturing value chain.

Focus on calibrated, informed lending

According to the Ministry, it has shared detailed data with the Department of Financial Services and key non-banking financial institutions, such as PFC, REC, and IREDA, on existing domestic solar PV manufacturing capacities.

This includes information on modules, upstream stages like cells, ingots-wafers and polysilicon, and ancillary components such as solar glass and aluminium frames.

The objective is to enable lenders to adopt a calibrated and well-informed approach while appraising proposals, and to encourage them to diversify financing beyond just module manufacturing to more upstream and ancillary segments of the solar value chain.

Strengthening India’s solar manufacturing ecosystem

MNRE underscored that its policy thrust remains firmly on building India’s self-reliance in solar PV manufacturing and strengthening the country’s role in the global solar value chain.

This is being pursued through a comprehensive set of measures, including the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for high-efficiency solar PV modules and steps to ensure a level playing field for Indian manufacturers. Notably, India’s domestic solar module capacity has expanded from about 2.3 GW in 2014 to roughly 122 GW currently listed in the Ministry’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM).

The Ministry reiterated its commitment to inclusive, competitive and sustainable growth of the solar ecosystem as part of India’s broader goal of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.

As of 31 October 2025, installed capacity from non-fossil sources has reached around 259 GW, with 31.2 GW added in the current financial year up to October 2025.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/saur-energy/media/media_files/2025/12/08/mnre-denies-advisory-for-clean-energy-financing-freeze-2025-12-08-13-04-15.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 06:00:14.222084

The combined entity will focus on producing green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at scale, using wood-waste biomass sourced from Louisiana. The merger brings together DevvStream’s carbon management expertise and Southern’s low-cost biomass-to-fuel platform, reports Antara News.

The new company aims to support airlines and shipping operators as they face stricter environmental rules worldwide. Its operations will be built around two divisions — one dealing with climate-related solutions and another focused on clean fuels — starting with Southern’s planned biomass-to-fuel project in Louisiana. Management expects that combining both companies’ strengths will help lower production costs and make alternative fuels more competitive. Carl Stanton, who will lead the merged company as CEO, said the merger is intended to position the new entity as a stronger industrial-scale fuels and credits business. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

Stanton said the aviation and shipping sectors “are under pressure to cut emissions, and they want practical solutions that they can afford.” He added that renewable fuels “are still far costlier than conventional fuels,” and the merger is meant to “bring down those costs and help companies meet the new rules without slowing their operations.”

Southern Energy Renewables CEO Jay Patel said Louisiana continues to be a key partner for the project. “The state’s access to feedstock, infrastructure and a skilled workforce gives us a strong foundation for long-term growth,” he said, adding that the company expects the partnership with the state to deepen as work progresses.

Nevin Smalls, Chief Strategy Officer at Southern, said the project has been designed to produce clean fuels “on a large scale and at lower cost than many global competitors.” He noted that their production route — converting biomass waste into methanol and then into SAF — uses established technologies and integrated carbon capture, enabling “one of the lowest emissions footprints in the market.”

Stanton also confirmed that Southern has made an initial investment of about $2 million in DevvStream through the purchase of 128,370 shares. He said the investment “shows confidence in DevvStream’s core work and its importance in reducing costs for customers,” while giving DevvStream shareholders meaningful ownership in a larger and more diverse clean-fuel platform.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tonnes of low-carbon ammonia per year. The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products' customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products' 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system. About five million tonnes per year of high purity CO2 captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Project: The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia is more than 90 percent complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tonnes per year of renewable ammonia.

Air Products and Yara anticipate entering into a marketing and distribution agreement where Yara would commercialize, on a commission basis, the ammonia not sold by Air Products as renewable hydrogen in Europe. The model maximizes value for both companies and enables ammonia from the world's first large-scale renewable ammonia plant to be delivered worldwide by Yara's unparalleled shipping fleet. The marketing and distribution agreement is targeted to be completed during the first half of 2026.

Leveraging complementary strengths to drive value creation in low-emission ammonia

Yara is the world's largest trader and shipper of ammonia, currently transporting over four million metric tonnes annually, which is supported by Yara's 12 ammonia vessels and 18 import terminals. In addition, Yara has a significant internal ammonia demand. Air Products is the world's largest supplier of hydrogen and brings leading low-emission hydrogen and ammonia production at scale. The collaboration would enable the companies to meet the increasing demand for low-emission ammonia in the coming years, particularly in Europe both for Yara's internal consumption and other customers.

""We are pleased to be working with Yara, the world's leading fertilizer company, as we advance the global low-emission ammonia market and maximize value from our projects in Louisiana and Saudi Arabia,"" said Air Products' Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Menezes.

""Air Products' two advanced projects are a strong strategic fit with Yara's flexible nitrogen system – enabling energy diversification and profitable decarbonization while aligning with our disciplined capital allocation policy. The Louisiana project builds on a proven, capital-efficient model; producing ammonia from externally sourced hydrogen and delivering strong returns,"" said Yara's CEO Svein Tore Holsether.

Climate lawfare is a Big Business. State, county and city lawyers have filed some 30 lawsuits, alleging that oil companies misrepresented the impacts of their products and caused billions of dollars in climate and weather damages.

After being approached by EarthRights International, Boulder and Boulder County, Colorado joined San Miguel County in April 2018 to sue Suncor Energy and ExxonMobil.

Leaving out the hurricanes and rising seas emphasized by coastal litigants, plaintiffs’ 105-page complaint alleges that the oil companies have severely harmed their property, health and safety, by causing higher temperatures, more droughts and wildfires, and dwindling snowpack that adversely affects water supplies and the farming and skiing industries.

They want a trial by local jurors and seek billions of dollars to compensate their jurisdictions for past and future damages and costs, evaluate and mitigate climate change impacts, abate and remediate its hazards, and compensate them for decreased agricultural and urban property values.

Defendants argue that the case raises major, complicated national and even international issues and therefore belongs in federal, not state courts. But after years of legal wrangling, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in May 2025 that the lawsuit could indeed proceed in state court.

So now Suncor and ExxonMobil have petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the case. Plaintiffs strongly oppose this. But there are compelling reasons why the Supremes should move it to federal venues, after declining earlier lawsuits that they said did not present a ripe or perfect case for review.

Fifty-plus years ago, I lived in Boulder, Denver and often went downhill and cross-country skiing. We had variable snow seasons: early and long, late and short, great snowpack or rocks. Back then the mantra was global cooling and a new ice age, but it later shifted to “global warming” when average global temperatures rose slightly, and finally to the all-encompassing “climate change” narrative.

I saw the aftermath of Colorado’s worst natural disaster ever, the 1976 Big Thompson flood. I witnessed other monster rainfalls, droughts and dust storms, and multiple wildfires. Decades-long Anasazi droughts underscore Nature’s destructive forces centuries ago.

Plaintiffs cannot possibly make a convincing historical or scientific case that today’s climate and weather are unusual or unprecedented. Nor can they separate natural forces and effects from fossil fuel or other manmade influences.

Team Boulder claims its case involves only local damages, issues, legal claims and remedies. However, ExxonMobil and Suncor production and refining activities, sales, emissions and alleged climate impacts are hardly confined to two counties or even the State of Colorado. The lawsuit’s effects would ripple like tsunamis across the USA and world.

Indeed, current and former county attorneys and officials have said the primary goals of this litigation include imposing “an indirect carbon tax” on defendants’ products; “raising the price” of those products so that they become too expensive for most families; curtailing fossil fuel use; and effecting “systems-level change” to America’s energy, economic and social systems.

The products include transportation fuels for Colorado and US cars, trucks, tractors and aircraft; natural gas to generate electricity for lights, computers, medical equipment, and lifesaving heating and air conditioning; and petrochemical feedstocks for over 6,000 essential products, including paints, plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fertilizers, and skis, ski boots and clothing of all descriptions.

Climate activists have been unable to enact national legislation to curb or eliminate the use of coal, oil or natural gas – or persuade Congress to ratify international treaties that compel all countries to slash their fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. Climate lawfare, via local and state courts, has thus become a central tactic for imposing their radical agenda, controlling our lives and reducing our living standards.

They know COP30 was an abject failure and overtures to “climate cataclysms” are falling on deaf ears.

They want to avoid federal courts and lawyers that might closely examine their far-fetched claims from national, international, scientific and economic perspectives. They know a US Supreme Court ruling in defendants’ favor would likely end any option for them to circumvent federal legislative and judicial processes.

Climateers also know that US states that enforce wind and solar power mandates have electricity prices at least two times higher than those that have not. Worse, residential prices in climate-obsessed Britain, Germany and other European countries are 2-3 times higher than the US average: 30 to 40+ cents per kilowatt-hour in Europe versus 15 cents in the USA.

They know (but vigorously deny) that German, British and other European electricity prices have caused their industries to lose millions of jobs and left families unable to heat their homes properly, leading to thousands of needless deaths every winter. Iberia’s peninsula-wide blackout in April 2025 proved reliance on wind and solar power can be disastrous, even deadly.

It’s hardly surprising that no other city or county has joined the lawsuit. That Colorado’s governor and former governor have refused to support it. Or that Colorado’s own attorney general joined 14 other state AGs in signing an amicus curiae brief opposing a very similar suit by California cities.

The AGs argued that cities should not be able to use the common nuisance law to “harness the power and prestige of federal courts to remedy global climate change.” They also noted that: “questions of global climate change and its effects … are political questions not suited for resolution by any court.” Indeed, such judicial interference would trample on “Congress’s carefully calibrated process of cooperative federalism where states work in tandem with EPA to administer the federal Clean Air Act.”

These issues are for Congress and the Executive Branch to debate, balance competing needs and interests, and decide at the national level. In dismissing New York City’s similar climate lawsuit, Federal Judge John Keenan made the same points.

Perhaps most importantly, over the past few years, the US Supreme Court has significantly curtailed the powers of federal agencies. In West Virginia v. EPA (2022), it held that, in the absence of clear legislative authority, government agencies cannot unilaterally issue regulations that have “major” economic or political significance.

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2023) reversed the “Chevron deference” rule. Silent or ambiguous statutory texts no longer give administrative agencies unfettered power to interpret laws in ways that let them increase control over people’s lives and livelihoods.

Cities, counties and states certainly should not have greater power than federal agencies – or be able to employ common law rulings – to control America’s fossil fuel production, use and products, in a futile attempt to control Earth’s perpetually changing climate. Especially when the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emissions now come from China, India, Russia and other countries.

The climate litigation charade must end.

Let’s hope the Supreme Court agrees that Boulder’s lawsuit is an excellent opportunity to terminate frivolous climate lawfare, expand on the guidance it provided in these two previous cases – and end attempts by climate activists to impose destructive national policies through local and state courts.",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-121.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 02:58:31.091822

On Sunday, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said that it had asked the finance ministry to advise lenders to adopt a ""calibrated and well-informed approach"" when evaluating proposals for additional standalone solar photovoltaic module capacity, citing oversupply risks. It added that the advisory was not intended to stop funding for the entire clean energy sector.

""Restricting financing now will disrupt under-construction projects and deepen reliance on imported cells,"" he said.

Several Indian firms ramped up module production in recent years, betting on exports to the U.S. But higher American tariffs and tighter scrutiny of Indian shipments for Chinese-origin components have hit exports, raising fears of a glut at home.

Batteries are the backbone of America’s technological ambitions. Electric vehicles, drones, aircraft, defense systems, grid storage, consumer electronics—the entire future runs on electrons stuffed into metal boxes. They are so crucial that they may ultimately determine whether the U.S. remains a global technology leader or cedes that advantage to China, which is racing ahead in electrification.

2025 was a massive year on the battery front, packed full of promising breakthroughs and disappointing setbacks. Below, we've compiled some of the biggest battery developments of the year. But first, let's explore how we got to this moment.

Batteries in 2025: A Recap

The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was a shot of adrenaline for battery projects. It injected hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies into the space, helping sprout sprawling factories (or at least plans for them) nationwide. We all know what happened next.

After President Trump returned to the White House in January, there was immediate whiplash on the policy front. Several battery plants either paused or shut down, jobs evaporated and automakers scrambled to redirect investment into stationary storage systems to soften the blow from the EV slowdown.

Still, 2025 proved that the the ship had already sailed. Projects announced in the Biden era that had come far along marched toward completion. EV prototypes with solid-state batteries hit the road as automakers continued to make bolder promises about the “holy grail” tech.

Meanwhile, today’s lithium-ion batteries continued to improve. Automakers released new or refreshed EVs with more efficient batteries delivering longer range at more competitive prices. We also saw lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) technology return to America, along with novel approaches such as the lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) battery chemistry to address affordability concerns.

The torrent of battery news in 2025 felt like five years compressed into one. And because this industry impacts everything from how we drive to how we power our homes and how we deal with natural disasters, the InsideEVs team covered it all obsessively, with scoops, technical deep dives, factory visits and interviews with industry leaders.

10 EV Battery Stories That Defined 2025

As the year winds down, here are the top battery stories this year from our editors, staff writers and contributors. If you couldn’t keep up with the battery news cycle this year, we don’t blame you. These 10 stories paint a solid picture of what happened in the battery world in 2025—and where it's going next.

How Ford And GM Are Plotting A Battery Breakup With China

General Motors and Ford are working on a breakthrough battery chemistry called lithium-manganese-rich (LMR), which aims to deliver driving range closer to current nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) packs at costs comparable to cheaper lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. I visited General Motors’ top-secret battery facilities in Warren, Michigan, this Spring to learn how these LMR batteries are made and what their implications are for the EV industry. I also spoke to engineers at Ford who described LMR tech as “LFP of the West” and the answer to “what’s next?”

Mercedes’ Solid-State Battery Prototype Comes Out Of The Lab, Onto The Road

This year, Western automakers inched closer to bringing their solid-state dreams to reality. These batteries promise longer range, faster charging times and improved thermal safety. A Mercedes-Benz EQS equipped with U.S.-based start-up Factorial’s semi-solid-state battery began road tests in Europe this year. BMW seems to have gone a step further, installing an all-solid-state (ASSB) pack from another U.S.-based start-up, Solid Power, in a prototype i7. While their roadworthiness is now being tested, expect more such announcements in the coming months as the technology continues to mature.

Ford’s Affordable EV Comeback Starts Here. But Not Without Controversy

LFP batteries are central to making EVs more affordable, as they’re cheaper to produce and don’t use expensive nickel or cobalt. But most LFP batteries today are made in China. Ford is working hard to change that. The company is building its $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, where it will make LFP batteries for its future EVs, licensing CATL’s tech. Patrick George visited the plant in June and reported that reaching this stage for Ford wasn’t without difficulties or controversy.

GM Is Bringing LFP Battery Production To America

GM had a huge year in the battery department. Not only did it surpass Tesla to become America’s largest battery cell manufacturer, but it’s also planning to bring LFP battery production stateside. The automakers’ two main battery suppliers, LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, will retrofit part of their U.S. plants, originally designed for NMC batteries, to assemble LFP packs. Both the Chevy Bolt EV and the Silverado EV have been confirmed to get LFP packs, but local production won’t begin until the end of 2027. Until then, GM will reportedly import LFP batteries from China’s CATL.

BMW Gen6 Batteries May Foreshadow Class-Leading EV

Lithium-ion batteries are advancing so rapidly that one wonders, do we even need chemistries such as solid-state? BMW’s Gen6 batteries will offer up to 620 miles of range (depending on the vehicle type) and 30% faster charging. This pattern of improved batteries was common across the industry this year. Toyota’s 2026 EVs feature batteries that are better than ever. From 2027 onwards, Hyundai’s batteries will be 30% cheaper and 15% more energy dense. And Tesla is working with Panasonic to develop anode-free cells that could boost the Model Y’s range by 90 miles.

We Built Too Many EV Battery Factories. Here’s What Happens Next

Battery plants worth billions were canceled this year as the Trump administration rolled back clean energy programs and tax credits. Still, North America and the rest of the world are staring down a battery manufacturing glut. China's battery production capacity outpaces demand by five times. Europe makes double the number of batteries than its car buyers need. And North America’s capacity-to-demand ratio is 1.9. Mack Hogan explained in his story how battery companies reached this stage and what the future might look like.

The Facts Are In: You Shouldn’t Worry About EV Battery Replacements

Battery replacements may have been common on the first-generation Nissan Leaf or some model years of the Chevy Bolt which had defective packs. But it’s very rare for modern batteries to randomly fail. Experts say there’s really nothing to worry about these days. Tim Levin outlined in his story that the latest EVs have battery replacement rates of just 0.3% and are basically worry-free for at least 15 years on average.

‘Vital To Our Future’: How Lithium-Ion Batteries Are Saving The Grid

Commercial electricity was invented more than a century ago. Yet the process of managing and distribution remains fragile, as heat waves and natural disasters keep knocking the grid off. States and utilities have been using battery energy storage systems as backup for years, but this year more automakers joined the fray to offset lower EV battery demand with batteries for energy storage. BESS allows companies to store and deploy renewable energy more efficiently, so that our lights remain on when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow.

CATL’s Sodium-Ion EV Battery Loves The Cold

The same core element that makes your lunch taste better, i.e., salt, is now also powering EVs in China. Research suggests that sodium is 1,000 times more abundant than lithium, but batteries made out of it don’t enjoy the same supply chain advantages and scalability as lithium-ion packs. But seeing potential in the technology for certain applications, CATL created its Naxtra sodium-ion subbrand in Spring. The company has started making high- and low-voltage sodium-ion battery packs in China, which can even operate at temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit.

AI companies are growing at a rapid pace — and continued growth depends on increasing energy supply.

Data centers are sprouting up all over the country, sometimes facing community backlash thanks to their water usage and the strain they threaten to put on the energy grid.

A report from an energy think tank makes the case for a broader perspective on how to meet data center energy needs.

Hundreds of billions of dollars are pouring into artificial intelligence, driving the U.S. economy. The profits that technology leadership investors seek depend on meeting the electricity needs of data centers, warehouse-sized facilities filled with servers that power the digital world, including AI.

By the end of 2025, U.S. data centers are projected to need 22 percent more grid power than they did the year before and almost three times more soon after. S&P Global puts the 2030 need at over 134 GW (gigawatts). One GW is enough to meet the average annual energy needs of about 700,000 homes.

Eric Gimon, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, hopes to provide legislators and state officials working to attract data centers with a more nuanced picture of what they can do to fill gaps between energy demand and supply.

“It’s the normal human thing when we’re dealing with complexity to cling to the simplest ideas,” he says. “People have devolved to the thinking that the way to deal with a big new load is a big new generator.”

Through a new report, Gimon hopes to move beyond what he calls “firm fixation.” He makes the case that overemphasis on “firm” power — electricity from sources that are always “on,” such as nuclear reactors or gas-fired power plants — leads to missed opportunities.

It can cause utilities and developers to overlook solutions like energy efficiency, or batteries connected to solar and wind generators, that cost less, can be implemented more quickly and reduce risk from overinvestment in local fixed capacity vulnerable to shifts in demand, he argues.

Negotiating Power

It’s well known that data centers can have serious environmental impacts and require massive amounts of water to cool the servers. Communities have increasingly pushed back on their construction, with complaints about noise and the possibility of increased energy costs. States and localities have the best chance of making deals to address these issues when a data center is first built, Gimon says — when it’s getting permits, authorization to connect to the grid, and when the utility is deciding how much to charge.

This is the time to ensure data center developers make fair commitments to help cover the infrastructure costs that come with their energy needs, and to push them toward solutions that make the most of existing resources and support the energy grid, Gimon argues. These could include energy efficiency requirements, using data center waste heat to generate electricity or flexibility regarding peak use times.

Gimon also points to a report from Rewiring America arguing that household energy efficiency and rooftop solar could potentially free up enough existing grid energy to meet the needs of the biggest data centers. Governments may be able to secure agreements from companies to fund efficiency projects for the rest of the grid to help meet their needs.

They may be better able to get these kinds of commitments from large technology companies like Amazon Web Services or OpenAI, which are building huge data centers to deliver their services. These companies may have a vested interest in gaining community buy-in and have a greater ability to make long-term energy use projections, Gimon argues.

It may be harder to secure these kinds of promises from “co-location” facilities — large warehouses owned by developers and rented out to multiple separate entities. These developers may be hesitant to make any deals that might affect their ability to draw tenants or the long-term value of their properties, Gimon says.

Drawing From Existing Resources

It’s common for conversations about data centers and energy use to focus on giant power sources like gas-fired plants or nuclear energy facilities. And certainly they will have to make use of those existing energy sources.

But Gimon argues that states and localities shouldn’t be afraid of a varied approach to meeting energy demands, leaning more heavily on renewables like wind and solar. The usual criticism of these sources is that they don’t provide a constant enough supply to power giant data centers.

That's not the whole picture, Gimon says. Energy demand from AI data centers may be enormous, but they don’t operate at peak demand at all times. “Depending on what they are doing, they could be running their chips 70 percent of the time, 50 percent of the time or 40 percent of the time,” says Gimon. “They also turn off and on a lot.”

They also tend to be built in phases. “That’s part of what makes it difficult to serve them with one big power plant,” says Gimon. “You can be undersized or oversized depending on where you are in phase in or phase out.”

Using batteries can assuage concerns about the intermittent nature of renewables. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, wind and solar account for more than two-thirds of utility-scale electric-generating capacity additions planned for 2025.

If governments can secure agreements with data centers to avoid peak energy use during periods of high demand for other grid users (like the afternoon of a summer day, for example), it can create more flexibility in choosing energy sources that can meet need.

“By exploring the nuanced solutions, policymakers can avoid overcommitting to outdated firm resources and instead adopt strategies that embrace modularity, flexibility, and clean energy,” Gimon writes. This can require a deeper dive in the complexity of energy systems by those in government who have responsibility for regulation or legislation.

The Tip of the Spear

Over the last 20 years, energy use decreased from 60 percent of what was available to users to 40 percent, Gimon says. The emergence of an energy-intensive industry, and cross-sector conviction that the nation’s fate depends on growing it as fast as possible, is a head-spinning reversal of this trend.

Data centers are just the tip of the spear, Gimon says. The dawning era of building electrification and the growth of electric vehicles, including heavy duty trucks, mean load growth will continue even if the data center craze crashes and burns.

“We’re in a new era of demand growth that we haven’t seen in a long time in the U.S.,” Gimon says. “It’s going to require an all-of-government approach to manage that, to manage new facilities, manage new generation and find ways to do a better job of using the infrastructure that we have.”

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF.

“Today I would like to share two major bits of progress first: I will start with the fact that I am proud to announce that the FX Super One First Pre-Production Vehicles Roll-off Ceremony is scheduled for December 21 at our manufacturing facility in Hanford, CA! We have reached a critical state of readiness: the full set of components for the first several pre-production vehicles have arrived on site. With nearly 3,000 parts per vehicle now in hand, we will formally launch production tomorrow.

This milestone carries significance in six areas:

1. It marks the near completion of the Bridge Closure for our Bridge strategy, covering a closed loop of supply chain, testing, logistics, customs clearance and production. This further validates the feasibility and strategic value of the Bridge model, across tariff adaptation, ICTS compliance, cost management, operational efficiency, and so on.

2. It marks that the Hanford factory has entered the FX pre-production phase. Our production, industrialization, supply chain, and Bridge systems are now forming a closed-loop synergy.

3. It could provide a replicable, fast-track mass production framework for the scalable deployment of future FX models.

4. It represents a new breakthrough in the Company’s business and supports improvements in our capital position and capital market expectations.

5. It could empower the global expansion of China's automotive supply chain and unlock its value within the U.S.— the world's highest-value market.

6. It could fill a structural gap, tap the blue-ocean segment in the U.S., and generate incremental value in the U.S. market, including job creation and contributions to manufacturing reshoring.

The second bit of progress is that the Board has conditionally approved FF and FX’s five-year volume production plan, including the target of 400,000-500,000 cumulative production and sales, contingent upon securing the necessary financing, as well as more support and agreements with strategic partners.

Fresh-cut or fake trees? What experts say is more sustainable might surprise you

At Sullivan Hardware and Garden, Christmas tree sales are already brisk.

“We have a large seasonal business which includes fresh-cut Christmas trees and artificial trees,” said Pat Sullivan, President of the hardware and garden store.

Millions of families buy a tree each year, but the environmental impact varies widely depending on whether they choose real or fake.

“When looking at options, it sometimes seems like the more sustainable option is to get a fake tree that you can use for multiple years, but the real tree is actually the way to go,” said Lizzie Hortviz, a sustainability expert and founder of Finch, a platform that educates consumers on sustainability.

Horvitz tells WRTV the carbon footprint of artificial trees is far heavier than most people realize.

“Real Christmas trees typically carry an average carbon footprint of 3.5 kg of CO2, if disposed of through burning or wood chipping,” she said. “A two m artificial Christmas tree has a carbon footprint of around 40 kg, more than 10 times that of a real tree… then, unfortunately, at the end of life, the only thing we can do is landfill them.”

At Sullivan, both types of trees are popular, but this year, the store says fresh trees are stocked up again on their store shelves.

“There's been a shortage of trees and fresh-cut for the last five years, and it's kind of coming to an end,” Sullivan said. “We're paying big dollars just to try to get trees, so the prices of fresh cut around town should either be stable or drop.”

The National Christmas Tree Association and the American Christmas Tree Association estimate the average fresh tree cost in 2024 was between $80 and $100. Artificial trees ranged from $85 to more than $1,000.

Beyond price, Horvitz says real trees offer environmental benefits long before they end up in someone’s home.

“Christmas trees are also doing all that good tree stuff. They're absorbing carbon, they're providing wildlife habitat, etc.,” she said.

""The most important thing is that we support these Christmas tree farms, because for every tree purchased, farmers plant one to three seedlings in its place. So, this guarantees the future of green space and farmland,” she added.

For those who prefer artificial trees, Horvitz says the key to sustainability is longevity.

“If you have a fake tree and if you're really set on getting one, you should have it for a minimum of 10 years to get the best payoff,” she said.

Experts even recommend using an artificial tree during the off-season to maximize its value. And when it’s time to toss a real tree, local pickup sites and drop-off options are widely available, often with help from farms or stores.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2d6c885/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F11%2F1f7df6664b078aa8f360a08616e3%2Fimg-9723.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 04:59:42.070559

The meeting brought together Minister Nicola Willis, Minister Simon Watts, Treasurer Dr Jim Chalmers and Minister Chris Bowen to deepen collaboration on emerging technologies and future-ready energy systems that can support more resilient and affordable pathways to net zero.

The discussions placed strong emphasis on how technology-led climate action and increased investment in renewable energy can relieve pressure on household power costs, improve productivity and reinforce energy security across both countries.

With the global economy shifting towards low-emissions technologies, Ministers highlighted opportunities for industries scaling clean products, digital innovation and climate-aligned investments, noting that updated Nationally Determined Contributions signal new clean-tech development aligned with the Paris Agreement.

They also acknowledged the unique value of trans-Tasman cooperation in generating tangible benefits for businesses and communities, including Māori and First Nations Australians, through innovation partnerships and integrated market design.

Climate pressures are reshaping regional supply chains, infrastructure and local economies, prompting both countries to focus on strengthening resilience and ensuring that economic development remains regionally driven and future-oriented.

Ministers reflected on progress since the previous dialogue, including New Zealand’s second emissions reduction plan for 2026–2030 and its National Adaptation Framework, along with Australia’s national Net Zero Plan and risk assessment initiatives designed to encourage long-term investment in sustainable technologies.

A major area of collaboration centres on harnessing technology to build an affordable and secure trans-Tasman energy system. Both countries are moving to align regulatory frameworks, simplify investment pathways and ensure that sustainable finance systems can interoperate effectively.

New commitments include upgrading the Equipment Energy Efficiency Program, supporting smart EV chargers, aligning Vehicle-to-Grid standards and boosting solar and battery sector collaboration to reduce compliance, enhance savings and expand clean-tech opportunities.

Ministers also highlighted emerging opportunities in sustainable aviation fuel, supported by ongoing work on a trans-Tasman SAF Strategy and Australia’s investment in low-carbon fuel production.

Clearer net-zero pathways and internationally relevant standards were recognised as crucial for attracting climate-aligned finance, with both countries working to develop interoperable sustainable finance frameworks.

Australia’s launch of its national Guarantee of Origin scheme and New Zealand’s alignment through its Hydrogen Action Plan mark important steps toward certifying the emissions intensity of green hydrogen, sustainable fuels and green metals, supporting a trusted market for future clean-energy trade.

Agricultural innovation remains a priority, with both countries investing substantially in technologies that reduce livestock emissions and can ultimately transform farming systems internationally. Ministers committed to deeper technical collaboration to speed up the development and adoption of these climate-smart solutions.

Beyond climate and energy, the dialogue also reinforced the importance of innovation in economic reform. Ministers discussed aligning productivity agendas, reducing business costs and accelerating digital payments, licensing reforms and digital asset regulation.

Agencies are exploring greater alignment in non-financial risk management and regulatory tiering in the banking system, while work will continue on harmonising building standards and product safety settings. A new working group will support collaboration on ensuring long-term accessibility and resilience in insurance markets.

Ministers emphasised their responsibility to support the Pacific amid growing climate impacts, reaffirming commitments to expand renewable energy through joint technical assistance, training initiatives in 2026 and deeper regional cooperation.

New Zealand also welcomed Australia’s agreement with Türkiye on COP31 hosting arrangements, which will help amplify Pacific perspectives and accelerate global clean-energy momentum.

According to official data, as of 31 October 2025, the country’s installed non-fossil fuel capacity stands at around 259 GW, including 31.2 GW added in the current financial year up to October.

Amid reports suggesting that the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has instructed lenders to pause financing of renewable energy projects due to excess capacity concerns, the ministry has issued a clarification refuting the claims.

No Directive to Halt Financing, Says Government

MNRE stated that no advisory has been issued to banks, financial institutions, or NBFCs to stop funding renewable energy power projects or equipment manufacturing units.

The ministry clarified that it has only circulated updated information on existing domestic manufacturing capacities—covering modules, solar cells, ingots-wafers, polysilicon and ancillary components such as solar glass and aluminium frames—to bodies including the Department of Financial Services, PFC, REC, and IREDA. The intent, it stated, is to enable lenders to take informed financing decisions and encourage support for upstream solar value chain development rather than focusing solely on module manufacturing.

Government Reaffirms Support for Solar Manufacturing Ecosystem

The ministry reiterated the government’s continued commitment to strengthening domestic solar PV manufacturing with the goal of making India a key global player in the solar value chain. This strategy is supported through policy measures such as the PLI Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules and ongoing efforts to provide a competitive environment for manufacturers.

The ministry noted that India’s solar module manufacturing capacity has increased from 2.3 GW in 2014 to approximately 122 GW today as listed under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM). This growth, it said, highlights the success of coordinated efforts between the central government, state governments and industry stakeholders.

Register Now NVIDIA Partnership Deepens NVIDIA, already collaborating with Palantir on operational AI systems, is expanding its involvement through Chain Reaction.
The company stresses that Chain Reaction is designed for reproducibility, enabling standardized hyperscale builds across multiple locations.","Palantir Technologies has introduced Chain Reaction, a new operating system built to support the nation’s rapidly expanding AI infrastructure. As demand for power, compute and hyperscale data centers surges, Palantir is positioning the platform as a foundational tool for the next era of U.S. industrial growth.

The company says the real bottleneck to AI progress is no longer the models themselves, but the energy and compute capacity required to run them at scale. Chain Reaction is designed to bridge this gap by linking utilities, energy producers, construction firms, and data center operators through a unified system built for unprecedented load and operational complexity.

According to Palantir, the platform is engineered to help transform outdated generation resources into high-uptime systems, stabilize the grid under massive new demand, speed up construction of new generation and transmission assets, and standardize future hyperscale data center design.

“The energy infrastructure buildout is the industrial challenge of our generation,” said Tristan Gruska, Palantir’s Head of Energy and Infrastructure. “But the software that the sector relies on was not built for this moment. We have spent years quietly deploying systems that keep power plants running and grids reliable. Chain Reaction is the result of building from the ground up for the demands of AI.”

CenterPoint Energy Expands Its Partnership

CenterPoint Energy — serving roughly 7 million customers across Texas, Indiana, Minnesota, and Ohio — is one of the platform’s founding partners. After Hurricane Beryl’s impact in 2024, the utility ramped up investments in resilience, selecting Palantir as its software backbone. Now, CenterPoint is leveraging Chain Reaction to accelerate “speed-to-power” and gain deeper operational visibility across its system.

“Never before have technology and energy been so intertwined in determining the future course of American innovation, commercial growth, and economic security. In the Greater Houston region, our energy consumption is projected to increase by nearly 50% in five years and double by the mid 2030s. This exponential growth is being driven by a diverse set of sectors, including high tech, healthcare, energy, industrial, pharmaceutical, and fleet, and is accelerating job creation across the communities we are privileged to serve. We are excited to team with Palantir and our other Chain Reaction partners to enable this future sooner,” said Jason Wells, Chair & Chief Executive Officer of CenterPoint Energy.

NVIDIA Partnership Deepens

NVIDIA, already collaborating with Palantir on operational AI systems, is expanding its involvement through Chain Reaction. By integrating NVIDIA’s accelerated computing stack — including Nemotron models, CUDA-X libraries, and Palantir’s AIP and Ontology — the initiative aims to streamline the complex supply chain behind gigawatt-scale “AI factories.”

“A new industrial revolution has begun—one where intelligence is manufactured at scale through an extraordinarily complex supply chain of AI infrastructure, now being built across America to strengthen our economy, workforce and security,” said Vladimir Troy, vice president, AI Infrastructure, NVIDIA. “By partnering with Palantir and our ecosystem, we are accelerating this transformation—powering the engines of the AI age, transforming data into intelligence and securing America’s technology leadership for decades to come.”

A Nationwide Buildout for the AI Era

Chain Reaction sits at the intersection of energy, construction, and digital infrastructure. The platform’s goal is to unify real-time operations, planning, and predictive analytics so that new power plants, transmission lines, and data centers can be built faster and operated with fewer disruptions.

Palantir framed the launch as a turning point for America’s ability to meet future AI-driven electricity demand. With load forecasts climbing rapidly — often by triple digits in fast-growing regions — utilities and developers are looking for tools that help compress timelines and improve reliability.

The company stresses that Chain Reaction is designed for reproducibility, enabling standardized hyperscale builds across multiple locations. By coordinating permitting, supply chains, construction, and grid interconnection in a single system, Palantir says developers can move from concept to megawatts more efficiently.

The announcement also underscores Palantir’s broader push into critical infrastructure, government systems, and industrial AI deployments. As energy systems become more digitally intertwined with compute infrastructure, Palantir is positioning itself as one of the key software players shaping the backbone of America’s AI economy.",,N,,2025-12-08 01:00:36.872858

Wood wants to increase food accessibility among Fort Worth youth through agriculture and environmental stewardship by using the green space at the 150 acres of the now defunct Woodhaven Country Club and golf course.

His environmental nonprofit Econautics aims to use the east Fort Worth site to foster connectivity to nature among children and families.

“That’s the goal,” Wood said. “It could meaningfully increase the quality of life for youth in the neighborhood.”

Crescendo Development, the company that now owns the acreage at the Woodhaven golf course, is one step closer to its vision for agriculture, housing and retail at the site now that Econautics has signed on.

The nonprofit is the first organization to put the land to use after Crescendo received approval from city officials in October for its preliminary plan to create the mixed-use development that faced some pushback from neighbors who worried about the traffic and density it would bring.

“We want to preserve as much green space as possible while having an economically viable project,” Crescendo Development owner and founder Will Northern said. “Econautics will serve as a healthy, holistic draw that will show it is possible to have agricultural-type uses adjacent to development.”

Bridging the gap

Econautics leased out 10 acres of the Woodhaven property in November with plans to use former warehouses and sheds to teach families and youth how to garden and grow quality produce, Wood said.

Fields of crops and greenhouses will also dot the land.

“We want to help bridge the gap in the food safety net in our country and my hometown of Fort Worth,” he said.

Econautics launched in 2012 with the mission of educating the public on how to apply sustainable practices into business operations in response to environmental concerns, such as poor water quality.

Now it focuses on environmental stewardship and teaching youth how to use clean technology to promote sustainable food production. Sustainable agriculture is an approach aimed at producing food while protecting the environment and expanding natural resources.

Plans for Woodhaven will involve assistance from a nurse practitioner and nutritionists to bring Econautics’ “outdoor kitchen” to life, Wood said.

Meanwhile, accessing the green space at the site will help improve the quality of life for east Fort Worth’s youth, he added, noting that Quanah Parker Park is the only park in Woodhaven now.

“Connecting with nature, that’s one of the things we’d like to have on-site,” he said.

Having grown up playing outdoors, hiking, and swimming in ponds, Wood wants other children to have a similar experience as they grow healthy foods, learn about environmental science and become grounded in nature at the former golf course.

“These are all things that promote longevity and address chronic diseases, which is a huge strain on the health care system and especially these communities,” Wood said.

Mixed feelings

Crescendo’s plans to revitalize the area drew mixed reactions from the public. Some neighbors opposed the project saying they worried about the increase in traffic and impact on the environment from building single-family homes, apartments and shops in the area.

Keith Larson, Woodhaven Neighborhood Association vice president, is looking forward to the environmental education Econautics will make available to youth.

“To show people in a not terribly big piece of property that you can actually grow and cultivate food that you can eat is a pretty exciting opportunity,” Larson said.

He finds Crescendo has done an “admirable job” of meeting with nearby residents to learn more about what they want to see at the site, which he said includes the light revitalization of a golf course and trails to access the Trinity River and Quanah Parker Park.

“There’s a lot of opportunity in the plan there, and we hope very much that the vision is going to play out as explained,” Larson added.

However, other residents believe Crescendo’s plans to increase retailers and business would not serve the neighborhood.

Woodhaven resident Erika Graham finds it “inappropriate” to develop a commercial space in a densely populated residential area.

Her concerns also stem from how the neighborhood’s tax increment financing district’s funds will be applied to the redevelopment of the golf course.

“While the apartment owners may be paying into the (TIF), it is ultimately the apartment residents that are out of pocket for it,” Graham said.

She and other residents would have preferred the city purchased the land and lightly redevelop the area with amenities such as an event venue, walking trails and a community center for neighborhood members to meet.

“However this property is developed, it needs to include amenities for all Woodhaven residents,” Graham said.

Envisioning Woodhaven’s future

Econautics’ mission aligns with Northern’s goals of preserving green space and nature while also being business-friendly, he said.

Whatever changes may come for Woodhaven, Crescendo Development wants to incorporate as much nature as possible into the site’s future, Northern said.

Even where new housing will be built, they’ll be designed to maintain green space, he said. While the golf course has not been in operation for several years, Crescendo has identified a large parcel of the area to become a smaller golf course.

Sitting on the left edge of the acreage is potential parkland, Northern said. While development of that parcel relies on public funds, he hopes to one day revamp the land to become a park, amplifying green space in the Woodhaven area.

“I want to … bring out and preserve those beautiful areas that make this place so special,” he said.

There are 27,000 known brownfields, or sites contaminated with pollutants, dotting Michigan. Many of them are locations where factories once stood.

About half are what the state calls “orphan sites,” meaning there’s no responsible party that owns the land and would otherwise have to clean up the pollutants, said Phil Roos, the director of the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

“Sometimes people don’t even want to touch it if they don’t know the nature of the contamination or can’t address it,” Roos said.

That’s why the state is funding restoration projects, offering developers grants of up to $2 million, he said.

The grants cover assessing what the contaminants are, the best ways of removing them and often helping with the first stage of clean up, Roos said.

“Because we have a lot of these sites around the state, we need to de-risk it by providing some funding that will allow whoever’s developing the site to raise capital to do the development, knowing that it’s safe and they don’t have to address those issues any further,” he said.

The grants stem from the state budget for RenewMI which allocates $77 million. RenewMI is the department’s environmental remediation program.

When brownfields are cleaned up, they can be revitalized and turned into new housing developments, parks, commercial establishments or new industrialization.

The Lugnuts Stadium in Lansing, home to a minor league professional baseball team, is on a former brownfield, Roos said.

Since 2019, the state has been funding brownfield cleanup. The department has done 474 redevelopment projects in 50 communities, leading to $184 million in incentives and creating over 20,000 jobs, he said.

Those projects included the Grayling Northern Market and the Grayling Sawmill in 2018. The Grayling Northern Market used to be a planing mill and lumber yard, while the sawmill was a hotel, saloon and stores.

There have been four brownfield clean-up projects since 2020 in Traverse City. The most recent project in 2025 is Grandview Vision.

The site used to be an ice cream factory, and an antique store is on the property next door, according to Environment, Great Lakes and Energy’s website.

Cadillac has also seen four brownfield projects, including one in 2025 to clean up a former dry cleaners, grocery store and retail buildings.

In the past year, there has been an influx of housing developments built on cleaned-up brownfields. Roos said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has made those projects a priority because of the state’s housing shortage.

“We can, in many cases, make it so there’s no threat to public safety and turn them into beautiful places to live,” he said.

However, not every brownfield site is equal, said Mike Witkowski, the director of environmental and regulatory policy at the Michigan Manufacturers Association.

Some “legacy sites” like abandoned gas stations and factories have contaminated an area to the point where the amount of money needed to clean it for residential development is unrealistic, he said.

There are different standards that dictate what brownfield sites can be used for while helping to prevent human exposure to harmful chemical pollutants, he said.

Those especially contaminated sites can still be cleaned up to meet standards for things like new industrial development.

“If you can come through and say, ‘All right, let’s turn this into a parking lot or another industrial setting and keep it at those standards’ – that’s really not only the best way to handle those contaminants, but it’s also the most economically sound for the state and private investment,” Witkowski said.He said the number of existing brownfields makes it impossible for the state to clean all of them, meaning private developers cleaning up sites is all the more important.

“One of the best things we can do is have a robust and and really well-functioning brownfield redevelopment program that allows these new private investment dollars to come in and say, ‘Hey, we want to build here on this site and not only are we going to provide jobs, but we’re also going to help clean up the the contaminants there and make this space usable property again,’” Witkowski said.

The Michigan Manufacturing Association opposes a bill currently in the Michigan Senate that would add additional clean-up standards, and extend liability for developers, saying it would likely discourage private investment into brownfields, he said.

“It really complicates it in a problematic way, which we feel is going to lead to less cleanups and less investment in our industrial sites and really more expansion into green space developments where there’s never been a development or any industry before,” Witkowski said.

He said the current brownfield program as it stands has been sufficiently vetted by the state and environmental engineers. It’s helped the economy grow across the state and has been successfully cleaning up contaminated sites.

“To try and bring that in a little bit or make change is going to hurt the trajectory of our environmental cleanups and economic growth,” Witkowski said.",https://greatlakesecho.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/36911_404499488300_92573353300_4464360_1537553_n_bigger.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 01:58:44.602952

Farmers urgently need economic assistance, according to a new Market Intel report from the American Farm Bureau Federation.

The key takeaways of the report are:

• Farm financial stress is severe and persistent. Margins are below break-even for many crops, working capital has been eroded, Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies are on the rise and, according to a recent survey of commercial lenders by the American Bankers Association, profits will remain elusive going into 2026.

•​​​​​​​ Trade losses have compounded economic pressures. Farmers have experienced multibillion-dollar export declines in some of their largest trading markets, including China. Trade frameworks have been announced, but increased export volumes have yet to materialize and cash prices remain at or below levels seen in early 2025.

•​​​​​​​ Without action, long-term viability is at risk. Additional financial support is critical to offset trade losses and provide a bridge until farm bill enhancements from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” go into effect. This will stabilize the farm economy, sustain rural economies and maintain affordable food prices.

“Input costs have increased dramatically over the last few years — up in some cases 30%, 40%, 50% — but at the same time, commodity prices have come crashing down. For many crops they’re at historically low levels,” said John Newton, AFBF vice president of public policy and economic analysis.

“Trade has slowed, and the effect is we’ve had margins that have been at or below break-even for many crops and specialty crops for many years in a row, and that’s starting to impact farm financial conditions.”

Trade losses heightened the challenges in an already difficult economic environment.

“As the Chinese backed out of the market, that put further pressure on prices. As farmers were harvesting a crop, many of them didn’t have storage and had to sell at harvest-time lows,” Newton said.

“So, even though we’ve got a framework in place and the Chinese are starting to buy product, for a lot of growers, the economic benefits of these frameworks may come too late.”

While some help was made available in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed by President Donald Trump on the Fourth of July and the American Relief Act, which was signed by President Joe Biden last December and mainly served as yet another one-year extension of the 2018 farm bill, that assistance won’t reach farmers until some time next year.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pledged $12 billion in economic support to help offset trade losses, Newton said.

“We hope to see details of that in the next few weeks, but the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ while it made a historic investment in farm bill risk-management programs, those benefits won’t materialize on the farm for over a year,” he said.

Ethanol Could Fuel Economic Rebound

At a time when the farm economy is facing a downward turn, farmers are looking for expanded market opportunities. Increased biofuel production could be one avenue to boost farm revenue and support the entire rural economy.

One simple solution for expanding biofuel demand would be to allow for year-round E15 in American gas pumps.

Most gasoline sold across the country is blended with 10% ethanol, but 15% blends are becoming increasingly common, particularly here in the Midwest, where most corn is grown. By the way, E15 gasoline generally costs at least 10 cents less a gallon than E10 gasoline.

But the Environmental Protection Agency has previously prohibited its sale during the summer over concerns that its use during that driving season could increase smog.

For the economic and energy security benefits of E15 to be fully realized, the marketplace needs long-term certainty — and there’s a straightforward path to make this possibility a reality.

Right now, the ethanol industry relies on the EPA to grant a series of short-term waivers to sell E15 in the summers.

A congressional fix to get year-round E15 that does not rely on those emergency waivers would allow producers to have some stability and know that they will be able to blend ethanol all year.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/lONFG1BYH-xDXfgrRKMhsqV7Ap0=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/S5JV6SGRY5HBZOZMK2NCS2SZ7Y.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 20:58:49.985713

But experts say ERCOT is still in a stronger position than it was during the deadly 2021 winter storm.

The findings come just days before ERCOT's board of directors meets to discuss how large energy-hungry facilities, including data centers and cryptocurrency mines, are reshaping electricity demand across the state.

According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, winter electricity demand continues to rise across the ERCOT region, driven in part by the growth of 24/7 data centers powering AI systems and other high-tech operations.

NERC's 2025–2026 Winter Reliability Assessment warns that these facilities are ""reshaping"" when Texans use power. Because data centers run around the clock, the report says they are flattening the daily load curve, stretching peak demand periods into longer windows — particularly before sunrise and after sunset, when solar isn't available.

The assessment shows ERCOT has enough capacity under normal conditions, but in an extreme cold scenario, the grid could face tighter reserves, similar to what the state experienced during Winter Storm Uri.

""If a storm comes through like we had in February of 2021, ERCOT estimates a 20% likelihood of rolling blackouts,"" Hirs said. ""That's a lot better than last year's estimate of 80%.""

According to ERCOT's Monthly Outlook for Resource Adequacy for January 2026, the grid operator's highest-risk hour this winter is around 8 a.m., when cold morning temperatures coincide with little or no solar production. ERCOT estimates just a 1.4% chance of issuing an Energy Emergency Alert during that peak hour under normal conditions — far below the emergency conditions Texans experienced nearly five years ago.

Hirs says the strain on the grid isn't only from data centers. Cryptocurrency mining — another high-power, round-the-clock industry — has become one of Texas' biggest electricity users.

""The cryptocurrency miners now in the past year have used as much electricity as El Paso and the city of San Antonio,"" Hirs said. ""Now, just in 2021, that was up to the level of Austin.""

Many of those companies are planning to bring their own on-site power generation, which could help ease pressure on the statewide grid.

""Most of them are working to bring their own electricity generation with them,"" Hirs said. ""Texas has been fortunate with a huge build-out of wind, solar, and batteries, so we're better able to absorb these new data centers — at least for the time being.""

ERCOT's board will meet Tuesday in Austin to discuss and address the issue of large electronic loads, a category that includes both data centers and crypto mining operations.

Britain's National Energy System Operator will prioritise grid connection for the most viable power generation and storage projects in a huge overhaul of the system, it said on Monday, designed to root out zombie projects clogging up the process.

Britain has a target to largely decarbonise its power sector by 2030 which will require many more renewable power plants such as wind and solar which will need to be connected to the electricity grid.

The government has also said it wants the country to become an artificial intelligence “superpower” which will require grid connection for power-hungry data centres.

The overhaul replaces a first-come, first-served system that had created a queue of more than 700 gigawatts of projects seeking connection - four times the amount Britain needs to meet its 2030 clean power targets.

""These changes will cut grid bottlenecks by prioritising ready-to-build projects, giving certainty about when and where they can connect and unlocking billions in clean energy investment,"" Kayte O’Neill, NESO Chief Operating Officer, said.

Under the new process, projects with planning permission, land rights and alignment with national energy goals will be fast-tracked for connection.

Around 3,000 grid connection applications were assessed, with 132 GW identified as crucial for meeting the government's Clean Power 2030 target and a further 151 GW needed by 2035.

A further 99 GW of projects seeking power from the grid, such as data centres, will also be prioritised for connection, NESO said.

More than 300 GW of projects will not advance, having failed to demonstrate readiness or alignment with national objectives, it said.

Britain's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government inherited ""a broken system where zombie projects were allowed to hold up grid connections for viable projects.""

That’s the part people outside this reality don’t understand. It’s not the injury that breaks you, it’s the hesitation. The pause before asking for help because you already know the answer: it depends on your deductible.

Across the Shenandoah Valley where I live, people make this same calculation. Can I afford to get better?

We don’t talk about it much, but the numbers tell the story plain: about four in 10 adults in America carry medical or dental debt, and rural folks are more likely to struggle with it than people living in urban areas. Research shows medical problems and bills are among the leading contributors to personal bankruptcy. And for about seven in 10 adults with health care debt, the bills came from a one-time or short-term medical expense – a single hospital visit, an ER trip, or an unexpected procedure. One broken bone. One bad diagnosis. One stroke of bad luck, and your whole future can tip.

You learn to live smaller after that, to stretch prescriptions, to work through pain, to keep quiet about what hurts. To walk around with the silent fear that your body might betray your budget.

We’ve all become experts at pretending the system is normal, because it’s the only one we’ve ever known. But it’s not normal, it’s a choice.

Other nations – Norway, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, just to name a few – have made different choices about how to care for their people. None of them are perfect, and they’re not all the same. But they’ve each decided on one simple idea: getting sick shouldn’t mean going broke.

These countries pay for it in different ways, some through higher taxes, some through shared insurance systems, but the result is the same: people don’t have to hesitate before calling a doctor when something’s wrong. It’s not socialism. It’s just a society deciding that health care is part of the common good – like roads, schools, or clean water.

When I spoke recently with journalists from Norway and Sweden, they told me what care looks like where they live.

In Norway, a hospital stay doesn’t come with a payment plan. Education is free, prescriptions are affordable, and families don’t go bankrupt because a child gets sick.

People still work hard – farmers, factory workers, teachers – but they do it knowing one injury or illness won’t destroy everything they’ve built.

They pay more in taxes, but what they get in return is peace of mind. They don’t hesitate before calling the doctor. They don’t lie awake wondering if this month’s paycheck will cover both medicine and the electric bill.

It’s not a perfect system, none are, but it’s one built on the idea that care is a shared responsibility, not a luxury.

Here in America, we’ve built something powerful – some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world. But access to them depends on what’s in your wallet.

Unfortunately, we also end up paying more for worse results by almost every measure: lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, and higher rates of chronic illness than other wealthy nations. In the country with the largest economy in the world, we still treat health care like a privilege to be earned. We’ve built a system where survival comes with fine print, where you can buy a truck on credit more easily than you can see a specialist.

I don’t bring this up as a political argument. This isn’t about right or left, it’s about right or wrong.

It’s about neighbors, parents, co-workers – about the next time you hear someone cough in a quiet room and realize how fragile we all are – how easily health can become debt.

When I think about the future I think about my children and how I want them to inherit something better than this quiet cruelty. I want them to live in a country where care isn’t a privilege you earn but a promise we keep to one another.

Because someday, it won’t just be a headline. It’ll be someone you love sitting in an exam room, staring at a clipboard, doing the math in their head.

Wondering if healing is something they can afford.

We can do better than that.

We have to.

Because in the land of plenty, no one should have to go broke just to stay alive.

Hi there! Welcome to Ed’s Clean Energy & Sustainability Jobs List, where we know climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels such as gasoline, coal, oil, and fossil gas (“natural” gas), and that burning fossil gas in our homes makes us sick.

There are 83 jobs and internships in the full version of the newsletter this week.

Access to jobs that require less than five years experience or that are located outside of the U.S. are and will remain free. There are individual subscriptions ($7/month or $70/year) available as well as career center subscriptions ($300/year). College student? Please ask your career center to sign up for a paid subscription, especially if they pointed you here. Odds are they have not subscribed.

Want to support the jobs list, but can’t swing a subscription? I started an affiliate bookshop on Bookshop.org that will send me a small affiliate bonus if you purchase books using this link (https://bookshop.org/shop/EdsCleanJobs). I also included a selection of books that I’ve enjoyed that address climate change and climate solutions. You can also send me a one-time payment/tip using this link.

What I'm reading this week:

Colorado mandates ambitious emissions cuts for its gas utilities (Alison Takemura, Canary Media).

Cooking with gas gets more expensive as Americans face rising prices into 2026 (Oliver Milman, The Guardian).

Natural gas use for electricity in California falls as solar generation rises (Andrew Iraola, U.S. Energy Information Agency, Today in Energy). The 2025 chart from this article is really interesting because it shows batteries responding to the infamous ‘duck curve’. Not to mention the way solar and batteries are starting to eat fossil gas’s lunch.

A Wildfire Survivors Want to Rebuild All-Electric, but a Utility Is Using Customer Funds to Incentivize Gas Appliances (Hilary Beaumont, Inside Climate News). California residents - the CPUC has an open public comment period on this matter. The article includes a link and details.

Environmental (in)justice articles of the week:

New Analysis Provides More Evidence That Heat Standards Save Lives (Liza Gross, Inside Climate News)

The community has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in Chicago and risks becoming a food desert. Additionally, the area has a 13% unemployment rate, nearly double the Chicago average.

Green Era Campus aims to breathe new life into the community, and Chicago at large, through the transformation of a 9-acre vacant brownfield site into a renewable energy and urban farming campus. The organization envisions creating green energy and jobs, providing fresh produce, offering small business incubation and educational programming on its campus, and bringing community green space to the Auburn Gresham area.

The project uses a unique, closed-loop approach to drive economic development and sustainability initiatives, including tackling the problems of food waste. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, food waste is the largest solid waste stream reaching landfills in the US, with Chicago alone producing 55 million pounds of food waste per month. Green Era has developed an anaerobic digester that will recycle inedible food waste to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) and nutrient-rich compost. The project will provide the compost created by the digester at low cost to farmers throughout Chicago. This compost will also be used on the project’s urban farm, which is expected to grow over 26,000 pounds of produce annually.

“We want to show how closed-loop digester systems benefit the environment as well as the community,” said Jason Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Green Era Sustainability, a partner in Green Era Campus. “Green Era hopes to be at the forefront of what’s next for sustainable, equitable urban development.”

With our experience in low-carbon energy, our lawyers were able to provide pro bono support to Green Era on a range of projects, most notably preparing an RNG offtake agreement that allowed the project to optimize the creation of its anaerobic digester.

Our engagement with Green Era is part of a broader effort to support individuals and organizations advancing sustainability worldwide.

We also assisted Green Era in interconnecting with a nearby natural gas pipeline, where it will inject the RNG created by its anaerobic digester. With this interconnection, Green Era can sell the RNG it generates to create revenue to support its urban food waste recycling and urban farming operations. The interconnection agreement was finalized in December 2023, and Green Era is now able to inject the RNG it produces into the fossil natural gas pipeline system. In further support of the project’s closed-loop system, our lawyers are helping Green Era negotiate a solar power purchase agreement and associated lease. As of April 2025, the self-sustaining anaerobic digester is fully operational.

“By starting from a community-oriented perspective, Green Era is taking a holistic approach to environmental sustainability,” said partner Josh Bledsoe, who oversees the Latham team working with the organization. “Green Era’s approach is truly unique, serving as a model not just for Chicago, but for cities across the United States.”

“Creating a community-centered climate-resilient hub is not only timely as we collectively understand the need for clean and renewable energy, but also the daily need in our neighborhoods for health-affirming food that can be grown by everyone. Most importantly, we hope that through the project our youth see the potential for their participation in green initiatives, as well as career and academic pathways,” said Erika Allen, founder and CEO for Urban Growers Collective, and president of Green ERA Educational NFP.

Following the completion of the anaerobic digester, our lawyers are assisting Green Era with feedstock supply agreements in order for the organization to develop a sustainable and efficient food waste management solution.",https://www.lw.com/assets/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-07 19:02:06.974443

The petition requests that the EPA add microplastics to its unregulated contaminants list, which is a list of emerging contaminants not currently required to be monitored under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.
The rule would allow data to be collected on microplastics and for the development of a monitoring program for drinking water across the country.
Renkoski said the current drinking water treatment systems were not designed for PFAS or for microplastics.
“In the few testings that have been done with drinking water, we are definitely seeing microplastics,” Renkoski said.","Governor Gretchen Whitmer and six other governors have signed a petition urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to monitor and collect data on microplastics.

The petition requests that the EPA add microplastics to its unregulated contaminants list, which is a list of emerging contaminants not currently required to be monitored under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.

Being added to the list means that microplastics would fall under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR). The rule would allow data to be collected on microplastics and for the development of a monitoring program for drinking water across the country.

The governors said a provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to place microplastics on the monitoring list because the petitionhas the signatures of seven governors. Michigan’s Whitmer joins governors — all Democratic — from New Jersey, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Wisconsin, and Connecticut.

Tami Renkoski, the co-founder of the Michigan Microplastics Coalition, said she was “thrilled” that Governor Whitmer signed the petition. “We appreciate all the work she has done to protect our Great Lakes and our beautiful state of Michigan,” she said.

Renkoski said the current drinking water treatment systems were not designed for PFAS or for microplastics. “So there would need to be some work done to get systems up to speed to remove those contaminants,” she said.

Renkoski said because microplastics are an emerging contaminant, researchers are still working on determining the maximum amount of microplastics people can consume before it becomes dangerous. “In the few testings that have been done with drinking water, we are definitely seeing microplastics,” Renkoski said. “But how much is too much, we don’t know yet.”

Microplastics are pervasive. Renkoski said they’ve been found in all parts of the human body and in fish in the Great Lakes. “It's like we have the faucet and the bathtub turned on, and it's overflowing,” she said. “It's nonstop. We have created so many plastic products, they're everywhere.”

Research on microplastic health and environmental effects is ongoing. Renkoski said they won’t know the extent of the problem until more data is gathered on microplastics.

Daines Pushes for Repeal",Tristan Scott,,,,,https://flatheadbeacon.com/2025/12/07/as-conservation-groups-rally-support-for-roadless-rule-sen-daines-pushes-for-repeal/,"Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., the Roadless Area Conservation Act (RACA) would protect nearly 60 million acres of national forestland.
The legislation would codify the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule) as well as the Colorado and Idaho Roadless Rules that collectively protect nearly 60 million acres of roadless national forest land in 39 states, including Montana.
“Senator Daines supports repealing the Roadless Rule,” according to an emailed statement from the spokesperson.
Established under the Clinton administration and enacted in 2001, the Roadless Rule generally prohibits road building and logging in all 58.5 million acres of national forest roadless areas.
Later that year, President Clinton instructed the agency to undertake a rulemaking process to provide long-term administrative protection for roadless areas.","Despite a growing chorus of conservation advocates calling on Montana’s congressional delegates to defend roadless wildlands through permanent protections, a bill to do so seems unlikely to advance without Republican support, including that of U.S. Sen. Steve Daines.

A Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee on which Daines serves held a hearing Dec. 2 to consider a slate of 26 public lands and wildfire bills, among them a measure to enshrine the decades-old Roadless Rule into law. Re-introduced in June by U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., the Roadless Area Conservation Act (RACA) would protect nearly 60 million acres of national forestland. Although it has failed before, its supporters say this version comes at a pivotal moment as the Trump administration moves to roll back safeguards introduced in 2001.

Hoping to capitalize on the blitz of bipartisan support that last summer helped cleave a public land sale provision out of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act — a moment when Montana’s Republican-led congressional delegation stood in uniform opposition to the sale — conservation groups this week mounted a similar pressure campaign on Daines.

“If Daines chooses to stop RACA while supporting the Roadless Rule rollback, he’ll expose how empty his public-land promises are,” according to a statement from Wild Montana Federal Policy Director Hilary Eisen. The nonprofit environmental group was among a coalition of more than 200 organizations to urge committee leadership to support RACA in a Dec. 2 letter.

The legislation would codify the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule) as well as the Colorado and Idaho Roadless Rules that collectively protect nearly 60 million acres of roadless national forest land in 39 states, including Montana.

Daines and his fellow Republican delegates from the Treasure State received plaudits from the conservation community after joining ranks with a bipartisan coalition to hobble the land selloff provision. U.S. House Rep. Ryan Zinke even led the charge against the sale in the House before Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, revived the provision in the Senate, putting all eyes on Daines and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy, who both stood firm and eventually wore Lee into submission.

Further burnishing his conservation credentials, Daines recently joined the bipartisan Senate Stewardship Caucus, pledging to “be [a] good steward of the land we’re blessed to live in.”

“This is his moment to prove he means it,” Eisen said. “The Roadless Area Conservation Act is a common-sense, fiscally responsible measure that protects our roadless wildlands by preventing reckless road-building and unnecessary logging, ensuring that our remote, backcountry areas remain intact for wildlife, recreation, and clean water.”

But if Daines was swayed by the political pressure earlier this year, he’s not bending to any calls for him to reverse his position on the Roadless Rule now, particularly after hailing its repeal as “another huge win for Montana and forest management.”

On Dec. 5, a spokesperson confirmed that Montana’s senior senator has not softened his stance.

“Senator Daines supports repealing the Roadless Rule,” according to an emailed statement from the spokesperson. “This action by the Trump administration is a huge win for Montana and will allow us to better manage our forests and protect our communities from catastrophic wildfires.”

The statement from Daines mirrored testimony that committee members heard Dec. 2 from U.S. Forest Service Acting Associate Chief Chris French who said the Roadless Rule has created “barriers to protecting the communities from wildland fire risk.”

“There’s more than 24 million acres of the wildland urban interface that are either within roadless or within a mile of roadless, of which we are restricted from how we treat those areas other than, let’s say, using prescribed fire access,” French said.

When pressed by Sen. Martin Heinrich, the committee’s ranking Democrat from New Mexico, about the “substantial amounts of those roadless areas being treated for fire prevention,” French clarified that the Roadless Rule doesn’t prohibit treatment, but rather “limits the type of activities that you can do” and makes fuels reduction work cumbersome and more expensive.

“Oftentimes, when you’re doing field production work, the actual value that is coming out of those materials is minimal compared to the actual cost of doing that,” French said. “So, in order for us to do more acres and create broader areas of treatments, we need to do the most efficient treatments that we can, providing access and providing the ability to get in there and do that is the way to make that happen. Otherwise, those costs for doing that work are extremely, extremely expensive.”

In northwest Montana, proponents of the Roadless Rule say that framing it as a barrier to active forest management is a mischaracterization, and that, while its value as a conservation tool is unmatched — in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, for instance, eliminating the Roadless Rule would remove critical safeguards against logging and roadbuilding across 9 million undeveloped acres — its genesis was born of utility and agency efficiency rather than an advocacy apparatus to obstruct.

Established under the Clinton administration and enacted in 2001, the Roadless Rule generally prohibits road building and logging in all 58.5 million acres of national forest roadless areas. It makes exceptions to access non-federal land inholdings and pre-existing mineral leases, and it allows some logging to reduce fire risk, improve habitat or aid in the recovery of endangered species, including whitebark pine. The primary thrust of the federal rulemaking initiative was geared toward reining in the scale of road-building activities by the Forest Service, which maintains eight times more miles of road than the Interstate Highway System.

The impetus for the Roadless Rule tracks back to 1998, when former U.S. Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck saw the agency’s vast and poorly maintained road system as a major environmental and fiscal problem and proposed a temporary moratorium on road construction in inventoried roadless areas across most of the National Forest System. At the time, the agency’s road maintenance and reconstruction backlog had ballooned to $8.4 billion while it received only 20% of the annual funding needed to maintain the existing road system to current environmental and safety standards.

The agency adopted an 18-month moratorium in February 1999, pending completion of an overall road management policy. Later that year, President Clinton instructed the agency to undertake a rulemaking process to provide long-term administrative protection for roadless areas. Over the next 14 months, the Forest Service conducted an extensive public involvement process that produced 1.7 million comments, with the majority favoring a strong national policy protecting roadless areas.

The Flathead National Forest includes an inventoried roadless area spanning 478,000 acres, mostly flanking the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area along the Swan Range, as well as west of the North Fork Flathead River in the Whitefish Range. In the Kootenai National Forest, about 639,000 roadless acres border the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness.

During the committee hearing on Dec. 2, Sen. Cantwell said the U.S. Forest Service’s support of repealing the Roadless Rule seems counterintuitive given that the agency is still struggling to maintain its sprawling inventory of roads and clear a $5.9 billion maintenance backlog.

“Instead of the Forest Service maintaining the existing system this administration wants to rescind the long-standing roadless rule to potentially build more roads that the Forest Service won’t be able to take care of,” Cantwell said.

According to French, the Roadless Rule “doesn’t compel road construction.”

“The primary driver is that there’s more than 24 million acres that are within our wildland urban interface that we can’t effectively treat right now,” French said.

Reiterating the importance of including the public in policy decisions, Heinrich, the senator from New Mexico, encouraged French to “have a robust public process before making these decisions” to repeal the 24-year-old administrative rule. At the time of the rule’s promulgation, more than 600 public hearings were held across the country and 1.6 million Americans expressed public support.

“You called the Roadless Rule a barrier. Do you know what sportsmen in New Mexico call the roadless areas that are protected in our state?” Heinrich asked French. “They call it elk habitat.”",https://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251116_MORAN_CABIN_160.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 17:59:46.495224

A national security strategy is supposed to describe the world as it is and explain how a country intends to navigate the constraints and opportunities in front of it. It is meant to be a map, not a message, and certainly not a mirror held up to a single political identity. The 2025 US national security strategy, released on December 4th, tries to present a unified view of American power but the foundation on which it rests is out of alignment with the physical, economic and geopolitical forces that will shape this century. A strategy built on a foundation of illusions becomes more fragile over time. The gap between the world described in this document and the world visible in the data is so wide that it is doomed to fail.

A good strategy begins with a diagnosis of reality. Richard Rumelt has argued for years that strategy is impossible without a sound understanding of the problem a leader is trying to solve. The current document offers a diagnosis that is framed through cultural and civilizational anxieties rather than observable global trends. Electrification, renewable generation, battery storage, demographic diversification, science driven migration flows, the institutional realignment of middle powers, and the emergence of new industrial supply chains are barely acknowledged. These are the forces reshaping global systems. A national security strategy is supposed to engage with these forces directly. Instead, it adopts a posture rooted in defensive cultural narratives that do not match the underlying physics or economics. This is the point where strategic drift begins.

The strategy attempts to anchor American strength in a vision of energy dominance based on oil, gas and nuclear energy. The world is moving in a different direction. Electric vehicles continue to climb in market share. Battery costs continue to fall on learning curves that have proven durable for two decades. Solar and wind generation are the cheapest sources of new electricity everywhere. Countries that rely on fossil imports are trying to replace them because volatility is expensive and electrified systems offer more control. Electricity as a commodity is becoming more central to every economic sector. High voltage transmission, long duration storage, flexible grids and clean industrial heat are the new strategic assets. Oil and gas exporters can still earn revenue during the transition but their leverage over other states diminishes as electrification spreads. Nuclear energy remains part of the mix but its export pathways are slow and capital heavy. A strategy that claims long term dominance through fossil exports is aiming at a shrinking target while the rest of the world invests in the next system.

The strategy’s focus on energy dominance overlooks the internal contradictions created by trying to satisfy both export driven revenue ambitions and the promise of cheap domestic energy for reshored industry. Higher exports pull U.S. oil and gas prices toward global market levels, which raises costs for industry and households at home. The shale sector adds another constraint. Producers have already exploited many of the highest profit sites, and new wells tend to decline faster and cost more to drill. This means the country is at the plateau of economically extractable oil and gas under current conditions. Maintaining high output becomes more expensive over time. Pursuing dominance through exports will therefore push domestic prices upward even as the underlying resource base becomes harder to develop. The alternative pathway, which relies on the continued expansion of renewables that already deliver low cost power in many regions, receives no attention in the strategy. Renewables appear only indirectly as something to be politically rejected under the label of “Net Zero ideology.” A transition to clean electricity would lower long term energy costs and strengthen economic competitiveness. The current policy direction moves in the opposite direction by tying American energy futures to a resource profile that is losing both cost advantage and structural relevance.

The strategy presents reshoring as a straightforward path to renewed industrial strength, but it does not acknowledge the conditions required for that shift to succeed. Large scale manufacturing investment depends on long term policy and regulatory stability because companies commit capital on multi decade timelines. The current environment, marked by abrupt tariff changes, political turnover and unpredictable administrative actions, increases risk for foreign investors who would otherwise finance new plants in the United States. I haven’t spoken to an investor this year who would commit long-term capital to the United States, leaving investments to speculation. Trump’s erratic policies have raised the price of debt and capital in the country, as money providers require greater returns due to the greater risks. Another overlooked constraint is the loss of industrial expertise after forty five years of offshoring. Many of the factories that left the country took with them skilled engineers, production specialists and operational knowledge that now reside in Asia and parts of Europe. Rebuilding advanced manufacturing capacity requires attracting those skills back into the country, which means welcoming foreign talent rather than restricting it. These conflicts were in sharp display at the battery factory where hundreds of South Korean nationals were arrested by ICE. These realities conflict directly with the strategy’s posture toward global investment and migration. A serious reshoring effort needs stable policy, predictable regulation and access to global expertise. None of these conditions are strengthened by the approach described in the document.

Soft power has always been one of the most durable elements of American influence. Culture, political values, stable institutions, scientific leadership and predictable diplomacy—elements of Joseph Nye’s widely accepted framework on soft power—created a reservoir of attraction that made alliances easier to maintain and agreements easier to negotiate. The current trajectory is rapidly eroding these sources. Tariffs on allies signal unpredictability. Cuts to aid programs signal retreat from global engagement and a key source of goodwill and contacts in recipient nations. Negative rhetoric aimed at partners makes cooperation more difficult. Visa tightening and suspicion of foreign researchers make the academic and scientific ecosystem less attractive. Public diplomacy institutions lose their reach when they are reduced in scope. Soft power takes time to build but it can erode faster than many expect when trust is damaged. The Trump Administration’s of the past year have caused significant and in some cases catastrophic decline in every aspect of US soft power. Instead, pandering to Trump is apparently seen as evidence of the existence of soft power, instead of placation of a dangerous and erratic world leader. A strategy that claims unparalleled soft power while acting in ways that radically undermine it is describing an asset that no longer exists in the same form.

Migration and demographic change receive heavy emphasis in the strategy. These themes appear as threats to national character and security. The data does not support this view. Immigrants in the United States, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely to commit crimes than native born citizens. They contribute to economic dynamism by adding skills and entrepreneurial capacity in regions that need both. Population growth driven by immigration has been an important part of American resilience. Demographic diversification supports innovation because different backgrounds and experiences create new problem solving approaches. Half of the US Fortune 500 were founded by immigrants or their children, and they certainly aren’t all white. Treating migration as a cultural threat rather than a policy challenge does not help the country align resources with real needs. Policies grounded in fear instead of evidence struggle to produce effective outcomes. A strategy that presents immigration as a driver of instability ignores the broad record of contribution that newcomers have made for generations.

The strategy misdiagnoses religious freedom and domestic sources of violence by framing Christianity as a besieged identity rather than recognising the real distribution of risk and harm in the United States. Federal threat assessments during the past decade have consistently identified rising violence against religious minorities, especially Jewish and Muslim communities, alongside extremist movements that draw heavily from Christian identity narratives. Domestic violence trends have been shaped by economic strain, gun access and online radicalisation rather than by any decline in the status of Christianity. By reversing these patterns and presenting the majority faith as the primary victim, the strategy directs attention away from the groups that are actually targeted. This framing is likely to produce policies that strengthen surveillance of minority communities and weaken surveillance of the actual sources of violence in the United States, something exemplified by the pardoning of the insurrectionists from January 6th, many of who are already back in jail for more violent offences after release. It will also encourage political rhetoric that deepens division inside the country rather than addressing the conditions that drive violence. A strategy that begins with a distorted diagnosis will struggle to produce coherent action because it focuses on threats that do not match the evidence.

Alliances are a strategic asset that depends on trust. The past few decades show that economic integration and shared democratic institutions create strong partnerships. The behaviour of a country toward its allies signals whether it can be counted on in difficult times. Aggressive tariff measures, public criticism of allied leaders, sudden shifts in diplomatic positions and inconsistent commitments weaken confidence. Countries respond by hedging. They develop deeper relationships with regional partners. They reduce reliance on American supply chains. They negotiate trade agreements without American involvement. Trust is not a soft concept. It is a material component of national security because it shapes the coalitions that determine global outcomes. A strategy that treats alliances as transactional loses sight of the long term value that stability creates.

There is a cost when culture war narratives are placed at the center of national security doctrine. Strategic clarity depends on a willingness to describe the world accurately. When racialized demographic fears or claims of civilizational decline are folded into official policy documents, the result is a distorted view of threats and opportunities. These narratives discourage cooperation with diverse domestic constituencies and with international partners who do not share the same identity framing. They focus attention on symbolic conflicts instead of structural challenges. They create friction in diplomacy because allies perceive the shift in tone immediately. National security analysis becomes less coherent when ideological boundaries define the set of acceptable conclusions.

A national security strategy grounded in the realities of the twenty first century would look different from the one offered in 2025. It would begin by acknowledging the global electrification trend and the rise of energy systems built around renewables, storage and flexible grids. It would frame climate as an operational risk that must be managed to maintain readiness. It would rebuild trust with allies by offering predictable commitments. It would anchor soft power by strengthening democratic institutions, open science and pluralism. It would treat migration as a policy domain where managed integration supports economic and social resilience. It would invest in clean industrial pathways for steel, cement, chemicals and logistics because these sectors will define competitiveness in the next decades. It would align American interests with the broad shifts already underway rather than resisting them.

The map in the current document does not match the terrain. The world is changing and the drivers of strategic advantage are changing with it. The United States has substantial assets that can support a renewed leadership role. For this to happen, the country needs a strategy that begins with an accurate diagnosis of the world as it stands and the world it is moving toward. This strategy then needs to stand for more than election cycle. The past decade has seen the US incapable of holding to and executing strategy past mid-terms, never mind presidential election cycles.

Despite this year’s sharp U-turn in federal energy policy, the renewable energy transition continues to branch out in new directions. One emerging factor is the relatively new area of floating solar. The field has already begun to scale up in some regions around the world, and innovative solar firms are carving out new opportunities here in the US as well.

Floating Solar Scales Up To Beat Fossil Fuels

Back in 2018 the US Department of Energy (such as it was back then) assessed the potential floating solar capacity of the US on reservoirs and other human-made bodies of water. After eliminating thousands of unsuitable locations, they still identified over 24,000 potential sites with the combined potential to provide for about 10% of annual US electricity generation at the time.

The appeal of floating solar lies partly in its ability to make space for renewable energy in land-constrained areas. Whether located on reservoirs and other built infrastructure, or on open water, floating PV arrays can also be moored in place with a minimum of site preparation, avoiding considerable expense for developers (see lots more floating PV background here).

Scaleup is already in evidence in some parts of the world, with the Asian Pacific Region (APAC) being a particular focus of attention. Last year the firm Wood Mackenzie surmised that APAC will account for the fast majority — 57 gigawatts — of an anticipated 77 gigawatts in global solar capacity by 2033.

A study published in the journal Energy & Environmental Science this year affirms the focus on APAC. “Offshore floating photovoltaic (OFPV) systems present a promising opportunity to expand global solar energy capacity, particularly for countries with limited land resources but extensive maritime zones,” the authors note.

The researchers modeled offshore floating solar potential based on economic datasets as well as geographic and climatic data. “The analysis reveals that up to 95% of analyzed offshore regions fall within conditions suitable for current FPV technologies, with Southeast Asia—particularly Indonesia and Malaysia—emerging as optimal early deployment zones due to favorable irradiance, bathymetry, and competitive LCOE,” they concluded, referring to Levelized Cost of Energy, a standard of comparison among different forms of power generation.

More generally, the new study found that in 84% of regions around the world, less than 2% of offshore water surface would be needed to meet current electricity demands.

Who’s Gonna Pay For All This?

The big question, of course, is cost. The floating solar industry has been maturing rapidly, but it is still a relatively new field of endeavor. Costs are expected to drop in the coming years, but even at this stage of the game the technology is competitive, or nearly competitive, with other power generation resources in some regions.

The competitiveness showing was particularly strong in Thailand and Malaysia, where most of the lowest-cost potential surfaced at less than 6 cents per kWh. More broadly, in 53% of the regions studied, the researchers calculated an LCOE below 15 cents per kilowatt-hour.

“As OFPV remains an emerging technology, it is expected that continued research and operational experience will enable optimization across manufacturing, system integration, and deployment, leading to further cost reductions over time,” the researchers concluded.

Meanwhile, Back In The USA

In terms of scale-up, the US has a long way to go. China, of course, has already put down record-breaking stakes in the offshore floating solar industry, having commissioned a 1-gigawatt array off the coast of Shandong Province last year. Meanwhile, the largest existing array in the US sits on a reservoir in New Jersey, clocking in at just 8.9 megawatts.

Still, even at a small scale, floating solar arrays can make a big difference in their host communities.

In New Jersey, for example, the borough of Bernardsville is considering a proposal to float solar panels on the site of a former quarry. As reported by the news organization New Jersey Hills, the project supports the state’s community solar initiative. Electricity ratepayers can voluntarily subscribe to the quarry project and receive a discount estimated at 30%, a significant benefit in today’s environment of skyrocketing energy costs.

NJH reporter Charlie Zavalick also takes note of land use advantages at the site. The quarry sits on private land with no public access and no current recreational use. According to the developer, surrounding communities do not have a view of the site that would be spoiled by the addition of solar panels.

The project could qualify as a community solar project under state law if 51% of its capacity is taken up by subscribers classified as low-income. That’s not a particularly easy benchmark to reach in parts of suburban New Jersey. However, Bernardsville has three affordable housing projects under way and additional projects are in the planning stages, which could help push low-income subscriptions over the goal line.

Floating Solar Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

Keep an eye on New Jersey for more floating solar news. Solar developers in the state dodged a bullet on Election Day this year, when the Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill handily beat her Trump-allied opponent, assuring renewable energy stakeholders of a reliable ally in the Governor’s office for at least the next four years, if not longer.

Meanwhile, the prospective developer of the quarry project, Third Pillar Solar, is also pursuing industrial sites elsewhere around the US. Inactive bodies of water are just one opportunity. In Texas, the company has signed on with the firm Diamond Infrastructure Services to assess its portfolio of reservoirs under management for solar potential.

Based on a preliminary assessment, Third Pillar anticipates building a total of 500 megawatts in floating solar under Diamond’s purview. In addition to earning new revenue from existing sites, the projects are expected to save money for Diamond’s clients by preventing excess water evaporation.

Since everything is bigger in Texas, the state is also on track to host the first large-scale floating PV array in the US, at 391 megawatts. The proposed site is a human-made coastal lake under the jurisdiction of Port Arthur, where it is presumably shielded from interference by the Interior Department and other federal agencies.

Next Steps For Floating Solar

The shade from solar panels can help conserve water in natural bodies of water, too, but researchers point out that the array must be designed to minimize if not eliminate other impacts on the aquatic habitat and the wildlife it supports.

Among the recent studies to that effect, last summer a team of researchers at Cornell University assessed that if just 3.5% of the existing bodies of water in the Northeast were deployed for floating solar, they would generate 25% of the solar energy needs in the region by 2050 — with the additional benefit of conserving land for other purposes.

That 3.5% figure includes bodies of water with significant recreation and biodiversity roles. Weeding them out of the pool of qualified sites, the researchers found that floating solar would only contribute 5% of solar energy needs to the Northeast. Still 5% is a fairly substantial figure in a region strapped for open land, potentially reserving thousands of acres for other uses. The researchers also point out that 5% represents an increase of 194% over the current capacity of land-based solar arrays in the Northeast.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/floating-solar-third-pillar.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 14:59:11.052218

In a statement, the ministry said it has not directed banks or other lenders to stop extending loans to renewable power projects or to renewable energy equipment manufacturing facilities. “It is hereby clarified that MNRE has not issued any advisory to financial institutions for stopping lending to either renewable energy power projects or to renewable energy equipment manufacturing facilities,” it said. The clarification comes amid media reports claiming that the ministry had cautioned lenders against fresh financing due to concerns around overcapacity in the sector. MNRE said it has only shared information on the current status of domestic manufacturing capacity in the solar photovoltaic (PV) segment with the Department of Financial Services and non-banking financial companies such as PFC, REC and IREDA. This, it said, is intended to help financial institutions take a calibrated and well-informed view while evaluating proposals for financing solar PV manufacturing facilities. The ministry reiterated that the government remains committed to making India self-reliant in solar PV manufacturing and positioning the country as a significant player in the global value chain. This push is being supported through initiatives such as the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for high-efficiency solar PV modules and measures aimed at providing a level-playing field for domestic manufacturers. These interventions have led to a sharp expansion in solar module manufacturing capacity, which has risen from 2.3 GW in 2014 to around 122 GW enlisted in MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM), the ministry said. MNRE added that it will continue engaging with stakeholders to ensure India’s renewable energy transition remains inclusive, competitive and future-ready. India, the statement noted, has already achieved 50 per cent of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, five years ahead of the target set under its nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement. As of October 31, 2025, installed non-fossil capacity stood at about 259 GW, with 31.2 GW added so far in the current financial year.

Flexible Data Centers: A Faster, More Affordable Path to Power | Camus Energy

Data centers can make grids more reliable, resilient, and affordable if integrated well. A new study out this week sheds light on what that entails::

The answer to the question: can flexibility allows data centers to connect faster? A resounding “yes.” Building on existing “connect and manage” models, our results showed that a small amount of local flexibility could enable loads to connect 3-5 years sooner.

Further, bringing a set of onsite power solutions (including load flexibility, onsite battery, and gas generation), when paired with procured capacity from renewable, battery, or VPP resources, can enable sites to entirely offset the additional system costs of adding new loads.

The result is a better grid - one which can support a lot more load, in which energy and capacity prices both remain stable, and in which there are new sources of system flexibility which can increase the overall resilience of the system.

The full study is linked in the Camus post. I highly encourage anyone interested in this area to spend some time with it. It’s one of the best studies I’ve seen on the topic and likely to garner significant attention, akin to the Duke University demand flexibility study done earlier this year.

The study was co-written by Camus Energy. I talked at lengthen about all these topics with Camus CEO Astrid Atkinson just two months ago:

Travis Kavulla Explains Why Electric Bills Shot Up, Odd Lots

Of course, there are many reasons why electric bills are rising and it’s complicated. Podcasts are a great format for exploring the complexity. Travis is one of the smartest energy people out there and Odd Lots is one of the best business podcasts out there. So, predictably, this episode was excellent.

On data centers:

How do you get them online without tripping into a bunch of necessary capital investments to serve that last few percent of hours where their demand needs to be served? Or can you source flexibility out of the system from somewhere else, like residential air conditioning, or something like that?

That’s a question that’s very important to figure out. People have kind of issue-spotted it but we’ve kind of really yet to solve it in any meaningful way.

The markets like Texas are geared toward solving it in more of a free enterprise premise, other markets seem to be struggling a bit.

So much more good stuff in this one. And to hear my more about using distributed flexibility to lower costs and increase grid reliability, listen to my discussion with Travis:

Home upgrades can power job growth | Rewiring America

Picking up on Travis’ point, permanent residential and small business demand reductions from energy efficiency and demand flexibility can lower consumers’ energy bills and create headroom on the grid for data centers. The classic win-win. But the benefits don’t stop there.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vIq0!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1427092-9b71-41fd-8a51-5e26019f7d98_1600x1056.png",N,,2025-12-07 16:59:44.817207

Adjacent to the Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond is a 40,000-square-foot battery factory for the industrial manufacturer Viridi, which plans to rapidly expand its workforce as it ramps up production on the West Coast.

Richmond Mayor Eduardo Martinez was present at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the facility in April, but returned Wednesday to speak to legislators who had traveled from as far as South Carolina and Ohio to tour the facility.

“The goal is to strengthen our ability to support clean energy and manufacturing and to provide companies with consistent points of context from day one,” said Martinez. “This service ties with a much larger vision for our shorelines. We are reimagining a working waterfront that honors the Rosie legacy while preparing for a cleaner future and the manufacturing industry and support staff.”

The factory opened after receiving a $9 million grant from the California Energy Commission. It is the second factory for Viridi, after the one at their headquarters in Buffalo, New York. The Richmond facility produces electric generators that have the capacity to power home, industrial, and even larger energy intensive needs.

Viridi president Eric Stein said the facility has the capacity to grow the workforce from the current size of 12 employees to a possible 75 within the next few months. He said the demand for batteries and generators, such as the ones they produce, is rapidly growing and the company can capitalize on using automation to meet demand while also adding skilled jobs.

“… We are reimagining a working waterfront that honors the Rosie legacy while preparing for a cleaner future and the manufacturing industry and support staff.”

Mayor Eduardo Martinez

“There’s a lot of automation that we can bring in, not to displace workers, but to actually expand, to build more products here and bring more people,” said Stein. “So one of the great things about our workforce is when we go to automation, we actually uplift the skill set, because we take people who were assembling product and turning screwdrivers and we train them on higher-end automation and robotics.”

Seeing green

Tess Williams, a project manager with Viridi, proudly spoke into a microphone as she walked backwards leading the tour. She said the company’s most popular product, the RPS150, has been used in hospitals, by emergency responders, and even at the Burning Man music festival. According to Williams, the company is making an effort to minimize their carbon footprint in Richmond during production and when their products reach the end of their service lives.

“We’re a green energy company. We’re not just going to throw these things out when we’re done,” said Williams. “Like anything at the end of its life, there are some parts of it that get thrown out, but 90-plus percent of the unit is reusable, recyclable, or goes to that company that can recycle them at that point, and it’s something we take pride in.”

One of the out-of-state legislators who traveled to learn more about the new technology was Ohio State Rep. Tristan Rader, who represents parts of Cleveland and Lakewood. He said it was encouraging to see many other legislators also in attendance as his home state attempts to address energy affordability issues.

“Both Democrats, Republicans are finally getting together saying we have got to deal with this affordability issue,” said Rader. “And we’re like, why don’t we open the door to all these different types of energy, not just coal, gas, and oil. If it’s cheaper then why not try to bring that to people.”",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LNM-20251205-BATTERYFACTORY-01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1130&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-07 14:00:56.937051

The school announced it will receive a $60 million commitment from the Dallas-based O’Donnell Foundation to create a new interdisciplinary energy studies program and a named honors fund. The gift will seed the Energy Science, Innovation and Enterprise curriculum, help recruit faculty across campus, and underwrite scholarships and career advising for selected students. University leaders say the investment ranks among the largest recent gifts to SMU and is aimed at preparing graduates for jobs across North Texas’s energy economy.

New program and honors fund

According to The Dallas Morning News, the donation will launch SMU’s Energy Science, Innovation and Enterprise program and create the O’Donnell Academic Honors Fund, with offerings set to begin in fall 2026. The program is described as interdisciplinary, pulling faculty from SMU’s business, engineering and humanities and sciences schools to teach technical, entrepreneurial and policy skills. The honors fund will provide four years of seed money to recruit faculty and a career counselor, and scholarships for about 20 students in each initial major.

Why Dallas is the focus

Texas still dominates U.S. energy production and jobs, a reality SMU officials say makes the program timely. Data highlighted by the Dallas Fed and federal energy employment reports show the state supplies a huge share of the nation’s wind and fossil fuel output and supports roughly 990,100 energy related jobs. ""Dallas has all of that, and that's why SMU is really the ideal place to locate a program like this,"" Bruce Bullock of SMU’s Maguire Energy Institute told The Dallas Morning News.

SMU’s fundraising backdrop

The donation arrives as SMU builds on a multiyear fundraising surge. SMU reports that its Ignited campaign topped $1.64 billion earlier this year, giving leaders more flexibility to invest in new academic priorities. The university also points to its new R1 research status and a roughly $2.3 billion endowment as factors that will amplify the gift’s effect. SMU notes that the O’Donnell Foundation previously invested in the university, including a $30 million commitment in 2023 that helped expand data science and engineering programs.

Donor profile and regional investments

The O’Donnell Foundation has been a major funder across North Texas education and research for decades, with a stated focus on math, science and the arts. In October the foundation pledged a separate $50 million investment to bolster college success across Dallas County, a package that directed funds to several local institutions including UT Dallas, according to UT Dallas.

SMU leaders say the program and honors fund are meant to attract students seeking careers in energy and to deepen ties between the university and industry across North Texas. Offerings and scholarships are slated to begin in fall 2026, and university officials say they will use the coming months to recruit faculty and finalize curriculum details.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/12/dallas-donor-drops-dollar60-million-on-smu-to-supercharge-energy-honors-hub-4.webp,N,,2025-12-07 13:00:16.485279

The federal tax credit for EV chargers will also come to an end in June 2026.
Under the Biden administration, it was announced that Chicago would receive $14.5 million in federal funds to develop nearly 200 EV charging stations.
To date, 38 communities have enrolled in the programme, which has driven up EV uptake in these areas, compared to other parts of the state.
However, several U.S. states and EV-makers see a bright future in EVs, suggesting that the uptake of electric vehicles will continue to increase, even if at a slower pace.","Since taking office in January, United States President Trump has spoken out against electric vehicles (EVs), signing an executive order to scrap the “EV mandate” (despite there being no such federal mandate). In recent months, federal support for EVs has waned under the Trump administration, resulting in announcements of delays for several EV-makers due to the ongoing sectoral uncertainty. However, some states are doubling down on efforts to expand their EV markets, with heavy investments in charging infrastructure and other initiatives.

Trump’s executive order sought to halt federal support for EVs, including a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers, which was established by law in 2022, as well as government support for EV charging infrastructure, and low-interest loans for automakers looking to develop EV and battery plants. Trump also stated plans to eliminate local regulations from California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington to ban the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035.

In September, the government officially halted tax credits on new and second-hand EVs. However, several carmakers, such as General Motors and Ford, have, so far, maintained their highly competitive pricing plans on EVs, to encourage consumers to make the shift from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric. The federal tax credit for EV chargers will also come to an end in June 2026.

The CEO of the automaker Ford, Jim Farley, said, “I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change,” in reference to the scrapping of the EV tax credits.

Price reductions on EVs are expected to help counter the scrapping of the tax credit on electric cars in the short term; however, the growing uncertainty around EV uptake could drive some automakers to stall new EV production, which could slow the pace of uptake in the coming years.

Some EV makers are still betting big on the rising uptake of EVs in the United States. In August, Ford announced $5 billion in financing for EV production as part of its “new Model T moment”. Ford plans to sell an EV pickup for $30,000, supported by the new investment, which would make its EVs highly competitive with alternative ICE models. Other companies also expect to be able to reduce the prices of EV models in the coming years, as production expands and the cost of manufacturing EVs decreases.

Meanwhile, Hyundai said it planned to maintain its EV investments in the United States. The firm’s CEO, José Muñoz, said that it could shift between producing EVs and ICE vehicles at its Georgia plant, which will allow it to respond to market demand.

General Motors CFO, Paul Jacobson, stated, “We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural (EV) demand going forward and how do we meet that natural demand.” “That’s going to take a little bit of time. We’ll probably have to adjust our footprint a little bit.” Jacobson still expects a longer-term growth in demand for EVs, even without the tax credit, albeit at a slower pace.

At the state level, several U.S. states are doubling down on plans to expand their EV markets even without federal support. Under the Biden administration, it was announced that Chicago would receive $14.5 million in federal funds to develop nearly 200 EV charging stations. However, Trump announced that this investment would not go ahead, as he suspended the Charging and Fuelling Infrastructure grant programme.

Nevertheless, Chicago is continuing with its EV Readiness programme with funding from the Illinois utility ComEd. Illinois aims to roll out 1 million EVs across the state by 2030, a significant rise from the 160,000 registered vehicles at present. It is making sure it stays on track to meet this goal with the launch of its fourth EV Readiness cohort, supporting representatives of 16 municipalities in upgrading their permitting and zoning processes related to EV charging, as well as raising awareness about EVs and state and local incentives.

To date, 38 communities have enrolled in the programme, which has driven up EV uptake in these areas, compared to other parts of the state. Cristina Botero, the senior manager of beneficial electrification for ComEd, explained, “People sometimes think that the dollars are the only reason people are not transitioning to EVs,” said Botero. “But a big part of it is education.""

The Trump administration has attacked the U.S. EV industry on several fronts, scrapping tax credits for consumers, making it more expensive for manufacturers to produce EVs, and halting the rollout of EV charging infrastructure. However, several U.S. states and EV-makers see a bright future in EVs, suggesting that the uptake of electric vehicles will continue to increase, even if at a slower pace.

In the final rule, EPA says Texas evaluated the required statutory ""four factors"" and that monitored visibility improvements and prior control programs helped drive the agency’s conclusion.
As detailed on the EPA’s Regional Haze pages, the program allows alternatives to source-specific Best Available Retrofit Technology controls, such as regional trading programs, as long as they achieve comparable results.
Nonprofits including the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association were involved in earlier regional haze litigation and are expected to mount new challenges, as per the Houston Chronicle.","On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency approved Texas’ regional haze plans. This decision allows the state to avoid adding new pollution controls at specific sources. The move affects efforts to reduce haze in national parks like Big Bend and the Guadalupe Mountains. Environmental groups say it could make it harder to require older coal plants to install sulfur dioxide and particulate controls.

What the EPA approved

According to the Federal Register, the Environmental Protection Agency approved portions of Texas’ 2009 and 2021 regional haze State Implementation Plans, along with the state's 2014 five-year progress report, finding that together they satisfy applicable Clean Air Act requirements. The rule is set to take effect on January 5, 2026. The Federal Register entry points to a docket packed with monitoring data, modeling and emissions analyses the agency leaned on in its evaluation. In the final rule, EPA says Texas evaluated the required statutory ""four factors"" and that monitored visibility improvements and prior control programs helped drive the agency’s conclusion.

How the agency justified the move

The EPA argues that long-term emissions reductions and visibility gains in Texas mean the state’s existing plans already reflect the improvements the Regional Haze Rule is supposed to deliver, and that states have leeway to choose how they comply. As detailed on the EPA’s Regional Haze pages, the program allows alternatives to source-specific Best Available Retrofit Technology controls, such as regional trading programs, as long as they achieve comparable results. That policy framework, paired with the technical record in the docket, forms the backbone of the agency’s rationale.

Why activists and some scientists say it matters

Environmental groups describe the action as a rollback that leaves parks and downwind communities less protected than they could be. ""Monitoring shows that the majority of haze comes from coal-burning power plants,"" Sierra Club campaign manager Emma Pabst told the Houston Chronicle, blasting the state strategies as ""do-nothing"" plans that put public health at risk. Local scientists, including Rice University’s Daniel Cohan, have said the regional haze program is one of the few federal tools available to push the largest sources to install proven pollution controls, so how the rule is used matters far beyond postcard views.

Coal’s role and what it means for Texans

State energy data show coal still provides roughly 10% of Texas’ generation capacity, leaving coal units as a meaningful slice of the power mix even as wind and solar surge. The Texas Comptroller’s energy overview notes that coal’s share has fallen over the past decade but continues to matter in parts of the grid. Whether older coal plants face mandatory federal retrofits or only state-level measures will shape how quickly emissions that cloud vistas and affect lungs actually come down.

Legal history and what comes next

The final rule arrives after a long legal arc. The Fifth Circuit previously vacated portions of EPA’s 2016 disapprovals of Texas’ plans, and the agency notes in the Federal Register that any petitions for judicial review of the new rule must be filed by February 3, 2026. The federal docket’s monitoring and emissions analyses are poised to be central exhibits if challengers head back to court. Nonprofits including the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association were involved in earlier regional haze litigation and are expected to mount new challenges, as per the Houston Chronicle.

What to watch

In the near term, look for fresh court filings and a fine-tooth-comb review of the technical documents in the EPA docket that helped justify the rule. For Texans who care about clear park views and neighborhood air quality, the real-world outcome will hinge on whether judges send the agency back to the drawing board or the state’s own regulator, TCEQ, chooses to tighten its approach on its own.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/12/epa-lets-texas-coal-off-the-hook-as-park-views-pay-the-price.webp,N,,2025-12-07 14:01:07.932399

The PPA sparked enough interest from financiers and partners to get the $52 million project — a 200-acre, 20-megawatt solar farm in Ocotillo Wells, Calif. — built by 2015.
One partner was project co-developer Regenerate Energy, whose founder and CEO Reyad Fazzani also served as Tallbear Energy’s president.
Others included financing from partners like Duke Energy, whose subsidiary Deriva Energy now helps maintain the solar farm in question, and manufacturing through fabricator Solar First.
These days, Westerman runs the day-to-day operations, alongside an energy consulting firm called Red Power he started last year.","In 2011, Richard Tallbear Westerman (Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate) pivoted away from an 18-year career in interior fabrication to enter the solar industry. He spent two years working out of his garage without a paycheck, building partnerships with potential financiers, locating suitable projects and negotiating land purchases.

Prior to starting Tallbear Seville, LLC, based out of Manhattan Beach, Calif., Westerman’s solar projects were relatively small scale, piggybacking off of the aforementioned career in building interiors, mainly for tribal casinos. Explorations into solar projects for those casinos, and later friends on the Morongo Band of Mission Indians Reservation in California, led Westerman to begin pursuing bigger opportunities in the space.

By 2013, Westerman’s company landed a power purchasing agreement (PPA) with the San Diego Gas & Electric Co. The PPA sparked enough interest from financiers and partners to get the $52 million project — a 200-acre, 20-megawatt solar farm in Ocotillo Wells, Calif. — built by 2015.

One partner was project co-developer Regenerate Energy, whose founder and CEO Reyad Fazzani also served as Tallbear Energy’s president. Others included financing from partners like Duke Energy, whose subsidiary Deriva Energy now helps maintain the solar farm in question, and manufacturing through fabricator Solar First.

These days, Westerman runs the day-to-day operations, alongside an energy consulting firm called Red Power he started last year. “I think I might be the only guy that jumped from a few homes to 20 megawatts,” he said. “But can a tribe do the same thing? I think so.”

Westerman spoke with Tribal Business News to discuss the process he used to build the Tallbear Seville solar farm, hashing out a power purchasing agreement, and surviving energy funding austerity. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

How did you first get into the solar industry?

I had a company that did the interiors for casinos. We did a lot of work for a lot of major casinos, as well as some minority contracting with big entities like Disney, Universal Studios, Planet Hollywood. We were called the gingerbread guys — we would fabricate everything and then come out, put signage up, column wraps, things like that, and make everything look nice.

At one point a casino approached us about doing some solar work for them, and I thought well it made sense, because our electricians were already trained by their union to do things like that. It made me start looking at what opportunities were out there, and then a friend of mine on the Morongo Band of Mission Indians’ tribal council asked me to look into solar installations for some of their homes.

I started meeting people in the industry, in particular one company out of San Francisco that was doing renewable energy development called Stellar, and after talking to them for a while they eventually said, “Well, why don’t we hire you for some consulting?” That made me really start looking into opportunities in this space, and that’s when the PPA came up.

What pushed you toward that instead of continuing on casino construction?

Solar is one of the most solid long‑term investments you can make, because the panels are warranted for 30 years. Remember now, which technology is dependable for 30 years that you can invest in? There’s not a lot. Which entities have the longest, best credit and history of making money? It’s the utilities.

So once you have a customer that has a 100‑year history of paying their bills and paying for energy, and you have a contract with them, it works out.

How did you build the San Diego solar project? That’s $52 million in 2010 money — it would have been even more today.

Well, I did it like any other developer. You get some good partners. I made the president of my company a very well‑known, experienced energy professional who had been the vice president of BP Renewables internationally. We got the best engineers. We got the best legal.

What role did the power purchasing agreement play in attracting partners to the deal?

It’s an attractive deal where there can be money made and be paid back. That can bring in people who want to participate.

Of course, getting the PPA isn’t like the golden ticket. Once you get it, you’ve got to prove it. PPAs could be the worst thing that ever happened to you, because you agree to deliver energy. They don’t care how you do it. You’re saying, I’m going to deliver 20 megawatts daily, and you’re signing a contract for that.

What kind of partners got involved once the PPA was in place?

One was the largest infrastructure fund out of Japan. That was our first financing partner. So that was construction finance. We get it built, we get it in operation.

Then you’re looking at a long‑term partner. Our first one was a company out of Canada called Kruger Energy that wanted to own some renewable energy in the United States. Then there was a change in the IRS rules, because they’re an international company, so they had to sell.

We ended up with Duke Energy as our partner to deliver the energy and handle operations and maintenance. So I still am the manager of the day‑to‑day operation.

How did you handle connectivity to the grid?

We used the Sunrise Powerlink, which was a power line from San Diego out to East County, a good 80 miles, and that connected us to the grid out there in the desert, and even provided energy into Arizona. When the Sunrise Powerlink came along, there was a tremendous opportunity east of San Diego in the desert there to interconnect, sell energy back the other way, right into the city.

You’re a 51% owner in the deal, which is part of how it came together, since your business is minority owned, is that right?

That was part of it, yeah - we’re part of the Minority Business Development Supplier Council, and that played into our bid.

What kind of challenges did you deal with along the way?

I got grilled by the California Public Utilities Commission when I was accused of people saying I was just being used as a Native for minority certification. So I had to go and get grilled on what I knew about solar. I had to do a lot of that on my own because they wanted to be sure I was independent, that I really owned and operated my own business.

How did that go?

They told me at the end of it that I am, in fact, an expert in solar. I was completely justified in my contract. But I had to prove that — there’s a lot of things you have to prove as a business owner. A lot of it isn’t just handed to you.

What are your thoughts about building projects like this in the federal funding vacuum created by an administrative policy shift back toward fossil fuels?

Investment tax credits are still there, right? The one I used. Not to mention, I don’t want to give away everything, because I do make money as a consultant too. But there’s new market tax credits, there’s low‑income tax credits. There’s still plenty of tax credits that can be applied to solar that Native American tribes can access. You have to package that up.

You’ve talked a lot about partnerships, too.

I’ve always been lucky in my career, honestly, to meet the right people. I didn’t figure all this out by myself and tribes shouldn’t expect to either.

Everybody goes to tribes and says, “Well, you got to do it all on your own, and you got to learn everything and do it all on your own.” No, they didn’t do that with their other power. You didn’t see them running out making little coal‑fired plants and nuclear plants, did you?

Usually the developer, contractor brings that to the table. For anybody to tell tribes, “You can just go do this” — well, they couldn’t build a million-dollar casino on their own. They got the experts. I don’t see it any different than other development businesses.",https://tribalbusinessnews.com/images/2023/TallBear_Serville.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 11:02:11.972992

One of the units at the Comanche coal-fired plant operated by Xcel Energy near Pueblo can stay open a year longer than planned to fill the gap while the site’s largest facility, the chronically troubled Comanche 3, remains out of commission.

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission agreed Wednesday to extend the life of Comanche 2, which was scheduled to close at the end of this year. Xcel Energy sought to keep the unit running after coal unit Comanche 3, the utility’s largest power generating source, malfunctioned in August.

Xcel has said Comanche 3 could be out of service until June.

While the PUC approved keeping the smaller unit running, members voted to require more frequent reporting by Xcel on the status of the plant and costs. The regulators warned that the company runs the risk of not being authorized to recover what it spends to repair Comanche 3 if alternatives would have been more cost-effective.

Commissioner Tom Plant said he was bothered by the assumption that “whatever it takes to get Unit 3 running is going to be a good strategy.” Plant and other members pointed out that Comanche 3 has experienced problems and numerous outages since opening near Pueblo in 2010.

The unit, originally forecast to run until 2070, is scheduled to close by the end of 2030. The closure is part of efforts by the state and utilities to cut greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.

Some of the parties weighing in on Xcel’s petition to keep Unit 2 open longer urged the PUC to protect the company’s customers from footing the bill to fix the long-ailing Unit 3. The Colorado Energy Office and the Colorado Utility Consumer Advocate office supported Xcel’s petition.

The PUC expressed frustration with not having more information about what it will cost to repair the unit. Members adopted a proposal by the conservation organization Western Resource Advocates to require Xcel to report its progress each month instead of the two reports the company proposed.

“How do you go into a project like this, a multimillion-dollar project, without even a ballpark estimate of what your costs are going to be and with the assumption that it’s just going to be approved and passed onto ratepayers? I just find that mind-boggling,” Plant said.

All three PUC members want Xcel Energy to identify potential costs before the money’s spent, but didn’t require that at this point. Commissioner Megan Gilman said the PUC’s approval of keeping the smaller unit open for the time being isn’t approval of whatever Xcel might spend to fix the larger unit. “I get that a lot of information may not be available just yet,” Gilman said.

But Gilman said the timing of the reports proposed by Xcel, including a June 1 application that could seek additional variances or approval of resources, is difficult. “We’re not even going to get a filing to assess the path forward until they supposedly already fixed it and spent all the money. That is a backward process of what analysis should be done.”

The PUC adopted another recommendation by Western Resource Advocates that would limit the total, combined power generation of the two units if Comanche 3 is repaired and starts operating in 2026.

“We appreciate the approval to extend Comanche 2 through Dec. 31, 2026, as it provides an essential, reliable resource that will be needed throughout 2026, even after Comanche 3 returns to service in the middle of next year,” Xcel spokeswoman Michelle Aguayo said. She said Xcel will wait to see the commission’s written order before responding to the decision’s details. “Maybe now that the Commission has sent a strong message that Xcel risks having to bear the burden of fixing the plant instead of passing the buck to customers, it will find cleaner, cheaper and clearly more reliable alternatives,” Eric Frankowski, executive director of the Western Clean Energy Campaign, said in a statement.

A group that includes the Pueblo County commissioners and the city of Pueblo supports keeping the smaller coal unit open. The group said in a filing with the PUC that Xcel Energy is facing a capacity shortage.

A previous analysis by the PUC staff showed that other coal plants struggled to stay online during the summer. The report highlighted what Xcel called a “code orange” event, meaning there was a realistic possibility of not having enough power to meet the demand for electricity. The utility asked customers to conserve energy Aug. 7 to avoid managed, rotating blackouts.

Xcel, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has proposed replacing the Comanche coal plant with wind and solar power, battery storage and natural gas generation.

The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants.","But learning to maneuver the shiny red drill they use to tap into underground heat feels different. It’s a critical part of the new family business, High Altitude Geothermal, which installs geothermal heat pumps that use the Earth’s constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. At stake is not just their livelihood but a century-long family legacy of producing energy in Moffat County.

Like many families here, the Coopers have worked in coal for generations — and in oil before that. That’s ending for Matt Cooper and his son Matthew as one of three coal mines in the area closes in a statewide shift to cleaner energy.

“People have to start looking beyond coal,” said Matt Cooper. “And that can be a multitude of things. Our economy has been so focused on coal and coal-fired power plants. And we need the diversity.”

Many countries and about half of U.S. states are moving away from coal, citing environmental impacts and high costs. Burning coal emits carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

President Donald Trump has boosted coal as part of his agenda to promote fossil fuels. He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

That’s created uncertainty in places like Craig. As some families like the Coopers plan for the next stage of their careers, others hold out hope Trump will save their plants, mines and high-paying jobs.

Matt and Matthew Cooper work at the Colowyo Mine near Meeker, though active mining has ended and site cleanup begins in January.

The mine employs about 130 workers and supplies Craig Generating Station, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired plant. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is planning to close Craig’s Unit 1 by year’s end for economic reasons and to meet legal requirements for reducing emissions. The other two units will close in 2028.

Xcel Energy owns coal-fired Hayden Station, about 30 minutes away. It said it doesn’t plan to change retirement dates for Hayden, though it’s extending another coal unit in Pueblo in part due to increased demand for electricity.

The Craig and Hayden plants together employ about 200 people.

Craig residents have always been entrepreneurial and that spirit will get them through this transition, said Kirstie McPherson, board president for the Craig Chamber of Commerce. Still, she said, just about everybody here is connected to coal.

“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said. “When that starts going away, beyond just the individuals that are having the identity crisis, you have an entire culture, an entire community that is also having that same crisis.”

PHASING OUT COAL

Coal has been central to Colorado’s economy since before statehood, but it’s generally the most expensive energy on today’s grid, said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

“We are not going to let this administration drag us backward into an overreliance on expensive fossil fuels,” Polis said in a statement.

Nationwide, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021, costing consumers $6.2 billion more, according to a June analysis from Energy Innovation. The nonpartisan think tank cited significant increases to run aging plants as well as inflation.

Colorado’s six remaining coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close or convert to natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal, by 2031. The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants. Renewable energy provides more than 40% of Colorado’s power now and will pass 70% by the end of the decade, according to statewide utility plans.

Nationwide, wind and solar growth has remained strong, producing more electricity than coal in 2025, as of the latest data in October, according to energy think tank Ember.

But some states want to increase or at least maintain coal production. That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.

PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE

The Coopers have gone all-in on geothermal.

“Maybe we’ll never go back to coal,” Matt Cooper said. “We haven’t (gone) back to oil and gas, so we might just be geothermal people for quite some time, maybe generations, and then eventually something else will come along.”

While the Coopers were learning to use their drill in October, Wade Gerber was in downtown Craig distilling grain neutral spirits — used to make gin and vodka — on a day off from the Craig Station power plant. Gerber stepped over his corgis, Ali and Boss, and onto a stepladder to peer into a massive stainless steel pot where he was heating wheat and barley.

Gerber’s spent three decades in coal. When closure plans were announced four years ago, he, his wife Tenniel and their friend McPherson brainstormed business ideas.

“With my background in plumbing and electrical from the plant it’s like, oh yeah, I can handle that part of it,” Gerber said about distilling. “This is the easy part.”

He used Tri-State’s education subsidies for classes in distilling, while other co-workers learned to fix vehicles or repair guns to find new careers. While some plan to leave town, Gerber is opening Bad Alibi Distillery. McPherson and Tenniel Gerber are opening a cocktail bar next door.

Everyone in town hopes Trump will step in to extend the plant’s life, Gerber said. Meanwhile, they’re trying to define a new future for Craig in a nerve-wracking time.

“For me, my products can go elsewhere. I don’t necessarily have to sell it in Craig, there’s that avenue. For someone relying on Craig, it’s even scarier,” he said.

QUESTIONING THE COAL ROLLBACK

Tammy Villard owns a gift shop, Moffat Mercantile, with her husband. After the coal closures were announced, they opened a commercial print shop too, seeing it as a practical choice for when so many high-paying jobs go away.

Villard, who spent a decade at Colowyo as administrative staff, said she doesn’t understand how the state can throw the switch to turn off coal and still have reliable electricity. She wants the state to slow down.

Villard describes herself as a moderate Republican. She said political swings at the federal level — from the green energy push in the last administration to doubling down on fossil fuels in this one — aren’t helpful.

“The pendulum has to come back to the middle,” she said, “and we are so far out to either side that I don’t know how we get back to that middle.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/00/3003b58c-6876-5141-9551-546d5c2e39dc/6932df2eadfc0.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-07 13:00:07.920728

Rather than reducing wildfire and protecting forests, they say the bill is a giveaway to the timber industry that will worsen wildfires and other threats American forests are facing.
“You can’t fix a problem with forests with the same methods that have caused the degradation to begin with.” Why now?
Giving the Feds more freedom to undertake intensive projects will reduce the amount of biomass available to burn and more readily allow for emergency management projects, they say.","A new bill moving through Congress promises a major overhaul in the way federal officials manage public lands in the United States. Lawmakers have framed the Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA), passed by the House of Representatives, as a necessary response to the spate of disastrous wildfires that have burned in the West over the last several years. The bipartisan bill would remove impediments to logging, allowing the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management vastly more latitude to remove what they say is the fuel that drives wildfires.

But critics contend that the bill’s purported solutions are a mirage. Instead of addressing the crisis, this bill would allow federal agencies to push through large management projects indiscriminately, while limiting avenues for public oversight. Though there is broad support for reducing wildfire destruction, some lawmakers and conservationists say FOFA’s effects on public lands would be disastrous. Rather than reducing wildfire and protecting forests, they say the bill is a giveaway to the timber industry that will worsen wildfires and other threats American forests are facing.

“Forests are broken because of the extent of logging that’s happened over the last five or six decades,” said Dominick DellaSala, a biodiversity and climate change scientist with the Conservation Biology Institute who is a critic of the bill. “You can’t fix a problem with forests with the same methods that have caused the degradation to begin with.”

Why now?

The enormity of fire disasters in recent years—including those in Maui, Los Angeles, and Texas—has been impossible to ignore. This is why the bill has garnered broad, bipartisan support, including in the Senate, where the bill passed out of committee but has yet to receive a floor vote. Its cosponsors are Democrats Alex Padilla of California and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, along with Republicans John Curtis of Utah and Tim Sheehy of Montana. FOFA offers provisions that supposedly would help land managers address the fire threat, seemingly oriented around the theory that more actively managing forests—through increased logging—can reduce the potential for large wildfires.

Specific provisions in FOFA allow for this in several ways. These include allowing certain projects to be exempted from the National Environmental Policy Act. Projects under 3,000 acres are typically able to get these exceptions, called “categorical exclusions,” if projects are claimed to pose little environmental risk. But the new law would enable exclusions for projects up to 10,000 acres, which would allow federal authorities to avoid currently required environmental analyses for far more management projects.

If FOFA becomes law, land managers would also be able to log and thin in designated fireshed management areas—fire-prone landscapes up to 250,000 acres—without current levels of environmental review. At the same time, it would give officials leeway to skip Endangered Species Act and National Historic Preservation Act review requirements.

For the public, the bill aims to limit input and reduce transparency by narrowing the timeframe that stakeholders have to challenge newly announced rules. The current allowance of time is six years, but under FOFA, the public would have 150 days, following the announcement of the decision, to mount a challenge.

Failed solutions

Many of the bill’s supporters, such as members of the Congressional Western Caucus, contend that cutting “red tape” is what will make FOFA effective. Giving the Feds more freedom to undertake intensive projects will reduce the amount of biomass available to burn and more readily allow for emergency management projects, they say.

But opponents say that the regulatory burden—already significantly weakened in recent years—is not the cause of worsening wildfires. Rather, they point to abundant data that long-standing patterns of active management are themselves worsening fire risk. This cohort includes DellaSala, who has authored numerous papers on wildfire and testified regularly in Congress on forest health.

He sees at least four components as essential to addressing the wildfire crisis: immediately cutting emissions (including from logging), which exacerbate climate change and make the scale of fires worse; protecting existing natural areas, which he describes as “our best natural climate solution”; focusing on preventing home ignitions by improving home hardening and defensible space in fire-prone areas; and by stopping road construction through wildlands. “Something like 90 percent of all fires nationwide have a human ignition factor built in,” he said. “We can’t stop lightning, but we can reduce the incidence of human-caused fires by having a better transportation management plan, which means closing and obliterating many roads.”

Timothy Ingalsbee, a former wildland firefighter and now wildland fire ecologist, is executive director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology. He also emphasizes the harms of road building—often falsely characterized as necessary for effective wildland firefighting—agreeing that FOFA on the whole is a dangerous bill.

He does think that, in isolation, some of FOFA’s provisions around wildland firefighting are important, but he worries about the impacts of the law’s overall approach on firefighter morale. “There is a legitimate need for proactive fire fuels management,” Ingalsbee said, pointing to prescribed burning, Indigenous cultural burning, and community fire preparation. Fire is inevitable and necessary in fire-prone landscapes, he said, and the century-plus-long practice of total fire suppression needs to change. “The exclusion of fire is now coming back to haunt us.”

“A treacherous bill”

Critics of the bill are especially alarmed at what they characterize as a power grab, done under the guise of a wildfire emergency, by which stripped-down and unaccountable agencies can undertake whatever sorts of projects they want.

“In the name of improving conditions in the forests and safety for communities, all of which this bill does not actually accomplish, the bill is going to end up taking out a whole lot of other laws and safeguards that have been in place for decades,” said Zack Porter, executive director of the Vermont-based wildland advocacy organization Standing Trees. “Ecological consequences aside, [FOFA] is a treacherous bill for maintaining the fragile democracy that we have.”

Porter is frustrated that the bill has taken on a bipartisan consensus, with Democrats—including those from eastern states, where wildfire has not traditionally been a major issue—signing on. He is especially incensed that his state’s junior senator, Peter Welch, voted yes in October on moving FOFA out of committee in the Senate, despite a July pledge to vote against the bill.

“Some of the same Democratic lawmakers who have rightly pointed out how the Trump administration is using manufactured emergencies to gain control—how are they not seeing through the ways that this bill does the exact same thing under the guise of the wildfire crisis?” Porter asked.

For Porter, DellaSala, and Ingalsbee, the issue is ultimately bigger than FOFA. It’s the confluence of a range of Trump administration policies that are handing even more control of public lands to industry, limiting public insight, and collectively worsening ecological health through a dramatic intensification of long-standing destructive policies. They point to the Roadless Rule rescission, along with Trump’s Executive Order 14225, titled Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production, as a sort of perfect storm of environmental harm that may lead to vastly more logging in some of the nation’s oldest and wildest forests—all more or less undertaken under the guise of so-called responsible land management.

DellaSala said he sees the same arguments playing out as when he first testified in Congress in the early 1990s—even as, 30 years later, so many protections have already been rolled back.

“It’s been an accumulation of eroding our nation’s protections and forest regulations to the point where, if FOFA gets through, it’s going to be a house-of-cards thing for forests, where the public has very little say in outcomes,” he said. “You’re going to get very simple environmental assessments that look to bypass regulations and push through these destructive projects that are only going to make the problem worse in the long run.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-07 11:02:56.055152

The Ministry also reaffirmed that no advisory has been issued to financial institutions to pause or halt fresh lending to renewable energy (RE) projects.

India continues to strengthen its clean energy footprint, having already achieved 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources—a milestone reached five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. As of 31 October 2025, the country’s installed non-fossil capacity stands at 259 GW, with 31.2 GW added in the current financial year alone.

In response to reports claiming that MNRE had urged lenders to stop financing RE projects due to concerns over overcapacity, the Ministry issued a clear clarification. MNRE confirmed that no such advisory has been issued to banks or financial institutions regarding lending restrictions on renewable energy power projects or equipment manufacturing facilities.

However, MNRE has shared updated data with the Department of Financial Services and key NBFCs—including PFC, REC, and IREDA—regarding the current domestic manufacturing capacities across the solar PV value chain. This includes solar modules, cells, ingots-wafers, polysilicon, and ancillary components such as solar glass and aluminium frames. The objective is to help institutions make strategic, informed investment decisions and encourage them to diversify lending across upstream and ancillary segments, rather than concentrating mainly on module manufacturing.

The Government of India remains committed to building a self-reliant, globally competitive solar manufacturing ecosystem. Backed by initiatives such as the PLI Scheme for High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules, India’s manufacturing capacity has witnessed remarkable growth—from 2.3 GW in 2014 to nearly 122 GW enlisted in MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) today.

This rapid expansion underscores the success of India’s solar manufacturing journey, driven by strong collaboration between industry stakeholders, State Governments, and the Central Government.

But they do reinforce that multilateralism can still bring science and policy together to address our global challenges.
The seventh edition of UNEP’s flagship report, the Global Environmental Outlook, will be key to informing how we deliver this future.
Because action on climate is action on biodiversity and land; because action on land is action on climate; because action on chemicals, pollution, and waste is action on nature and on climate.","As geopolitical challenges and tensions escalate globally, one thing is clear: Fragmented politics will not fix a fractured planet.

This is why the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA)—the world’s highest decision-making body on the environment—is so critical to address our shared and emerging environmental threats.

The seventh session of the assembly, taking place at the headquarters of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi, Kenya this month, will bring together ministers, intergovernmental organizations, multilateral environmental agreements, the broader UN system, civil society groups, scientists, activists, and the private sector to shape global environmental policy.

Recent UNEP data show emissions continue to rise as the impacts of global environment and climate challenges are accelerating and growing ever more extreme. We see it in record heatwaves; disappearing ecosystems; and toxins in our air, water, and soil. These are global threats that demand global solutions.

To deliver at the speed and scale required, the United Nations system must act together—with the full family of Multilateral Environmental Agreements coming together to support countries.

Even in turbulent times, environmental multilateralism continues to deliver. Since countries met at UNEA last year, this multilateralism has delivered important progress.

Governments agreed to establish the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste, and Pollution—finally completing the “trifecta” of science bodies alongside the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The BBNJ Agreement on the sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction came into force, a major win for the governance of our oceans.

Importantly, during such a challenging political climate, the Paris Agreement is showing that it is working. However, it is clear we need to move much faster with greater determination. But change is afoot: The global shift to low-emission and climate-resilient development is irreversible. Renewable energy is outcompeting fossil fuels pricewise. Climate smart investments are driving tomorrow’s vibrant economies and societies.

While we must recognize that many were hoping COP30 would include explicit reference to phasing out fossil fuels in the decision text, this was not to be. However, the COP president committed to creating two road maps during his one-year tenure, one to halt and reverse deforestation and another to transition away from fossil fuels—a move that was backed by more than 80 countries during the talks.

These are not small steps—nor are they enough to address the threats we face in full. But they do reinforce that multilateralism can still bring science and policy together to address our global challenges.

Of course, progress is not always straight forward. Since UNEA’s historic resolution in 2022 on a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, negotiations have continued to advance. While we do not yet have a full treaty text agreed, the latest talks in Geneva earlier this year made hard fought progress and countries remain at the table, sustaining momentum toward an agreement that ends plastic pollution once and for all.

This year, under the theme “Advancing sustainable solutions for a resilient planet,” UNEA will build on these wins to set the stage for even greater progress.

The seventh edition of UNEP’s flagship report, the Global Environmental Outlook, will be key to informing how we deliver this future. Released during UNEA, the report will help move us beyond diagnoses of our common challenges to identifying real solutions across five interconnected areas: economics and finance; circularity and waste; environment; energy; and food systems. Drawing on contributions from hundreds of experts worldwide, the Outlook will help countries prioritize the most effective solutions to deliver our global goals.

To deliver at the speed and scale required, the United Nations system must act together—with the full family of Multilateral Environmental Agreements coming together to support countries. UNEP is proud to host 17 conventions and panels that span the environmental spectrum, from toxic chemicals to protection of the ozone layer. Bringing this family of agreements closer together offers opportunities to better align priorities.

This is why UNEA will put a central focus on how these agreements can better work together for accelerated, more targeted support to countries as they implement commitments. Because action on climate is action on biodiversity and land; because action on land is action on climate; because action on chemicals, pollution, and waste is action on nature and on climate.

Inaction now carries a clearer cost than ever.

In 2021, China cracked down on cryptocurrencies and banned Bitcoin mining and trading. Since then, the U.S. has taken the title of the world’s biggest Bitcoin mining hub, accounting for about 75% of reported activity, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (2).

In the U.S., the Federal Reserve decides how much money should be minted each year. But cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are decentralized and no specific body or organization controls them.

So how do new bitcoins enter the economy? They’re mined.

If you’re picturing a worker with a pickaxe, replace the worker with a computer and the pickaxe with computing power.

Bitcoin mining plants operate tens of thousands of computers day and night to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to add a transaction “block” to the public bitcoin ledger, which is known as the blockchain. As a reward, they are granted newly minted bitcoins.

The higher the price of Bitcoin, the more incentive to mine, and the price is up over 400% in the last five years.

The total Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million, and there are currently about 19.9 million in circulation today. As the price rose, mining became more profitable, which led to more miners competing to solve blocks and an increase in overall electricity use.

From mid-2022 to mid-2023, the 34 largest mines in the U.S. consumed 32.3 terawatt-hours of electricity, 33% more than Los Angeles and enough for three to six million homes, according to one study published in Nature Communications (3). Worse still, 85% of this power came from fossil fuels.

Most of the mines were in Texas, New York, Georgia, Pennsylvania and North Dakota. Locals have complained about a constant din from the mining rigs, and lawmakers are concerned about how they’re affecting the utility bills and air quality of residents.

Trump’s strategy

Eric Trump has traveled the world talking about American Bitcoin, which he is a stakeholder in along with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr.. On stage at the Consensus conference in Toronto earlier this year, he emphasized that the Trump administration’s pro-fossil-fuel energy policies were going to help crypto mining.

“We believe we have the cheapest energy anywhere in the country, so much of it coming out of West Texas. We have a president of the United States who actually believes in having a proper energy policy … where he wants the cheapest energy of anywhere in the world because that’s going to fuel all the innovation that we’re talking about right now,” he said. “Go try and mine Bitcoin in France. Go try and mine Bitcoin in Scotland … you’re just never going to do it. The energy price is too high.”

Trump has focused on rolling back clean energy regulations to bring energy prices down. He has also attacked the clean energy industry, shutting down projects and claiming it’s the reason for high electricity prices, even though the data undermines that argument.

O’Leary’s ESG bet

O’Leary on the other hand says low-cost sustainable energy, which Bitzero champions, is the future of Bitcoin mining.

Founded in 2021, the Vancouver-based company has four data centers for mining in three countries — Norway, Finland and the U.S. — and, the CEO told Moneywise, they use “100% renewable energy.”

The company said the currently available energy mix at its remote 184-acre North Dakota site includes wind, natural gas and grid sources. Natural gas is considered much cleaner than other fossil fuels like coal, but it isn’t strictly a renewable source unless it’s produced from organic waste. Bitzero hopes to use only renewable energy when the site becomes operational.

This has been the direction the industry has been moving in. A global survey by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance showed that miners’ electricity mix is predominantly sustainable (52.4%), with renewables accounting for 42.6% and nuclear accounting for 9.8%. Natural gas has also replaced coal as the single largest energy source used in Bitcoin mining.

How you can invest

There are many bitcoin mining firms that are publicly-listed in the U.S., like Riot Blockchain (RIOT), IREN (IREN), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Cipher Mining (CIFR), CleanSpark (CLSK), Bitdeer (BTDR) and TeraWulf (WULF).

When deciding whether or not to invest, it’s important to consider companies’ fundamentals, like costs per coin mined. O’Leary says he looks at power contracts: “What's your power coming in at? It's over 8 cents kWh? No thanks.”

You may also choose for ideological or strategic reasons to look at how they source their energy and if that aligns with your values and expectations of how policies are going to look in the future. For example, IREN claims to use 100% renewable energy at its data centers. Despite its name, CleanSpark runs on “low-carbon power” and not 100% renewable energy.

These companies do remain very vulnerable to the price of bitcoin plummetting. The total market cap of bitcoin miners has collapsed from over $90 billion in mid-October to around $55 billion today, according to Bitcoin Mining Stock (4).

However, they may have the opportunity of repurposing their computing capacity for AI and other uses. JPMorgan analysts recently published a note highlighting the flurry of deals as crypto miners convert to high-performance computing (HPC) power providers.

The investment bank lifted its stock ratings on Cipher Mining and CleanSpark to ""overweight,"" citing the former's recent 410 MW of HPC contracts and the latter's 200 MW of critical-IT potential at its newly acquired 285-MW Texas site, according to The Block (5).

In the Sackett case, the court majority ruled that the waters of the U.S. shouldn’t include wetlands unless they have a direct “continuous surface connection” to another body of water.
While Alsentzer wasn’t happy with the Sackett decision, he argues the new proposed rules curtail federal clean water protections even more.
“Federal law has never said a family farmer can't do what they need to do to support ag on their land,” he said.
“Montana and our ranching community works very hard, is very much a steward of the environment,” she said.","HELENA — The Trump administration is proposing changes to the definition of what bodies of water are considered “the waters of the United States.” While it may seem like an obscure or even irrelevant question, Montana agricultural organizations say it’s not just academic for farmers and ranchers.

The Clean Water Act gives the federal government the authority to address pollution in “waters of the United States.” That means a wide variety of land use activities may require a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency if it’s determined they would affect those waters.

(Watch the video to hear more on the possible impacts of a change to WOTUS.)

Montana Ag: What Waters of the U.S. changes could mean for agriculture

Over the last decade, different federal administrations have tried to establish different standards for when a body of water qualifies as a water of the U.S.

“WOTUS really did put ranchers and agricultural producers in a very difficult position,” said Raylee Honeycutt, executive vice president of the Montana Stockgrowers Association. “It was kind of like a pingpong game: We kept seeing rules changing and going back and forth, expansion, reduction.”

The Stockgrowers and other agricultural groups celebrated in 2023, when the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Sackett v. EPA narrowed the definition of “waters of the U.S.” The Trump administration says its proposed new rules are intended to implement the Sackett decision.

Honeycutt says she’s hopeful these rule changes will bring more stability for agriculture.

“Really what Montana Stockgrowers was asking for – as well as the larger livestock community – was some certainty and clarity in the rules, so that people could continue to plan and make business decisions based off those rules,” she said.

She says one of the major concerns for farmers and ranchers was whether federal regulations extended to “ephemeral” bodies of water – those that don’t have water for the entire year.

“At one point in time, we were talking about puddles of water that had standing water on it being navigable and being under the authority of the EPA,” she said. “So what we're really seeing is some commonsense approach to, when there's water standing because it's rained a lot, that isn't necessarily a body of water that should be regulated by the EPA.”

The EPA says the new definitions would focus enforcement on “relatively permanent” bodies of water. In the Sackett case, the court majority ruled that the waters of the U.S. shouldn’t include wetlands unless they have a direct “continuous surface connection” to another body of water. The new rule would define that by saying a wetland must border a body of water under federal jurisdiction and have surface water at least during a “wet season.”

The agency also says it’s planning to make changes specifically with agricultural producers in mind, including expanding exclusions to limit the number of ditches that would fall under federal jurisdiction and reinstating a specific exemption for groundwater.

Not everyone is happy with what the administration is proposing.

“This narrow interpretation isn't based on science; it's based on essentially a wish list of, ‘How can we do as much as we want everywhere?’” said Guy Alsentzer, executive director of the environmental group Upper Missouri Waterkeeper.

While Alsentzer wasn’t happy with the Sackett decision, he argues the new proposed rules curtail federal clean water protections even more.

“If you care about clean and healthy water, you can't just care about the river – you’ve got to care about all its arteries, which is to say its headwaters and its wetlands,” he said. “This is an unscientific rule.”

He argues development and other actions taken on lands that only have water for part of the year can still have significant downstream impacts.

Alsentzer believes the concerns about how a stricter WOTUS rule would affect farms and ranches are overstated.

“Federal law has never said a family farmer can't do what they need to do to support ag on their land,” he said. “What federal law has said is, the big industrial-scale operators, you've got to take responsibility for your pollution.”

Honeycutt said, regardless of these changes, there are still going to be federal environmental protections in place, as well as protections at the state level.

“Montana and our ranching community works very hard, is very much a steward of the environment,” she said. “We want the world and the earth to be thriving. We are just one component in making that a success.”

Alsentzer said Montana does have state protections, but he questioned whether the state would have sufficient funding to fill the gap if federal oversight is cut back.

The EPA will be accepting public comment on the changes to the WOTUS rule through Jan. 5, 2026. Both Honeycutt and Alsentzer said their groups are encouraging their allies to submit input.

“We're working with our members as well as our national partners to make sure that ranching and the agricultural community is very represented,” said Honeycutt.

“We need to, at minimum, let them know that we care, we're watching and we're upset with the decisions they make,” Alsentzer said. “And then to the extent that they still make a bad decision, then it's incumbent on us to stand up for our rights.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/73f4432/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4240x2226+0+303/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Ff2%2F7a%2Fcb16e1904439b872ce7641d1d02e%2Fdsc03293.JPG,N,,2025-12-07 11:03:19.730899

Expensive natural gas prices hit households with a double whammy Because natural gas is the largest source of U.S. electricity generation, when the fuel gets more expensive, it forces consumers to pay higher electricity bills.
“Natural gas prices tend to be the biggest determinant of power prices,” according to EIA.","When fracking spread across our country in the early 2000s, it ushered in an era of cheap gas and fundamentally changed the American energy landscape. Gas toppled coal to become the dominant source of electricity generation in the country–– and the United States became the world’s largest natural gas producer.

However, we’ve gotten so used to the idea of cheap natural gas that we’re failing to reassess whether that narrative is still true. The data is increasingly telling us it isn’t – we’re now the world’s largest natural gas exporter and natural gas power plants are far more expensive to build – both of which force Americans to pay more for power. That means we risk locking ourselves into expensive decisions with decades-long consequences.

The fracking revolution began nearly 20 years ago—today’s reality is different. If government officials and utility executives still think we’re in the era of cheap natural gas, their decisions will be driven by outdated knowledge, and they won’t be able to fight rising power prices if they invest in the wrong technology.

Natural gas prices face upward pressure on two fronts

Soaring data center electricity demand has sent utilities scrambling to add new sources of electricity to the grid. In places like Virginia, ground-zero for the data center surge and home to roughly 20% of the world’s data centers, the gas industry is shouting from the rooftops that gas is needed to meet this new demand while keeping costs low.

That premise is wrong on multiple levels.

First, it’s essentially impossible to build a new gas-fired power plant by the end of this decade. Gas turbine manufacturers like GE Vernova, Siemens Energy, and Mitsubishi scaled back their production capabilities years ago when new turbine orders were few and far between. As a result, power producers trying to source new turbines face wait times of five to seven years.

Second, much of the workforce that built the surge of gas infrastructure in the 2000s and 2010s has either retired or moved on to other industries, creating a deep workforce shortage. If utilities want to build a new gas plant, it’ll be years before they can get the equipment, and even then, it’s hard to find workers to build it—but we need the power now, not in 2030. That means new gas-fired power plants will be dramatically more expensive this time around.

NextEra CEO John Ketchum says building a new gas-fired power plant today would cost three times as much as the last facility the utility built, back in 2022.

And that’s only half of the equation—once the facility is built, you need fuel to run it. Turns out, that’s drastically more expensive now too.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts natural gas prices will rise 14% in 2026, following a 59% year-over-year increase from 2024 to 2025. EIA attributes rising prices to increased demand stemming from rising liquified natural gas (LNG) exports and flat production capabilities.

“Gas is only going to get more expensive going forward,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program. “You can build more pipelines in Virginia or anywhere else, but that extra natural gas is still going to be competing with folks in Berlin and Beijing for access to the U.S. gas.”

“LNG is tying us more to global markets that pay more than we do for gas,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas, Austin. “That has to put more upward pressure on gas.”

Like any other commodity that’s sold across the world, gas companies seek the highest-priced markets. These companies say American natural gas increases our domestic energy security, but they don’t care about home heating bills, they just want to make the highest possible profit – even if that means selling our gas to countries like China.

And yet, Energy Secretary Chris Wright wants to double LNG exports within five years, and then double them again. LNG exports already increased 25% between 2024 and 2025.

Expensive natural gas prices hit households with a double whammy

Because natural gas is the largest source of U.S. electricity generation, when the fuel gets more expensive, it forces consumers to pay higher electricity bills. In fact, every region of the country has seen electricity prices increase over the last three years.

Wholesale electricity prices spiked 23% in 2025, and EIA predicts they’ll climb another 8.6% in 2026. “Natural gas prices tend to be the biggest determinant of power prices,” according to EIA.

But it’s not just electricity bills that are causing sticker shock—the majority of homes in the U.S. use natural gas to heat them, so as gas prices rise, so too will home heating bills. Indeed, EIA is forecasting that home heating costs will rise next year. Federal Reserve data shows retail gas utility service has risen 11% over the past year, near an all-time high. That means more expensive home heating bills for families this winter, potentially fueling the 8% increase in home heating costs expected this year.

Americans are already struggling to pay their utility bills—1 in 20 households has a utility debt high enough to be sent to a collection agency, and average monthly energy bills have increased 35% since 2022, according to a recent report.

Fortunately, rapidly growing wind, solar, and storage can help keep costs in check and can be deployed quickly to meet growing electricity demand. Wind and solar are the cheapest sources of new electricity, and they’ve gotten exponentially cheaper over the past decade-- 91% of new renewable power projects commissioned last year were more affordable than new fossil fuels, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

And renewables and battery storage are essentially the only new sources of electricity being added to the U.S. grid right now, comprising over 90% of new capacity in 2025 and 2024. The truth is that states with the highest levels of wind and solar generation like Iowa, Oklahoma, and New Mexico have had the lowest utility bill rate increases in America, Energy Innovation research finds.

This project, led by the Australian unit of Chevron, aims to link the offshore Geryon and Eurytion natural gas fields to existing infrastructure on Barrow Island. By enhancing the region’s LNG export capacity, the initiative not only strengthens Chevron’s global portfolio but also promises to bolster the local economy. As the energy landscape evolves, the Gorgon expansion serves as a testament to the ongoing demand for reliable energy sources.

Gorgon Stage 3: A Strategic Expansion

The Gorgon Stage 3 development represents a strategic expansion designed to secure additional natural gas resources for export. With six wells planned across two fields, this phase builds on the existing capabilities of the Gorgon Project. The decision to proceed with this stage underscores the confidence of Chevron and its partners in the viability and potential of the region’s natural gas reserves.

As part of a series of planned subsea tiebacks, the development aims to integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure. This integration is critical as it minimizes the environmental footprint while maximizing output. The project not only targets increased LNG exports but also ensures a steady supply of domestic gas for Western Australia’s households and industries.

Economic and Environmental Implications

Beyond its economic benefits, the Gorgon Stage 3 project carries significant environmental considerations. Chevron’s proposal was accepted by the offshore environmental regulator in November, following a public comment period. This approval indicates that the project meets the necessary environmental standards and regulations, a critical aspect in today’s energy sector.

The development is not only poised to enhance LNG exports but also to secure long-term gas supplies for local consumption. Western Australia’s 15% gas reservation policy ensures that a portion of the gas produced is allocated for domestic use, supporting local energy needs. This policy is crucial for balancing export opportunities with domestic energy security, a growing concern in many regions worldwide.

The high cost of energy has also become a major political issue that is on voters' minds as they head to the election polls.

What's happening?

As ABC News reported, voters in many states have been expressing their frustration after utility rate hikes. The issue has been especially on voters' minds in key battleground states as Democrats and Republicans debate over affordable electricity.

A survey found that 36% of American adults find their electricity bills to be a major source of stress. As an estimated 80 million Americans are struggling to pay their utility bills, Charles Hua from the consumer advocacy organization PowerLines said: ""It's a life or death and 'eat or heat' type decision that people have to make.""

Why are rising energy bills significant?

Increasingly expensive electricity bills are straining Americans' budgets and forcing them to make difficult decisions that affect their safety and comfort. The high cost of electricity is affecting people's health, and experts anticipate these costs will continue to rise as AI data centers expand.

The issue is also impacting politics, as voters demand relief amid unaffordable price hikes. Politicians must rise to the challenge of addressing their constituents' concerns and work to lower energy costs to affordable levels.

What's being done about high energy costs?

Some companies, such as Georgia Power, have proposed spending billions of dollars to expand their power-generating capacity to meet data center demand. There are discussions underway among lawmakers about whether data centers will have to pay their fair share of the power they use or if taxpayers will bear those costs.

CHINESE CLEANTECH INVESTMENT INTO AUSTRALIA HAS COLLAPSED, PUTTING AT RISK THE COUNTRY’S NET ZERO & INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION GOALS

A new report released today by independent think tank Climate Energy Finance (CEF), Rising Tide: China’s Outbound Cleantech Capital Surge Drives Global Collaboration Toward Net Zero, finds that Chinese firms have committed more than US$180bn of outbound foreign direct investment (OFDI) in cleantech since the start of 2023 – up 80% since CEF’s Green Capital Tsunami report a year ago.

China’s investment into cleantech manufacturing and clean energy infrastructure spanned batteries, battery materials, solar PV, wind, EVs, hydro-electricity and green hydrogen industrial precincts in countries as diverse as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Türkiye, Brazil, Hungary, Spain, France, Portugal, Azerbaijan, Zambia, Egypt, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia.

The sheer scale and depth of Chinese cleantech firms’ green energy statecraft push over the last three years is bringing about a profound shift in the global energy, economic and geopolitical landscape, extending China’s leadership and influence as the US withdraws from the net zero playing field since the re-election of President Trump in 2024, and initiates a trade war.

For China and its partners, investment and technology cooperation on green manufacturing and clean energy infrastructure is a win-win-win. It aligns with delivery of host countries’ net zero targets and green industrialisation priorities, with a focus on building domestic capabilities through learning and technology transfer, as China deploys its cleantech capital and overwhelming global decarbonisation leadership as a diplomatic instrument of its green energy statecraft. And a win in relation to climate.

The picture is different in Australia. Caution continues to define the federal government’s approach to Australia's #1 trade partner, maintaining a chilling effect on investment engagement. Chinese OFDI into Australia has collapsed by 85% since 2018, now making up only 1.5% of the total OFDI from all countries, a decline from the already exceptionally weak 1.87% in 2024. 2024 recorded the third lowest value and number of transactions since 2006 at just US$882m, a fraction of the peak of US$16bn in 2008.

Foreign capital, technology and knowhow are key to achievement of Australia’s decarbonisation goals. Around 70% of investment in Australian clean energy projects comes from overseas. The decline in engagement with China’s capital and expertise puts at risk Australia’s net zero and green re-industrialisation ambitions set out in its Future Made in Australia and Net Zero Plans. The report recommends reforms to enable carefully-managed strategic partnership with the world’s cleantech leader to support Australia’s energy transition, competitiveness and long-term prosperity.

Report lead author Caroline Wang, CEF’s China Analyst said:

“As this report shows, a new geoeconomic order is emerging as the primary engine of the energy transition, China, commits multibillions in foreign cleantech capital investment in renewables and green manufacturing projects. This is accelerating economic and technological integration between emerging economies and China across renewables and green industrial ecosystems. South-South cooperation is increasingly diversified and de-risked amid global trade and geopolitical uncertainties, through a mix of cross-border, public-private finance and project partnerships. At the same time, formalised knowledge sharing and capacity building initiatives such as training and R&D partnerships are rising.

In 2025, US tariffs, unilateralism and regression on renewables have further accelerated the shift in the centre of gravity of global commerce towards China and emerging economies, as countries seek to diversify their economic and political partnerships away from an unstable US and achieve their sustainable development goals.

Australia stands at a critical juncture. Chinese investment in Australia remains at historic lows. A multipolar world – no longer centred on the US, Australia’s traditional security ally – necessitates an urgent overhaul of its economic, foreign investment, and foreign policy settings. This means strategically working with China, or being left behind in the new world order. Australia has an opportunity to selectively partner with global Chinese cleantech firms, which bring not only capital, but world-class technology and expertise in areas of Australia’s national priority, particularly the Net Zero plan and Future Made in Australia plans, and to learn from some of the partnerships referenced in this report.

Not engaging with China’s capital and expertise will delay Australia’s net zero transition, putting at risk its decarbonisation goals and future prosperity in a net-zero global economy.”

Tim Buckley, CEF Director and former MD of global investment bank Citigroup said:

“China leads the world in almost all cleantech research, development and deployment. China leads the world in all cleantech manufacturing supply chains. China leads the world in cleantech domestic deployments and cleantech exports. Now, consistent with the Paris Agreement for economically developed countries to help the Global South deploy zero-emissions domestic energy solutions to overcome their addiction to imported fossil fuels, China leads the world in cleantech OFDI.

It is brilliant to record over US$180bn of OFDI from China since the start of 2023, up from US$100bn just one year earlier, as China develops partnerships and manufacturing capacities around the world to leverage their supply chains, technology leadership, capital and EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) capacities to accelerate cleantech deployments globally.”

Dr Muyi Yang, Senior Energy Analyst at global think tank Ember, said:

“China’s cleantech makers are now looking much more to overseas markets, as demand at home stabilises and the global energy transition speeds up. And that’s where the dilemma kicks in. Almost everyone agrees you can’t hit climate goals without working with China. But once cooperation moves to actually making clean products together, worries about over-reliance and ‘de-risking’ suddenly grow louder. The real challenge isn’t to cut China out, it’s to build more diversified, resilient supply chains that still tap into China’s know-how while helping other countries grow their own clean industries. If they don’t, by the time their local industries finally get going, Chinese companies may have already pulled even further ahead.”

Also see commentary from David Olsson AM, National President of the Australia China Business Council in the Foreword:

“Australia has an opportunity to align economic ambition with geopolitical reality. Preserving our security relationship with the United States should not preclude deeper collaboration with China in areas of shared economic and climate interest. A more nuanced and strategic approach to green energy statecraft – one that attracts investment while safeguarding national security – is essential to building economic resilience, securing our sovereign capabilities, and ensuring our competitiveness in a decarbonising world.”

The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy clarified it has not halted lending to renewable energy projects, despite concerns of oversupply in the solar PV module industry. The ministry aims for informed capital deployment, encouraging financing for upstream manufacturing stages rather than just modules. This comes as India nears its non-fossil fuel capacity target.

The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) on Sunday dismissed reports suggesting that it has asked financial institutions to pause fresh lending to renewable energy projects.

The clarification comes amid concerns of oversupply in India’s solar photovoltaic (PV) module industry and follows earlier communication urging lenders to take a cautious view on financing new, standalone module manufacturing capacity.

India has reached 50% of its installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, five years ahead of its Paris Agreement target. As of 31 October 2025, non-fossil capacity stands at about 259 GW, including 31.2 GW added so far in FY26.

The ministry said that there has been “no advisory to Financial Institutions for stopping lending to either renewable energy power projects or to renewable energy equipment manufacturing facilities.”

It further said that the objective is not to halt financing but to ensure informed capital deployment across the solar manufacturing ecosystem.

Live Events

The MNRE confirmed circulating the status of domestic manufacturing capacities to the Department of Financial Services and institutions such as PFC, REC and IREDA. According to the ministry, this information has been shared so that institutions “adopt a calibrated and well-informed approach while evaluating proposals for financing any manufacturing facility in solar PV manufacturing sector and explore and expand their solar PV manufacturing portfolio to upstream stages like solar cells, ingots-wafers and polysilicon as well as solar module ancillaries like solar glass and aluminium frames, etc. as well, rather than being limited to financing solar PV module manufacturing facilities alone.”

The clarification follows media reports stating that rapid expansion of standalone module units, combined with weakening export demand, could push the domestic market into oversupply.

Over the last three years, several Indian companies scaled up module capacity to target the U.S. market. However, higher U.S. tariffs and increased scrutiny of Indian shipments involving China-origin components have curbed exports, contributing to excess capacity in India.

Industry projections indicate module manufacturing capacity could rise to nearly 200 GW in the next few years, while solar cell capacity could grow to 100 GW—well above India’s near-term installation pace. This comes at a time when new solar project execution has slowed due to muted demand.

“The Government of India is committed to make India self-reliant in solar PV manufacturing and establish the country as a major player in the global value chain,” the ministry said.

It noted that solar module manufacturing capacity has expanded from 2.3 GW in 2014 to around 122 GW enlisted in the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers today—reflecting the cumulative efforts of industry, state governments and central initiatives.

The ministry added that it remains committed to further strengthening the solar manufacturing ecosystem through continued policy support, infrastructure development, and innovation,” and will continue working with stakeholders to ensure the sector remains competitive and future-ready.

The deadline has helped drive a big spike in business for solar installers as buyers rush to qualify for the 30% tax credit before it disappears. But California installers said lengthy utility permitting times could imperil customers’ tax credits if their systems aren’t in place by Dec. 31.

“Clients are concerned about potentially missing the tax credit deadline,” Anthony Del Bene, a manager at Berkeley solar installer A1 Sun, said in an email. “We explained that we would do everything possible to meet this timeframe [but] given the delays we’re seeing, I can’t say I feel completely at ease.”

US homeowners already pay more for solar and wait longer for installation than Australians and Europeans due to a byzantine permitting system, which varies from city to city and utility to utility. Now, with the sun setting on the federal tax credit, delays that prevent solar and battery installations until after Dec. 31 could cost homeowners $10,000 more for a typical project.

Emily Walker, director of insights at Boston-based solar marketplace EnergySage, said permitting has been a barrier in the US long before the current solar stampede. “Installers are working around the clock to meet the rush, but most have stopped promising year-end completion due to limited bandwidth and increasingly long and inconsistent permitting timelines,” she said in an email.

A US Internal Revenue Service spokesperson said that to qualify for the tax credit, homeowners need to complete installation of solar and battery systems by Dec. 31. For those installing both, a finished system often must include the attachment of a device called a meter socket adapter to their utility meter to connect solar and battery components without expensive electrical upgrades.

That creates a particular bottleneck in California, the nation’s largest solar market. Nearly 60% of new residential solar installations in the state include batteries compared to 40% nationally, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and utilities typically install the meter socket adapters.

Solar executives said it can then take up to a month or more for utilities to connect an installed system to the power grid, but that’s no longer a requirement to receive the tax credit.

Kevin Luo, policy and market development manager at industry group California Solar & Storage Association, said the race to go solar before the tax credits expire has only exacerbated longstanding permitting delays at two of the state’s big investor-owned utilities, PG&E Corp. and Southern California Edison.

“They had not prepared sufficiently for that even though they knew it was coming,” he said.

Lengthy municipal permitting times are also making it a gamble for homeowners trying to qualify for federal tax credits. “Many jurisdictions take weeks and sometimes months to approve permits for solar and battery systems, and that has caused significant delays in getting systems installed before the end of the year,” said Jake Hassid, managing partner at Northern California installer Simply Solar.

Bill Russell, a manager at solar installer NRG Clean Power in the Los Angeles area, said it’s taking Southern California Edison six to 10 weeks — four times longer than other utilities — to install meter socket adapters, putting customers’ ability to qualify for the 30% tax credit “in serious jeopardy.”

Southern California Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford said the utility has experienced “significant delays” in installing the devices between September and November due to a jump in applications from homeowners as the tax credit deadline approached. The utility is working to “speed up the process, enabling customers to receive their tax credits,” he said.

PG&E spokesperson Mike Gazda said the time to process meter socket adapter applications and install the devices was nine days in October and November, but several installers said they’re experiencing weeks or a month-long delay.

Barry Cinnamon, chief executive officer of Bay Area installer Cinnamon Energy Systems, said he launched a marketing campaign urging potential customers to “hurry up” after the enactment of the Trump administration’s tax bill in July scuttled tax credits and rebates for renewable energy, heat pumps and electric vehicles. That resulted in record sales, and Cinnamon hired more installers to handle the demand.

To avoid waiting for the utility to install meter socket adapters, he switched to a more expensive gadget called a gateway, which performs the same function but can be deployed by the installer. Otherwise, “we're not going to be able to complete the installation in time now because we will have that delay from the utility,” said Cinnamon.

Environmental Service Pros has announced the expansion of its environmental services to include comprehensive mold remediation for residential and commercial properties in the Nashville area. The family-owned company, which previously focused on mold testing and inspections, now offers complete mold removal solutions alongside its existing hazardous material services.

The expansion represents a strategic move to provide clients with end-to-end mold management services. While the company has built its reputation on accurate mold testing and professional inspections, the addition of remediation services allows property owners to address mold issues through a single trusted provider. The new offering complements the company’s established expertise in asbestos removal, lead testing, crawl space encapsulation, and air duct cleaning.

According to Michael McDonnell, the owner of Environmental Service Pros, the decision to add remediation services came from consistent client feedback. “Property owners told us they valued our testing accuracy and wanted us to handle the removal process as well,” McDonnell stated. “This expansion allows us to serve our community more completely.”

The company’s licensed and certified technicians have undergone specialized training in mold remediation protocols to ensure safe and effective removal processes. The expanded mold services address various indoor mold situations, from minor surface growth to more extensive contamination requiring containment and specialized equipment. Each remediation project begins with a thorough assessment to determine the scope of work and appropriate remediation strategy.

Mold growth in homes and businesses can result from various moisture issues, including roof leaks, plumbing problems, high humidity levels, and poor ventilation. Nashville’s climate, with its warm summers and moderate humidity, can create conditions conducive to mold development in buildings. Left unaddressed, mold can compromise indoor air quality and potentially affect building materials. The company’s combined testing and remediation approach provides property owners with a streamlined solution for identifying and resolving mold concerns.

The new remediation services integrate with the company’s existing environmental health offerings. Clients can now access comprehensive solutions for multiple indoor environmental concerns through a single provider familiar with local building characteristics and regional environmental factors. The company’s experience with crawl space encapsulation and air duct cleaning provides relevant expertise for addressing moisture control and ventilation issues that often contribute to mold growth.

Environmental Service Pros maintains proper licensing and certification for all hazardous material services performed. The company’s approach emphasizes precision and care in service delivery, with technicians following established safety protocols for containment, removal, and disposal of contaminated materials. Post-remediation verification ensures that affected areas meet acceptable clearance standards before projects conclude, with detailed documentation provided to property owners for peace of mind and compliance purposes.

The addition of remediation capabilities strengthens the company’s position as a comprehensive environmental services provider for the Nashville market. The family-owned business continues to operate with a focus on creating healthier indoor spaces through professional hazardous material management, while also investing in ongoing training and technology to stay ahead of evolving industry standards and client expectations.

The service expansion reflects growing demand for qualified mold remediation providers in the Tennessee region. By adding this capability to its existing testing and inspection services, Environmental Service Pros now offers property owners complete mold management solutions backed by the company’s established reputation for dependable environmental services, ensuring both immediate results and long-term protection against recurring environmental health risks and structural damage.

Done right, 2025 becomes the pivotal year when the country transitions not just into electric vehicles but, more importantly, into renewable energy sovereignty and advanced manufacturing.

China is broadcasting to the world that long-term industrial success lies in mastering the supply chain ecosystem, especially for core EV components. The path forward for Malaysia is clear: Proton and Perodua must collaborate to create a globally competitive local component industry through cross-company standardization.

Commonisation isn't new to the automotive industry. The Detroit Big Three achieved dominance in the 1950s and 60s on this very premise, derogatorily called ""badge engineering.""

General Motors, once the world's largest and most valuable company, was the most prolific practitioner.

The Japanese and Germans followed suit, with successful platform-sharing within corporate groups like VAG, Toyota Group and Hyundai-Kia.

But here's the problem: this practice remained limited to companies within the same corporate umbrella. Stellantis, Fiat-Chrysler, and the Renault-Nissan Alliance all attempted broader collaboration, but corporate egos prevented true industry-wide commonization.

At the 2015 Detroit Auto Show, former Fiat Chrysler chairman Sergio Marchionne captured the absurdity perfectly: ""Competition and brand-building means that every manufacturer wants to make its own core components, like, say, four-cylinder engines, leading to ruinous overlap. You are talking about hundreds of millions of duplicative and redundant investments that do not bear any benefit for the consumer.""

Yet to this day, car companies pour billions into building nearly identical engines differentiated only by letter acronyms - engines that 90 per cent of consumers couldn't distinguish if their lives depended on it.

This is where China rewrote the playbook. Chinese carmakers can now develop new models in under two years, while traditional brands still need three years or more.

They didn't discover magic - they took commonisation beyond corporate boundaries.

A June 2025 Wards Auto article captured this transformation through Ramiro Gutierrez, president of ZF North America, who described the stark difference:

""The approach of many legacy customers is 'No, I want my steering system, and my braking system, and my suspension system - and they cannot be the same as this other guy's.'

In China, the same systems can be sold to ten automakers because they realise standardisation will get them to market faster, and differentiating those systems provides no added value to the end user.""

The distinction is crucial: while VAG perfected parts-bin sharing within their empire, Chinese manufacturers embraced component sharing across competing companies and even across industries.

When German giants struggled with software, Chinese automakers simply partnered with smartphone and electronics companies who already had the expertise and operating systems ready to deploy.

In China, directly competing companies routinely use identical standardised modules from the same Tier-1 suppliers, creating a powerful ""ecosystem of scale."" This presents a fundamental divergence from the Western model.

Where Western standardisation remains confined to brands under a single corporate umbrella, China's scope spans multiple competing companies. This provides suppliers with aggregated volume from entire industry segments rather than single OEM groups. R&D costs amortise significantly faster when spread across many automakers, freeing companies to focus innovation on user experience, design, and software rather than proprietary engineering of commodity systems.

Consider CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer. Through their ""Choco-SEB"" swappable battery system, five major Chinese automakers including direct competitors like FAW, Changan, and GAC, all use the same standard battery packs.

Similarly, suppliers like Desay SV and iFLYTEK dominate the digital cockpit market by supplying identical domain controller modules and voice interaction systems to competing car brands.

This model delivers tremendous economic advantages: mega-scale production, rapid R&D amortisation, and aggressive reinvestment in innovation.

It creates a virtuous cycle where costs decrease while technology advances, benefiting the entire ecosystem.

The combined production of Proton and Perodua represents a domestic volume of about 420,000 units annually.

While this market size is not in the league of China, it provides the minimum viable scale necessary to attract major Tier-1 foreign investment, establish a high-tech local manufacturing base, and eventually anchor regional exports into Asean.

Both companies have already identified the same three components for localization. Instead of developing proprietary systems separately, a national standardization strategy could catalyze the birth of a local component industry.

First, both companies must agree on one or two standard battery pack formats, focusing on common physical dimensions and connection points.

Capacity (kWh) and chemistry (LFP vs. NMC) can vary, but standard form factors would create predictable demand for suppliers.

Second, they need to establish specifications for motor classes based on dimensions, power output ranges, mounting points, and core architecture requirements suited to the Malaysian market across different size and price segments.

Third, a common Battery Management System (BMS) platform architecture must be developed that suppliers can build upon, ensuring compatibility and economies of scale.

Ideally, these standards should be developed with other industry players beyond Proton and Perodua - but these two national champions must start the ball rolling.

The Government's Critical Role

Government action is absolutely essential to make this happen. The current EV steering committee provides a starting point - invite all industry players to the table and clearly indicate that the future will include national standards for these three key components.

All local assembly programmes must incorporate these local parts. The government must establish clear timelines and consequences: Standards must be established within three years

This will proceed regardless of individual company participation

Strategic incentives (R&D grants, tax breaks, pioneer status) for suppliers committing to produce standard components in Malaysia

Incentives for Proton and Perodua to offset initial risks in adopting common platforms

The government should also leverage diplomatic and trade relationships to attract global Tier-1 suppliers, ensuring investment packages include substantive technology transfer and local vendor development programmes.

A Golden Opportunity

The EV era offers Malaysia a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform from an assembler into a high-tech manufacturer.

Success won't come from going it alone. By emulating China's proven cross-company standardisation model, Proton and Perodua - with strong government support - can create the economies of scale necessary to birth a local EV component champion.

The question isn't whether Malaysia can afford to pursue this strategy. It's wchether we can afford not to.",,N,,2025-12-07 09:00:27.257736

The environmental group filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which last year approved the use of phosphogypsum for the pilot project on Mosaic property.

“Mosaic began construction activities the week of August 25, 2025, and began applying phosphogypsum as road base on October 7, 2025,” the company, which intervened in the case on the side of the EPA, said in Friday’s filing.

“It completed all portions of the road that involved phosphogypsum on November 4, 2025. Although Mosaic is still working to complete some ‘control’ sections of the road, those sections do not use any phosphogypsum — they are constructed from common road materials. Mosaic and University of Florida scientists and engineers will also test and monitor the road base as described in the (EPA) approval.”

Mosaic attorneys added, “This action (lawsuit) is now moot because construction of the phosphogypsum portions of the pilot road project is complete. The court should accordingly dismiss the (Center for Biological Diversity) petition for review.”

The Center for Biological Diversity filed the challenge in February, about two months after the EPA approved the project at Mosaic’s New Wales facility. The issue of using phosphogypsum in road-building has long been controversial, as opponents have pointed to potential cancer risks from the substance, which is typically stored in huge stacks, known as “gypstacks.”

In challenging the project, the Center for Biological Diversity has contended, in part, that a 1992 federal rule bars using phosphogypsum in road projects. It has cited concerns about radon emissions and potential air and groundwater pollution.

The EPA said in a court filing this year that the project was limited to a 3,200-foot road. Mosaic — a major player in the phosphate industry — used phosphogypsum from a stack on the New Wales property for the project, according to a declaration of a company official attached to the company’s filing Friday.

Mosaic and the EPA have disputed the Center for Biological Diversity’s arguments in the case.

“At bottom, EPA approved a site-specific project presenting total risks that are at least an order of magnitude less than placement of phosphogypsum in a stack,” EPA attorneys wrote in a September brief.

Mosaic said in a separate September brief that the Center for Biological Diversity’s “real concern is that the pilot will serve as a gateway to broader beneficial use of phosphogypsum in road base.”

Here's Why This Is A Problem. - The Wire,Aathira Perinchery,,,,,https://m.thewire.in/article/environment/the-aravalli-hills-have-a-new-definition-heres-why-this-is-a-problem,"On November 20, the Supreme Court accepted a new definition of the Aravalli hill ranges that the Union Environment Ministry proposed: that only hills above 100 meters above the local terrain be considered as the ‘Aravalli Hills and Ranges’.
But here’s the problem: by this new definition, at least 90% of the Aravallis will no longer be protected legally.
“The acceptance of the uniform definition of the Aravalli hills by the SC bench is extremely regressive,” Neelam Ahluwalia, Founder Member, People for Aravallis, told The Wire.
After an order by the Supreme Court in May 2024, the Union Environment Ministry had constituted a Committee to develop a uniform definition of the Aravalli hills and ranges.
Trees and their canopy cover in the Aravalli hills preserve humidity in the atmosphere, moderates the wind velocity and helps regulate rainfall patterns, ecologist Pia Sethi said in a statement.","Bengaluru: On Sunday, November 30, a small group of 30-odd citizens including children gathered at the Chakkarpur-Wazirabad eco-restoration corridor in Gurgaon, Delhi, under the Aravalli Bachao citizens collective.

“Do you want to breathe? Do you want to drink water? Then save the Aravallis,” one of the many posters they held up read.

On December 3, Congress leader and chair of the Congress Parliamentary Party Sonia Gandhi cited the example of the Aravallis, detailing why India needed “a new deal for the environment”. “The Modi Government has now nearly signed a death warrant for these hills, already denuded by illegal mining,” she wrote in The Hindu.

On December 5, an online petition initiated by the citizen collectives People For Aravallis and Save Sariska said that the Supreme Court had immersed the ancient hill range into an “existential crisis” after its judgment on November 20. Among the five main demands that the online petition asks citizens to make is that India’s apex court recall its recent judgment – one, that they say, will endanger the Aravallis greatly. The petition, signed by citizen signatories, will be sent to around 30 officials and authorities including the Supreme Court of India.

What is this judgment, how is it endangering the Aravallis now, why are citizens galvanising into action for the hill range, and how bad is this ‘death warrant’ that Gandhi spoke about?

The Wire breaks it down for you.

What are the Aravallis?

The Aravallis are a long stretch of low-and mid-elevation hills (ranging from ) in northwest India.

The hill range contains a diverse variety of habitats. These include dry deciduous forests, such as those found in the Sariska Tiger Reserve which is home to India’s national animal; tropical thorn forests such as those that dominate in the Delhi Ridge right next door to the national capital; and wetlands like the Sambhar Lake near Jaipur, Rajasthan (formed due to a natural depression in the Aravalli hill range), which supports tens of thousands of local and migratory birds.

The Aravallis are also one of the oldest fold-mountain systems of the world: according to some estimates such as this one, it was formed in the Pre-Cambrian era which dates back to about 3-4 billion years ago. This makes it much older than the adjacent Himalayas (though home to the world’s tallest peak, this mountain range is only about 40-50 million years old).

The hill range provides a host of ecosystem services across its 700-km length. These include regulatory services which play a key role in maintaining climate, carbon sequestration, air and water quality, preventing soil erosion and more.

The Aravallis are also home to many sacred groves, or lands protected by local communities for their spiritual and cultural significance. In 2023, for instance, scientists identified a staggering 89 such small and big sacred sites in Udaipur district in the Rajasthan Aravallis alone.

“The Aravalli range, which runs from Gujarat through Rajasthan and till Haryana, has long played a significant role in Indian geography and history,” Gandhi wrote in an article for The Hindu on December 5. “It has served as a barrier to the spread of desertification from the Thar Desert to the Gangetic Plains, guarded Rajasthan's proudest forts such as Chittorgarh and Ranthambore, and served as the cradle of spirituality for communities across northwest India.”

Clearly, the Aravallis are important for not just wildlife and biodiversity, but people too.

A hill range already under threat

The Aravallis face a number of threats. Illegal mining is a prime concern. A book chapter in 2021 identified “illegal and rampant mining”, as well as unorganised urbanisation, over-exploitation of natural resources, introduction and spread of invasive species, disposal of untreated sewage and solid waste and deforestation as major threats.

The Delhi government itself identifies illegal mining, along with the construction of buildings, roads and housing, conversion of forest land into parks (such as this plan by the Haryana government), garbage dumping, and the introduction of invasive species (such as Prosopis juliflora or the vilayati babool tree) as some of the chief threats that the Delhi Ridge (which is part of the Aravallis in the union territory) experiences today.

One of the reasons why mining is such a huge threat across most of the hill range is that there has always been ambiguity in the definition of what constitutes a forest – and is therefore liable to be protected under Indian law – in many parts of the Aravallis. In Haryana for instance, the Aravallis are called gair mumkin pahar (or ‘uncultivable hilly areas’).

However, conservationists have been fighting long battles to ensure that these open forests, hillocks and grasslands are still protected, and illegal mining operations shut down. For instance, in July this year, the district of Nuh in Haryana got a dedicated ‘mining unit’ to prevent illegal mining; the local administration also closed down four roads allegedly constructed by illegal miners in the district and wrongly regularised, The Tribune reported.

Why are citizens demanding its protection now?

On November 20, the Supreme Court accepted a new definition of the Aravalli hill ranges that the Union Environment Ministry proposed: that only hills above 100 meters above the local terrain be considered as the ‘Aravalli Hills and Ranges’.

“Those hills and ranges comprising rocks of the Aravalli Supergroup and Delhi Supergroup, which originated during the Palacoproerozoid to Mesoproterozoic, having a relief higher than 100 meters (+5 Meters) above the surrounding terrain, may be defined as 'Aravalli Hills and Ranges’,” the court order read.

The new definition treats a landform as part of the Aravalli landscape only if it has at least 100 metres of elevation above the local relief (including the landform’s slopes and adjacent areas), the Jhatkaa signature petition that went online on December 5 noted. This is highly unusual: the elevations of physical and geographical features are usually expressed in metres above mean sea level – and are not dependent on the terrain around them. However, the report of the committee that looked into this that was accessed by The Wire justified this by noting that the use of elevation alone as a “sole criterion cannot suffice the purpose as taking the average elevation for defining Aravalli Hills and Ranges will lead to inclusion and exclusion error for selection of Aravalli Hills and Ranges in the four States”.

But here’s the problem: by this new definition, at least 90% of the Aravallis will no longer be protected legally.

According to a report by the Indian Express, internal documents of the Forest Survey of India (FSI) showed that only 1,048 of 12,081 Aravalli Hills 20 metres or higher and spread across 15 districts in Rajasthan, are 100 metres or more in height. This means that just about 8.7% of the Aravallis in Rajasthan will be protected by this definition. Rajasthan has the highest area under the Aravallis across all states. The news report also quoted an official of the Union Environment ministry as saying that the FSI had cautioned that the 100 metre cut-off “would protect only a few guard posts while surrendering the fences below”. Losing lower hills will likely expose vast areas to sand and dust particles blowing from the Thar desert to the Indo-Gangetic plains and endanger the livelihood of farmers and health of people, including those living in Delhi-NCR, the Indian Express quoted the unnamed official as saying.

“The acceptance of the uniform definition of the Aravalli hills by the SC bench is extremely regressive,” Neelam Ahluwalia, Founder Member, People for Aravallis, told The Wire.

“How can a 3 billion-year-old ecosystem which is India’s ecological, geological and cultural heritage be so narrowly defined to facilitate mining and commercial exploitation? India’s oldest mountain range is bleeding as a result of licensed and illegal mining and real estate development with hill after hill across Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat being razed to the ground. Aravallis require strict protection, not illogical and senseless definitions to exclude the majority of the areas from legal protection,” she said.

National security cited again

The new definition of the Aravallis has been adopted to enable mining in the area for reasons including “national security”, documents show.

After an order by the Supreme Court in May 2024, the Union Environment Ministry had constituted a Committee to develop a uniform definition of the Aravalli hills and ranges. While the Committee, after several meetings, agreed that “the presence of vegetation over the Aravalli slopes acts as a value-added protective layer”, arrests soil erosion, regulates local microclimate, and preserves biodiversity. The Committee also added that the hill range contains “precious and strategic minerals” such as gold, tungsten and lead. This offers “substantial potential for future exploration”, an additional affidavit on behalf of the Union Environment Ministry said.

The hills also contain “significant potential” for critical minerals such as graphite, lithium and other rare earth elements – “all of which are of growing strategic relevance for energy transition, high-technology manufacturing, and national security”.

“In this context, the Committee was of the considered opinion that while the ecological and environmental integrity of the Aravalli Hills and Ranges must remain the foremost priority, it is equally necessary to evolve framework that enables systematic, scientific, and environmentally sustainable exploitation of critical, strategic, and atomic minerals located within the region. Such a balanced approach would ensure that the country's strategic and developmental interests are not compromised, while upholding the objectives of conservation and ecological restoration.”

This is yet another instance wherein the Union Environment Ministry has cited national security and strategic interests to accelerate developmental activities. The ministry has used this very argument in the case of the slew of infrastructure projects planned in the Great Nicobar island in the Andaman and Nicobar island complex against which several sections of society including ecologists and activists have raised numerous concerns about.

A death knell for the Aravallis

The new re-definition of the Aravallis is disastrous for the hill range chiefly because of the impacts on people, biodiversity and the ecosystem due to the opening of vast tracts of the Aravallis to mining, environmentalists have said.

Even with existing levels of mining which is already “extensive”, all that local villagers are left with are just “bare hills, dust, rubble and diseases,” said activist Kailash Mina who has been leading grassroot struggles against illegal mining in the Aravallis.

“The uniform definition of the Aravalli hills accepted by the Supreme Court will lead to more destruction in the range and more negative impact on the communities dependent on the Aravallis for their sustenance. Agricultural productivity which has declined across the Aravalli belt in South Haryana and Rajasthan as a result of unavailability of water due to excessive mining and with a layer of dust from the stone crushers covering the crops will be more negatively impacted with more than 90% of the hills across the range not qualifying as Aravalli hills and being opened up for mining,” he added.

The mining that ensues will also have ramifications for human health – not just for local communities living in the vicinity and within the hill range, but even for people living in urban areas including the national capital of New Delhi. Mining in the Aravallis will release more dust and pollution into the air, and this will worsen the already poor air quality in the national capital because Delhi sits right on the edge of the hill range.

Medical practitioners have already noted how the current air quality in Delhi is disastrous for health, even affecting children negatively.

“How can we destroy more than 90% of [the Aravallis], with just one stroke? As a doctor I see more and more patients who are suffering the consequences of living in high levels of pollution,” Dr. Sharda Yadav, a medical doctor and resident of Gurgaon who participated in the Aravalli Bachao protest on November 30, said.

Yadav, who specialises in dental surgery, told The Wire that she now sees higher incidences of patients coming in with respiratory issues such as asthma and bronchitis as part of their broader, medical systemic history.

“Allergic elements present in polluted air cause coughing, sneezing and suffocation leading to mouth breathing. Chronic mouth breathing can lead to a variety of dental problems, including bad breath, gum disease and tooth decay primarily because it causes a dry mouth and affects oral hygiene,” Yadav said.

Ecological and environmental impacts

The Aravallis are already witnessing degradation due to mining, encroachment and urbanisation.

“Losing more hills and forests to mining will shrink habitat of wildlife and increase man-animal conflict; intensify desertification; worsen dust pollution, water scarcity and extreme weather events; negatively impact food and water security for millions of people living in North West India,” Ahluwalia told The Wire.

Trees and their canopy cover in the Aravalli hills preserve humidity in the atmosphere, moderates the wind velocity and helps regulate rainfall patterns, ecologist Pia Sethi said in a statement.

“The loss of vegetation cover with the opening up of smaller Aravalli hills for mining as they are not considered as Aravallis anymore can impact local rainfall patterns and temperature, leading to increased heat stress throughout the Aravalli belt in North West India,” she commented.

Groundwater recharge will also be affected, said water conservationist Rajendra Singh, famously called “The Waterman of India”. The Magsaysay award winner stressed that many districts in the Aravallis are already highly water-stressed.

“The Aravalli region acts as a critical water recharge zone,” he said. “The highly fractured and weathered rocks with their natural cracks allow water to percolate and recharge the groundwater. Calculations reveal an immense potential of 2 million litres of ground water recharge per hectare of the Aravalli landscape. Aquifers lying beneath the Aravallis are interconnected and any disturbance or alterations in the pattern due to breaking of hills due to mining can significantly alter the groundwater table and its purity.”

'Scrap definition, recall judgment'

The letter put together by the People For Aravallis and Save Sariska which is to be sent to 30 officials and government authorities including the Supreme Court demands that the government scrap the new, uniform definition of the Aravallis.

It also demands that the Supreme Court order dated November 20 that accepts this new definition of the Aravallis be recalled, “as the decision risks irreversible damage to North West India’s only barrier against desertification, critical water recharge zones, pollution sinks, wildlife habitats and public health”.

It urges the government to declare the Aravallis across Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi as a ‘Critical Ecological Zone’ because of the suite of crucial ecosystem services that the range provides for millions of people living in northwest India.

Another demand is that all mining and stone crushing activities near human habitation, agricultural fields, water bodies, wildlife sensitive zones in the Aravallis be stopped, and alternative building materials be developed so that mining is no longer a threat for the hill range.",https://m.thewire.in/sortd-service/imaginary/v22-01/jpg/large/high?url=dGhld2lyZS1pbi1wcm9kLXNvcnRkL21lZGlhZjcwNTlmZjAtZDMyZi0xMWYwLWE1ZjMtZTU1ZmUzOTdjMGFmLmpwZw==,N,,2025-12-07 11:03:15.114373

Reporting supported with a grant from The Water Desk at the University of Colorado Boulder.

NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico—Silvia Fernández Gallardo Boone leaned over a stream of water rushing through a concrete chute at the city’s wastewater treatment plant.

“Smell it!” she said, beaming.

Odorless, treated wastewater flowed into the Coyote Arroyo, or creek, then the Rio Grande. Mere months earlier, more than 12 million gallons of raw sewage were leaking every day into the river and groundwater in Nuevo Laredo. After repairs to the treatment plant, to Fernández Gallardo’s delight, the flow of untreated wastewater has been significantly reduced.

“Being on the border, we really live our lives on both sides of the river,” Fernández Gallardo said, looking out at the treatment plant. “We all have a stake in taking care of the river.”

When Carmen Lilia Canturosas was elected mayor of Nuevo Laredo in 2021, deferred maintenance had debilitated the plant. To make matters worse, broken sewer lines were leaking wastewater onto city streets. Canturosas, re-elected in 2024, threw her support behind overhauling Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater and sewer system.

Fernández Gallardo, an architect by training, was appointed general manager of the Potable Water and Sanitation Commission (Comisión de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado), known by its Spanish acronym COMAPA. In 2023, COMAPA broke ground on an $80 million project, backed by U.S. and Mexican institutions, to repair the failing wastewater treatment plant and damaged sewer lines. The North American Development Bank (NADBank) issued the largest grant for wastewater improvements in its 30-year history.

Shared waterways like the Rio Grande have been sites of cooperation between the two countries, but also points of contention. Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater overhaul is the latest bet that the U.S. and Mexico can work together to improve water quality and the environment.

But the project is reaching fruition as tensions mount between the U.S. and Mexico under the second Trump presidency. Mexico once again has fallen short on its treaty commitment to share Rio Grande water with the United States. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariff demands have cast a shadow over trade hubs like Laredo-Nuevo Laredo.

Far from the policy disputes of Washington, D.C., officials like Fernández Gallardo are still counting on binational collaboration to yield tangible benefits for local residents.

“Rehabilitating the Rio Bravo doesn’t just mean improving local environmental conditions,” she wrote in a statement to Inside Climate News, using the Mexican name for the river. “It also represents an opportunity to move toward shared water security between Mexico and the United States.”

Monitoring Water Quality

The day before Fernández Gallardo toured the plant, Martin Castro and Tom Vaughan were on the other side of the border, knee deep in the Rio Grande. Four Border Patrol officers peered out from an outcropping above the river and asked what they were doing.

Castro, watershed science director at the Rio Grande International Study Center, and Vaughan, a center co-founder and emeritus biology professor at Texas A&M International University in Laredo, calmly explained that they were taking water quality samples. A few minutes later, the officers left.

The pair were collecting samples to contribute to an extensive database on the river’s water quality, as they do every month.

On that late October day, Border Patrol and National Guard troops far outnumbered fishermen and other recreational visitors to the Rio Grande. It’s not only the law enforcement presence that makes environmental protection on the Rio Grande unique.

As an international river, the Rio Grande was initially excluded from the Texas Clean Rivers Program. The collaborative effort monitors and protects the state’s water resources. Vaughan was among those who advocated in the 1990s for the Rio Grande to be included.

The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), a federal agency that enforces the border and water agreements, eventually took over water quality monitoring on the river. IBWC data from the Rio Grande now feeds into the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Clean Rivers Program.

For more than 1,200 miles, the Rio Grande snakes between Texas and Mexico, crossing remote deserts and urban areas before reaching its delta at the Gulf of Mexico. IBWC partners with organizations like the Rio Grande study center to collect water samples at 119 stations. Monitoring at eight stations in El Paso was suspended in 2023 because of border security installations. IBWC spokesperson Frank Fisher said sampling has been re-established at all but three sites.

Castro and Vaughan collected samples to send to a certified laboratory. They record other measurements themselves, such as turbidity using a Secchi disk.

“Upriver, I would swim in it,” Vaughan said, referring to the Rio Grande upstream of the bend in the river that wraps around Laredo. “If I was really thirsty, I might drink it.”

But he explained that sewage downstream of the city makes the water unsafe for swimming or other contact recreation. This part of the Rio Grande below the Amistad Reservoir, known as segment 2304, exceeds Texas standards for bacteria.

In this stretch of the river, the highest readings for E. coli, the indicator for bacteria, are downstream of Laredo and the wastewater discharges from Nuevo Laredo, according to IBWC’s 2024 Rio Grande summary report. At the Pipeline Crossing and El Cenizo sites, E. coli readings were 240,000 parts per 100 milliliters. That is nearly 2,000 times the state’s water quality standard of 126 parts.

The IBWC report warns of “serious health risks” and that the water is unsuitable for recreational activities or consumption. The report attributes the high bacteria levels to wastewater infrastructure allowing sewage to enter the river.

IBWC’s Fisher said bacteria levels are elevated in other parts of the river including in the urban areas of El Paso/Ciudad Juárez, Del Rio/Ciudad Acuña, Eagle Pass/Piedras Negras, and in Hidalgo County.

“TCEQ is committed to advancing collaboration among federal, state, and binational partners to improve water quality and resilience in the border region,” said Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesperson Victoria Cann.

Cann referenced the Lower Rio Grande Water Quality Initiative as one example of the agency’s efforts to improve water management. The initiative aims to “restore, protect and improve” water quality on the Lower Rio Grande downstream of Falcon Reservoir. The group recently completed an 18-month binational salinity study, according to Cann.

Cleaning Up the Rio Grande

It’s one thing to collect data on the river’s water quality. It’s another to act on that data. For decades, the U.S. and Mexico have debated how to improve the environment and sanitation along their nearly 2,000-mile border.

The 1944 water treaty between the two countries entrusted border sanitation issues to the IBWC. As new problems cropped up—like sewage flowing downhill from Mexico into the U.S.— new agreements, known as minutes, were added to the treaty. In 1989, the U.S. and Mexico partnered to build a wastewater treatment plant in Nuevo Laredo.

After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was adopted in 1994, Nuevo Laredo and other border cities grew rapidly. Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater treatment plant opened in 1996. Binational wastewater treatment plants were also built in Tijuana, Baja California and Nogales, Arizona.

In a side agreement to NAFTA, the two countries created the NADBank, a binational development bank to fund infrastructure on the border.

Nuevo Laredo’s population has almost doubled since 1994, to nearly half a million people. Laredo, with about 260,000 people, is now the busiest land port for international trade in the United States.

But ongoing maintenance of wastewater infrastructure became a sticking point. By the time NAFTA was renegotiated in 2020—and renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement—border wastewater treatment plants were in urgent need of repairs. Sewage flowing from Tijuana into Southern California became an international dispute.

Colorado State University emeritus political scientist Stephen Mumme, an expert on U.S.-Mexico relations, partially attributes maintenance problems to the “constant churn” in Mexican politics, in which local administrations change every three years.

Mexican cities also struggle to finance long-term infrastructure projects and collect monthly bills from ratepayers. Sanitation competes with other urgent public works in border cities buckling under rapid growth.

“The capacity to engage in the type of financing and planning that is often taken for granted in American cities is not yet fully realized in Mexican cities, even in border cities,” Mumme said.

Jesús Frausto Ortega, coordinator of the water management graduate program at Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Monterrey, Mexico, said that previous efforts to stop the flow of sewage in Nuevo Laredo were like paving over a pothole.

“You could fix one part, but there was no holistic solution,” said Frausto Ortega, who previously worked in Nuevo Laredo.

He said Mexican cities often lack political will to invest in sanitation infrastructure.

“Traditionally, officials don’t invest in projects that are underground,” he said. “[That’s because] the public doesn’t see the project and we don’t have reliable accountability mechanisms.”

COMAPA’s Fernández Gallardo said she heard this sentiment from other public officials.

“Why would you want to invest in sewer lines?” she remembers them asking. “That’s like burying money.”

Binational Investment

Fernández Gallardo and Canturosas, the mayor, persisted. They found support among U.S. officials, including then U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar and then IBWC Commissioner Maria-Elena Giner. NADBank provided an initial $650,000 grant to develop plans for the wastewater treatment plant and collapsed sewer lines.

Support started to pour in. NADBank committed $22 million from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Border Environment Infrastructure Fund. Mexican agencies, including COMAPA, committed another $53 million. The IBWC pitched in $2 million, and a commercial loan of $6 million rounded out the budget.

IBWC’s Fisher said the agency’s contribution came “as part of a long-standing practice to share the cost of extraordinary maintenance.” He said the funds were used to purchase six aerators needed for the biological process at the plant.

NADBank Managing Director John Beckham said that the significant commitments from both countries set the effort apart.

“Those are unique features of this project that are replicable,” he said. “We’re proud of it. We think it’s something that can help us in other parts of the river.”

Fernández Gallardo estimated in late October that the wastewater treatment plant’s rehabilitation was 80 percent complete. She said that sewage was still being discharged at 10 locations in the city, down from 27.

“You’re investing in a public good,” she said. “These are projects that you don’t see, but you feel the difference in the city.”

Fernández Gallardo acknowledged that COMAPA must prevent deferred maintenance from once again hobbling the plant. She said that going forward, 4 percent of funds from water bills will be designated for maintenance.

“[We have to] ensure that these plants can be maintained over time …,” Beckham said. “To avoid cycles of every 25 years where we have to lay out $80 million.”

Martin Castro of the Rio Grande International Study Center said the upgrades are a “meaningful milestone.”

“They underscore how urgently the river needs sustained infrastructure investment,” he said. “Continued investment and binational cooperation are essential to protect water quality for both communities.”

A Changing Political—and Environmental—Climate

While Nuevo Laredo is making strides, extreme drought and climate change are testing the fragile balance on the binational river. The Rio Grande provides drinking water for over 6 million people in the United States and Mexico. Farmers from Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico rely on it to irrigate their crops.

But experts warn that current water consumption levels cannot be sustained. The Amistad Reservoir, upstream of Laredo, hit historic lows during July 2024. Climate change will further reduce the river’s flow.

A November 2025 study led by the World Wildlife Fund found that 52 percent of water consumption in the Rio Grande Basin is unsustainable, causing depletion of reservoirs, aquifers and river flows. American Rivers named the Lower Rio Grande the fifth most endangered river in the United States this year.

The Rio Grande is the only source of water for Nuevo Laredo and Laredo. But sometimes the river drops so low that the pumps at the water treatment plant struggle to draw in water, Fernández Gallardo said. She touted COMAPA’s purple pipe program, which diverts treated wastewater for outdoor irrigation and industrial use, but said more must be done to conserve and re-use water.

“Without the river, we don’t have the two Laredos,” she said.

Fernández Gallardo said she would like Nuevo Laredo to directly re-use treated wastewater for domestic supply, known as direct potable reuse.

“Treated wastewater is the only water resource whose supply will always go up as the population increases,” she wrote in a statement. “[Direct reuse] would redefine the future of water on the border.”

Another Rio Grande city, El Paso, is rolling out this technology. But Fernández Gallardo knows the municipal administration’s time to execute projects is running out.

Escalating tensions between the United States and Mexico are felt locally. While Mexico increased Rio Grande water deliveries to the United States in the past year, the Trump administration has threatened Mexico with additional tariffs and even sanctions if the nation does not deliver more to Texas. Meanwhile, Mexican officials have attributed the shortfall to the ongoing drought.

The Trump administration quickly replaced several of the U.S. officials essential to the Nuevo Laredo project, including Salazar, the ambassador, and Giner, the well-liked IBWC commissioner.

The Trump administration is also moving forward with plans for a border wall through Laredo, which local organizations, including the Rio Grande International Study Center, oppose.

Water quality woes on the Rio Grande have attracted little national attention. But EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has pressured Mexico to stop the sewage flows from Tijuana. The EPA has struck agreements with Mexico to accelerate the timeline to repair the Tijuana treatment plant.

A State Department spokesperson said that the U.S. and Mexico have “launched a new era of cooperation characterized by swift and decisive actions.”

“No other bilateral relationship has a greater effect on the daily lives of the American people and President Trump and his cabinet are committed to improving the welfare, health, and prosperity of our border communities,” the spokesperson said.

The EPA also funds NADBank’s grants for wastewater infrastructure on the border. Congress has not passed a full federal budget for 2026. Nonetheless, the spending bills for environment and natural resource agencies that passed through committee maintained support for the EPA’s border wastewater programs. The Senate bill would appropriate $36 million and the House bill $45 million for border wastewater projects, comparable to recent years.

CSU’s Mumme said that the Trump administration’s increasing hostility toward Mexico could backfire.

“Trump is used to bullying his way. But that only goes so far,” he said. “Mexico does have leverage.”

Mumme said the history of cooperation shows that the U.S. and Mexico can achieve common goals, on issues from wastewater to water scarcity.

“There’s no substitute to cooperating and finding mutually beneficial solutions,” he said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rio-Grande-3w.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 06:00:05.798831

Under the plan, New Jersey is betting heavily on utility-scale solar and battery storage.
Offshore wind “was a big piece of trying to get to 100 percent clean electricity by 2035,” Felder said.

Potosnak’s group is backing a lame-duck bill that would incorporate the state’s 2035 goal of 100 percent clean energy—currently in place from a 2023 Murphy executive order—into state law.","In the waning days of Governor Phil Murphy’s tenure, state officials unveiled an updated Energy Master Plan that calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 and steep reductions in climate pollution by midcentury. Since 2019, the state has used the first version of the plan as the backbone of its climate strategy, promising reliable, affordable and clean power.

The blueprint lands at a moment when delivering on all three goals is increasingly in doubt.

While a second Trump administration rolls back federal clean-energy support, PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator that serves New Jersey and a dozen other states, struggles to manage surging electricity demand from artificial-intelligence data centers.

“The Energy Master Plan is a statutorily required report to chart out New Jersey’s energy future,” said Eric Miller, who leads the Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy. While not binding, it is the state’s official roadmap to attain its climate goals.

Miller’s office and the state Board of Public Utilities developed the plan with public input and help from outside consultants.

Under the plan, New Jersey is betting heavily on utility-scale solar and battery storage. State modeling envisions total solar capacity climbing to about 22 gigawatts by 2050 which is four times today’s roughly 5 gigawatts of installed solar. On paper, it would be enough to supply nearly all of the state’s current households over a year. To get there, the plan assumes adding about 750 megawatts of new solar each year from 2026, roughly double the pace of solar construction in 2024.

The plan’s release follows a governor’s race in which energy costs dominated, and voters chose U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat who campaigned on preserving Murphy-era climate targets, over Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican who argued for a slower transition.

“Voters sent a clear message that clean energy is the most cost-effective path forward and the smartest long-term investment,” said Ed Potosnak, head of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters and a local council member in Franklin Township.

A Grid Tested By Data Centers

The plan lands as New Jersey enters what Miller calls the “load growth era.”

For roughly two decades, electricity demand in PJM’s footprint, which stretches from New Jersey to Illinois, was flat or falling as aging power plants retired and efficiency improved. That trend has flipped because of data centers.

“What we saw in 2024 into ’25, and I think what we’re going to see for the next 15 years, is a scenario where demand on the electric grid is growing,” Miller said.

For years, New Jersey spent billions subsidizing hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles and thousands of buildings to electrify. Now, Miller said, “some of the techniques for greenhouse gas reductions are going to have to kind of meet the moment,” by taking a more proactive role in engaging with PJM, or by filling in the dearth in clean energy incentives caused by the Trump administration.

The recent PJM capacity auctions have added billions of dollars in costs for customers across the region. This showed up as a 20 percent jump in summer electricity bills in New Jersey this year, which became a hot campaign issue during its recent gubernatorial race.

“The wholesale price of electricity is determined by PJM and federal policy, and then also the price of natural gas,” said Frank Felder, an energy economist who has advised regulators. “New Jersey can’t do much about that.”

Participating in a fast-track rulemaking process that PJM initiated to address data center-driven demand, outgoing governor Murphy joined other governors in proposing that data center developers bring their own power generators in exchange for quicker permit processing.

PJM seeks to decide which proposals to pursue this month and file them with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by the end of the year.

Federal Headwinds and Stalled Offshore Wind

Layered on top of PJM’s turmoil are decisions coming from Washington.

Experts repeatedly pointed to President Trump’s second-term moves to strip away clean-energy tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and to impose new tariffs on imported solar panels and wind equipment. They say those steps have raised costs and driven off developers.

Potosnak called it “Trump’s clean energy ban” and said the administration’s opposition to offshore wind “derailed the best chance we had to get massive amounts of offshore wind going that would have begun lowering our utility rates this year.” Several major Atlantic projects, including those planned off New Jersey’s coast, have been canceled or delayed.

Offshore wind “was a big piece of trying to get to 100 percent clean electricity by 2035,” Felder said. With new contracts unlikely for several years, he warned New Jersey could be “back at basically square one” by the end of the decade.

Even so, Felder and others urged caution against writing off renewables entirely. Robert Mieth, a Rutgers University researcher who studies power systems, noted that offshore wind is well established in Europe and that, with or without U.S. manufacturing, “there will be access to competitive and affordable renewable technology from other countries.”

In the meantime, state officials point to progress in areas they can influence more directly.

Miller noted that New Jersey has gone from roughly 20,000 plug-in vehicles in 2018 to about 270,000 today, after lawmakers set clear targets and funded incentives and chargers.

The state’s “nation-leading solar program,” he said, is “primarily state-incentivized, primarily state-funded,” and can keep expanding—albeit slower now—even as federal tax credits expire.

“The cheapest energy is the energy you don’t have to make,” Potosnak said, citing efficiency programs, rooftop and warehouse solar and batteries on parking lots that “drive down utility costs for families and businesses” while cutting pollution.

A Guide, Not a Mandate

For all its detail, the Energy Master Plan is not binding.

“The Energy Master Plan does not have the force of law,” Miller said. It has been “very informative,” he added, but “it is not a legal requirement that we follow it exactly.”

Gov.-elect Sherrill will determine how closely New Jersey hews to the map. Neither she nor her opponent had any role in shaping the modeling, Miller said, and the plan was not written with a particular “political future” in mind. Instead, Miller said, the Murphy administration hopes the incoming governor will treat it as “a very useful modeling exercise” or a guide.

Advocates are already trying to lock some of those targets into a statute. Potosnak’s group is backing a lame-duck bill that would incorporate the state’s 2035 goal of 100 percent clean energy—currently in place from a 2023 Murphy executive order—into state law.

If it passes, he said, it would give residents and environmental groups the right to sue if future administrations fall short and send a signal to investors that New Jersey’s direction will not change with every election.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2150017008.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 06:00:23.504659

Then there’s the EV charging network — or, more accurately, the charging network we were promised.
For future EV buyers, the rollback removes one of the biggest forces pushing automakers to build affordable electric models.
Here in Connecticut, where we import every gallon of fuel we burn, a slowdown in EV adoption is more than an environmental setback.
You may find new gas-powered cars will be cheaper, but the cost of driving them will go up in (exhaust) smoke.","Don’t look now, but the Trump White House is changing the cost of your driving commute.

Maybe you missed this news, perhaps disturbed (yet unsurprised) by our President’s daily tirades… attacking Somalis as “garbage” one day, pardoning a convicted drug smuggler the next or his continued threats of invading Venezuela. How easily we miss the closer-to-home news by getting distracted by these “bright, shiny objects.”

We all know that Connecticut drivers must cope with some of the highest gas prices, longest commutes, and oldest highways in the Northeast. Now Washington has decided to dramatically weaken fuel-economy standards for new cars, cutting the 2031 target from roughly 50 mpg to about 34. This threatens to make things worse for everyone, especially current and future electric-vehicle owners.

On the surface, the rollback is pitched by the White House as a win for “affordable cars,” claiming that these relaxed miles-per-gallon rules will shave maybe $900 off the cost of a new gas-powered SUV. But for Connecticut commuters who routinely log 12,000–15,000 miles a year, those savings will evaporate quickly: cars that burn more fuel cost more to operate, and in a pricey state like ours, the pump always gets paid.

But the bigger, less obvious impact of the mileage rules will be on electric-vehicle drivers– the very people who bought into the promise of lower operating costs, cleaner air, and a modernized transportation system.

According to the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles, there are 2.7 million cars and trucks in our small state. But only about 60,000 of them are EVs.

For those current EV owners, the MPG rollback creates more uncertainty… beyond just finding a charging station. EV resale values depend on strong future demand. So when Washington signals that gasoline-powered cars will stay dominant longer, that EV market may sputter. Fewer people will shop for EVs, fewer choose them, and used EV prices will likely soften.

Federal tax incentives (up to $7,500) for new EV buyers already expired this fall but some Connecticut rebates continue… for now.

Then there’s the EV charging network — or, more accurately, the charging network we were promised. Federal programs launched with great fanfare in 2021 pledged 500,000 publicly available chargers nationwide. But fewer than 400 federally funded chargers have actually been built under the $7.5 billion program.

In Connecticut, fast-charging deserts for thirsty EVs persist across Litchfield County, the Quiet Corner, and shoreline towns east of New Haven. Even Fairfield County’s charging stations, while more plentiful, are frequently congested or out of service.

For future EV buyers, the rollback removes one of the biggest forces pushing automakers to build affordable electric models. Without strict fuel-economy rules, carmakers can meet federal requirements by selling profitable gas-powered SUVs rather than investing in lower-cost EVs that would appeal to everyday drivers. The result? Slower arrival of mid-priced EVs, the very models that would make ‘going electric’ a realistic choice for middle-class families in these tight times.

Remember four years ago when Elon Musk promised us a Tesla for $25,000? In fact the new entry-level models now cost about $37,000 or more.

Here in Connecticut, where we import every gallon of fuel we burn, a slowdown in EV adoption is more than an environmental setback. It’s an economic one. More money will leave the state for out-of-region fuel suppliers. And an unreliable, underbuilt charging network threatens to stall our transportation future.

The real bottom line? You may find new gas-powered cars will be cheaper, but the cost of driving them will go up in (exhaust) smoke.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tesla-charging.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 08:59:32.332482

However, MNRE has circulated to the Department of Financial Services and NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) like PFC, REC and IREDA, the status of present installed domestic manufacturing capacities across various sectors of solar PV manufacturing, including solar modules and upstream stages like solar cells, ingots-wafers, polysilicon, as well as ancillary equipment like solar glass and aluminium frames.

This commitment is supported through a comprehensive set of initiatives, including the PLI Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules and measures to provide a level playing field for the Indian manufacturers. The catalytic effect of these interventions has resulted in an expansion in solar module manufacturing capacity, from just 2.3 GW in 2014 to around 122 GW enlisted in MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) today.

This expansion underscores the success of India's solar PV manufacturing story through the collective efforts of the industry, various state governments and the Government of India, while also reinforcing India’s commitment to achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and contributing meaningfully to global decarbonization efforts. MNRE remains committed to further strengthening the solar manufacturing ecosystem through continued policy support, infrastructure development, and innovation. The Ministry will continue engaging with stakeholders to ensure India’s solar journey remains inclusive, competitive, and future-ready, the official statement said.

India has already achieved 50 per cent of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement.

We had coal as the largest source of energy for several decades, probably through World War II.
Today, oil and natural gas are about 72 percent of total U.S. primary energy, the highest percentage ever.
But in rich countries that have built infrastructure, natural gas has displaced coal as the biggest source of electricity.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright spoke to the National Petroleum Council on Dec. 3 at its presentation of two studies offering solutions for increasing energy production and electricity reliability. These are excerpts from his remarks:

I always say to people — I can say without a doubt — energy is the most important industry in the world by far, because every other industry wouldn’t be remotely close to what it is today without energy. Affordable, reliable, secure energy literally makes the world go ’round, allowing us to live long, healthy, opportunity-rich lives.

So, I’ve been frustrated most of my career to see politics — and not just looking at math and numbers — seep into energy, leading to tremendous destruction to the quality of life.

We spent 25 years not growing our electricity production very much, maybe 1 percent a year. Does that sound American? One percent a year growth in energy and electricity? And it’s electricity that’s going to drive artificial intelligence. Americans are frustrated with the rise in electricity prices. They went up a lot, but they shouldn’t have.

We have an increase in electricity prices because of political decisions, policy decisions. It was a choice, not an unfortunate event or scarcity problem. Political choices drove the price of electricity up.

Wood was the biggest source of energy on the planet throughout all of human history, until about 1900. We had coal as the largest source of energy for several decades, probably through World War II. And then coal was passed by oil, and oil has been the largest source of energy in the United States — and globally — for many decades.

Today, oil and natural gas are about 72 percent of total U.S. primary energy, the highest percentage ever. And yet nobody wants to go study petroleum engineering because they’re going away, ‘they’re going out of business.’

I’m like, ‘They’re at a record high in quantity and in market share, and both are growing. So maybe they’re not going away.’

The National Petroleum Council matters. Oil and natural gas, together with coal, are what power the world.

I love coal. It’s the largest source of global electricity since we started collecting data around 1900.

But in rich countries that have built infrastructure, natural gas has displaced coal as the biggest source of electricity. So oil and natural gas — the petroleum industry — matters massively. We need it to build smart infrastructure and have smart policies and deliver these products as efficiently as you can, which impacts the economic opportunities for Americans.

We got into some ruts by not having open, honest conversations about environmental issues in oil and gas and infrastructure.

My goal, the Trump administration’s goal, is to be open, transparent and discuss all of these trade-offs. To discuss these things so we can have a more rational view.

We don’t want to deindustrialize the United States. We don’t want AI, like the other energy-intensive industries, to go overseas. We don’t want to keep exporting job opportunities for Americans. We actually want to grow opportunity and prosperity right here.

The sector has contributed 2.4 per cent of all net jobs created across the global economy over the past five years.
Despite the strong recent performance of the overall energy sector, the report warns of deepening skilled labour shortages.
According to the IEA’s Energy Employment Survey, the main barriers preventing people from entering energy-related training include costs, foregone wages and limited awareness of available programmes.
Reskilling within the energy sector itself is also essential.","Strong investment in energy infrastructure drove a 2.2 per cent rise in energy jobs last year, nearly double the rate of employment growth for the wider global economy, according to a new International Energy Agency (IEA) report, which highlights the dynamic trends across the sector as well as bottlenecks for skilled labour in key areas.

The World Energy Employment 2025 report released finds that global energy sector employment reached 76 million people worldwide in 2024, up more than 5 million from 2019.

The sector has contributed 2.4 per cent of all net jobs created across the global economy over the past five years.

The power sector is leading the way on job creation, accounting for three-quarters of recent employment growth, and is now the largest employer in energy, overtaking fuel supply.

Solar PV is a key driver of growth, complemented by rapid expansions in hiring in nuclear power, grids and storage.

Increasing electrification of other sectors of the economy is also reshaping employment trends, with jobs in EV manufacturing and batteries surging by nearly 800 000 in 2024.

Fossil fuel employment remained resilient in 2024.

Coal jobs rebounded in India, China and Indonesia, pushing employment in the coal industry 8 per cent above its 2019 levels despite steep declines in advanced economies.

The oil and gas industry has also regained most of the jobs lost in 2020, although low prices and economic uncertainties have triggered job cuts in 2025.

Based on early data, energy employment growth is expected to moderate to 1.3 per cent in 2025, reflecting persistently tight labour markets and heightened trade and geopolitical tensions that are making some firms more cautious about hiring.

Despite the strong recent performance of the overall energy sector, the report warns of deepening skilled labour shortages.

Out of 700 energy-related companies, unions and training institutions participating in the IEA’s Energy Employment Survey, more than half of them reported critical hiring bottlenecks that threaten to slow the building of energy infrastructure, delay projects and raise system costs.

“Energy has been one of the strongest and most consistent engines of job creation in the global economy during a period marked by significant uncertainties,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “But this momentum cannot be taken for granted. The world’s ability to build the energy infrastructure it needs depends on having enough skilled workers in place. Governments, industry and training institutions must come together to close the labour and skills gap. Left unaddressed, these shortages could slow progress, raise costs and weaken energy security.”

Applied technical roles such as electricians, pipefitters, line workers, plant operators and nuclear engineers are in especially short supply.

These occupations alone have added 2.5 million positions since 2019 and now represent over half of the entire global energy workforce, more than double their share of total employment in the broader economy.

An ageing workforce is intensifying the pressure, with 2.4 energy workers in advanced economies nearing retirement for every new entrant under 25.

Nuclear- and grid-related professions face some of the steepest demographic challenges, with retirements outnumbering new entrants by ratios of 1.7 and 1.4 to 1 respectively.

At the same time, the supply of newly qualified workers is not keeping pace with the sector’s needs. To prevent the skills gap from widening further by 2030, the number of new qualified entrants into the energy sector globally would need to rise by 40 per cent.

The report shows that this would require an additional $2.6 billion per year of investment globally, representing less than 0.1 per cent of spending on education worldwide.

Policy measures can make a major difference.

According to the IEA’s Energy Employment Survey, the main barriers preventing people from entering energy-related training include costs, foregone wages and limited awareness of available programmes.

Effective policy tools include targeted financial incentives for learners, expanded apprenticeships, greater private-sector involvement in curriculum design, and investment in training facilities.

It added that India has already met 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, achieving the target five years ahead of its Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. As of October 31, the country’s non-fossil fuel capacity stands at 259 GW, with 31.2 GW added in the current financial year. The ministry emphasised that financing should not remain limited to module manufacturing, but also expand to upstream segments such as cells, ingots, wafers and polysilicon, along with ancillaries like solar glass and aluminium frames. The govt reiterated its commitment to making India self-reliant in solar PV manufacturing and strengthening its position in the global value chain. Supported by schemes such as the PLI for high-efficiency modules, India’s module manufacturing capacity has jumped from 2.3 GW in 2014 to 122 GW listed on the ALMM. MNRE said it will continue policy support, infrastructure development and stakeholder engagement to ensure India’s solar sector remains “inclusive, competitive and future-ready.”

India's renewable energy sector continues its robust expansion, with non-fossil fuel sources now accounting for half of the nation's total power generation capacity, a milestone reached five years earlier than initially projected under commitments made during the Paris Agreement.

Current figures through the end of October 2025 show approximately 259 gigawatts of installed capacity from clean energy sources, including a substantial addition of 31.2 GW during the first seven months of this fiscal year.

Recent media coverage suggested that the ministry had instructed financial institutions to suspend funding for renewable projects due to concerns about excessive production capacity.

The ministry has categorically denied these claims.

What the ministry has done, according to official statements, is provide detailed information to financial oversight bodies and major lending institutions, including Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, about current manufacturing capabilities throughout the solar photovoltaic supply chain.

This information encompasses production capacity data for solar panels, cells, silicon wafers, polysilicon materials, and supporting components such as specialised glass and aluminum framing. The goal is to encourage lenders to take a more comprehensive view when assessing funding applications for solar manufacturing plants.

The ministry is urging financial institutions to broaden their investment perspective beyond conventional solar panel assembly operations to include earlier stages of production and component manufacturing.

India's solar manufacturing sector has experienced remarkable transformation, with panel production capacity surging from a modest 2.3 GW in 2014 to approximately 122 GW currently listed under the ministry's official registry of approved manufacturers and products.

Centre in its statement reaffirmed its dedication to establishing India as a significant force in the worldwide solar manufacturing landscape while working toward the ambitious target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by the decade's end.

Ministry officials indicated they will maintain ongoing dialogue with industry participants to ensure the sector remains dynamic, inclusive, and prepared for future challenges.",https://static.businessworld.in/1589948103_kbF4A7_2020_05_20T041000Z_1_LYNXMPEG4J072_RTROPTP_4_IEA_RENEWABLES.JPG,N,,2025-12-07 02:58:27.213631

Despite this year’s abrupt U-turn in federal energy policy, US innovators are still front and center in the global decarbonization race. That includes the somewhat unglamorous but carbon-heavy field of concrete, where a research team at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts has introduced a bio-inspired concrete alternative that sequesters carbon during the production process, achieving true carbon-negative status.

Concrete Has A Carbon Problem, Bigly

The research team calculates that their new alternative building material sequesters 6.1 kilograms of carbon per cubic meter during the production process. In contrast, conventional concrete emits roughly 330 kilograms of carbon during production.

Getting to -6 from +330 is quite an achievement, considering the carbon intensity of conventional concrete. Part of the challenge involves reducing the high heat required to transform limestone into the “clinker” that forms the basis of traditional cement, which is the glue that holds gravel and other concrete aggregates together.

Another significant challenge is to replace the limestone itself. A sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate fossils, limestone releases a copious amount of carbon dioxide when heated. The US Geological Survey estimates that limestone accounts for almost 66% of the carbon emissions attributed to cement production.

“While most people realize that cars, planes, and power plants contribute to climate change, there’s another major source of greenhouse gases that’s often overlooked. It’s all around us –perhaps even right where you are as you read this. It’s concrete, and the cement used to make it,” USGS elaborated in a think piece last year (see lots more concrete background here).

The Long Road To The Superbricks Of The Future

The roster of solutions to concrete’s carbon problem has been growing into the bio-based space. In a new study published in the journal Matter, the WPI research team notes that one area of focus involves deploying microbes to precipitate calcium carbonate, with bamboo, mycelium, fungi, and bacteria-based materials also among the other alternatives. However, the researchers also note that cost, complexity, engineering issues, and the potential for negative environmental impacts are limiting factors for bio-inspired cement alternatives.

The WPI team itself encountered a significant roadblock in an earlier work, in which they described a bio-inspired process for growing minerals on a polymer scaffold. They introduced trace amounts of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzed water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid. The carbonic acid then interacted with calcium to produce calcite, which attached itself to the scaffold.

“The material exhibits a compressive strength of 12 MPa and a degree of self-healing capability,” the researchers reported, with MPa being shorthand for megapascal, a valuation of the compressive strength of a concrete mix. By that measure, 12 MPa is pretty good for a first effort. It comes within shouting distance of the minimum MPa for some uses, though the American Cement Association notes that high-strength concrete typically has a strength of at least 55 MPa.

The WPI team also took note of a more substantial issue, stating that the strength of their new material “decreases significantly under humid conditions,” which they describe as a “universal problem for biologically inspired construction materials that use hydrophilic polymers as scaffolds.”

“Although incorporating biomaterials reduces carbon emissions, these products are not water resistant and require a protective layer,” they emphasize.

The Hydrophobic Solution

If you caught that thing about hydrophilic, so did the WPI team. In the new work, they took a different tack. Under the title, “Durable, high-strength carbon-negative enzymatic structural materials via a capillary suspension technique,” they describe how they deployed sand to form a hydrophobic scaffold upon which calcium carbonate crystals can grow.

“We present a strong, cost-effective, carbon-negative building material, named enzymatic structural material (ESM), that integrates enzymatically formed CaCO3 crystals into a hydrochar scaffold via capillary suspension,” they explain.

“This enables versatile fabrication, rapid molding into various structures within hours, and scalability for mass production, bypassing the 28-day curing required for conventional concrete,” the researchers add. In addition to the carbon sequestration benefit, they also cite recycling and repairability as an additional plus in the sustainability column, helping to reduce construction waste and extend the lifespan of a project.

While not hitting the high-strength mark for conventional concrete, the research team achieved a respectable compressive strength of 25.8 MPa, making ESM suitable for roof decks and wall bricks among other applications.

WPI also emphasizes that ESM takes only hours to cure, compared to the four-week timetable typical of most concrete mixtures, helping to accelerate housing construction and post-disaster rebuilding efforts.

“Because ESM is produced with low energy and renewable biological inputs, it also aligns with global goals for carbon-neutral infrastructure and circular manufacturing,” ESM points out.

US Innovators Keep On Innovating

Don’t get too excited just yet. The road from the laboratory to the shelves of your local hardware store is a long one. The WPI team plans to focus their next steps on parsing out the ecological efficiency of their ESM formula, while improving its performance and laying the groundwork for scaled-up production.

In the meantime, various near-term carbon cutting solutions are emerging on the market. One example from the CleanTechnica archive is the Massachusetts startup Sublime Systems. The company’s low carbon “Sublime Cement” is beginning to catch on among construction industry stakeholders in the US, with Microsoft being one high-profile example.

When last heard from, the American Cement Association (a rebrand of the Portland Cement Association earlier this year) also continues to hold the torch for global leadership in the decarbonization movement. “The association has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to set a global standard for innovation and create a sustainable future,” ACA says of its “Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality.” Released in May of 2024, the Roadmap provides space for carbon capture and sequestration, but the overall emphasis is on next-generation solutions that deploy low-carbon feedstocks and renewable energy at the production end. ACA also counts energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy at the building design and construction end towards its 2050 carbon neutral goal.

So much for last year’s effort. This year has been a different story. In May, the US Department of Energy clawed back carbon capture grants for cement producers, among other industries, leading ACA President and CEO Mike Ireland to call the action “a missed opportunity for both America’s cement manufacturers and this administration.”

Nevertheless, the ACA moved forward with a decarbonization agenda for its third annual Sustainability Summit in August. “While 2025 has brought landmark changes in Washington that directly affect cement companies, the industry’s top goal of decarbonization remains the same,” Ireland declared in a preview of the event. The Summit also highlighted alternative kiln fuels and low-carbon cement blends along with a commitment to continue investing in carbon capture systems despite the federal funding cuts.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/carbon-negative-building-material-WPI.png,N,,2025-12-07 09:58:03.729027

The investment in GFCL EV Products Limited marks a turning point for India’s ambitions to control its own EV supply chain rather than relying on imports from China and other nations.

The World Bank Group’s private-sector arm announced the deal on Dec. 5, targeting a new plant in Jolva, near Bharuch in Gujarat. The facility will produce critical lithium-ion battery components under one roof, including electrolyte salts, cathode materials and specialized binders that go into every electric vehicle battery.

This represents IFC’s first investment in a battery materials company in India, signaling confidence that the country can compete in the high-value chemistry that makes electric vehicles possible. For a nation racing to electrify its transportation sector, the deal couldn’t come at a better time.

What makes this facility different

Unlike typical manufacturing plants that focus on one component, GFCL EV’s facility will handle multiple stages of battery production in a single location. The plant will produce lithium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte salt, custom electrolyte formulations, lithium iron phosphate cathode materials and PVDF/PTFE binders. These materials together account for more than half the cost of a lithium iron phosphate battery cell.

The parent company, Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited, already operates as one of India’s largest producers of fluoropolymers and specialty chemicals. With three manufacturing units in Gujarat and a captive fluorspar mine in Morocco, GFL brings decades of chemistry expertise to the battery materials business. The company deployed about 1,125 crore rupees (approximately $135 million) in capital expenditures during fiscal year 2024-25, with more than half dedicated to EV-related projects.

Racing to meet surging demand

India’s electric vehicle market is exploding. Industry forecasts show lithium battery demand will skyrocket from about 4 gigawatt-hours in 2023 to nearly 139 gigawatt-hours by 2035, driven primarily by compact passenger vehicles and small SUVs. The government’s Production Linked Incentive scheme for battery storage aims to create massive manufacturing capacity with an overall budget of 18,100 crore rupees (about $2.2 billion).

The challenge isn’t just building enough batteries but ensuring India isn’t simply assembling components made elsewhere. Cathode materials and electrolyte salts represent the highest import dependence, with China currently dominating global production. Industry estimates suggest cathode materials alone can account for 29% to 51% of a lithium-ion battery’s total price, depending on chemistry and metal prices.

Why IFC is betting big

The investment fits IFC’s broader strategy of backing projects that deliver climate benefits, create high-skill jobs and strengthen supply chain resilience. By supporting domestic battery materials production, IFC aims to reduce India’s dependence on imported components while enabling the country’s transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.

IFC has already invested heavily in India’s EV ecosystem, including a $20 million equity stake in Transvolt Mobility, its first global investment in an EV fleet platform. The organization has also supported two- and three-wheeler manufacturers, last-mile logistics operators and charging infrastructure providers. Moving upstream into battery materials represents the next logical step in building a complete domestic EV supply chain.

Navigating choppy waters

The investment comes during turbulent times for global battery markets. Lithium hydroxide prices have plummeted nearly 90% from their 2022 peaks, while battery pack prices fell about 20% in 2024 to a record low of $115 per kilowatt-hour. Overcapacity in global cathode and materials markets could squeeze profit margins and intensify competition from established players in China and South Korea.

Technology shifts also pose challenges. While GFCL EV focuses on lithium iron phosphate chemistry, which has become mainstream for mass-market EVs due to safety and cost advantages, automakers are exploring alternative chemistries including manganese-rich variants and even sodium-ion batteries. GFL’s expertise in fluorine-based materials across multiple battery types should provide some protection against single-chemistry risk.

A blueprint for Indian manufacturing

If successful, the GFCL EV facility could serve as a model for how traditional chemical companies can pivot into high-value energy transition materials. The project blends decades of process knowledge with emerging demand from the electric vehicle revolution. For India, owning the chemistry inside battery cells matters as much as assembling the cells themselves.

The partnership between a global development financier and an established Indian chemical manufacturer demonstrates that India’s battery story is moving beyond assembly plants toward the more strategic business of controlling critical materials. Whether this gamble pays off will depend on execution, market conditions and the country’s ability to compete with deeply entrenched Asian manufacturers who have spent years perfecting these processes.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s energy agenda to center energy supplies on projects like the nuclear power plants and the Alaska liquefied natural gas (LNG) project has created both opportunities for economic growth for Korea but also raised concerns over Korea’s dependency on U.S. priorities.

Trump’s firm determination for fossil fuels has been demonstrated time and time again, beginning from his infamous statement, “Drill, baby, drill,” during his inaugural address, and re-exemplified by the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement in January 2025.

On Oct. 29, Korea and the United States finalized the logistics for tariff agreements in essential industries, easing tensions over trade and Korea’s role in the energy supply of the United States.

After the Korea-U.S. summit, Seoul's presidential aide, Kim Yong-beom, announced that the ""reciprocal"" tariffs will be reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent, signaling a shift in the two countries’ approach to trade and investment.

The finalized tariff negotiations offered preferential treatment for imported components critical to the energy supply of the United States, such as the nuclear and oil sectors, reflecting Trump's strategic focus on traditional energy sources. This agreement is due to the fact that the United States does not have the capability to independently develop its own full energy supply. Under this framework, Korea is gaining strategic and economic benefits by having increased exports with reduced tariffs, though questions remain about whether these advantages outweigh the financial support required by the United States.

Nuclear Energy: Korea in the U.S. SMR market

On Aug. 25, shortly after President Lee Jae Myung took office, the first Korea-U.S. summit took place.

In the Korea-U.S. Business Roundtable, Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy concluded 11 memorandums of understanding in five fields including shipbuilding, nuclear plants, airlines and LNG. The nuclear power plant factor is both a positive and a negative for Korea.

Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and Doosan Enerbility cooperated with X-Energy and Amazon Web Services on future planning for small modular reactor (SMR) design, construction, operation, supply chain development, investment and market expansion. With that, KHNP was incorporated into nuclear power plant and uranium enrichment plant construction in the United States.

After the Three Mile Island accident occurred outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1979, due to a lack of a proper cooling facility, the United States paused its insistence on the supply of skilled manpower, thus collapsing the nuclear industry environment. Civic concern about radioactive waste disposal and its high cost problem followed after multiple accidents.

For these reasons, the United States sought support from foreign nations, and Korea was one country chosen to support the United States as their relationship improved.

""This phenomenon implies how urgent the United States is in its recovery of the nuclear industry,” claimed Kim Ji-young from the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute.

As Seoul works to strengthen its longstanding alliance with Washington, Korea is encountering a new set of opportunities in the expanding U.S. nuclear energy sector. Recent partnerships signal a broader opening for Korea to take part in the design, construction and supply chain development of SMRs.

The global SMR market is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades, supported by Korea’s 10th Electricity Plan, which targets six new reactors by 2033 and nuclear energy accounting for 34.6 percent of national electricity. Korea aims to increase nuclear generating capacity from 24.7 gigawatt-electrical in 2022 to 28.9 gigawatt electrical in 2030 and 31.7 gigawatt electrical in 2036, while also planning to export 10 nuclear units by 2030 and advance the development of Korean SMRs, according to the World Nuclear Association.

This expansion strengthens Korea’s economic position by enhancing its global role as a supplier of advanced nuclear components, supporting domestic industry growth, creating high-skilled jobs and promoting expertise in reactor construction, operation and supply chain development. Moreover, continued investment in nuclear energy contributes to national energy security and offers a low-carbon alternative that aligns with long-term environmental and climate goals.

But the benefits come with notable challenges.

Korea’s increased involvement in U.S. strategic-sector initiatives stems from a $350 billion investment package linked to the Korea-U.S. trade deal, which allocates $200 billion for U.S.-selected strategic industries, including advanced energy and nuclear technology, and $150 billion for shipbuilding cooperation, according to Reuters.

A Korean report noted, “Mid‑ to long‑term, critics warn that Korea’s nuclear ecosystem could be structurally subordinated to Westinghouse […] even for SMRs, Korea may have to submit to a U.S. firm’s technology verification.”

Some experts point out that while cooperation strengthens diplomatic ties, it may temporarily slow Korea’s ability to diversify its domestic energy innovation efforts.

Pressuring investment: In the pipeline of Trump’s ‘Alaska LNG’ project

Trump’s ambitious construction of an 800-mile-long pipeline in Alaska that encompasses regions from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet — a project known as Alaska LNG — is the ultimate fruit of his plans for the advancement of U.S. power in the energy industry.

Mike Dunleavy, the Republican governor of Alaska, describes the project as a “step in the right direction for Alaska and American energy dominance,” supporting Trump’s cancellation of the 2024 Rule on Alaska Petroleum Reserve on Nov. 23.

But who will enable his vision for U.S. oil industry expansion?

Trump is turning to Asian countries for the answer, with Korea as one of the prime sources for concentrated investment.

“We have the greatest amount of energy in the world and we're dealing with South Korea, as you know, in Alaska,” Trump declared at the Korea-U.S. summit on Aug. 25. “We're going to be making a deal, a joint venture with South Korea. Japan is also very strongly involved.""

Despite Trump’s confidence in Korea’s inclination to collaborate, no realistically operational discussion took place during the summit, according to chief presidential secretary Kim.

On this topic, Shin Hyun-don, a professor of the energy resources department at Inha University, concludes in hindsight that the contract between the United States and the Korea Gas Corp. (Kogas) signed in August was an effective means of circumventing seemingly compulsory Alaska investment, which can be highly risky considering its technical and economic uncertainty.

The long-term purchase contract requires Kogas to buy 3.3 million tons of U.S. LNG per year across a decade.

“The current government deserves a passing score as [the contract] created a valid justification to not participate in the Alaska LNG project,” Shin remarked.

Further regarding this settlement, optimists view this agreement in a commercially beneficial light in that while crude oil from the Middle East entails a 3 percent tariff, the agreement with the United States would be under the two nations' FTA, indicating duty-free shipments despite the relatively long distance.

“Crude oil from the United States is more economical depending on the circumstances,” an official said.

Yet, domestic industries are expressing concerns about the inevitability of a widespread reconstruction of oil facilities for the accommodation of U.S. crude oil in national factories, which would require a prodigious amount of funds — $2 billion to $3 billion worth of structure reformation to be exact, the Korea National Oil Corporation revealed.

This would be especially unfavorable considering Korea’s current economic state. The Lee government’s midterm financial plan is predicted to add up to more than 109 trillion won ($74 billion) in new debt each year, according to Park Sung-hoon, the chief spokesperson of the People Power Party.

The aftermath for the energy industry

“Both leaders welcome Korean investments in various sectors to advance economic and national security interests, including but not limited to shipbuilding, energy, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, and artificial intelligence/quantum computing,” said the White House after the Korea-U.S. summit, held prior to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang, on Oct. 29, alluding for more potential interactions between the two countries in multiple sectors of the manufacturing industry.

Trump’s endeavor to develop the energy industry in the United States became apparent on May 23 after signing four executive orders to recalibrate the U.S. nuclear industry and discussing rapid cooperation on Alaska LNG supplying East Asian countries.

The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute claimed in July that the Trump administration's actions, such as signing executive orders on nuclear energy, are “desperate acts on rejuvenating the U.S. nuclear energy industry.”

U.S. Secretary of Energy Christopher Allen Wright also said on Sept. 25 that the construction of LNG pipelines in Alaska will be “started within the next 12 months.”

Such a rapid execution to renovate and empower an industry was reflected in affairs with Korea.

In the first summit, private companies such as Trifigura and Total Energies were contracted for future exports of LNG to Korea, and companies like Centrus and Fermi America decided to cooperate on establishing a nuclear facility complex in Texas.

There was also an agreement between two defense-wise allied nations to approve the construction of nuclear-powered submarines operated by Korea.

Further collaborations in developing nonrenewable energy sources and applications brought a warning from the Embassy of China in Korea to “ exercise caution when proceeding [with introducing nuclear submarines].”

As the summit came to a conclusion and overall investment logistics were finalized, a variety of comments came from the Korean political sphere.

Democratic Party leader Jung Chung-rae said the overall investment was “the greatest negotiation and greatest achievement that will forever shine in the history of Korean diplomacy.”

The People Power Party claimed that the execution of the conference was only made “how the Americans wanted,” expressing criticism toward the terms.

The commerce industry expressed relief at the decision to disperse investment sectors, with the Peterson Institute for International Economics rating it as a “wise decision in minimizing foreign market instability” and the New York Times reviewing it as “overall less burdensome.”

The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions criticized the Korea-U.S. summit for the decision to accept investments to facilitate energy, goods and technology and exports to the United States, saying, “The burden will ultimately fall on workers and the public.”

With the final terms made for large-scale investments, it comes down to either a revival or rehabilitation of Korea-U.S. economic affairs and projects deemed prosperous for energy production under the Trump administration. With “Lee's strategy of flattery” clearly working, the BBC said, now Korea must wait to see whether or not the trick brings a beneficial impact.

The success of Bulgaria’s green transition, participants agreed, will depend not only on technology or funding – but on cooperation across political, business, and social lines.","As Bulgaria faces growing pressure to align with the European Union’s green transition goals, energy leaders and experts convened at the “Green Week” international forum to discuss the country’s future energy strategy. The event, focused on sustainable transformation across Central and Eastern Europe, brought together stakeholders from business, government, academia, and civil society.

One of the central messages of the event was clear: Bulgaria needs a comprehensive, forward-looking national energy strategy that balances environmental targets with energy security, social impact, and industrial competitiveness.

“Time is of the essence,” said energy entrepreneur Hristo Kovachki, who participated in the roundtable discussion titled “Bulgaria’s New Energy Strategy.” “Drafting a clear strategy must not be delayed – but we need to approach it wisely, without dismantling our existing infrastructure prematurely.”

The Role of Coal and Alternative Fuels

With the EU pushing for deep decarbonization across its member states, many countries are facing tough decisions about the future of coal. Bulgaria, where coal continues to play a role in the energy mix, is under pressure to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy sources.

However, Kovachki pushed back against the idea of sudden coal plant closures, arguing that transitional fuels and new technologies must be integrated into the process. He pointed to biowaste and natural gas as viable alternatives.

“Bulgaria generates over 10 million tons of biowaste annually,” Kovachki noted. “This is a resource we can use sustainably, especially in power plants that are currently coal-dependent.”

He also described natural gas as the fuel of the transition, highlighting its flexibility and lower emissions compared to coal. According to Kovachki, such alternatives offer a more stable and realistic path toward reducing emissions without causing energy insecurity or economic disruption.

Institutional Support and Strategic Planning

A recurring theme in Kovachki’s comments was the need for state support, especially for private energy companies navigating the complexities of the energy transition. He emphasized that private operators cannot carry the burden of transition alone and called for government involvement in coordinating investments and regulatory reforms.

“The state should be more involved in ensuring a successful transition for its coal power plants, who still produce the majority of the country’s baseload power after NPP Kozloduy,” he said.

This point resonated with others at the forum, including Alexander Zagorov, secretary of the Podkrepa Labour Confederation, who warned that political pressure and unclear messaging around the future of coal were hindering constructive dialogue between businesses and trade unions.

“The attacks on the coal industry are making meaningful engagement very difficult,” Zagorov said. “With the right strategy, we can avoid conflict and work together.”

EU Ambitions and Local Realities

Panelists agreed that while the EU’s decarbonization targets are important, translating them into local policy will require careful adaptation to Bulgaria’s specific economic and social context. Professor Hristo Vasilev, an energy expert, summarized the panel’s sentiment by urging cross-sectoral cooperation.

“Capable people from various sectors must come together to lead Bulgaria’s energy sector toward decarbonization, while minimizing the social impact,” he said.

The forum also highlighted Bulgaria’s critical energy infrastructure and potential for innovation. Kovachki’s previously stated views on extracting rare earth elements from coal and mining byproducts – an idea supported by several international experts – fit within the EU’s broader push for strategic resource independence and circular economy practices.

Next Steps: From Dialogue to Policy

The event concluded with a shared sense that Bulgaria must move from discussion to action. Representatives from Bulgartransgaz, the Electricity System Operator, and other institutions echoed the need for a unified national plan that can attract investment, maintain energy reliability, and guide decarbonization efforts.

As the country continues to modernize its energy sector under the European Green Deal framework, the formulation of a balanced, data-driven, and inclusive national energy strategy remains a top priority.

A litany of energy companies around the world has, in recent months, expressed new ambitions to expand production across the entire midstream sector, marking a new era of possibilities as the new year approaches. One such company that has ambitious projects ready for the new year is Targa Resources. The firm recently announced the plan to construct what will become its flagship “Speedway” pipeline, connecting its Permian Basin operations to a facility in Mont Belvieu.

Targa to expand its Permian pipeline, as well as new gas and NGL facilities

Targa Resources, one of the largest energy operators in the United States, recently announced an astonishing plan to build a new 500-mile ‘Speedway’ pipeline that will connect the company’s substantial operations in the Permian Basin to a gas and NGL processing facility in Mont Belvieu. The company has also expressed its intention to build a new gas processing plant that will continue to serve its US customer base.

The Permian Basin has become the backbone of the American gas and oil sector, attracting some of the largest and most profitable energy companies in the world, while keeping a close eye on any new potential customers aiming to cash in on the boom of natural energy resources production in the United States. This new expansion development plan comes amid calls by the international energy community to diversify domestic and regional energy production.

The US energy boom has been led by a new directive set in motion by Donald Trump

The US energy market has seen substantial increases in natural energy resources such as gas and oil, led by the ever-enigmatic Donald Trump. Trump announced on his first day in office for his second term that he would institute new measures to revive the oil and gas sector in the US, following a wave of renewable energy permitting under the previous administration.

Targa’s new ‘Speedway’ pipeline will become the belle of the US energy ball

Targa recently announced its plan to construct a ‘Speedway’ Pipeline that will span approximately 500 miles from its Permian basin operations all the way down to its processing facility in Texas. The new 1 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids pipeline will transport NGLs from Targa’s existing assets in the Permian and any potential future plant additions to its fractionation and storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas.

The new 30-inch diameter pipeline and associated infrastructure will build on the company’s already impressive energy operations in the United States. With construction underway, Targa has stated it expects the Speedway pipeline to be fully operational by 2027 at an estimated cost of roughly $1.6 billion. To accommodate an expected growth of operations in the near future, Targa will also move forward with the construction of its Yeti plant.

The Yeti plant will be a 275 million cubic feet per day gas processing facility, marking the continued growth of the Permian operations and the US energy market overall. The Permian has seen several exceedingly large energy companies outline pipeline expansion plans in recent months.

The US energy market is set to welcome the new year in style and abundance

The opulence of the American revival of its energy sector has been a sight to behold. As new and pioneering projects are being planned, the US energy sector has not looked this promising for a very long time indeed. Take, for example, the plan recently unveiled by Transwestern Pipeline to open a bidding season for Energy Transfer’s Desert Southwest expansion.

V Environmental Protection Agency: Implications for Public Health Policy and Practice.” Public Health Reports, vol.","Since assuming office, the Trump Administration has made it blatantly clear that expediting the extraction and deployment of fossil fuels through legal measures is one of their priorities. On his Inauguration Day, Trump delivered EO 14154 Unleashing American Energy to redirect domestic energy development exclusively towards the oil and gas industry. Since then, he has pursued a hostile reversal of policies outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act. In May of 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed complaints against the states of New York and Vermont over their climate superfund laws and preemptively sued Michigan and Hawaii to prevent them from taking legal measures against oil companies. [1, 2] These states have cited tort laws, which allow parties to remedy their injuries through lawsuits, to recover damages associated with climate change. Tort-based claims are similarly found in three dozen other pending lawsuits in which state and local governments have sued major fossil fuel companies for inflicting harm upon people or property. [3] The DOJ, however, alleges that the Clean Air Act, a federal law that regulates air emissions, preempts state efforts to address and mitigate climate change. Citing Trump’s EO Protecting American Energy from State Overreach, the DOJ also argued that state-led energy regulation impinges on the executive branch’s foreign affairs powers. Other legal groups have sought long-term avenues to suppress climate cases. In a letter to the DOJ in June of 2025, 16 Republican state attorneys general requested that the administration enact protections for the fossil fuel industry modeled after a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers from litigation when their guns are utilized for criminal purposes. [4]

If Big Oil is granted a legal shield, the courthouse doors would shut for Americans seeking accountability for the role corporations played in contributing to extreme weather damage. Such an action would establish a precedent of prioritizing corporate interests over community well-being and would shift the fiscal consequences of climate change onto taxpayers. Additionally, fossil fuel immunity claims should be considered illegitimate attempts to constitutionalize an economic interest and violate states’ regulatory power to impose environmental standards. Previous environmental cases have substantiated the lack of federal prerogative and accountability in climate action, and precedent has determined states’ constitutional power to enshrine environmental rights.

States that have filed lawsuits against energy and fossil fuel companies usually follow a consistent pattern of citing violations of state tort law, signifying their proper venue in state and local courts, and undermining the soundness of federal measures that intervene in fossil fuel regulation. In County of San Mateo v. Chevron Corp., the Ninth Circuit affirmed a district order remanding to state court claims brought by California local governments against fossil fuel companies, finding that “the companies did not establish prerequisites for the Grable exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule for cases that raise a substantial federal issue.” [5] The Ninth Circuit held that such cases were not subject to federal jurisdiction because they did not raise concerns relevant to federal law. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit held that “the Clean Air Act did not completely preempt the plaintiffs’ state-law claims” and that the plaintiffs’ injuries were considered “too attenuated and remote” to be governed by federal law applicable to federal enclaves. [6] The plaintiffs' complaints remained a state law complaint on the grounds that the Clean Air Act (CAA) fails to address all claims related to air pollution.

The decision on the Clean Air Act’s preemption power is particularly notable, as current lawsuits pursued by the DOJ call upon the CAA to prove state climate action inessential. Additionally, the court panel rejected the energy companies’ argument that the plaintiffs’ claims should be heard in federal court under 28 U.S. Code § 1331, also known as the federal question jurisdiction, simply because the alleged harm happened on federal land under exclusive federal control. The general federal question jurisdictional statute grants federal district courts original subject matter jurisdiction over ""all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.” [7] In this instance, the federal government’s tangential stake in the case — having dominion over the land in which the violations occurred — proved insufficient in employing this statute. Such a determination demonstrates that fossil fuel infrastructure operated on federal land is not exempt from civil liability, and even more so, that the harms these facilities produce can still be cited under state law.

Corporations, like Chevron, host a portion of their oil extraction operations on federal land, and thus, it is notable that while operating in these areas, no immunity is being granted. Ultimately, the empirical favorability of state court climate litigation undermines the plausibility of federal directives on fossil fuel immunity. However, with the overruling of Chevron in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, redirecting the interpretation of federal statute from agencies to the court, the judicial system has assumed novel importance within the climate fight. Power has been further invested in the courts to issue sound rulings on environmental policy, subverting the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the federal government’s reliance on it to supplement state regulation. [8]

In cases where the EPA does have ruling authority, modern environmental jurisprudence increasingly recognizes the right of states and their sovereignty to hold federal agencies accountable for regulatory neglect in the face of environmental degradation. Although Massachusetts v. EPA is largely recognized for declaring greenhouse gases pollutants, the landmark ruling also reinforced states' legal standing to sue federal agencies over subpar environmental regulations. In this case, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that Massachusetts, due to its ""stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests"" as a state, had standing to sue the EPA over potential damage caused to its territory by global warming, along with the legal right to seek redress for agency inaction. [9] Massachusetts specifically cited injuries to its land and health, which paved the way for administrative recognition of environmental harms. The majority decision concluded that Massachusetts had a legal right to seek relief given that the Commonwealth met all three conditions: (1) a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent, (2) the injury that is traceable to the act of the defendant (the EPA in this case), and (3) evidence that favorable action by the EPA would help repair the injury. [10]

In the wake of lawsuits against Big Oil, the question of whether judicial decisions can adequately ameliorate climate injuries has been contested. In May 2025, Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit public interest law firm, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging their executive orders that accelerate the deployment of fossil fuels in Lighthiser v. Trump. In October, a federal district court in Montana dismissed the case. According to the court, the plaintiffs were incapable of surmounting the ‘final, dispositive hurdle’ that the relief would be outside the court’s power to grant. The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs had proven sufficient injury, but argued that the issue of alleviating climate change was too broad and failed to meet the requirements of redressability. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the agency put forth a similar argument claiming that its power to regulate global climate change was insufficient to provide relief. Here, however, the majority reached a different conclusion than that of Montana’s federal district court. Majority leader Justice Stevens stated that ‘incremental agency action over time may produce cumulative effects and that for standing to be present, the state would not have to show that any single action would remedy its problems.” Stevens further argued that “the EPA's regulation of greenhouse gases would have a significant effect because of the enormous amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the U.S. transportation sector.” [11] Thus, the failure of Lighthiser v. Trump in seeking redress and holding fossil fuel companies accountable does not disprove the prospect of such action, as Massachusetts v. EPA validated the utility of regulatory standards in remedying climate injuries and proved that they can be traceable to an entity.

In holding fossil fuel companies accountable, the application of the Public Trust Doctrine (PTD) presents a potential avenue for asserting states’ role in environmental protection. The doctrine derives from the Roman ""jus publicum"" principle of common ownership of natural resources: “By the law of nature these things are common to mankind—the air, running water, the sea, and consequently the shores of the sea.” [12] In the U.S.’s recognition of the public trust doctrine, state governments rightfully serve as trustees of resources, though its application has traditionally been exclusive to that of waterways. The PTD has been constitutionalized by several states, including Hawaii, which enshrines that “all public natural resources are held in trust by the State for the benefit of the people” and explicitly defines resources to include “land, water, air, minerals, and energy sources.” [13] In Hawaii’s complaint against BP, Shell, and Exxon, the state alleges that it has a constitutional obligation to uphold this protection and cites eight causes of action in its complaint, among them negligence and “harm to public trust resources.” [14] Formerly employed to settle disputes over access to waterways, the doctrine has now imposed affirmative duties upon states to protect resources, as evidenced in various state constitutions. [15]

Similarly, Pennsylvania’s constitution guarantees a “right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment,” and provides that “as trustee of these resources, [Pennsylvania] shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.” [16] As public-trust-based litigation becomes increasingly prevalent in state efforts to address climate change, courts must clarify their function. Hawaii’s invocation of its constitutionalized PTD in litigation against major oil companies emphasizes the doctrine’s contemporary expansion and undermines claims that fossil fuel entities enjoy protection from state-led environmental litigation.

Trump’s Executive Orders raise pressing concerns about the future of the fossil fuel industry and the extent of state autonomy in regulating and preserving these industries within their borders. Understanding how past legal actions have justified state countermeasures against federal expansion of fossil fuels is essential in today’s era of energy polarization. Efforts to immunize fossil fuel corporations place corporate interests above community well-being — a tension reflected in the growing incorporation of the public trust doctrine into state constitutions. This doctrine has been invoked in legal battles to defend states’ rights to safeguard their natural resources and land from oil and gas expansion. Moreover, climate cases are increasingly being remanded to state courts, underscoring the limits of federal authority in establishing doctrines that confer “rights” upon fossil fuel industries. The disparities between landmark cases such as Massachusetts v. EPA and Lighthiser v. Trump reveal that holding entities accountable for regulatory failures is possible, particularly when public health violations are at stake. As organizations and communities seek representation and redress for the harms caused by fossil fuels, these corporations must remain subject to rigorous public scrutiny and accountability.

Michigan Advance

EV sales are in the tank. So what happens next?

Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since federal tax credits ended on Sept. 30.

In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.

The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.

But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.

One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.

After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe. ✂️

The takeaway is that, yes, this is a setback, but ICE cars are not going to win.

North Dakota Monitor

Natural gas operator fined for environmental violation at North Dakota reservation

The operator of natural gas production facilities on the Fort Berthold Reservation was ordered Friday to pay a $500,000 fine and do 500 hours of community service for an environmental violation.

Targa Badlands LLC pleaded guilty earlier this year in U.S. District Court in North Dakota to a violation of the Clean Air Act that affected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.

Targa, which operates six natural gas compressor stations on Fort Berthold, failed to install required hazardous air pollutant monitoring systems, federal prosecutors say in court records.

The violation occurred between 2018 and 2022 on the Johnson Compressor Station near Mandaree. Natural gas gathering pipelines include compressor stations that boost pressure before the gas reaches a natural gas processing plant.

The combustion engines on the compressor station produce hazardous air pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan O’Konek said during the plea hearing, according to a transcript.

The plea agreement indicates Targa self-reported the violation and promptly corrected it by installing monitoring equipment. The company has since taken steps to improve environmental compliance, federal prosecutors said. The attorney for Targa did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. ✂️

Included only because I’m a sucker for ND news. The issue was found and reported by the company itself. They are a repeat offender, but I’ll look at the positive that there is someone internally looking for issues. Hopefully, they’ll develop better internal processes to stop this from happening again.

Georgia Recorder

Georgia hashes out plan to let data centers build their own clean energy

Big companies have spent years pushing Georgia to let them find and pay for new clean energy to add to the grid, in the hopes that they could then get data centers and other power-hungry facilities online faster.

Now, that concept is tantalizingly close to becoming a reality, with regulators, utility Georgia Power, and others hammering out the details of a program that could be finalized sometime next year. If approved, the framework could not only benefit companies but also reduce the need for a massive buildout of gas-fired plants that Georgia Power is planning to satiate the artificial intelligence boom.

Today, utilities are responsible for bringing the vast majority of new power projects online in the state. But over the past two years, the Clean Energy Buyers Association has negotiated to secure a commitment from Georgia Power that ​“will, for the first time, allow commercial and industrial customers to bring clean energy projects to the utility’s system,” said Katie Southworth, the deputy director for market and policy innovation in the South and Southeast at the trade group, which includes major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. ✂️

Because it made me smile:

✂️ But as it stands, CEBA sees ​“the approved CIR framework as a meaningful step toward the ​‘bring-your-own clean energy’ model,” Southworth said — a model that goes by the catchy acronym BYONCE in clean-energy social media circles. ✂️

It looks like there are still technical kinks to iron out and not all regions of the country are managed in a way to easily facilitate this, but I like the idea.

Idaho Capital Sun

Idaho Congressman Fulcher introduces bill extending private, short-term health care coverage

Idaho Republican Congressman Russ Fulcher is hoping to expand the use of private, short-term health insurance.

Fulcher on Thursday announced the introduction of the Removing Insurance Gaps for Health Treatment (RIGHT) Act of 2025, which would extend the maximum allowance for short-term health plans from four months to up to three years.

Short-term, limited-duration insurance, known as STLDI, are private insurance plans designed to cover temporary gaps in health coverage. The plans are sometimes less expensive than plans offered through state health insurance marketplace plans, but do not always cover as many services and are not subject to the same consumer protection regulations as those compliant with the Affordable Care Act.

“Four months is far too short a limit, posing undue stress and uncertainty on Americans who would otherwise be left without coverage,” Fulcher said in a press release. “My bill, the RIGHT Act, expands STLDI plans to a full year, with the option to renew for up to three years. This is a practical, no-cost approach that offers families more choice, control, and flexibility to select the healthcare options that work best for them.” ✂️

He’s a U.S. rep. Couldn’t he just sign the discharge petition and extend ACA subsidies?

Maine Morning Star

Federal court rejects state effort to weaken agreement protecting disabled children’s rights

A federal court last week rejected a joint attempt by Maine and the U.S. Department of Justice to weaken a previous agreement that required the state to improve services so that children with disabilities no longer had to be separated from their families.

In a statement Friday, a coalition of rights organizations said the ruling “preserves essential protections that ensure children with behavioral-health needs will receive integrated, community-based services rather than face unnecessary institutionalization.”

The settlement agreement stemmed from a September 2024 lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice that alleged the state was failing to meet the needs of students that require behavioral health services and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by separating them from their homes and communities by institutionalizing them or sending them to juvenile detention centers.

Two months later, the lawsuit was dismissed after the state agreed to implement a robust accountability system with reporting requirements, community outreach and the establishment of an independent watchdog, who would oversee data on state services. Under that initial agreement, the state committed to increasing the availability of community-based behavioral health services through the Maine Department of Health and Human Services so that children would no longer have to be separated from their families. ✂️

Once again, the courts step up to do the right thing.

Maryland Matters

Redistricting supporters outnumber opponents at Maryland meeting

Supporters of mid-decade redistricting in Maryland showed up in force for a virtual meeting of a state advisory commission Friday, calling on state leaders to redo congressional maps to oppose President Donald Trump (R).

It was the third hearing of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission and the third different outcome: Redistricting opponents dominated the first hearing and the second was nearly evenly split. Redistricting proponents dominated Friday’s meeting, thanks to a slew of climate and civil rights advocates, union leaders, a few retired federal employees and even a high school student.

Also joining the chorus was Bobby LaPin, the Maryland social media personality who has announced his intention to run against Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City), a commission member who opposes mid-cycle redistricting.

The commission will meet at least once more, on Dec. 12, to hear public comment.

The redistricting saga began with Trump urging Republican-led states to redistrict for partisan gain before the 2026 elections, to pick up GOP seats in Congress. Red states that have passed new maps so far include Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. Democrats in California and Virginia have fired back with maps of their own. ✂️

Arizona’s Congresswoman Grijalva says she was pepper sprayed during Tucson ICE raid

Arizona’s U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva was involved in a clash with federal agents during a protest of immigration raids in west Tucson Friday, during which she claims she was hit with pepper spray.

According to a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency partnered with the Internal Revenue Service to carry out as many as 16 warrants in southern Arizona in a “years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations.” In videos posted to social media by community advocates, several masked federal agents in tactical gear can be seen near the westside location of popular Mexican seafood and grill restaurant Taco Giro.

The raids prompted a protest and federal agents deployed tear gas and pepper spray against the crowd. The Arizona Daily Star reported that multiple employees who live near the west Tucson restaurant were detained. At least one protester was among those taken into custody by federal agents. AZ Family reported that Taco Giro locations in north Tucson, Casa Grande and Vail were also targeted. ICE spokesman Fernando Burgos-Ortiz confirmed to the Arizona Mirror that multiple people were arrested, but didn’t clarify how many or confirm claims that agents had pepper-sprayed a sitting U.S. Congresswoman.

Tricia McLaughlin, the spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, dismissed Grijalva’s account. McLaughlin accused Grijalva of hindering the work of federal agents and appeared to question Grijalva’s claim that she was pepper-sprayed by highlighting her lack of visible physical reaction in the video. ✂️

Oregon Capital Chronicle

Portland’s DA balked at charging federal agents under Oregon law. Then AG Rayfield stepped in

The top local prosecutor in the Portland area is cautioning against “unreasonable expectations” for his ability to charge federal agents using state law, after signing onto a statement last week warning the Trump administration that its officers could be held accountable for excessive force.

The district attorneys in Oregon’s three most populated counties and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield stood in unison last week when they signed onto a letter warning the Trump administration that they were monitoring reports of excessive force by federal agents with the goal of potentially bringing charges forward should the issue persist. Rayfield, alongside Multnomah County District Attorney Nathan Vasquez, Washington County District Attorney Kevin Barton and Clackamas County District Attorney John Wentworth, requested cooperation from the federal government in Oregon’s investigations.

The attorneys pointed to instances of disproportionate use of force through tear gas and nonlethal munitions by agents with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during protests outside the Portland waterfront Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility. They also referred to federal agents from an unmarked van in October holding teenagers at gunpoint by a Hillsboro Dutch Bros coffee stand and the November arrest of a 17-year-old U.S. citizen during his lunch off-grounds from McMinnville High School. ✂️

Events

1790 - The U.S. Congress moves from NY City to Philadelphia.

1825 - President Adams recommends establishing a national observatory.

1849 - Harriet Tubman makes her final escape from slavery.

1865 - Georgia ratifies the 13th Amendment and abolishes slavery.

WineRev:

1865 Washington DC The 13th Amendment to Constitution, abolishing slavery, had passed both branches of Congress back in January (the center of a fine movie ‘Lincoln’ starting Daniel Day Lewis). Now it needed to be ratified by ¾ of the states. Since the Lincoln Administration did not consider secession legal, legally those 11 Southern states were still part of the Union (so instead of needing 15 ratifications from the 20 states that remained loyal, the Amendment needed 25 out of the 31 total.) OTOH Lee surrendered back in April, Jeff Davis was arrested in May, there was no fighting going on, and in the various Southern states the Union Army is watching over the brand new and re-constituted state governments. (And former Confederates were not allowed to vote or be part of any elected office. If they got mad about this, they could complain to any armed Union soldier or officer on occupation duty in their town…..) On this day the government of Georgia ratifies the Amendment, making ¾, making it part of the Constitution.

1877 - Thomas Edison records voices for the first time at the offices of Scientific American.

1884 - The Washington Monument in D.C. is completed.

Will he tear it down or just rename it?

1922 - Power is transmitted over the first electric power line in NY.

1923 - President Coolidge becomes the first Presidential to address the country on the radio.

WineRev:

1923 Washington DC Marconi and Tesla had gotten the world signaling by radio at the turn of the century. In the fading days of World War I scientists and engineers figured out how to add voices, sounds, even music to the dots and dashes (Morse code) that had been used earlier. Transmitters went up and receivers were designed and sold. In 1920 KDKA in Pittsburgh became the first US commercial radio station to go on the air. Their first broadcast told of the results of the 1920

Presidential Election (Harding the winner.) In the summer of 1923 President Harding died in office and Calvin Coolidge became President.

On this day Mr. Coolidge became the first President ever to speak live on radioto a national audience from the White House.(They connected other stations by telephone lines to the same broadcast so it could be widely heard. They called the connection a ‘network’….a technical term worth remembering. 😊)

1933 - Judge John M. Woolsey rules that James Joyce's novel Ulysses is not obscene (United States v. One Book Called Ulysses).

1947 - The Everglades National Park (FL) is dedicated by President Truman.

WineRev:

1947Florida National Parks were invented by President Grant back in 1872 when he invented the world’s first one called ‘Yellowstone.’ Other mountains, seacoasts, canyons have been designated National Parks (and administered by the Park Service and the Dept. of the Interior.) On this day President Truman (shrewd enough to go to Florida in December!) dedicates a most unusual ecosystem as a protected National Park: The Everglades.

1961 - Ernie Davis becomes the first Black to win the Heisman Trophy.

1964 - Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer airs on t.v. for the first time.

1995 - The FDA approves the first protease inhibitor to treat HIV/AIDS (Saquinavir).

St. Nicholas Day

St. Nicholas Day on December 6 celebrates of course carries some connection to Christmas and Santa Claus, but there is much more to this holiday and St. Nicholas than that. Although St. Nicholas partially inspired the Christmas and Santa Claus that we all know and love, St. Nicholas actually derives from a different kind of tale. Let’s learn about St. Nicholas and what this day is truly about.

WineRev:

343 (Three digit date!) Death date of Nicolas, Bishop of Myra (now Demre), Eastern Roman Empire (now Turkey) (The Church remembers saints on their death day, looking death in the eye and proclaiming “this one we will remember despite you, so the good they did will live on in memory and for inspiration.”)

Almost nothing known about Nicolas from surviving records; earliest mentions are from over 200 years later. Many miracles already attributed to him and he had a legendary for reputation for generosity and gift-giving (in secret; by tradition he left gifts for the poor in the middle of the night, and anonymously.)

Most famously remembered for rescuing three sisters from being sold into prostitution by dropping a bag of gold coins down their chimney on three consecutive nights so their father had a dowry for each of them and could marry them off. (Notice any parallels with some other guy: chimney…..gifts……coming by night? Some story pieces have been around a LONG time.) The real Good St. Nick!

To Quote Girsaol

Tomorrow is St. Nicholas’ Day, the patron saint of children who is not known for having anything to do with sardines.

St. Nicholas and I have something in common! I have nothing to do with sardines, either!

National Miners Day

Despite federal efforts to ensure safe working conditions for miners, they have one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs you can imagine. To recognize their efforts, Congress has declared December 6 National Miners Day. Why? Our entire economy depends on them. On this holiday, we should all take a moment to think about the many ways that miners play a role in our daily lives. Mined materials contribute to things like roads, houses, cars and computers. We wouldn’t be able to get much done without their hard work.

I applaud all of the work that miners have done for us.

===

NATIONAL GAZPACHO DAY

National Gazpacho Day, on December 6th, recognizes a flavorful soup that cooks serve cold. This typically tomato-based vegetable soup originated in the southern Spanish region of Andalucia. Gazpacho is widely consumed in Spanish cuisine, usually during the summer months.

I question the wisdom of making this day at a point of the year when many of us want soup served hot, but I’m not the “national day” Gazpacho.

===

Mitten Tree Day

On December 6th, Mitten Tree Day celebrates the gift of warmth. It’s a day to collect mittens, hang them on a Christmas tree, and then hand them out to those in need.

Those who live in cold climates understand the necessity of mittens. This winter clothing item is essential for keeping the hands warm while outdoors. Unfortunately, however, there are many children around the world who are without adequate winter clothing, which includes mittens.

It’s a national day I can get behind.

===

Put On Your Own Shoes Day

Sounds simple enough – and surely plenty of us do it every day, unless you really feel like braving the walk to work in your socks – but it seems this day might be more to do with shoes themselves and a way of encouraging children to put on and tie their own shoes.

Not just for children…

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-12-06 23:44:50+00:00,techxplore.com,Georgia Power says it needs a huge increase in power capacity to meet data center demand,Jeff Amy,,,,,https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-georgia-power-huge-capacity-center.html,"Josh Stein cited concerns about data centers as one reason for opposing a 15% rate increase sought by Duke Energy for two utilities.
80% of new capacity for data centers Georgia Power, with 2.8 million customers, projects the largest percentage increase in electricity demand over the next five years of any region but Texas.
The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—enough to power 4 million Georgia homes—saying 80% of that would power data centers.
That's in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power.
But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs.","With data centers flooding into Georgia, utility regulators face a big decision: Should they let Georgia Power Co. spend more than $15 billion to increase its electricity capacity by 50% over the next six years to serve computer complexes? Or could the utility overbuild and stick other ratepayers with the bill?

It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The largest subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co., Georgia Power said in testimony filed last month that the build-out will boost the state's economy and ""allow Georgia to contribute to the nation's focus on the global importance of artificial intelligence and the digital economy.""

""Given the number of companies interested in doing business in Georgia and the amount of customer load with signed contracts or in advanced discussions, it is important to continue moving forward with support for this great growth opportunity,"" company officials said in testimony.

But electricity bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize the power demands of technology behemoths.

""I think what's happening in Georgia is in some sense a perfect microcosm of what's happening nationwide,"" said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonprofit group that seeks to increase public involvement in utility regulation. ""You're seeing electricity demand grow at the fastest rate in decades, and you're seeing electricity prices rise at the fastest rate in decades.""

A growing political issue

Electricity costs were a key issue in last month's elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, both data center hot spots. On Tuesday in North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein cited concerns about data centers as one reason for opposing a 15% rate increase sought by Duke Energy for two utilities.

In Georgia, the five elected Republicans on the Public Service Commission will decide on Georgia Power's proposal weeks after voters delivered a stinging rebuke to GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the panel in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July.

After hearings next week, commissioners are scheduled to take a final vote Dec. 19. The two new Democrats won't take office until January and current commissioners denied a request by opponents to postpone the decision until then.

Brionte McCorkle of Georgia Conservation Voters, a group that advocates for carbon-free energy and supported the Democrats, fears the vote will be one last gift from the all-Republican commission to Georgia Power.

""It would be a slap in the face for the commission to rush through this proposal, and give the power company everything it wants,"" said McCorkle ""It's just not listening to what the people have said loud and clear.""

80% of new capacity for data centers

Georgia Power, with 2.8 million customers, projects the largest percentage increase in electricity demand over the next five years of any region but Texas. That's according to an analysis by power consultant Grid Strategies of forecasts filed with federal officials. The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—enough to power 4 million Georgia homes—saying 80% of that would power data centers. That's in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power.

Whether the forecast is accurate and who will pay the bill if data center customers don't materialize is at the heart of the decision. Commissioners in January adopted rules meant to make sure data centers pay the costs of building new power plants and transmission lines they need. But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs.

""The whole argument is premised on the idea that if we get all these new customers, then we can take costs and spread it out over more people and therefore put downward pressure on prices,"" Hua said. ""Well, if you don't actually end up getting all those customers and you built all this new infrastructure, then you could see a scenario where you actually drive bills through the roof even more.""

The ultimate potential costs are unknown because Georgia Power's estimates are partially a trade secret that the company won't release. For example, the $15 billion price tag only covers construction costs for 80% of the current 10,000 megawatt request, and it doesn't include any of the borrowing costs, which customers must also pay. The price of the 3,000 megawatts approved in 2024 remains entirely secret. Because of the rate freeze, ultimate costs won't become clear until 2028, the next time commissioners set electricity rates.

Will customers pay?

Public Service Commission staff members who have analyzed the request say Georgia Power will need $3.4 billion a year in additional revenue by 2031, which could equal out to $20 a month for a residential customer. The company replied that such a claim is ""flatly incorrect.""

""These customers pay upfront the full costs of serving them, commit to long-term contracts, and provide financial guarantees,"" said spokesperson Matthew Kent. ""That means residential and small business customers are protected from cost increases tied to these projects.""

Staff members recommended that the commission allow Georgia Power to build capacity for new large customers only after they have signed contracts starting with 3,100 megawatts of capacity and up to 7,400 megawatts total for contracts signed by March 16. That recommendation would also allow the commission to avoid approving contracts for some new multibillion-dollar natural gas-fired power plants. Costs for such construction have risen sharply, partly because equipment manufacturers are having trouble meeting demand.

The company reacted sharply against that recommendation, saying ""it would significantly inhibit"" its ability to sign up new data centers, hurt economic development, and reduce the opportunity to lower rates.

The company and staff could negotiate a settlement before the Dec. 19 vote. McCorkle said any outcome should focus on protecting customers.

""What we don't want is a form of corporate welfare, where individual citizens are paying for the benefit of big mega corporations like Meta and Amazon,"" she said.

They create opportunities, attract investment, generate new high-quality jobs, and strengthen energy security, while consolidating Greece’s geostrategic position.
Indeed, energy security today is inseparable from national security.
Their presence enhances stability, confirms Greece’s credibility, and creates a broader shield of energy protection.
By investing in the hydrocarbons sector, Greece increases its energy security while remaining fully prepared.","“The emerging regional architecture of energy security, prosperity and stability runs through Greece,” Environment and Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou said in an interview with Kathimerini during his recent trip to Washington.

He highlighted that the presence of two major American energy companies in Greece provides a broader shield of energy security. He also sent a clear message to Turkey. Unless it embraces the US-promoted model of cooperation – abandoning the casus belli and the “gray zones theory” – it will not be able to participate in this new regional framework.

In recent months, Greece has achieved a significant geostrategic upgrade through its energy agreements with the United States. How can this momentum be sustained or even strengthened?

The agreements signed in Athens in November offer undeniable, multifaceted benefits, economic, energy-related, and geostrategic. They create opportunities, attract investment, generate new high-quality jobs, and strengthen energy security, while consolidating Greece’s geostrategic position. To fully realize these gains, it is essential that the agreements are implemented immediately, with continuous engagement, commitment to the objectives, and strict adherence to timelines. The Vertical Corridor is already operational, allowing the supply of US LNG to Ukraine. Just a few days ago, my US counterpart and I established a working group tasked with implementing the strategic objectives of the Vertical Corridor; its first meeting is scheduled for December 10. These initiatives form part of a broader architecture that enhances Greece’s regional role. The Vertical Corridor – connecting some 100 million people – the 3+1 framework linking Greece, Cyprus, Israel and the US, and the IMEC corridor together aim to create a unified pathway for regional development and stability stretching from India to Ukraine. Greece sits at the heart of this chain, acting as a key hub where energy routes, infrastructure, pipelines, ports, rail and road networks intersect, shaping a new regional architecture.

This new regional architecture strongly reflects the Trump doctrine, which firmly links energy to national security. Does Athens feel more secure within this model?

Indeed, energy security today is inseparable from national security. By strengthening the former, Greece naturally bolsters the latter. The conclusion of the Chevron-Helleniq Energy agreement and the first offshore drilling in 40 years – planned by the ExxonMobil-Energean-Helleniq Energy consortium – mark a new era in which the world’s two largest publicly listed energy companies are actively operating on Greek territory. Their presence enhances stability, confirms Greece’s credibility, and creates a broader shield of energy protection. However, as important as this energy shield is, it cannot replace Greece’s responsibility to continuously strengthen its national deterrent capabilities and leverage emerging European defense supply chains, especially amid global upheavals and Turkey’s ongoing casus belli. By investing in the hydrocarbons sector, Greece increases its energy security while remaining fully prepared.

Since the US considers regional stability and reduced tensions crucial for the success of its energy companies’ projects, does this affect Greece’s approach to Turkey?

This new architecture can only thrive in an environment of stability, genuine cooperation and clear prospects. We want it to serve as a paradigm shift for the region – one that eliminates extremes and threats. It is therefore up to Turkey to follow this model of cooperation, leaving behind the casus belli and the “gray zones theory.” Otherwise, Turkey will be unable to participate in this new reality. This vision of regional development highlights the need for a positive, realistic agenda based on commercial cooperation and respect for international law. Our planning prioritizes synergies grounded in international commercial norms rather than tensions or zero-sum thinking. Moreover, in recent months, Greece- – without reacting to Turkey’s provocations – has advanced the institutionalization of maritime spatial planning and marine parks, as well as agreements with the Chevron-Helleniq Energy consortium for offshore blocks south of Crete and the Peloponnese, exercising its sovereign rights in the sector.

Since you mentioned the 3+1, how valuable was the recent meeting in Athens and what foundations has it set for the future?

The recent meeting – held for the first time at the ministerial level – was particularly successful, marking an upgrade of the format. Established in 2019 through the US East Med Act, the 3+1 mechanism includes funding for the creation of the Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center, a goal toward which we are working systematically. Such a permanent cooperation hub will enhance strategic dialogue, build expertise, and solidify the energy partnership among member-states. At the same time, the 3+1 can serve as the link between the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the Vertical Corridor, creating a unified architecture of energy security and development across the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. The next 3+1 meeting is scheduled for April 2026 in Washington.

With regard to IMEC, can Greece be confident it has established its place if and when the corridor becomes a reality?

From the outset, Greece treated IMEC as a strategic opportunity and acted methodically to secure its participation, without adopting an adversarial approach toward other European countries. This approach was reinforced through careful government planning, successive meetings between Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – both in Athens in August 2023 and in India in February 2024 – and by promoting Greece as a key connectivity hub. Today, Greece has strengthened its role as an alternative gateway to the corridor. Combined with the Vertical Corridor and the 3+1, Greece is establishing its position in this emerging regional architecture.

Where does the electricity interconnection project stand? Sources in Washington suggest that if the three countries decide to break the deadlock, the US would provide support if needed.

As both the Greek prime minister and the president of Cyprus have announced, it has been decided to update the technical and financial data of the Greece-Cyprus electricity interconnection. During my visit to the US, interest in participating in the project was confirmed by American institutions – whether government-linked or purely private. For Greece, this project has never been purely economic. It carries strategic significance, ending Cyprus’s energy isolation and fitting within a broader vision connecting Greece, Cyprus, and Israel – and further linking Israel, the Arab world and India – transforming our geographic and energy links into a genuine corridor of stability and development.",https://www.ekathimerini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Papastavrou-960x600.jpg?v=1765016606,N,,2025-12-07 05:59:58.927156

However, in the car industry, competition is fierce. Throw in changes to federal policies into the mix, and it becomes equally stressful and complicated. Now, Ford’s next EVs will be vastly different, as its CEO is clear about the future and believes adapting to the historic shift is the best way to survive. Discover what lies ahead for Ford in the future, and how it plans to adapt with its EVs.

Ford’s CEO is clear about the future

Several factors play a key role in choosing the type of car a person drives. In the U.S., being ‘carbon-conscious’ has become a significant trend, as thousands have embraced a greener lifestyle and thus, greener cars as well. While many may miss the great roar of an internal combustion engine (ICE), electric-powered vehicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular.

Beyond savings on fuel and maintenance costs, government incentives have also increased the popularity of EVs in the U.S. market. However, since the end of a particular tax credit incentive, what will the future hold for the EV market? While some may be uncertain, Ford’s CEO is clear about the future, and has even hinted that the next EVs will be vastly different to adapt to the ‘historic shift.’

Next EVs will be vastly different to adapt to the ‘historic shift’

The popular $7,500 tax credit incentive has been cut as a result of the Trump Administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The U.S. market saw a significant increase in the sales of EVs before the incentive came to an end, but what happens next?

According to Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, the EV industry will still be vibrant, but much smaller than they initially thought. At the Detroit conference, Farley stated that “partial electrification” cars, or rather hybrids, would be easier for customers to embrace, highlighting a ‘historic shift’. Farley continued that they learned their lesson the hard way by overestimating the EV market, adding:

“Customers are not interested in the $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast, they’re efficient, you don’t go to the gas station, but they’re expensive.”

This is what the future of Ford may look like

Thanks to the federal reforms, all automakers, including Ford, will have to figure out what to do with their EV capacity and battery plants. According to Farley:

“We’re going to have to find a place; what we do with all the batter plants. And we’ll fill them. But it will be more stress because we had a four-year predictable policy. Now the policy changes. It means Ford, our construction companies, and we all have to make adjustments. And it’s going to be good for the country, I believe. But it will be one more stress on the supply side.”

For now, customers can most likely expect Ford to focus on EVs that will be much smaller and better suited to urban and suburban lifestyles with shorter commutes. Prices for these EVs will be lower, as their batteries will be significantly smaller. However, Farley added that hybrids, E-Revs, and EV plug-ins are the future (and Ford’s savior), as America is already “falling in love.”

Ford currently has few hybrid options to choose from. Currently, we can choose between the Maverick and the Escape when it comes to standard hybrids, with the Escape also available as a plug-in hybrid. However, the Escape production is coming to an end in 2026, meaning Ford’s only saviors will be the Maverick and the F-150. Only time will tell how soon Ford launches a new hybrid model. Perhaps Sweden’s new shocking hybrid model will serve as a source of inspiration in the future.
