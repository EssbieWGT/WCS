This adds to the initial funding for FIRE Collaboratives announced in January.

According to DOE, “these investments are part of DOE’s broader mission to unleash American energy, science, and innovation, ensuring the technologies that define the future of fusion power are developed here in the United States.”

“This funding represents a major step toward establishing commercial fusion energy as a singular competitive advantage for the nation,” said Tammy Ma, director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL) Livermore Institute for Fusion Technology.

LLNL has a prominent role in these projects. As the home of fusion ignition, LLNL is uniquely positioned to help translate the physics breakthrough into a viable source of commercial fusion energy. LLNL first achieved fusion ignition in a 2022 National Ignition Facility experiment and has since repeated the achievement multiple times.

The FIRE collaboratives will receive $128 million, awarded to seven teams focused on creating a fusion energy science and technology innovation ecosystem by forming virtual, centrally managed teams. The selected teams aim to bridge the DOE Fusion Energy Sciences program’s basic science research and growing fusion industries.

LLNL staff are involved with three of the FIRE collaboratives:

Catherine Percher: Fusion Neutrons for Integrated Blanket Technology Development Through Advanced Testing and Design, led by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This collaborative will address a crucial gap in the development of fusion pilot plants: the development and validation of integrated blanket technology in prototypical environments, particularly under the irradiation of 14 MeV D-T neutrons and with high-magnetic fields to demonstrate representative performance of key components and systems.

Kelli Humbird and Derek Mariscal: Fusion Energy Data Ecosystem and Repository (FEDER), led by General Atomics. This collaborative will create a centralized, federated platform that integrates data from experiments, materials science and modeling, supporting both magnetic and inertial fusion research. The project aims to standardize data formats and provide advanced tools for data discovery, analysis and visualization, enhancing collaboration and accelerating progress toward practical fusion energy.

Vlad Soukhanovskii: Advancing the maturity of liquid metal plasma-facing materials and first-wall concepts, led by the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. This collaborative will solve key technical problems with liquid metal plasma-facing materials and wall concepts so that liquid metals can be considered for fusion pilot plant designs. Research will include four main challenges: testing protective materials, understanding material properties, studying how liquid metals behave in magnetic fields and developing new metal alloys.

The INFUSE program will receive $6.1 million. With this funding, DOE selected 20 projects that accelerate private-sector fusion energy development by reducing barriers to collaboration between businesses and national laboratories or universities. LLNL’s Matt Selwood is leading the national laboratory effort collaborating with Pacific Fusion to investigate coded apertures for pulsed magnetic fusion neutron imaging.

Yet the clean energy boom is beginning to cut into this pollution.
The next phase of clean energy deployment could help China to go much further than the pledges Mr. Xi announced this week and supplant in a more significant way the dirty energy the country relies on.
In practice that means systematically building infrastructure, sophisticated supply chains and a predictable domestic market for clean energy.
Mr. Trump rolled back President Joe Biden’s flagship climate initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act, and with it billions of dollars in federal investment in the clean energy sector.","President Xi Jinping of China has long taken pleasure in poking fun at the West’s short political attention span in confronting long-term challenges such as climate change. Western diplomats told me that in 2017 he regaled a delegation with a story about how President Barack Obama had traveled to Beijing to attempt to pressure China to cut its greenhouse gas emissions faster, only to be followed by President Trump, who downplayed the threat of climate change.

The point was that in contrast to the West, where election cycles have constrained consistent climate action, China plays a long game — planning decades into the future. And it doesn’t like to make promises it can’t keep.

This week, at the United Nations General Assembly, Beijing offered the world a glimpse of how it plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the years and decades ahead with a pledge to reduce them by 7 to 10 percent by 2035.

Such a modest commitment is frustrating to environmental advocates and Western leaders alike, who see it as falling short of what the climate crisis demands. In one sense, they’re absolutely right. China is the world’s biggest polluter and single-handedly burns more than half of the world’s coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. According to my organization’s research, China would need to slash its emissions by at least 30 percent from peak levels by 2035 to align with the Paris Agreement’s target to limit average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Beijing’s new pledge clearly misses that mark.

Yet to judge China’s climate ambition by the new pledge alone is to miss the far more consequential economic story: China has become the world’s clean tech superpower. Its dominance in the solar, battery and electric vehicle industries should allow it to move faster on climate and help much of the rest of the world use fewer fossil fuels, too. While the West is distracted and divided, China is focused and surging ahead.

There are reasons for China’s choice to set a conservative target. Domestically, China’s economic slowdown, particularly in provinces reliant on heavy industry, has made its leaders wary of climate actions that could jeopardize growth.

Internationally, wavering commitments from key Western polluters, most sharply the United States and, to a lesser extent, the European Union, also affect China’s willingness to act boldly. In the absence of Western leadership, its self-interested approach tends to become more pronounced.

Yet in the decade since Mr. Obama visited Beijing to implore Mr. Xi to cut emissions more aggressively, China’s clean energy sector has evolved from a nascent industry into a powerful engine of its economy and a source of national pride.

Today, China manufactures over 80 percent of the world’s solar panels, around 75 percent of electric vehicle batteries and more than 60 percent of wind turbines. In 2023 alone, the clean tech sector accounted for 40 percent of China’s growth in gross domestic product, a staggering number in an otherwise sluggish economic environment. China now installs more solar panels annually than the rest of the world combined.

The clean tech sector is also becoming the core of China’s industrial future and global business expansion. Last year, China invested $72 billion in green manufacturing outside its borders, equivalent to about 40 percent of China’s total foreign direct investment.

The country still accounts for about 30 percent of climate-warming gases, with its vast industrial base and coal fleet responsible for 90 percent of new emissions globally since 2015. Yet the clean energy boom is beginning to cut into this pollution. The rapid deployment of renewable energy brought China’s carbon dioxide emissions down by 1 percent in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend that began in early 2024.

The next phase of clean energy deployment could help China to go much further than the pledges Mr. Xi announced this week and supplant in a more significant way the dirty energy the country relies on. For instance, while Mr. Xi’s government pledged that China would add six times the amount of wind and solar energy it had installed in 2020 and ensure that 30 percent of its energy came from nonfossil fuel sources by 2035, it is likely to go far beyond that.

Unlike the West, where climate targets are often ambitious but vulnerable to political cycles, China has aligned decarbonization with its economic growth strategy. In practice that means systematically building infrastructure, sophisticated supply chains and a predictable domestic market for clean energy.

In the West, temporary surges in ambition often give way to political backsliding, creating the illusion of progress without deep structural changes. Mr. Trump rolled back President Joe Biden’s flagship climate initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act, and with it billions of dollars in federal investment in the clean energy sector. Meanwhile, the European Union, once a champion of climate action, has been struggling with geopolitical distractions and internal divisions and, embarrassingly, was unable to present a climate pledge at the United Nations this week.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/28/opinion/28shuo/26shuo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 20:00:42.789875

Beginning in 2029, AtmosClear, a subsidiary of Houston-based Fidelis New Energy, plans to generate renewable baseload power at the Baton Rouge plant using sustainable materials like sugarcane bagasse while capturing 680,000 metric tons of biogenic CO2 annually, which ExxonMobil has agreed to inject more than a mile underground. The biogenic CO2 produced could also be used as a feedstock for low-carbon natural gas or other synthetic fuels, according to AtmosClear.

ExxonMobil’s carbon capture and storage system includes a 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline network, Class VI injection wells, and monitoring systems. “We have a number of permits under review for potential storage sites,” ExxonMobil Media Advisor Margot Armentor said in a release. “We’re in the early stages of determining whether these sites will be suitable CO2 storage locations,” said Armentor.

In April, tech giant Microsoft signed a 15-year agreement with Fidelis AtmosClear for carbon dioxide removal as part of a voluntary commitment the tech giant made to become carbon neutral by 2030. Microsoft has entered into several carbon dioxide removal (CDR) purchase agreements with various companies since 2020. Other technology companies are also pursuing voluntary carbon removal strategies, often with net-zero and carbon-negative goals that rely on buying CDR credits.

Louisiana State University Professor Richard Hughes said Lousiana’s geology is almost perfect for carbon capture and storage. “The way the interaction of the rivers and the Gulf of Mexico has happened over Millenia is we’ve got these thick sands, and the river moves back and forth so that the sands are covered by shale. The shale is kind of an impermeable piece where nothing can move up or down, and the things in the sand just stay there, and we have a sequence of these sand layers from 20,000 feet down almost to the surface,” Hughes said in a YouTube video.

President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” preserved and expanded 45Q tax credits for carbon capture and storage, which were initially established in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump’s bill simultaneously canceled billions in Department of Energy awards to companies developing decarbonization projects, however, as reported by The Center Square.

Fidelis AtmosClear plans to begin construction in 2026 and expects to begin producing baseline power and biogenic CO2 in 2029. The company said it estimates the project will result in over $800 million of investment and approximately 75 permanent and 600 construction jobs. The plant will also support a significant revival of forestry management jobs impacted by mill closures in the area, Fidelis said.

Will Green, president and CEO of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, said in an op-ed Friday published by Nola.com that there is more than $20 billion in proposed CCS investment across the state.

Louisiana, North Dakota, Wyoming, West Virginia and Arizona are the only states to a have achieved primacy for carbon capture and storage from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which means they have taken over the day-to-day responsibility of issuing permits for Class VI wells, monitoring compliance, and taking enforcement actions when violations occur.

The Louisiana legislature developed carbon capture and storage policies through numerous bills passed during the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions.

And he’s just getting started with his intervention into U.S. electricity markets, Zack Colman reports.

The Energy Department and the White House National Energy Dominance Council are considering new orders and a more aggressive effort to keep large, around-the-clock fossil fuel plants from closing — pushing deeper into decisions traditionally left up to power companies or state utility commissions.

Some plants might have to stay open even if they are unprofitable, potentially driving up consumers’ electric bills.

Trump and his top policy brass — Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum — say the decadeslong transition from coal to a diverse range of power sources including renewable energy has tipped the United States into an energy crisis that can’t be undone without mining and burning more coal, as Hannah Northey reports.

Zack reports that White House officials fear Trump’s vision of an energy-hungry, tech-driven economy could come crashing down unless “baseload” coal plants slated for retirement stay open while regulators exempt others from federal air quality standards.

Coal has been on the losing end of electricity markets that dispatch the cheapest sources of power generation first. Natural gas, wind and solar power have been the cheapest sources. Old, inefficient coal plants are now among the most expensive for power companies to operate, and they pollute more than other sources.

Less complicated politically is Trump’s promise to bring down electricity prices, which continue to climb in most regions of the country.

‘There is no emergency here’

Wright confirmed at an event hosted by Reuters this week that the administration is “absolutely” exploring ways to keep baseload plants open, including more secretarial orders.

Wright has used that emergency authority to keep three power-generating units open: a coal-fired plant in Michigan and two oil-fired units of a plant in Pennsylvania. He used similar authority to keep a Maryland oil plant running and allow it to exceed its operating limit, at the regional grid operator’s request.

The Trump administration is looking at using the Defense Production Act to prop up plants financially and ordering plants to stay open in the name of preserving capacity for peak demand.

Projections for rapidly rising electricity demand is putting pressure on regional power grids. But opponents of the administration’s use of emergency power say it’s just adding costs onto consumer electricity bills.

“There’s no emergency here,” said Ari Peskoe, director of the electricity law initiative at Harvard Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program, who argued that Wright is assuming a persistent energy emergency in the country.

David Patton, a grid analyst, told one regional power organization — the Midcontinent Independent System Operator — this month that Wright’s order to keep a Michigan coal plant open “was costly and not needed to meet MISO’s reliability requirements.”

Ditching the science

The Environmental Protection Agency may be forced to abandon its scientific argument for scrapping the finding that drives climate regulation, Jean Chemnick writes.

That argument, drawn from a Department of Energy report that downplayed the risks of climate change, is facing pushback and a lawsuit over how the group that wrote the report was formed. The group, made up of scientists widely seen as climate contrarians who were handpicked by Secretary Chris Wright, has since been disbanded, throwing the report in limbo.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t play much of a role at all in the final rule,” said Jody Freeman, director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School.

“If they’re not smart and they leave it in there,” Freeman said, “they’re just inviting a court to say, ‘You ignored the overwhelming science, and under arbitrary and capricious review, you can’t.’”

US prepares to step up on nuclear fuel

DOE is set to release at least $900 million to fund domestic uranium enrichment projects to fuel the nation’s nuclear fleet before imports from Russia are cut off, Brian Dabbs and Francisco “A.J.” Camacho write.

The money could come by the end of September, sources told Brian and A.J. The U.S. imports up to a quarter of its uranium from Russia and has only one company currently producing the type of uranium that large reactors use. Some in the industry see the federal funding as just the tip of what’s needed.

Lee Robinson, chief operating officer for General Matter, a nuclear fuel enrichment company, said this week at an Atlantic Council event that the U.S. nuclear fleet could run into “shortage territory” in the coming years.

A ray of hope for plastics talks

Through the gloom of another failed global plastics treaty summit, close observers say they saw a glimmer of hope emanating from China, Leonie Cater reports.

In its closing speech, the world’s biggest plastic producer subtly changed its language on tackling the plastic crisis, acknowledging the problem has to do with the entire life cycle of plastic. It comes as Beijing moves to fill a vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal from global engagement in environmental talks.

The plastics industry accounts for 3.4 percent of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Plastic production is on track to almost triple by 2060.

Trump and the GOP have other reasons to be anxious over the potential outcome of the 2026 elections.
Even factoring in red-state redistricting, the current numbers suggest that the Democrats have a reasonable chance of taking control of the House after the 2026 elections.
(I’ll have more to say about this in Part 2 of “A Government Most Fowl” as it concerns messaging.)
In Part 2 of “A Government Most Fowl”, I’ll discuss how the midterms run-up should be used to reset the clean energy and environment debates in response to today’s political realities.","Venice has its pigeons and Capistrano its swallows. Flying over the White House and Capitol Hill these days are birds of a different feather – chickens. For the president and the GOP Congress, they’ll soon be coming home to roost.

Although all elections are important, some are more so than others. History will look back on the 2026 midterms as among the most momentous of the modern era. The reason for this can be summed up in three simple words: Donald John Trump.

The president so dominates the executive and legislative branches that the 2026 elections will be a referendum on his handling of the economy and the affairs of state. Trump claims to have won a popular mandate at the polls last November. It’s FAKE News.

Trump’s winning margin in 2024 was less than 1.5 percent of the popular vote. Although beating Harris by 16 percent in the Electoral College vote, it’s a flawed number in that it fails to reflect popular sentiment and how evenly divided the nation seems to be. The narrow majorities in both the House and Senate are further proof that America is split nearly in half between Trump supporters and everyone else.

If presidential elections are examples of regime change, then the electionof Donald J. Trump in 2024 is an example of radical culture change.

Trump doesn’t have a popular mandate. He has a license given him by the Republicans in Congress and the conservatives on the Supreme Court to do almost anything he wants. The Republican Senate has rubber-stamped its approval of what many believe to be the least competent and most ethically compromised cabinet since the Harding administration.

The House fiddles while the president impounds the monies Congress appropriates, guts agencies established by law, and stops projects that have attracted billions of dollars of private investment because he thinks wind turbines are ugly and coal “clean” and “beautiful”. (What if we were to gold plate the wind turbines, Mr. President?)

Without understanding what was actually being done, the Republicans in Congress hailed Elon Musk and his chainsaw for cutting government programs they oversee and are responsible for, because they contained words like climate, clean energy, environment, minority, vaccine, scientific or medical research, equity, and justice.

Government reform by a keyword search has predictably resulted in major gaps in the operation of federal agencies and the implementation of various programs and policies. Because weather and climate change are closely connected, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cut critical forecasting work. It suspended tracking programs at the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

What does it say when an administration fires the independent inspectors general of nearly every cabinet department and doesn’t replace them? What does it tell you about the relationship of an administration to the truth when the government attempts to overwrite history to conform to nationalistic myths or censors and removes scientific information from federal websites because it conflicts with the fancies of the president?

The first nine months of Trump’s 2nd regime have turned the federal government feral.

The Department of Justice attacks any individual, group, or institution that deigns to disagree with the president and his worldview. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Trump has been able to wing his way out of most problems by crying FAKE NEWS, using misdirection, firing the messenger, or threatening to use the full might of the federal government to prosecute an opponent.

The consequences of Trumpian economics and government reforms are just now showing up in the economy. Given all that’s happened over the past eight months, it’s easy to forget that the impacts of many of Trump’s policy and program reforms, tariffs, and deportation programs are in the earliest stages of implementation.

Delays between implementation and impact are the result of various factors. In the case of rising prices, pre-tariff inventories and efforts by companies to “eat” the new import costs for as long as possible have tamped down pricing. However, companies are running out of options.

At some point, the truth catches up to all of us – Mr. Trump included.

A July survey by KPMG found that “83 percent of businesses expect to raise prices in the next six months, with nearly three quarters already passing on some of the costs.” According to the company: “The full impact on consumers is likely still to come.”

Two of Trump’s most vaunted accomplishments – tariffs and the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB) are among the reasons the president’s approval ratings are trending south. According to the Pew Research Center, 61 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s tariff policies, while 38 percent approve. The disapproval number for OBBB is 46 percent, while 32 percent approve, with 23 percent being unsure. (See Figure 1)

A Washington Post/IPSOS poll released on September 18th confirmed Pew’s earlier findings. Trump’s approval within Republican ranks was also shown to be dropping, especially among “younger Republican and GOP women.”

What could also prove problematic for Republicans in the 2026 congressional elections is the view of a majority of adult Americans (53 percent) that Trump “is making the federal government work worse, while only about half as many (27 percent) say he is making government better.” The numbers reflect lessening support for Trump’s handling of the federal bureaucracy.

Trump is underwater in terms of voter approval, even for his handling of immigration and crime. Both are issues he has traditionally scored high on. Although the surveys show predictable partisan splits, the loss of favorability amongst independent voters could prove the difference in 2026.

Trump’s response to the poll numbers is – as it always is – to blame the polls and the bias of organizations responsible for them. The president spares no one. In a recent interview on FOX News with Martha McCallum, he blamed FOX for bad polling.

There’s going to come a time when claims of FAKE NEWS and disingenuous pollsters will not outweigh the truth of weakening job markets, rising prices, and dysfunctional federal agencies.

The reasons behind Trump’s loss of support are real rather than theoretical. If younger Republicans lose faith in the president’s economic policies, it’s because recent graduates are being hit hardest by the softening labor market.

China’s reduced imports of US farm products are negatively impacting the nation’s agricultural economy. Not only are farmers unable to sell their soybeans, but they aren’t buying new combines, harvesters, and tractors. The loss of low-wage immigrant labor to harvest crops and pack meat means a rise in food prices.

Mr. Trump could fire every government statistician and replace them with MAGA acolytes, and it wouldn’t change the reality of rising prices and the increasing concerns of voters. Trump’s rebrand of his OBBB as the Working Families Tax Cut is unlikely to take voters’ minds off the fact that their dollar is buying less than it did a month ago, or that they’re paying more for health insurance, when they can afford it at all.

Trump and the GOP have other reasons to be anxious over the potential outcome of the 2026 elections. Historically, midterm elections are notoriously brutal to a sitting president’s party.

Known as the midterm curse, the party controlling the White House has lost an average of 28 seats in the House of Representatives and four seats in the Senate over the 22 off-year elections between 1934 and 2018. (The 2022 midterms did not follow the law of averages as the Democrats lost just six seats in the House while gaining one in the Senate.)

The generic congressional ballot shows Democrats with a lead over Republicans of between three and eight percent, indicating that partisanship is still a major factor in how Americans are likely to vote in 2026. The 2018 generic ballot showed a spread in favor of the Democrats of between seven and 13 percentage points.

The 2018 elections resulted in “a net total of 41 seats from the total number of seats they had won in the 2016 elections.” It was the Democrats’ “largest gain of House seats since the post-Watergate 1974 elections, when they picked up 49 seats.” Trump’s approval ratings at the time hovered around 50 percent.

Even factoring in red-state redistricting, the current numbers suggest that the Democrats have a reasonable chance of taking control of the House after the 2026 elections. The likelihood that the Dems will gain the net of four seats needed to flip the Senate is less.

If the overwhelming majority of economists and political analysts are right, the negative consequences of the president’s policies will only worsen between now and November 2026. If the past is prologue, then the midterm elections will return control of the House to Democrats. From an environmental perspective, Democratic control of the House is a net good thing.

Trump’s opposition to clean energy sources and environmental regulation is so virulent that it’s resulting in the administration working against itself. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has leveraged billions of dollars of private investments in red states – ironically, more in red than blue. One example is the recently raided, under-construction Hyundai battery plant in Georgia.

The White House has rebuffed efforts of red state Republicans to continue the programs. GOP proponents have partly argued that the administration could take credit for it. Trump had no problem taking credit for infrastructure projects contracted for by the Biden administration. Why not for the IRA? (I’ll have more to say about this in Part 2 of “A Government Most Fowl” as it concerns messaging.)

Nothing is more critical in terms of federal climate policy than slowing the administration’s cancellation of renewable energy programs and the unwinding of environmental regulations back to a time before Nixon.

The 2026 midterm elections are an opportunity to effectively slow the Trump administration’s onslaught against clean energy and the environment. In the run-up to the election, the clean energy and environmental communities must keep their collective eyes on the prize – a Democratic House majority.

If I were asked to suggest a phrase that best describes what the midterm election will be about, I’d put “back to basics” at the top of my list. Even in good times, elections are about the economy.

Contrary to what Trump says and demands his administration agree with, people are worried about inflation, jobs, and whether tariffs are worth their sacrifice. Seeing your utility bill go up five percent or more in a month isn’t FAKE NEWS. It’s a problem for the average family of four.

Part of people’s core concern is whether the government will be there for them in times of emergency – personal or societal. A majority of voters believe Trump isn’t the problem solver he claims to be. In fact, they’ll soon be wondering if he isn’t the problem giver.

Voters in 2026 are going to be looking for answers to bread-and-butter issues. It will be up to the clean energy and environmental communities to help frame the debate in a manner that resonates with voters, particularly independents and conservative youth and builds a foundation for the 2028 elections.

In Part 2 of “A Government Most Fowl”, I’ll discuss how the midterms run-up should be used to reset the clean energy and environment debates in response to today’s political realities. One is that Trump has set the terms of the debate, which means keeping it simple and less philosophical.

The GOP budget from the House Appropriations Committee would scale back funding for Maine environmental regulators.

The Natural Resources Council of Maine says that would put clean air and water at risk.

Also read:

Leaders with the NRCM say the cuts could affect not only Maine’s environment, but also the state’s tourism industry.

""Our waters are not clean enough to swim in,” Natural Resources Council of Maine Federal Policy Advocate Anya Fetcher said. “If our air is more polluted, then there will be less of an incentive, less of an interest in coming to Maine to enjoy all of the beauty that our state has to offer.""

Leaders say these proposed cuts would represent the most extreme rollback of environmental funding in decades.

In the meantime, a budget approved on the Senate side, where Susan Collins chairs the Appropriations Committee, would leave more EPA funding intact.

The EPA released the following statement:

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-09-26 21:30:01+00:00,Washington Examiner,Don't bail out Joe Biden's broken subsidies - Washington Examiner,Rep. Eric Burlison,,,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/op-eds/3827047/dont-bail-joe-biden-obamacare-broken-subsidies/,"I can promise you that Biden’s subsidies do not fit the bill.
And the best part is, in this case, doing so requires us to do nothing at all: Republicans must simply allow Joe Biden’s disastrous temporary subsidies to expire.
Even without Biden’s COVID subsidies, taxpayers will still cover 80% of the typical enrollee’s premium —up from 68% in 2014.
That’s because Obamacare subsidies cap what enrollees pay, fully insulating them from rising healthcare costs and shifting costs directly onto taxpayers.
The truth is that when Americans are actually presented with the facts of the issue at hand, polling shows the majority of Americans want Congress to let these subsidies expire.","Layered on top of already generous subsidies that are not going away, these Biden-era handouts force taxpayers to foot the bill for fully subsidized health care for more than nine million Obamacare recipients. Not a single Republican has ever voted for these subsidies or to extend them. None should do so now. Democrats themselves couldn’t even secure support within their own ranks to make these subsidies permanent. In fact, former Senator Joe Manchin opposed their inclusion in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, citing fiscal concerns.

The question now is whether Republicans will draw a clear line in the sand or settle for a position no stronger than Joe Manchin’s. In November, the people gave President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress a clear mandate to deliver on the conservative agenda. I can promise you that Biden’s subsidies do not fit the bill.

It is incumbent upon us to actually do the work of the people and restore some semblance of fiscal responsibility. And the best part is, in this case, doing so requires us to do nothing at all: Republicans must simply allow Joe Biden’s disastrous temporary subsidies to expire.

Much like our fight to restore work requirements in Medicaid — a deeply popular and common-sense policy — Republicans again have the opportunity to take a principled conservative stand to protect taxpayers in the face of fabricated pressure campaigns. Dubious polling pushed by Democrats and insurance lobbyists suggests that the midterms could be a bloodbath for Republicans if they allow Biden’s COVID subsidies to expire. “Premiums will double,” they say. “Millions will lose coverage.”

Here’s the reality.

42% of Obamacare enrollees are on fully subsidized plans as of 2024. Another 28% pay a premium of $50 or less. When Biden’s subsidies expire, the average enrollee (someone earning 200 percent of the federal poverty level) will only have to pay $32 a week for a plan — about the cost of a median DoorDash order. Someone earning 100% of the poverty level would only have to pay $3.45 — the cost for a cup of coffee.

Even without Biden’s COVID subsidies, taxpayers will still cover 80% of the typical enrollee’s premium —up from 68% in 2014. That’s because Obamacare subsidies cap what enrollees pay, fully insulating them from rising healthcare costs and shifting costs directly onto taxpayers.

If Republicans cave to the Left’s demands, it will be entirely clear that generous taxpayer-funded pandemic healthcare subsidies will be here to stay; almost four million Americans will lose their employer coverage, crowded out by artificially low government-backed premiums.

Free market principles be damned.

This, of course, doesn’t even scratch the surface of the systematically broken Biden subsidies, which cost taxpayers $30 billion annually in improper payments. Biden’s Covid-19 credits are direct cash payments from the United States Treasury to health insurers. Every customer is a fresh check, providing a direct incentive for insurance brokers to collect as many enrollees as possible, often without their knowledge. With $0 premium plans becoming widely available, many enrollees never see a bill.

In 2024 alone, nearly 12 million enrollees filed no claims. Between 2021 and 2024, the number of zero-claim enrollees tripled. As a result, taxpayers sent tens of billions of dollars to insurers even though no care had ever been given.

Is it our position that taxpayer money is best spent on corporate welfare for insurance companies that provide nothing in return? Do we earnestly believe that the American taxpayer will look favorably upon us for layering more waste, fraud, and abuse on an already broken healthcare system?

The truth is that when Americans are actually presented with the facts of the issue at hand, polling shows the majority of Americans want Congress to let these subsidies expire. So let them.

If Democrats want to hold the government hostage because we refuse to burden taxpayers with another trillion-dollar list of demands that would erase all the progress Republicans have made over the past eight months, let them.

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR FTC FIRING LAWSUIT TEEING UP CHALLENGE TO 90-YEAR-OLD PRECEDENT

Republicans were not sent to Washington to rubber-stamp Joe Biden’s COVID-era policies, allowing inflation to spiral further out of control. Our broken healthcare system does deserve attention, but monthly subsidy checks to insurance companies while shifting rising healthcare costs onto taxpayers isn’t “making health care more affordable.”

If politicians are genuinely interested in raising the living standards of Americans, spending measures that pile more debt onto the backs of working families, suppress free market competition, and incentivize government dependency shouldn’t even be entertained.

The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges.
A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company.
Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.
A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump’s administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,” said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important’ to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,” the official said, adding: “We’re trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don’t believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,” Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

So once we're past this tax credit, pull out your crystal ball, what what what do you think the EV market looks like ahead, Kevin?
Uh California is one we've been watching, accounting for about 30% of EV sales last year.
and there have been talk that they would be replacing the tax credit themselves, but recently it just came out that they're not going to be replacing that tax credit.
Yeah, so there is a used EV tax credit.","Well, August saw the highest sales of electric vehicles this year, up 19.4% from July and since January EV sales are up 61%, but some industry analysts fear those high voltage sales could be short circuited after tax credits for EV buyers expire on September 30th. Join me now is Kevin Roberts, Carguru's Director of Economic and Market Intelligence. Kevin, good to see you as always. Uh maybe start big picture, Kevin, you know, what is the story with tax credits? They've they've boosted sales so much.

Kevin, why are they going away? Explain that for us. And have folks been, you know, have you seen them rushing in ahead of that deadline?

Yeah, so as part of the big beautiful bill, uh the expiration of the tax credits was pulled ahead to September 30th. and once that was announced, we really started to see the momentum start to pick up from consumers looking to get ahead of that tax credit expiration. So that's both on the purchase of vehicles and also it's helping on EV leasing as well. So, uh we've been I I've been calling it a EV crescendo uh as consumers really look to get ahead of uh get their sales in uh before that credit expires.

And Kevin, you know, um we did see Tesla update its website, um saying, you know, order by September 30th. This included even a a countdown clock on the site. Kevin, how are how are some of the other auto makers? Do we know? Do we have line of sight there? How are they trying to kind of build awareness, get people in the door in the showroom?

Well, I mean, I can say from our data, you can see that the sales rate has picked up. and not only that, the amount of, you know, the number of EVs on dealer lots has been declining and the market day supply has dropped quite significantly. Uh from where we were, you know, at the end of June, 108 days supply and now we're under 45 days supply. So, the message is clearly getting out to consumers and they're looking to kind of snap up those EVs before that credit expires.

So now bottom line, Kevin. So, you know, now let's let's look ahead. So once we're past this tax credit, pull out your crystal ball, what what what do you think the EV market looks like ahead, Kevin? What what would you expect to see?

So, it's it's unknown. I I've been taking a look at what happened in other markets where tax credits expired. If you look to Europe, you know, you saw double digit declines uh of EV sales afterwards. Uh California is one we've been watching, accounting for about 30% of EV sales last year. and there have been talk that they would be replacing the tax credit themselves, but recently it just came out that they're not going to be replacing that tax credit. So a large EV market that we could be seeing uh a drop in sales volume in.

Are there certain EV names, Kevin, EV makers that in your opinion, hey, these guys, they they may be better positioned than others in a sort of a post- tax credit world.

So, normally, I would have assumed that automakers might be looking to plug the gap themselves, but we're in a post- tariff environment and that tariff tax bill they're currently consuming most of themselves right now. So I don't know how much automakers are going to be able to really kind of foot the bill uh as those EV tax credits go away.

And and Kevin, by the way, what what does the the used market for EVs look like? You have line of sight there?

Yeah, so there is a used EV tax credit. It's for vehicles under $25,000. So we've been seeing an acceleration in that market as well. Not as much as what we've been seeing in the new vehicle market, but there has been an uptick uh in that used EV market and we've been seeing a lot more used EVs particularly get under that $25,000 threshold. And so it's a small but growing market.

We've been talking here about EV's, but let's kind of like broaden out this discussion a bit. Look at that larger car market, uh Kevin, so gas, hybrid vehicles. I saw a JD Power site is saying, um, they think sales is expected to actually contract in September. Do you agree with that, Kevin? And if so, is that, what would be the reasons for that? Is that just high higher rates, higher prices, both?

I I mean, we've been seen almost a pull ahead in vehicle sales the past couple months. We saw that at the end of March, early April when the tariffs were first announced, there was a lot of kind of looking to get ahead of those pre-tariff prices. Uh we saw, you know, an acceleration of sales in July and August as well, um as consumers, you know, didn't see prices increase and were looking to get out there as well. So, there is a concern about potential pull ahead of sales volume. Uh but when and where that might strike is a little bit uncertain at this point.

Kevin, you you mentioned tariffs, just want to end here on that. Um, and just your sense of how they factor into this discussion because you have trade agreements, frameworks with the UK, EU, Japan. I mean, they they do provide for this um, the 15% tariffs. Is that in your opinion, Kevin, is that a, is that manageable for the industry?

So, we've already been seeing automakers uh absorb a lot more of the tariff costs than what I initially expected. I think most people were initially expecting. We can see with trade data, the tariff rates are there and the tariffs are taking effect. Uh so the trade deals that are going to be announced will help to kind of bring down that rate. uh and will provide more room for automakers to potentially absorb those tariff costs for a longer period of time than what we might have initially thought when the tariffs were initially brought out in March.

Kevin, great to see you as always. Thank you, sir.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be ""very small"" — less than 10% — and serve as ""a cash buffer"" for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it "" the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world "" in a speech this week at the United Nations. ""If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

Those provisions are the basis of opposition from Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts, a group of 480 open shop contractors and related businesses.
“We are very aware of the extreme change in the amount of federal funding that is available now,” Murphy said.
“And one thing I just want to say on that is that we should not let the lack of federal funding stop us from implementing these, at the very least, these energy assessments.
And then see where we can actually implement the changes, or where we can get funding from.”","BOSTON – Estimating that the federal government’s turn away from clean energy projects has eliminated at least 20,000 jobs here, organized labor groups on Thursday renewed their push to create more work by requiring energy assessments in public schools and universities across Massachusetts.

Massachusetts AFL-CIO, the Climate Jobs Massachusetts Action coalition and a handful of individual locals were among those who voiced support for a bill (H 3476 / S 2275) that would require energy and air quality audits for public schools, universities and colleges.

The assessments would estimate the costs of energy improvements as well as greenhouse gas reductions that would result if improvements were made, and it would establish a new Healthy and Sustainable Schools Office within the Department of Energy Resources that could implement the recommended changes.

“Let’s identify the oldest boilers, the worst air ducts and crumbling insulation, and let’s fix them with highly-trained workers and responsible contractors that are going to do a clean job and keep costs down. Let’s find the schools that have the greatest potential for solar panels and thermal energy networks, and install high-quality systems that will save districts money over time and get their buildings closer to net zero,” Ryan Murphy, executive director of Climate Jobs Massachusetts Action, said. “These upgrades would save money. More efficient heating systems, combined with generation and heat transfer solutions like solar and geothermal, mean lower bills for schools and less demand on our grid.”

The bill would also require contractors bidding on the work to agree to comply with the prevailing wage law, any project labor agreements and to ensure their workforce includes a minimum number of workers who went through a registered apprenticeship program. Those provisions are the basis of opposition from Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts, a group of 480 open shop contractors and related businesses.

“We certainly support the concept of healthy schools and the work that will be involved to create them, but we do oppose this bill because of some of the requirements that create unreasonable bidding requirements that will limit competition and workforce participation,” association President Greg Beeman told the committee. He added, “This is untenable, and will result in open shops not being able to bid on this work, reducing the overall number of bidders.”

Murphy told the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy that clean energy projects “unfortunately, have been hit hard by recent federal government decisions” and estimated that the federal government “has killed at least 20,000 planned clean energy jobs here in Massachusetts so far.” He and Chrissy Lynch, president of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, pitched the energy audit bill as a way to replace those job opportunities.

“We do not have a worker shortage in our energy unions. We have a high-quality job site shortage,” Lynch said. “This bill would put energy workers back to work and allow training centers to take in more apprentices.”

The Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy Committee advanced a redraft of the legislation last session as part of a larger bill that focused on transportation infrastructure. The committee advanced that bill to the House Ways and Means Committee in early April 2024, and it advanced no further, according to a committee summary of the latest version.

Co-chair Sen. Michael Barrett asked Murphy and Lynch about the bill’s proposed funding mechanism. The bill simply directs the state to “appropriate funds to a revolving fund to finance activities authorized under this act” and to “apply for, receive, and accept funding from local and federal sources.”

“The one area of resistance we always get in this general domain is if we’re imposing unfunded mandates,” Barrett said.

Murphy said the Healthy and Sustainable Schools Office created under the bill would “search for or collect the available funding, whether through federal grants or state funding that might be available” and mentioned revenues from the state’s surtax on higher-income households as one potential source.

“We are very aware of the extreme change in the amount of federal funding that is available now,” Murphy said. “And one thing I just want to say on that is that we should not let the lack of federal funding stop us from implementing these, at the very least, these energy assessments. And then see where we can actually implement the changes, or where we can get funding from.”",https://i0.wp.com/atholdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/56b26f64-da4c-4778-af22-6dd98245bc7a.jpg?fit=750%2C500&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-26 18:01:42.914681

For instance, discussions point to a 15% headwind in sales for 2025 but underscore long-term resilience through technological advancements.
Industry groups warn of job losses in the tens of thousands if sales falter, echoing sentiments in Pickup Truck Talk.","As the federal electric-vehicle tax credit hurtles toward its expiration on September 30, 2025, dealerships across the U.S. are witnessing an unprecedented surge in sales. Buyers are scrambling to secure rebates of up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on used ones, a policy originally enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act but now curtailed by recent legislative changes. This deadline has transformed showrooms into bustling hubs, with inventory depleting faster than anticipated, according to reports from industry analysts.

The rush isn’t just anecdotal; data from automakers like Tesla and Ford indicate a spike in orders, with some models selling out weeks ahead of schedule. This phenomenon echoes past incentive phaseouts, but the scale here is amplified by years of pent-up demand fostered by the credit itself. Yet, beneath the frenzy lies a deeper question: Could this short-term boom inadvertently lay the groundwork for sustained EV growth without government subsidies?

The Surge and Its Immediate Effects

Analysts at NerdWallet note that the credit’s end marks a pivotal shift, potentially pricing out budget-conscious consumers who relied on it to make EVs affordable. In states like California and New York, where adoption rates are highest, the loss could lead to a temporary dip in sales, with projections from the Internal Revenue Service suggesting a 20% to 30% drop in the immediate post-deadline period.

However, the current buying spree is flooding roads with more electric vehicles than ever, which could create a self-reinforcing cycle. As per insights from GeekWire, this influx might accelerate infrastructure development, from charging stations to grid enhancements, as municipalities respond to heightened demand. Industry insiders argue that the sheer volume of new EV owners will generate organic advocacy through word-of-mouth and real-world demonstrations of the technology’s viability.

Irony in the Incentive’s Demise

Ironically, the rebate’s expiration could force manufacturers to innovate more aggressively on cost reduction, a point emphasized in recent coverage by Detroit Free Press. Without the crutch of federal aid, companies like General Motors and Rivian are already pivoting toward cheaper battery chemistries and streamlined production, aiming to compete on price alone. This mirrors historical patterns in consumer electronics, where subsidies kickstarted markets that later thrived independently.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect a mixed sentiment among users, with some lamenting the end of rebates as a blow to affordability, while others highlight how the rush is exposing more drivers to EVs’ benefits, potentially normalizing them in everyday use. For instance, discussions point to a 15% headwind in sales for 2025 but underscore long-term resilience through technological advancements.

Global Comparisons and Domestic Ripples

Looking abroad, Canada’s experience offers a cautionary yet optimistic parallel. As detailed in Electric Autonomy, provinces like Quebec have doubled down on incentives, sustaining growth, while others scaling back saw initial slumps followed by rebounds driven by private investment. In the U.S., similar dynamics are at play, with states like Texas and Florida poised for losses in the billions, according to The News Wheel, yet this could spur localized policies to fill the void.

The broader economic implications extend to jobs and supply chains. Experts cited in CBT News warn of potential disruptions in manufacturing, but they also predict that the rebate-fueled boom will leave a legacy of skilled workers and established factories, reducing dependency on imports from China.

Long-Term Adoption Catalysts

Delving deeper, the irony highlighted by GeekWire centers on behavioral economics: The deadline creates a sense of urgency that not only boosts immediate adoption but also builds a critical mass of users who influence peers. Surveys from Cox Automotive, referenced in X discussions, show dealer expectations dipping short-term but rebounding as EVs prove their worth in fuel savings and performance.

Moreover, environmental advocates argue that this shift tests the market’s maturity. With falling battery costs—down 80% since 2010, per Kiplinger—EVs are nearing price parity with gas vehicles, potentially rendering subsidies obsolete. The rush might thus serve as a bridge to a subsidy-free era, where innovation and consumer preference drive growth.

Challenges Ahead for the Industry

Still, challenges loom. The IRS’s recent clarification, as reported by NPR, allows some flexibility for deals in progress, but post-September, affordability barriers could widen disparities, particularly in rural areas with sparse charging networks. Industry groups warn of job losses in the tens of thousands if sales falter, echoing sentiments in Pickup Truck Talk.

Yet, optimists point to Singapore’s model, where rebate extensions, as covered in The Straits Times, have sustained momentum without full reliance on incentives. In the U.S., this could translate to hybrid strategies blending private incentives with public infrastructure pushes.

A Pivotal Moment for Electric Mobility

Ultimately, the end of the EV rebate represents a litmus test for the sector’s resilience. As AInvest analysis suggests, while it reverses a decade of momentum, the last-minute rush might inject enough vehicles into the ecosystem to tip the scales toward widespread acceptance. For insiders, the key will be monitoring how automakers adapt, from Tesla’s energy storage pivot amid sales headwinds—noted in X posts—to legacy players like Ford doubling down on affordable models.

This transition, fraught with uncertainty, could redefine electric mobility, proving that sometimes, the removal of a safety net forces the industry to soar on its own merits. As one analyst put it, the rebate’s sunset might just herald a brighter dawn for EVs.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-8033c0b4-2ad8-4fb9-a049-c8f531fa4615.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 18:02:51.539133

It’s climate change because if it goes higher or lower, whatever the hell happens, there’s climate change.
Stephen Lacey: Yeah, but the climate activists marching at Climate Week are leaning into the culture wars.","For the last decade and a half, the loudest voices in the climate movement have treated decarbonization like a moral crusade: ban gas stoves, declare climate emergencies, punish fossil fuel companies.

But those tactics don’t lower utility bills or build durable political coalitions. And now, amidst a radical shift in U.S. politics where the economy dominates, there’s a growing call for a pragmatic reset.

This week, we dissect two critiques of climate politics. In a Bloomberg essay, Michael Liebreich argues it’s time to ditch the guilt and doom, stop chasing impossible targets, and focus on fast, affordable progress. Alex Trembath of the Breakthrough Institute says the “climate hawk” is an endangered species in U.S. politics.

We’ll walk through their arguments, and debate what a reset in climate politics and policy might look like.

Plus, another reset in finance. Generate Capital and Greenbacker, two of the most important clean energy investors, are both under new leadership. Both companies are re-evaluating their approaches to the market. What do these shakeups say about the state of climate capital and the “missing middle” of projects that still struggle to get financing?

Stephen Lacey: Jigar, you had a birthday party last night. How was it?

Jigar Shah: It was a manufactured success.

Stephen Lacey: When is your birthday actually?

Jigar Shah: It’s August 30th, but we had this party last year and people really liked it, so we did it again this year and it was even better.

Katherine Hamilton: You’re so lucky that you have a birthday in a nice month.

Jigar Shah: It is true.

Katherine Hamilton: My birthday is the middle of February and nobody celebrates my birthday.

Jigar Shah: Oh, well, now we’re going to have to make it our mission to celebrate your birthday.

Stephen Lacey: Well, good. I’m glad you were out last night, Jigar, because the later you stay out, the punchier you are, so…

Jigar Shah: Oh, no. Not good.

Stephen Lacey: Good entertainment value.

From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. This week, do we need a climate reset? For the last decade and a half, the loudest voices in the climate movement treated decarbonization kind of like a moral crusade. Ban gas stoves, declare emergencies, punish fossil fuel companies. But those tactics don’t lower utility bills or win durable majorities. And now, amidst a radical shift in US politics, there’s a growing call for a pragmatic reset. We’re going to look at some of the critiques and ideas for shifting strategy, plus we’re going to talk about another reset, this one in finance, Generate Capital and Greenbacker are two of the most important clean energy investors, have swapped out CEOs and they’re rethinking their strategies. What is behind the shakeup?

I’m Stephen Lacey, executive editor of Latitude Media. Welcome, all. As always, Katherine Hamilton and Jigar Shah by my side, well, virtually by my side, I guess, staring at me through a computer screen. Katherine Hamilton is the chair of 38 North Solutions. Hey there.

Katherine Hamilton: Hey.

Stephen Lacey: You’ve got some really interesting tools behind you. It looks like you’re, I don’t know, in a shaker village or something.

Katherine Hamilton: I always think it looks like a Game of Thrones, some chamber. Yeah, I put a lot of found objects in my house.

Stephen Lacey: Nice. Where do you go find those?

Katherine Hamilton: Tool sheds on my property.

Stephen Lacey: Well, you’re not at Climate Week, but it sounded like a busy week for you. You ventured down from the mountains into the city.

Katherine Hamilton: I did very briefly, but I was so jealous because I kept seeing all the cool reports coming out of Climate Week where y’all were.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, big week. Always a big week. Jigar Shah is the co-founder of Multiplier. He’s the former director of DOE’s Loan Programs Office. How is New York Climate Week this year, Jigar? It’s often called like a mini-cop because you’ve got tens of thousands of people flocking to the city, you’ve got the UN General Assembly. Did it feel any different than past years, given the political circumstances?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I do think people are very hopeful. I think they’re probably mistaking that for defiant. When I talk to people, the level of clarity around what they want to invest in and what gives them the most sort of confidence in this moment seems lacking. And so there was a lot of great conversations around where the federal nexus is and where you can actually continue to deploy at scale and some of the things that are going on around us, like the governors who all gave big speeches at the PJM Conference on Monday. And so I think there’s a lot of those conversations. I’d say that there were less international conversations, the rooms that I were in, but it was great.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, it kind of depends on the room you’re in because you can have a choose your own adventure experience at New York Climate Week. You can go to lots of events around solutions, infrastructure, energy. A lot of the stuff that we talk about here, you could follow along with the formal UN process where countries this year were handing in their pledges late. You can get as doomery as you want too. You can go to events like the Make Billionaires Pay March that happened this week that kind of blended a coalition of anti-ICE, anti-capitalism, pro-Palestinian, and anti-fossil fuel activism. That always feels a little confusing to me. And so that actually is a good backdrop for what I want to talk about today. There’s this growing set of critiques around pieces of the climate movement and calls for a reset in how we negotiate around climate policy and actually message around this stuff.

So I want to talk about that. That’s a big part of the conversation. But I want to turn first to a story unfolding in the world of clean energy finance, a shakeup of sorts. Two of the leading firms, Generate Capital and Greenbacker have new CEOs, and they’re pledging strategic redirection. Generate is also reportedly discussing an IPO, perhaps as a new way to raise capital. Jigar co-founded Generate. And we’ve been talking about this and he says that the changes that these two companies reflect some signs of challenges in the market. Let’s start with these two firms, Jigar. Why do they matter? What is the background on how they were structured?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, it’s a good question and maybe on the outset, we should start with the fact that these companies have raised a lot of money and that money has been deployed into projects and those projects generate cash flows. So neither one of the companies is on the verge of bankruptcy or anything like that. They’re making money, people are getting paid. All of that stuff is occurring. But when you look at investment firms, they really are defined by their ability to raise more money. And right now, both of them are having a hard time raising more money. And so to get to your question, Greenbacker was created because there seemed to be a hole in the marketplace for an ability for retail investors to invest in clean energy. There were a lot of people who were banks or pension funds who could invest in renewable energy. But if you wanted to put $50,000 of your own money into something and just get a 6% dividend yield back, there was not a lot of options.

And so you had to be what they call an accredited investor to invest in clean energy. And so most people are not accredited, which is generally having a 2 to $3 million net worth, including your home value. So the way that Greenbacker did that was they filed with the SEC as if they were going public, but they never actually listed on an exchange. And so your shares are not easily traded every day. It’s not on the stock market, but you’ve gone through an SEC approval process such that you can market to retail investors. And then with Generate Capital, there was a recognition that when you have a standard GP/LP structure, general partner, limited partner structure, that you have to tell the limited partners exactly how you’re going to invest that money before they give it to you. It’s really detailed.

And in the clean energy space, being that detailed is very hard because the market changes every year. And so getting yourself the ultimate flexibility to be able to do these kinds of investments is very hard within that structure. So Generate decided to become a C corp. So in Generate’s case, all of the investors are just shareholders of Generate Capital, and that money, within reason, can be used for any purposes that Generate deems in the company’s interest. And the board, which is made up of the investors, can obviously fire the CEO or tell you you want to do something different or whatever it is. But day to day, they don’t give you detailed instructions on how to invest the money.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, Jigar. So I’m curious about Generate, because I know when you were there, you spoke a lot about the investments in fuel cells and anaerobic digesters and a bunch of other project finance that seemed really smart and seemed to really scale a lot of technologies that were working. They just needed project finance. And I just wonder how our current climate and the policy direction that our country’s been going and if that has changed how they’ve invested or if they’ve kind of stuck to what you had originally started doing.

Jigar Shah: Yeah, no, that’s a good question. And so maybe to think about when you have a company like Generate Capital, you can imagine if you invest in things that are fairly low risk that everybody is doing, then the returns are also lower. And then when you want to pay everybody’s salaries who work at the company, there’s not much left over to give back to investors. So you need higher returns. And the way that we got higher returns was to invest in leading-edge technologies. You tried to avoid bleeding-edge technologies, but you tried to be on the leading-edge. Those are people who really couldn’t get money from traditional sources of capital because like we discussed before, it wasn’t in their mandate.

So think anaerobic digesters, think battery storage, when we funded STEM back in 2014, 2015, there were a lot of different asset classes that we can go through. But part of that is also representing those asset classes into other conversations. So like with fuel cells for instance, they qualified for a 30% tax credit, but you could imagine none of the traditional tax credit investors wanted to do tax equity for fuel cells. So it took me two years to get the fuel cell companies to get tier one tax equity providers to even pay attention to them.

And as a result, Generate was able to invest at a rate that was a much higher rate of return upfront. We took the risk that we could find a tax credit buyer, and when we did, the returns that we were left with were much higher because tax equity comes in at a pretty low cost of capital. And what we were left with had a much higher cost of capital than expected, similar to anaerobic digesters where you had to figure out the renewable natural gas marketplace and the California low carbon fuel standard credits and all of this complexity. And so the question becomes, first of all, who should figure out this complexity for brand new business models? And then once you’ve figured out that complexity, can you hand it off to lower risk capital? Because when you do that, then the assets that you’re holding become even more valuable.

Stephen Lacey: Okay. So that’s really helpful background. So why are we talking about these two firms? David Crane, the former CEO of NRG, undersecretary of infrastructure at DOE when you were there, is now taking over as CEO. Greenbacker just announced a new CEO as well, Daniel de Boer, the former head of infrastructure at the firm. Both of these moves are framed as responding to a rapidly evolving market, which is often code for market pressures. Translate this for us.

Jigar Shah: So in Greenbacker’s case, they plodded along for a long time. So they were raising $10 million a month, $5 million a month. So they weren’t raising big dollars. But they made the mistake of wanting to invest in low-risk assets, so think solar and wind assets. And then by the time you paid for all the salaries at the senior level, they really could only pay a 3%, 3.5% return. But instead of telling their investors that, what they did was when solar comes back with money, they come back both in principle and in debt. So you might get 10% of your money back every year, some of which is paying back the mortgage, and some of which is the interest on the mortgage. And so if you’re paying people a 6% dividend yield out of that 10%, well, then that means you don’t have a lot left over to invest in new projects. So that means that over time, you just get smaller and smaller and smaller.

And then around 2020 with the ESG boom, they went to Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley just put a huge amount of money behind them. So I think it was maybe 2 or $3 billion that came in in a very short period of time and they figured out how to put it to work. Obviously, it took a little bit of time, but they also did, I think, a really large project with Hecate. And so they’re now in the process of getting that done. So Dan has come in really just to get them fixed up, like what’s working, what’s not working, which projects were maintained properly, which ones weren’t. But the fundamentals of Greenbacker are still flawed because if you actually are promising investors 6% returns, you have, let’s call it 3% of the returns that have to go to pay everybody’s salaries, well, then you need to make 9% to actually stay breakeven. And that doesn’t come from low-risk solar and wind assets.

So they recently wrote down their portfolio by 30%. So that means if it was worth 2 billion before, it’s now worth 1.4 billion. And they have to decide can they go out and raise more money? But you can imagine that one of the roles that they’re playing even in the solar and wind space is to do weird, funky stuff. So if somebody was doing a one-off wind turbine in the back of their factory, which we saw in California for years, or if people are doing new models of community solar that tried to work closely with environmental justice groups or whatever, then you can imagine very large sophisticated buyers of those assets might be like, “That’s too one off. We don’t want to deal with that $10 million project.” And so Greenbacker could play that role. But I think after 12 years or so of being in business, they still haven’t really found their way. And so they switched CEOs to try to really fix what’s broken.

Katherine Hamilton: So Daniel de Boer came from their infrastructure arm. So how does that change the way they may be thinking about their portfolio going forward?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, it doesn’t, and that’s what scares me. I think the world of Dan and I think the world of Carl Weatherley-White, who I’ve known for years, who I think has come in as CFO, but the challenge with Greenbacker fundamentally is they have to find ways of doing funky stuff, even if they’re only comfortable with solar and wind, that generates that return, which is the promised return to investors, plus the cost of running the platform. And if they can’t do that, then they’re constantly giving people money back that actually was slated to be reinvested into new projects. And so then that means that you’re not long for the world. And so I think in this moment where we’re trying to grow the market for clean energy, there is a mainstream set of boxes. So as you know, whether it’s Brookfield or an Exterra or all these other big players who buy projects, they have very sophisticated boxes and they want 100 pieces of paper that proves that you’ve done this and proves that you’ve done that, and et cetera, et cetera.

And if you’re not that person, if you’re not a developer that can give them 100 pieces of paper or it’s not cost-effective for you to put it together because your project is $10 million and 100 pieces of paper might cost $1 million to put together, then where do you go for alternative financing? And to date, it’s been family offices maybe or other people. And those people are like, “Well, I can put my money anywhere, so I think I’m going to put it over here where I can make a lot more than over here.” And so that’s why we had the GGRF, which is now obviously not in existence. And so when you think about the total amount of financing solutions that our country needs to be able to onboard all of this extraordinary effort that developers are putting forward to get to churches, to get food banks done, to get fire stations, solar systems, to get police officers what they need. Whatever it is that people are doing with this great technology we’ve invented, there has to be an appropriate investor available for them to go to.

Stephen Lacey: And can you go into a little bit more detail about what has been plaguing Generate and how that compares to Greenbacker’s challenges?

Jigar Shah: So Greenbacker never tried to do leading-edge stuff. Generate really was very successful at doing leading-edge stuff. So when you think about all the anaerobic digesters they funded, they just reopened the Cayuga facility in New York, which is the largest food waste digester that processes food waste there. I just heard that they process a lot of White Claws that were mislabeled and had to be crushed. And so there is hundreds of thousands-

Stephen Lacey: Is that White Claw, the alcoholic seltzer?

Jigar Shah: Exactly, exactly. So when I was at Generate, we used to take all the ice cream from Unilever’s facilities. They’d always have a bad batch of ice cream and then they’d have to get rid of it. And for these food companies-

Stephen Lacey: You’ve got White Claws and ice cream. Perfect for your birthday party.

Jigar Shah: That’s what we do. So there are hundreds of thousands of tons of this food waste. So most the time, the plant is running great, but one batch goes bad, what do you do with it? And for a lot of these large corporations, they’ve committed to scope two and scope three emissions reductions. And so putting food waste in landfills, which then release methane is not good for them. So they needed a place for it to get processed. And so we put in money into a bunch of facilities and there was London, Ontario, and then there was the UK and other places, and I think they probably put a couple hundred million dollars to work into what they did. Those made very, very nice returns. I think that’s great.

But over time, what happened was they ended up with 38 people in their capital markets team and their capital markets team went out to the marketplace and said, “Hey, we have all this stuff to sell.” And the people that they went to said, “Well, that’s interesting, but what we really would love is boring community solar.” And so Generate said, “Well, maybe we should do more boring community solar.”, which they did, which is great, but then they don’t get 16 to 18% returns on boring community solar. So they did some funky financial stuff, which is fine. Lots of people do that. I think it was well within the risk tolerance, and then interest rates started going up, and when interest rates started going up, your equity returns go down because the debt actually takes more of the return.

And so now, Generate Capital has made far lower returns on low-risk assets than they made on their higher-risk, higher-reward assets. And so as a result, they’ve had a really hard time raising money the last two years because people are like, “Well, you’ve invested in low-risk stuff and haven’t given us high returns, and so why would we give you more money?” And so it’s one of those things where I think that the difficulty of the business model was the point. And when their capital markets group, which got very bloated, decided that they wanted to do easier stuff and they wanted to raise money for easier stuff, well, then they didn’t meet the returns.

Stephen Lacey: So does this mean, given the changes of focus at these two companies, that we are going to see capital limitations in the market?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, most certainly. Right? And that’s why you-

Stephen Lacey: How acute are those capital limitations?

Jigar Shah: Well, you saw that Chris Anderson of TED Fame announced a big conference. Well, he announced a big fund, a $300 million fund for doing this missing middle stuff. And then he announced a big conference, I think he’s doing this weekend in California to try to get people focused on putting more money into this missing middle. But it’s a big deal. When you think about the Loan Programs Office, we probably had $350 billion or so of unprocessed loans that were submitted to Loan Programs Office for review. But when I left, so those projects are presumably real that folks were seeking debt for. And then you have all the folks who are looking for grants out of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations or the MASC office or the Great Deployment Office or others.

And so when you think about the quantum of capital at writ large that people want for all of these sectors and clean cement and clean steel and heat batteries, and you tell me which sector, but there’s tons of them, it’s at least $100 billion if not more. And if you count up Wollemi and Spring Lane and Ultra and a few other folks, that’s maybe a billion. And so it’s not even close to the need that we have. And so all these companies have done this extraordinary work of getting through venture rounds and getting to their first of a kind project and all this other stuff, and now we need them to be part of the gigaton scale climate reductions and they’re under capitalized.

Stephen Lacey: This is an indication of why this sector is so difficult. If we continue to have trouble funding this missing middle and we have these capital constraints, what does that mean for overall carbon reduction goals and thinking about these critical sectors?

Jigar Shah: So right now, people are talking about China being the electrostate, right? But let’s be clear about what they’re really doing. They’ve scaled up solar, they’ve scaled up lithium-ion batteries and LFP batteries. They have scaled up nuclear plant deployments. These are all technologies that were shared with the Chinese during the Obama administration. And so we’re talking about electrostate technology scale up of stuff that was shared with them during the Obama administration. Now that’s awesome, and we are going to continue to grow around the world and China is selling some of those equipment to Ethiopia and Pakistan and lots of places around the world. But at some point, we’re going to need to move to heat and we’re going to have to move to clean steel and we’re going to have to move to clean cement. And you know who’s not doing that right now? China. And so the real question is when and where are all of these technologies going to scale up?

And I’m hopeful that the UK gets there with the National Wealth Fund or GB Energy. I’m hopeful that the EU figures out what it wants to do with its policies or Australia. I saw Saul Griffith this week and near Climate Week, and he’s trying to get people there. They want to do green iron because Australia is known for just selling rocks and they want to do more value added work on the continent. So making lithium processing a priority or making green iron or whatever it is. But those technology companies are all in the United States. And so the question is that do they want to scale up here? Do they want to go to Australia to scale up? Are they going to just give their technology away in bankruptcy to China? Exactly how do we roll out the next generation of decarbonization technologies, which were probably admittedly 10 years away from really getting scaled up?

Stephen Lacey: All right, let’s turn now to our main story. I think it’s the perfect time to stocktake, as the UN climate parlance goes, on how we’re talking about climate, what the climate movement looks like and pathways forward in the current environment. And to kick off our next segment, I want to play a piece of tape from Donald Trump giving his speech this week to the UN General Assembly in New York. And this was happening right as tens of thousands of people were convening around the city for Climate Week.

Donald Trump: But we’re not letting this happen in America. In 1982, the executive director of the United Nations Environmental Program predicted that by the year 2000, climate change would cause a global catastrophe. He said that it will be irreversible as any nuclear holocaust would be. This is what they said at the United Nations. What happened? Here we are. Another UN official stated in 1989 that within a decade, entire nations could be wiped off the map by global warming. Not happening. It used to be global cooling. If you look back years ago in the 1920s and the 1930s, they said, “Global cooling will kill the world. We have to do something.” Then they said, “Global warming will kill the world.” But then it started getting cooler.

So now they just call it climate change because that way, they can’t miss. It’s climate change because if it goes higher or lower, whatever the hell happens, there’s climate change. It’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world in my opinion. Climate change, no matter what happens, you’re involved in that. No more global warming, no more global cooling. All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.

Stephen Lacey: I wanted to hear that tape for a couple reasons. One, I don’t think you could ask for a more direct example of how dark and twisted the politics of climate are right now in America at the highest levels. But two, Trump is hinting at something that reflects an actual critique of a very vocal contingency, the doomers. And since the 2010s, the loudest message from progressive groups pushing policy action on climate change has been focused on worst case scenarios. And out of that, a deeply moral approach to policy advocacy. And that approach, at least among the most visible climate organizations, groups like the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, Greta Thunberg’s FridaysForFuture, the Extinction Rebellion, meant that for them, the only reasonable option was blocking fossil fuels, creating radical and social equity, and pushing this narrative that we add only 10 years to avert catastrophic impacts.

And if Donald Trump’s speech at the UN tells us anything, it’s that that strategy didn’t work. And I’m certainly not suggesting that you can draw a straight line between the election of Trump and the failure of the climate movement. Of course not. But they’re actually not that far from each other. Trump was elected in part because voters felt like they had felt like the left had abandoned kitchen table economic issues in favor of other causes, and they weren’t focused enough on solving problems. I think that is an important factor in the last election. And instead of building this kind of durable majority that activists thought they were, they were often alienating voters who have increasingly been worried about paying rent, affording gas, keeping the lights on. And this is where the idea of this pragmatic reset comes in.

Michael Liebreich has a really phenomenal essay in Bloomberg, this two-part essay. And in it, he argues that we need to stop making people feel guilty, stop obsessing over the climate apocalypse, and take a much more pragmatic approach to the framework for how we talk about and present climate change and the actual climate talks themselves. And Alex Trembath from the Breakthrough Institute had an essay out earlier this year where he argued that the era of the Climate Hawk is over. And he also argues that centering politics around existential threats and moral urgency has polarized the issue and hitched climate to progressive identity politics. And so I think this is just a really interesting time to grapple with this question. Do we need a complete reset on climate, both in coalition building and in policy? And I’ll turn to you first, Katherine. What do you think of, how do you buy the critique that I just outlined?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I’ve thought a lot about this because I listened to Liebreich, both his part one and part two of his essay, which part one tried to say, “Here’s the math we got to use to think of what’s next.” And then part two is like, “Here are the things we need to actually do for a reset.” And I also started thinking about what was happening in New York with all of the protesters, with people protesting a number of things. It wasn’t just one thing. And my sensibility has always been you need people on both sides to get to the middle. So it’s great that there’s a pragmatic approach that you can take, and we should go through and dissect what that is and what that might look like. But I don’t think you get there unless you have the left flank as well and have that pushing so that you have a middle.

Because right now, you have a president who’s out there claiming that climate is a total hoax, you have the left trying to demonstrate against a wide variety of things because there is a lot going on right now that people are protesting, and then the pragmatic approach is coming to the middle. And I think you have to have both sides to be able to come into the middle. So I think Liebreich is not wrong that this is a good time to think about that because we need to come together with what are some pragmatic solutions? That’s a good thing to think through, but you don’t get to a negotiation and a middle unless you have both sides to push back on. So for me, that’s the setup.

Stephen Lacey: I generally agree with that. I guess the question is how it filters into politics. The Democratic Party itself has a really deep problem, and many Americans felt like the Democratic Party had aligned way too closely with this progressive social agenda and rather than these kitchen table issues. And so to me, it depends on how folks who are focused on climate on the left align with the activist agenda.

Katherine Hamilton: I actually think that’s an issue of narrative and messaging because if you look at all of the bills that passed, that were essentially climate bills that passed during the Biden administration, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure bill, those were all really pragmatic solutions that dealt with kitchen table issues. But that was not what the narrative was. And I think that’s where things failed because that’s not… The narrative should have been super inclusive about this is actually going to affect your price of eggs. And now we’re seeing that happen. You take the stuff away, it is going to impact everything in your life and the affordability issues. But I think that a lot of that was not about the actual content, but about the narrative and messaging.

Stephen Lacey: Definitely. Yeah, Jigar, what do you make of the premise?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I tend to agree with Katherine as we’ve talked about, I think on our collective podcast for 10 plus years. I think that-

Stephen Lacey: Agree meaning that you need that flank?

Jigar Shah: Well, I’ll give you an example that’s extreme. I’ve never criticized Mark Jacobson over his a hundred percent wind, solar, and hydro thing, even though I know that it’s completely freaking impossible to do anything that he’s suggesting. But there’s a lot of people who are inspired by his work, and that’s how we got a lot of the renewable portfolio standards passed at the state level. And so do I need to come out and slay his message? No. But in closed doors, I’m telling people we need a lot of clean firm power generation. And so that includes nuclear and includes geothermal, it includes other stuff. So I think the part that all these Monday morning quarterbacks misunderstand is getting to 48 votes in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act was virtually impossible. I think people don’t understand how diverse the Democratic Party is broadly and how important the left flank was to get Sheldon Whitehouse and Bernie Sanders to agree on something.

And so yes, they fell short of 50, they only got 48. And then you had a very pragmatic negotiation that didn’t include the environmental groups or other left flank folks from January of 2022 through August of 2022, that was only Joe Manchin, and to some degree, Kyrsten Sinema. And they passed the bill that, as Katherine suggested, was really damn pragmatic. But I just think that people don’t understand how politics works. They just want to Monday morning quarterback the narrative at the end. And look, Donald Trump has been a master of narrative. Look, I don’t love that he’s a master of the narrative, but he is. And Biden in particular was not. He certainly wasn’t doing press releases every day and press conferences every day and all the things that a president frankly has to do because while I loved Secretary Granholm, she is no stand-in for the President of the United States. And so that narrative just didn’t get done because Joe Biden wasn’t giving it.

So I just think that some of this stuff is a little too much. That being said, we’ve always agreed with these two pieces on balance within our podcast. The notion that you were going to go to the American people and say, “This is only going to cost you a little bit more, but we’re going to save the planet.” was always a terrible narrative. It was terrible for Waxman-Markey and it’s terrible now. And it doesn’t have to be the case because we have all of these extraordinary technologies that actually are the most affordable way to meet this load growth moment in this particular case and the fastest way to meet this load growth moment in this particular way.

And so we don’t have to sacrifice. For the first time in my entire career, there is no sacrifice needed. You get the most affordable solution and the fastest solution. And that should be celebrated. And I think that to Katherine’s point, the left and the doomers played some role in getting the urgency there. And all of us technocrats had a very important role in actually doing the work to get the technologies lined up and the money in there and projects built on Walmart stores and whatever it is that got the cost down.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, how do you think the progressive climate activist wing influenced policy headed toward the IRA? In 2018, the Sunrise Movement broke out with this congressional sit-in, AOC came and visited them and praised them. There was this viral moment where they were all holding up their green jobs for everyone now signs and AOC sort of gave them the momentum they needed, and the Sunrise Movement eventually became a very influential student-led group. And the argument was that they really did create, they forced Pelosi and others to start talking about climate change in the 2018-2019 era that eventually led to the negotiations around the IRA. Is that accurate to you?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I think it did really stress the urgency and also showed that there were young people who really cared and cared enough to go and try to meet with her and to make a point of it. Of course, in the end, they were not completely happy with what the outcome was. But that may have never been the case, but it did raise it as an issue, and it was something that had been percolating since Waxman-Markey had failed in favor of healthcare during the Obama administration. And that was probably the right choice. Everybody needs healthcare, so maybe that was the right choice, but the tactics had changed and also the energy had changed around it.

So I think it was really important that they did that and that they kept the pressure on because that forced the discussion. And maybe everybody didn’t get what they wanted out of the bill, but it definitely led, I think, to climate action. And I also think there are provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that may not have happened without those folks like low-income adders and being able to focus on communities that most need the help. I don’t know that any of that would’ve happened without that pressure.

Jigar Shah: Yeah. One other thing I would say is that as somebody who has been on boards of environmental groups and other things for a long time, we are in a weird place right now, right? Because the cleantech sector has really abrogated its entire responsibility in developing its own political infrastructure. We sort of put together CEA and then AWEA and then that became ACP, but we were really borrowing the political infrastructure from the environmental groups for many, many years. So when you think about whipping votes in state legislatures or whipping votes in the federal government and in Congress, a lot of those were environmental folks who had been around for a long time, and then they had C3 organizations and C4 organizations that could lobby and all these other things. And so it’s only now that the cleantech sector is actually recognizing that borrowing the environmental group’s political infrastructure is probably not the right call.

And in some ways, I think that’s probably what Alex Trembath is really suggesting is that the cleantech sector is sort of saying that we’re in lockstep with the environmental groups, which is not always a good thing. And frankly, probably 40% of the cleantech sector’s employees voted for Trump. And so it’s not really the right methodology by which to get our stuff done. And so now you see the cleantech sector actually building its own political rails and funding its own candidates and putting all these things together and the environmental groups are going to have to figure out what it wants to do because it’s not clear to me that being pro stuff is what the environmental groups do.

In general, they raise a lot of money when they’re against stuff. That’s what activates their base. That’s how they get lots of $50 donations, is PFAS, and figuring out how to shut down coal plants, and doing all this other stuff. Building tons of batteries and solar, it’s hard for them to raise money on that stuff. And so I think part of our challenge is they have frankly been big warriors and they’ve been doing things that I’m not sure was part of necessarily their business model because the cleantech sector wasn’t doing it. Now the cleantech sector has decided it should do it, and I think we’ll be better off for the environmental groups pushing what they care about and the cleantech sector pushing what they care about.

Stephen Lacey: I want to dissect Alex Trembath’s argument quickly. So his argument is that climate hawkism failed politically. That for more than a decade, climate hawks and activists tried to put this existential threat and moral urgency at the center of politics, and that they want attention but not durable majorities. And that climate has never cracked the top tier of voter priorities, that the efforts to raise salience actually polarized the issue instead of broadening support. And then the path forward is this pragmatism we’ve been talking about, which is climate change is of course real and serious, but it’s best addressed indirectly by focusing on things that people care about, like energy abundance, affordability, resilience, innovation, and that climate outcomes should be more of a co-benefit, not the centerpiece. What do you make of his critique of climate hawkism specifically?

Jigar Shah: The thing that I worry about with that entire line of argumentation is it just feels like pontification by Monday morning quarterbacks. For folks who actually have to lift heavyweights all the way up the mountain and actually get stuff done, that is not how anything works. Going into the middle and saying, “We’re not going to talk about climate. We’re only going to talk about the benefits of our technology, and we’re just going to be a pro-technology argument, and we just want R&D and we just want innovation.” That’s why we’re 20 years behind. This is the Bjorn Lomborg crap that we’ve been dealing with for a long time, which is that the technologies aren’t ready to deploy at scale. Let’s keep investing in R&D. And it turned out that investing heavily into the deployment of technologies is what dropped the costs so precipitously. It wasn’t more R&D. More R&D is also always welcome. But what we want to do is actually get people to deploy stuff at scale.

Now, the question becomes can you get people to deploy stuff at scale while staying completely under the radar screen and not using climate as an argument? Which is kind of what Alex is saying. I don’t know. How did that work out for nuclear power? Not very well. And so now, the Trump administration is weaponizing nuclear power and maybe they’ll get 10 AP1000s under construction, maybe not. But when you think about how nuclear power has tried to stay under the radar screen since 2008, and very few of them have actually gotten deployed, it didn’t work that well. I think that some of the things that we do, you can say is a hype cycle within the capitalist system, too much money going into AI, but before too much money going into hydrogen or whatever it is.

And some of it is actually supported by the fact that climate hawks were the ones who convinced the capitalists that this was a hype cycle and that they should dump a bunch of money into it. And so I just think that he gets too cute by saying that I want this part of the menu, but not this part of the menu. And I think we would’ve had the exact same results technologically and crowding and capital and all that stuff if we just had done the stuff that fits my gluten-free vegan, sort of like [inaudible 00:43:49].

Katherine Hamilton: Hey, don’t knock gluten-free.

Stephen Lacey: I think we’re about to test it right now. No one is talking about climate, and we are going to see how the conversation progresses, given that people are going to be talking about affordability, reliability, resilience, and so all the things that-

Jigar Shah: No, that’s not a test.

Stephen Lacey: Why is it not a test? It’s-

Jigar Shah: Because remember, what I’m claiming is that we would not be in this situation where all of our technologies are fully affordable and we can get away with just the affordability message if we had not participated in climate hawkism the last 10 or 20 years.

Stephen Lacey: But you don’t think that the business community would’ve just innovated anyway? That there’s a contingency of entrepreneurs and investors who wouldn’t have been driving it forward without that messaging?

Katherine Hamilton: Oh, yeah. Who got all the regulation in place for tailpipe emissions and power plant emissions? If we hadn’t had the climate hawks, that wouldn’t have happened, and that opened up markets for clean energy. So that actually created the space for these new technologies to be able to pencil out. So I absolutely disagree with that premise. I also think there are voters who are single-issue voters. So I just don’t think it’s true that people are only going to vote on affordability. Maybe that’s the bulk right now. But there are climate voters. Just as there are pro-choice voters, there are people that that is their only issue that they care about, and I don’t think that that will necessarily change.

Now, some of the things, if you think of it like, “Oh, I’m just going to have a rational read of what Alex Trembath says, which by the way, if you read it, you’ll get very… And if you care about climate, you’ll get emotional reading it. So the best way to do it is to get ChatGPT to just summarize it because then it’s very dispassionate and it takes all of the tone that he loves to use out of it. But he’s saying that climate hawk era is over, that climate should be de-centered politically, but politics has room for a lot of issues as I just said. There are a lot of people who vote for a number of things, and climate mitigation can be a very happy side effect of driving down affordability and increasing jobs as Jigar has talked about forever. And then critiquing all the climate targets. Well, if you don’t have climate targets, what are you working for? What are you working toward?

And so it’s important for everybody to have a goal, even if it’s something you’re not going to be able to meet, you have a goal and you take steps to get there. And then this cultural backlash, making it a cultural issue is really tough because there are only certain people who want it to be a cultural issue. If you can de-culturize it and just have it be about the health and well-being of humans on this planet, I think you’ll be able to still make your arguments and still move ahead even if you just care about climate.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, but the climate activists marching at Climate Week are leaning into the culture wars. They’re making it about everything, every social justice issue possible, and I just do not see how that is at all a winning message in this current environment. And I think if Democrats take their cues from that or people who are generally supporting climate policy regardless of which party they’re in, if anyone is taking cues from that, it will not land.

Jigar Shah: Sure. But remember, at Charlie Kirk’s funeral, the president said that, “I actually hate my opponents.” versus other people. So you have culture wars on that side, which I don’t think other people should be participating in. Look, the fact that people do and say things that I don’t think is fully reasoned through your lens and my lens doesn’t mean that I hate them for expressing their free speech rights. And I just think that people don’t… Look, the weird thing is about Alex, is that I’ve probably been the most effective communicator of eco modernism without believing in it of anybody in the entire 25-year history of his institution. And so I only use economic messages or pollution messages or other stuff because it works for me in the companies that I work with and the technologies I’m putting forward. But to not recognize how the actual political process works and not how moments get created and how things become memes and things become viral like Greta, do I wish Greta never existed? Of course I don’t. Like, oh, my goodness.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I’m certainly not saying that.

Jigar Shah: No, but that is kind of what he’s saying. He’s saying, “I wish that this had never been politicized. I wish that these people had never actually broken through. I wish that these things were just completely dispassionate.” I get it. We all wish that we just lived lives of quiet-like amplitude, but that’s not the world we live in. We agreed for social media companies to exist. Now, you’ve got all this screaming going on on Facebook or on Twitter or on Bluesky or whatever it is. We live in the world we’re in, and the notion that people are like, “Gosh, I wish everyone was as boring as I am.” No. No, no, no. That is not the world we live in. And so I don’t know why I want to engage in something that just is nonsensical.

Stephen Lacey: I think it’s a really helpful conversation. I don’t think it’s nonsensical. I think it’s the perfect time to be having this conversation. So let’s go into some of Liebreich’s other views on what this pragmatic climate reset looks like. Katherine, what are some others that resonated with you?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I’ll tick down… He had eight things that he wants to reset on and we can dive into any of these, but resetting climate politics, we’ve talked about that. How do you get to the center on the politics without guilt-based messaging? Sure, let’s do better messaging. Resetting climate targets, he says they should be more reasonable. You got to have climate targets, so figure out what those are. Reset energy priorities. So he’s allow for some flexible gas plants so that you can at least use those for peaking and not for baseload, and you don’t have a bunch of stranded assets. He isn’t saying you need to not do renewables. I think he’s just saying to be a little more flexible. Reset hydrogen expectations. If two people are trying to decide whether to invest in hydrogen, just send Michael Liebreich into the room who will say, he will say, “This was the stupidest idea in stupidville.” Which is exactly what he said in that article. He hates hydrogen so much. Reset diplomacy, and we may want to talk about that and dig into the COPs and how do those work.

And reset science scenarios. He has some arguments about how some of those are outdated and need to be re-upped. That would be great if we can all get on the same page on that. The US right now is not in the mood to do that, but that would be great to do. Reset finance and ESG to sort of take ESGs not as a separate piece of the puzzle, but as part of the full financial system. And also make governments be more in charge of regulation. Unfortunately, right now, our government is not doing that. And then reset policy and regulation to try to have more of a value for money test where the value is in the climate reduction. These all seem really rational, pragmatic ideas. The issue is like how do we then execute on those?

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I thought he has really good ideas for how to change the climate negotiations process, which is really relevant, given the UN assembly this week. There were a couple of ideas that stood out to me. One was basically shrink the circus of climate talks, hold it with a much smaller number of people, focus on concrete deals in very specific industries like in steel, cement, shipping, energy. Don’t try to hash out these economy-wide, one-size-fits-all targets. Take the land use and agriculture piece and forestry out of the conversation and make it its own convention because the politics and culture of land are so much different than many of the other industrial conversations.

And then really revisit this idea of loss and damages. He argues that it doesn’t make sense to create a duplicate aid system where losses from specific climate events can’t be clearly tied with emissions, with scientific certainty, and that there’s a lot of energy that goes into that system that doesn’t make sense. And I think that clearly paring down these negotiations and making them about very specific deals in specific industries really resonates with me. Jigar, were there any that stood out to you of how to change the way we’re engaging in this negotiations process?

Jigar Shah: I don’t know that I had a lot of great insights on the negotiation process, but I totally agree with the circus. Honestly, I haven’t gone to a cop since I was forced to when I ran the [inaudible 00:53:07] and good riddance, the Biden administration tried to get me to go to COPs, and I was like, “Hell no.” I don’t know why I would go. Because this is the thing, I totally agree. I’m not a negotiator. I don’t know that I necessarily even care about the text that’s coming out of the negotiations. I’m pretty sure I’ve never really read an article in the last 10 years around what’s happening in the text and what’s happening in this and that and whatever. I think in general, it is orthogonal to what I’m doing on the cleantech side.

I totally agree with Michael, which is that these processes, which are deeply consultive and very difficult diplomatic efforts are really valuable on land use. Just so important. When you think about what we do with the rainforest or palm oil in Indonesia or some of these other things that are occurring, even in the United States, when you think about what’s happening under our current administration, I do think that our protection of land is going down in a really big way. And I do think that that conversation matters a lot. And so I hope that they take him up on that offer. I think the other challenge you have, and agree with him on the loss and damage piece, is that it is most certainly the case that we are changing the way that the globe operates, whether it’s weather patterns or sea level rise or other things. And there are going to be places around the world that are less and less habitable. Even in the United States, you can’t even get home insurance anymore in the state of Florida.

And so you’re in this weird spot where we need real solutions to these challenges. And just having a transfer of money from the United States to XYZ country doesn’t solve the underlying problem, which is around insurance and how insurance markets work. We had this conversation a little bit with our friend from JPMorgan where I was like, “Well, if these are all these issues, why are you not sending a letter to all of the homeowners saying your house is definitely going to be a problem in seven years?” And she’s like, “Well, I haven’t gotten permission to do that yet.” I get it. But I just think that there’s a way to have these conversations and a way to have a positive influence on reducing the worst possible impacts on humans around the world. And I don’t think that that comes through in any way that is actionable through the current COP process.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, and the funds that have been set up have just been absolutely unworkable. You talk to any developing country. And the definition of developing country may need to be shifted a little bit as well, but those countries are not getting what they need and in the format that they need it. So they’re saying, a lot of smaller countries are saying, “Yeah, we would love to be able to build clean resources. We can’t build any resources right now because the fund doesn’t work for us.” So trying to figure out how to restructure that in a way that’s really workable, it’s caused a lot of people a lot of gray hair. But I think that’s something that would be really important. And Liebreich says countries should be focused on their own decarbonization and their own economic growth and benefit. Well, maybe if developing countries did that and put some muscle into it, then they would have the extra cash to be able to help to both be a leader and innovate, but also to have some extra funds to be able to show the pathway for countries that don’t have the resources that they need.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. He basically argues that we should get rid of that entire rich-poor framework because as he argues, that many developing countries, they have skyscrapers, space programs, global companies, wealthy elites, and meanwhile, these supposedly rich countries are still full of people with stagnant wages, living in a cost-of-living crisis. And the best thing, as you said, Katherine, that we can do is having rich countries lead by example and that decarbonize their own economies while preserving standards of living. And he says I think, “If they fail at home, then no amount of climate finance will matter abroad.” And I generally agree with that.

Jigar Shah: Just to be clear though, Stephen, I don’t think the vast majority of the world believes in that, even though I think they need to make that shift. I’m a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. They have all these people who focus on blended finance and climate finance and all this stuff. It’s been something that people worked on for 20 years. Part of why I joined as a senior fellow is to convince people that frankly, mainstream capital flows are flowing at such large rates right now that it dwarfs blended finance.

When you think about what happened in Pakistan the last two years, not a single drop of blended finance or climate finance or development bank finance went into Pakistan. All of that money was for-profit money, all of it for the last two years. And so you’re just starting to see that as Katherine’s suggesting, that a lot of these well-intentioned programs just have not worked. They have not crowded in other capital, they have not done the skills transfer that I think people expected them to do. And so at some point, we just have to throw out things that didn’t work.

Stephen Lacey: Okay. So imagine you are a young person looking at how they can make the biggest impact right now. Could be in activism, could be in business, could be anywhere. What do you think would be the highest impact way they could spend their time on something climate related? Katherine, where would you devote your focus?

Katherine Hamilton: It’s such a funny question because at Cornell, that’s exactly what they asked me. And they had students from every type of school, every discipline, and I kind of said, “Do what you do from where you are. There are a bunch of you that are engineers, engineer. There’re a bunch of you that are scientists and researchers, do that. There’s some of you who are communications people, focus on the narrative.” Or writers writing to me is the biggest, best skill you can have. But really, you can get to it from wherever you are, find your pathway from what you love and what you’re good at. So I know that’s not a definitive answer, but I think it’s something that I can’t say to everybody, “Do policy.” That’s not right for everybody.

Jigar Shah: So I think I use the same exact answer that Katherine uses when I get asked that question. But I think maybe to give you an answer from a slightly different perspective, look, I think that there has been a 30 or 40-year effort to solve problems that are really thorny by throwing money at the problem. And I, for a long time, didn’t think that worked. But now, I definitively know that it doesn’t work. And we need to be raising a group of children today that can rethink how we accomplish our goals. That whatever discipline they want to come at it from, it can’t just be throwing money at the problem. You can’t just raise taxes more and say, “Now, this time, it’ll solve it.” Whether it’s childcare or healthcare or energy policy or climate policy or whatever it is, it can’t just be, “Here’s another feed in tariff at 47 cents a kilowatt-hour.” Or “Here’s another thing.”

It has to be, what is it at the core of our systems are holding back the ability for us to innovate within the current system? And I think that we, particularly in the West, have this ability to rise to the occasion in this moment and figure it out. I don’t want to have a top-down state like China, right? I respect China greatly, they do their thing, they have had a tremendous amount of a success in building nuclear plants, building hydro dams, whatever. I think that the way in which they accomplish that are not the trade-offs that I would want to be in that society under. I think the West has to figure out what that more balanced approach looks like. Climate happens to be the area that I’m focused on. So then there’s labor and justice and some of these other things, but I think that this is a universal problem where we’ve been thinking in a group way for 40 years and we have to break out of it.

Stephen Lacey: Those are both good answers. To get more specific, if someone who was say interested in activism or politics, creating political change, were to ask me that question, I would say find a way to do serious on-the-ground work. Find a way to make your work about influencing planning boards, zoning boards, all the local politics of building clean energy and sustainable infrastructure, because we have a deep local problem when it comes to building an energy infrastructure. And you can sort of raise awareness about climate change all you want, but if people are continually resisting this stuff, if local regulatory boards are not finding ways to build this stuff, it doesn’t matter how you talk about it, it’s just not going to get built. And more and more projects are getting caught up in this web of resistance on the local level, even among communities that theoretically should support it. And I think it’s just a growing and deep problem. And that’s where I would say is focus your attention on solving that problem.

Jigar Shah: And I think that that is still related though to the systems issue. To Katherine’s point, when you think about writing and how important writing is, we’ve lost all of our local journalism. No one’s holding a city of 3,000 people accountable for their actions. So those people can do whatever the hell they want to do. And so even if the climate solution that we’re proposing is half the price of the old solution, they’re like, “Well, but the old solution is run by my cousin and so we’re going to do it that way.” I just think that when you think about what is broken at the local level, is that the best ideas are not the ones that actually get to the top. That there’s just so much embedded resistance to change because people are like, “But that person’s been running that dealership for 40 years and he doesn’t want to add electric vehicle repair technicians.” Or whatever it is. It’s one of those things where we have somehow gotten just so sclerotic.

Stephen Lacey: Well, I think we can wrap it there. This was a good one, I think a long overdue conversation, the right week to have this conversation. Jigar, good to see you. Thanks for joining us the night after your birthday. I’m saying that with air quotes. Appreciate you doing this after a late night.

Jigar Shah: Well, I’m glad to do it, and I just want to make sure everybody recognizes that I’m still as optimistic as ever. The fact that there are no trade-offs today and that we are now the cheapest solution and the fastest solution gives me great hope that I think that this is our time.

Stephen Lacey: Absolutely. And Katherine, I know you are working on this also every day with Common Charge and thinking about how to frame this in ways that are really relevant to people’s lives, so keep at it.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-26T110045.891.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 20:01:01.586398

This strategic move could solidify Aqua Metals' role as a cornerstone in the domestic battery supply chain, reducing reliance on foreign sources and enhancing national security.
As Aqua Metals gains traction, so too could its collaborators, benefiting from shared expertise and an expanded network within the industry.
Looking further ahead, the long-term possibilities for Aqua Metals are significant, contingent on its ability to scale its AquaRefining™ technology and secure widespread adoption.
Aqua Metals' AquaRefining™ technology is positioned as a key enabler in this transition, offering a cleaner, more efficient path to resource recovery.","Reno, NV – September 26, 2025 – Aqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQMS), a pioneer in sustainable lithium-ion battery recycling, saw its stock skyrocket by an impressive 46.75% today, making it a top gainer in the market. The significant surge comes on the heels of the company's announcement regarding its upcoming participation in The Battery Show North America 2025, where its Vice President of Commercial, David Regan, is slated to join a critical panel discussion on ""Critical Minerals and Trade Policy.""

This strategic visibility event, scheduled for October 6-9, 2025, in Detroit, Michigan, has galvanized investor confidence, signaling Aqua Metals' growing prominence in addressing the urgent need for a robust, domestic supply chain for critical battery minerals. The market's enthusiastic reaction underscores the increasing importance placed on sustainable recycling technologies and national energy independence in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle (EV) and renewable energy sectors.

The Catalyst: Strategic Visibility and a Greener Future

The immediate trigger for Aqua Metals' substantial stock gain was the September 25, 2025 announcement detailing its key role at The Battery Show North America. David Regan's participation in a panel focused on ""Critical Minerals and Trade Policy"" offers an unparalleled platform for Aqua Metals to showcase its proprietary AquaRefining™ technology. This innovative process is designed to efficiently and environmentally responsibly recover high-value materials, or ""black mass,"" from spent lithium-ion batteries and manufacturing scrap, transforming them into battery-grade materials for direct reuse within the U.S. market. Unlike traditional, high-emission smelting methods, AquaRefining™ offers a cleaner, more sustainable alternative, aligning perfectly with global environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objectives.

This recent surge is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of several positive developments for the company. Earlier in September, Aqua Metals announced on September 8, 2025, that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement, following a necessary reverse stock split, thereby alleviating significant regulatory concerns. Furthermore, on September 16, 2025, the company cemented its commitment to a sustainable U.S. critical minerals supply chain by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Impossible Metals. This collaboration highlights Aqua Metals' proactive approach to securing its position in the burgeoning battery recycling ecosystem. While the stock experienced some volatility in the days leading up to the announcement, including a significant technical-driven surge on September 24, 2025, and a subsequent dip, the consistent upward trajectory on September 26, 2025, firmly points to the Battery Show announcement as the primary fundamental driver for this latest rally. The event is poised to facilitate crucial engagements with leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), cell producers, and other industry stakeholders, potentially paving the way for new partnerships and accelerated commercial deployment of AquaRefining™ technology.

Companies Poised to Win or Lose in the Evolving Battery Landscape

Aqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQMS) is clearly positioned as a significant potential winner from this event and the broader trends it represents. By participating in a high-profile industry event like The Battery Show North America and focusing on critical minerals and trade policy, Aqua Metals enhances its visibility and credibility among key decision-makers. The company's AquaRefining™ technology, which offers a more environmentally friendly and efficient method for recovering valuable materials from spent batteries, directly addresses the growing demand for sustainable solutions in the EV and energy storage sectors. Successful showcasing and subsequent strategic partnerships could lead to increased licensing agreements, joint ventures, and a faster rollout of its recycling facilities, thereby significantly boosting its revenue and market share. This strategic move could solidify Aqua Metals' role as a cornerstone in the domestic battery supply chain, reducing reliance on foreign sources and enhancing national security.

The ripple effects of Aqua Metals' potential success could extend to its strategic partners, such as Impossible Metals, with whom it signed an MOU on September 16, 2025, to advance a sustainable U.S. critical minerals supply chain. As Aqua Metals gains traction, so too could its collaborators, benefiting from shared expertise and an expanded network within the industry. Conversely, traditional battery recycling companies that rely on less sustainable, high-emission smelting processes might face increasing pressure. As regulatory scrutiny over environmental impact intensifies and consumer preference shifts towards greener technologies, these legacy players could see their competitive edge erode. Their slower adoption of advanced, environmentally conscious methods could put them at a disadvantage in securing contracts and attracting investment in a market increasingly prioritizing sustainability.

Furthermore, the heightened focus on domestic critical mineral supply chains, amplified by events like The Battery Show, could put pressure on companies heavily reliant on international sourcing or those without robust recycling strategies. Manufacturers of electric vehicles and energy storage systems are increasingly seeking assurances of supply chain resilience and ethical sourcing. Companies that cannot demonstrate a commitment to these principles, either through internal recycling capabilities or strong partnerships with innovators like Aqua Metals, may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage in an increasingly conscious market. The event, therefore, acts as a spotlight, highlighting the innovators and potentially casting shadows on those slower to adapt to the new, sustainable paradigm.

Wider Significance: Reshaping the Future of Critical Mineral Supply

Aqua Metals' strategic move to highlight its AquaRefining™ technology at The Battery Show North America 2025 carries significant weight within the broader industry context, aligning perfectly with several critical trends. The global push towards electric vehicles and renewable energy storage has created an unprecedented demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Simultaneously, there's a growing recognition of the environmental and geopolitical challenges associated with traditional mining and refining processes, many of which are concentrated in a few foreign nations. Aqua Metals' focus on domestically recycling ""black mass"" from end-of-life batteries directly addresses the imperative for a secure, sustainable, and circular economy for these vital resources, reducing U.S. dependence on volatile international supply chains. This event underscores the accelerating shift towards closed-loop systems in manufacturing, a trend that is only expected to intensify.

The potential ripple effects of Aqua Metals' increased visibility and potential partnerships are substantial. Successful commercialization and scaling of AquaRefining™ could encourage other players in the battery manufacturing and recycling ecosystem to invest further in advanced, sustainable technologies. This could lead to a virtuous cycle of innovation, driving down costs, improving efficiency, and further solidifying the domestic supply chain. Partners, such as Impossible Metals, could see their collaborative efforts gain more prominence, fostering a network of companies committed to ethical and sustainable mineral sourcing. From a regulatory and policy perspective, Aqua Metals' efforts resonate strongly with current U.S. government initiatives aimed at bolstering domestic manufacturing, promoting green technologies, and enhancing national security through supply chain resilience. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, include provisions that incentivize domestic battery production and recycling, creating a favorable environment for companies like Aqua Metals.

Historically, major technological breakthroughs or strategic announcements in emerging industries often serve as inflection points, drawing significant investment and accelerating market adoption. Comparisons can be drawn to early advancements in solar panel manufacturing or semiconductor development, where companies that established early leadership in sustainable or efficient processes gained a lasting competitive advantage. While Aqua Metals is still in the growth phase, its current trajectory, amplified by this strategic appearance, positions it as a key player in shaping the future of battery recycling. The event not only elevates Aqua Metals but also serves as a bellwether for the increasing maturity and investment appeal of the entire sustainable critical minerals sector.

What Comes Next: Navigating Growth and Market Opportunities

In the short term, all eyes will be on Aqua Metals' (NASDAQ: AQMS) performance and announcements during The Battery Show North America, scheduled for October 6-9, 2025. Investors will be keenly watching for any news regarding new strategic partnerships, licensing agreements, or significant commercial breakthroughs that might emerge from the event. Positive developments during the show could provide further upward momentum for the stock, while a lack of concrete announcements might lead to some profit-taking. The company's ability to effectively communicate the value proposition of its AquaRefining™ technology to potential customers and investors will be crucial. Post-show, the market will likely assess the tangible outcomes and the extent to which the visibility translates into actionable business growth.

Looking further ahead, the long-term possibilities for Aqua Metals are significant, contingent on its ability to scale its AquaRefining™ technology and secure widespread adoption. The company aims to establish itself as a dominant force in sustainable battery recycling, contributing substantially to a circular economy for critical minerals. This will involve continued research and development, securing additional funding for facility expansion, and navigating a competitive landscape that is attracting increasing investment.

Utility-scale storage leads the charge Most of that Q2 growth came from utility-scale projects, which added 4.9 GW – enough to power 3.7 million homes during peak demand.
The Southwest Power Pool, which hadn’t seen new battery storage projects in three years, saw a comeback with three installations in Oklahoma.
“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP’s vice president of energy storage.
“After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC,” Weis said.","The US battery storage market just had its biggest quarter ever. In Q2 2025, a record 5.6 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity came online, according to the latest US Energy Storage Monitor report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie.

Utility-scale storage leads the charge

Most of that Q2 growth came from utility-scale projects, which added 4.9 GW – enough to power 3.7 million homes during peak demand. As electricity demand climbs and prices rise, more states are turning to large-scale batteries to keep the grid stable and affordable.

Texas, California, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of new capacity. The Southwest Power Pool, which hadn’t seen new battery storage projects in three years, saw a comeback with three installations in Oklahoma. Meanwhile, Florida and Georgia are now forecast to deploy more storage than expected after major new procurements by utilities.

“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP’s vice president of energy storage. “Despite regulatory uncertainty, the industry is on track to produce enough grid batteries in US factories to meet 100% domestic demand.”

Home batteries are booming

The residential battery storage market also surged, adding 608 megawatts (MW) in Q2, up 132% year-over-year and 8% from Q1. California, Arizona, and Illinois led the growth as more homeowners paired batteries with rooftop solar and adopted higher-capacity systems.

CCI market grows slowly

The community, commercial, and industrial (CCI) segment grew by a smaller 38 MW, up 11% year-over-year. California and New York made up more than 70% of Q2’s CCI capacity, while Illinois gained ground. But community-scale storage remains limited due to high costs and policy barriers.

Outlook: Resilient growth, but headwinds ahead

The ACP/Wood Mac report forecasts 87.8 GW of US storage by 2029, with residential and utility-scale projects in the lead. But growth could dip 10% in 2027 as new federal rules take effect on where battery cells can be sourced.

“Pricing and FEOC [Foreign Entity of Concern] uncertainty, and slow community storage development are expected to limit CCI growth below 1 GW by 2029,” said Allison Feeney, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. She added that residential storage will likely outpace solar thanks to strong incentives, especially in markets like California and Puerto Rico.

Allison Weis, Wood Mackenzie’s global head of storage, said Trump’s big bill act preserved the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for batteries, but stricter sourcing rules after 2025 could reduce the five-year outlook by 16.5 GW.

“After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC,” Weis said. “While domestic supply is ramping up, shortages are possible, and developers may still rely on Chinese cells to fill gaps.”

The report warns that projects failing to hit certain milestones by the end of 2025 could face new permitting and regulatory risks, underscoring the urgency to build now under current rules.

Yixian Sun highlighted a differing perspective: “I don’t think Chinese actors are unwilling to transfer or share their technologies to their Global South partners.
Echoing Hove’s “co-evolution” framing, Sun said this “shouldn’t be a one-way process where Chinese companies pass know-how to their Global South partners.","In the past decade, China has regularly shattered clean technology records at home. Simultaneously, it has emerged as a major partner for countries of the Global South seeking to boost renewable energy capacity and pursue low-carbon development.

Domestic clean-tech manufacturers have underpinned China’s vast expansions of solar and wind power, battery capacity and electric vehicles (EVs), and they are now increasingly seeking, and finding, new markets overseas. In 2024, exports of these four technologies from China to the regions of the Global South totalled over USD 72 billion, accounting for almost half of all wind, solar and EV exports.

For many countries, these imports have brought a much-needed boost to sustainability efforts, expanding access to electricity and driving booms in renewable capacity. But ambitions among Global South nations to move beyond a trade-only relationship in these goods are being regularly voiced, including in bilateral meetings with Chinese counterparts and in international summits.

The hope is that China can be not just a source of imports for green tech, infrastructure and services, but also a provider of the technology and knowledge that can enable increased manufacturing and innovation within countries’ own borders.

At a diplomatic level, China has long been sensitive to such requests, promoting scholarships to study in China, technical cooperation platforms and “Luban Workshops” for vocational training in partner countries. Expansions of all such initiatives were pledged to nations as China hosted the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization Plus meeting in Tianjin, for example. But they may not be enough, and such transfer of technology and knowledge is a complex, and often contentious, topic.

During China’s own rapid industrialisation since Reform and Opening Up began in 1978, Chinese companies themselves benefited from exchanges with European and American partners, as well as in the more recent development of its world-leading solar, wind and EV sectors. But analysts have told Dialogue Earth of doubts around the incentives and capacity for China’s green tech giants to share their expertise in the clean energy space. Concerning the Global South, meanwhile, they have highlighted relevant initiatives demonstrating the potential of such transfers, but also raised questions about countries’ capacity and leverage to scale up this engagement.

Defining tech transfer

Technology and knowledge transfer have long been sought by countries of the Global South, but have gained renewed attention as global efforts to build up clean energy capacity have surged. These desires are coalescing with calls from developing countries for Global North, as well as Chinese, partners and investors – often their raw material buyers – to support their industrialisation and moves up value chains.

Recommended

Issues around these transfers from China have been a key point of discussion at recent meetings co-organised by Dialogue Earth. These include a panel event held in Berlin, Germany, alongside the Heinrich Böll Foundation, and an international conference of China researchers, analysts and civil society figures, hosted by the SGAIN project at the University of Bath in England.

“There is no doubt that the sustainability transition of Global South countries will need support from China in terms of both financing and technology cooperation,” Yixian Sun, the SGAIN project’s principal investigator and the Bath conference’s lead organiser, told Dialogue Earth. “Hence, sharing, but more importantly co-developing, knowledge and technologies between China and its southern partners is a necessary step in the global sustainability transition.”

China’s own experience benefitting from such partnerships was highlighted by several attendees at the conference, with BMW’s cooperation with CATL in the early 2010s a prominent example raised by one speaker. CATL is now the world’s largest battery maker.

Anders Hove, a senior research fellow on China at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, described to Dialogue Earth how partnerships with western manufacturers in China’s auto industry “evolved from simple joint venture requirements in the nineties to more sophisticated policies that forced foreign automakers to ensure localisation of core technologies like batteries, electric motors and control systems”.

These exchanges have been a sensitive point in China’s trade relations with the US and the European Union, with allegations that “forced technology transfer” has been demanded of foreign investors – something that China’s 2019 Foreign Investment Law sought to explicitly prohibit.

Rather than a simple “one-way” movement, Hove emphasised that these relationships should be seen as “co-evolution” between partners. He raised the example of the development of China’s solar industry through collaboration with western partners, to now account for over 80% of global manufacturing: “[It] showed how German and American technicians worked with local manufacturers, creating a back-and-forth co-evolution process rather than one-way transfer.”

Hopes and doubts in Southeast Asia

China’s solar industry has emerged at the forefront of its clean-tech manufacturers’ overseas expansion, with significant growth in global exports of panels and other components during the past decade. In recent years, Chinese solar manufacturers have also relocated some of their production, notably to Southeast Asia, helping to establish Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia among the top producers and exporters outside China. These relocations have been widely read as a means for manufacturers to evade US tariffs on Chinese-made solar equipment – a trade that is now severely threatened by the Trump administration.

However, with facilities in Southeast Asia focused largely on final assembly, the extent to which knowledge and technology transfer has taken place in these investments was questioned by experts consulted by Dialogue Earth.

According to Hove, “all the know-how remains in China, all parts come from China, and the whole supply chain is still located there. There’s essentially no knowledge diffusion happening, even though there’s solar manufacturing”.

This was echoed by Jessica Liao, an associate professor at North Carolina State University whose research focuses on Chinese foreign policy and Southeast Asia. She described local capacity-building through investments as “limited”. But she also said that calls for such support have been a “rising priority” among Southeast Asian nations.

Liao pointed to Chinese investments in EV manufacturing in Thailand and the nickel industry in Indonesia as areas in which Southeast Asian countries are hoping for support to move up value chains. Nickel is a crucial component in EV batteries and Indonesia already accounts for nearly half of its global production, but the country is also hoping to establish itself among the world’s leading battery producers. CATL recently broke ground on a USD 6 billion facility in West Java.

However, Liao questioned the potential for transfers to occur in these sectors: “Most of this manufacturing is really not the knowledge- or technology-intensive part of the EV buildup. So, we haven’t seen any clear case where the host countries are benefitting from the more upstream knowledge, the core knowledge of any of those clean-tech industries.”

As the region’s largest market and economy, Indonesia may be better positioned than its Asean neighbours to benefit from these processes, holding, in Liao’s words, “more bargaining power”. She said that Malaysia may also have some advantages due to its manufacturing capacity, skilled workforce, and large Chinese diaspora populations with a history of doing business with China. But, she added, “most Asean countries have a modest market size and a lot of regulatory and institutional barriers, so it’s difficult for a Chinese investor to see to what extent there can be knowledge transfer”.

Lessons from Brazil

As South America’s leading industrial hub and home to a well-established clean energy market, Brazil has been a top destination for Chinese green-tech manufacturers’ overseas expansion – and arguably a frontrunner in knowledge and technology transfer partnerships.

Chinese auto giant BYD, the world’s largest EV maker, recently announced that its first Brazil-made vehicles had rolled off its production line in the north-eastern state of Bahia. Fellow manufacturer Great Wall Motors cut the ribbon on an EV factory in São Paulo in August. One of China’s largest wind turbine manufacturers, Goldwind, has also launched a base in Bahia to assemble in Brazil, which is the world’s fifth largest wind power market.

João Cumarú, a Brazil-China specialist and international advisor at Consorcio Nordeste, a development body for Brazil’s north-east region, told Dialogue Earth that knowledge and technology transfer have emerged as “one of the central pillars of the bilateral agenda”.

“During his last visit to China, President Lula pointed out that investments shouldn’t be only about infrastructure – they also need to include education, technology and training people, so Brazil can strengthen its own value chains,” Cumarú added.

In addition to the existing investments in EV and wind turbine manufacturing, Cumarú said there is “a lot of interest in Chinese expertise with critical minerals, especially in refining and processing”, which could help Brazil take advantage of its own reserves.

Several initiatives to directly foster knowledge and technology transfer in green sectors have already been established between the two countries. Both Cumarú and Sun highlighted the China-Brazil Center for Climate Change and Innovative Energy Technology (CCB) as one example. Created in 2009 via a partnership between the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Tsinghua University in Beijing, the centre promotes academic exchanges and joint development in bioenergy, solar and wind power, and electricity transmission. Cumarú also spoke of cooperation projects in the agricultural sector and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as CBERS, the decades-old China-Brazil satellite programme.

In Cumarú’s view, effective exchanges in these areas depend on strong government support: “You need stable policies, clear rules on intellectual property and incentives for joint ventures. Mechanisms like the China-Brazil High-Level Coordination Committee can help to set the agenda and make sure things actually move forward.” Finance, too, “is another piece of the puzzle”, and support for such programmes from federal agencies and institutions, such as Brazil’s development bank BNDES, is necessary. “Without resources, cooperation risks staying only on paper.”

Policy signals and preparedness

On the prospects for knowledge and technology transfer between China and Global South countries, experts told Dialogue Earth of barriers in host countries, but also the incentives for Chinese companies, and authorities, to engage.

Recommended

Anders Hove spoke of “concerning signals” in China’s export controls that may limit the potential for exchanges around technologies such as batteries, which he said have been designated as “sensitive technology”. On balance, he said, “It’s more than half dependent on Global South countries developing their own absorptive capacity, but China’s government policies on technology export controls are equally crucial.”

Jessica Liao, meanwhile, highlighted Chinese companies’ motivations: “Their incentive is really not to help the local economy or local industrialists to have the independent capacity to do it … their primary concern is to help solve their domestic overcapacity problem. Why [would] they have any incentives to reproduce all those as surplus in Southeast Asia again?”

Measures such as export controls signal to clean-tech companies that their core technology should “stay home”, Liao added. These companies “walk a tightrope” to balance government support while pursuing their overseas expansion, she said, “aware that this expansion should really just be at the low end of production”.

Yixian Sun highlighted a differing perspective: “I don’t think Chinese actors are unwilling to transfer or share their technologies to their Global South partners. In many cases, they haven’t done so because there are no viable mechanisms for this, with transfer not only too costly in today’s market, but also challenging due to cultural differences.”

Sun, like all other fellow interviewees, spoke of capacity constraints and a lack of coherent strategies in partner countries: “The challenges in many host countries actually lie in the lack of well-designed policies to promote this, as well as the lack of human resources to absorb relevant technological know-how.”

Hove similarly described human resources as an important factor in technology and knowledge transfer: “You can’t put skills and knowledge in a container. Even if there was some textbook or Wikipedia file that could be transferred, that wouldn’t solve the fundamental human resource challenge that developing countries face.”

The potential of overcoming such constraints and creating the environment for these exchanges may be reflected in the experiences of Brazil – though both Sun and Cumarú said tracking concrete initiatives for knowledge and technology transfer is not straightforward, neither is measuring their impact, which tends to occur in the longer term.

Echoing Hove’s “co-evolution” framing, Sun said this “shouldn’t be a one-way process where Chinese companies pass know-how to their Global South partners. Instead, it should be a mutual learning process, where Chinese actors engage with their Southern partners to develop or improve clean technologies”.

The act changes three pieces of energy legislation, including the Electricity Act, the Public Utilities Act, and the Marine Renewable Energy Act.

‘We’re unleashing Nova Scotia’s untapped potential to make our province a clean energy and economic powerhouse,” Energy Minister Trevor Boudrau said in the press release. “This means good jobs, stronger communities, and more opportunities right here at home, and it means we can pay for the investments our province needs in areas like healthcare, highways and homes.”

This comes as the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator is starting the first phase of a licensing process to tap into Nova Scotia’s offshore wind to produce 62 gigawatts of clean energy.

“Our goal is to move this along in an appropriate fashion to make sure it’s done right, but certainly our goal is to move it quickly as well,” Boudreau said.

The announcement came nine days after Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Ottawa was prepared to work with Nova Scotia to ramp up its ambitious plans for the so-called Wind West project, which is aimed at providing power to the rest of Atlantic Canada and beyond.

Nova Scotia estimates the initial capital cost of Wind West at around $60 billion. The province said it would expect a 4 per cent royalty from offshore production and is seeking federal investment tax credits and low-interest financing through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.

The province also announced this summer that four offshore areas had been designated for offshore wind development. The areas include French Bank, Middle Bank and Sable Island Bank — all south of Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore — and Sydney Bight, northeast of Cape Breton.

What is the credit? The California Climate Credit comes in April and October from providers who are regulated by the state’s public utilities commission. It’s funded by the state’s cap-and-trade program, which allows industries that emit greenhouse gases to buy pollution allowances.

Listen • 0:45

Many will see lower electricity bills in October

How much could I get? More than 11 million households will get a cut this round, but the amount varies by utility. Here’s a breakdown for qualified utilities in Southern California:

Southern California Edison: $56

San Diego Gas & Electric: $81.38

Bear Valley Electric Service: $34.91

All community choice aggregators, such as the Clean Power Alliance and Orange County Power Authority, also get the credit. You can check with your utility for specific amounts.

Any help for LADWP customers? Sorry, you’re not eligible for the credit because the utility is managed by the city.

Next year’s credit: The climate credit will come again in April — this time for electric and gas bills. According to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office, those amounts will also increase because of new legislation. It’s not yet clear by how much.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3ac432a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5476x2875+0+355/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F66%2F47%2F1513aa2a4185b6f084bd98c79f39%2Fgettyimages-1221250506.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 17:00:30.101622

Holyoke will become the first city in the northeast United States to adopt Veolia’s Hubgrade technology for wastewater treatment, which uses AI-enabled predictive technology, robotics, digital twins and 3D virtual reality systems to analyze system performance. It will recommend operational adjustments to Veolia’s experienced team at the site and the Holyoke Department of Public Works, which can use Hubgrade insights to reduce energy consumption and chemical use, extend the useful life of expensive equipment, and cut costs.

Holyoke Mayor Joshua A. Garcia said: “Holyoke remains committed to pioneering sustainable environmental solutions that support our community’s growth and protect our natural resources. This partnership with Veolia exemplifies our dedication to innovation, efficiency, and environmental stewardship – creating a cleaner, healthier future for all residents.”

David Connors, President of Veolia Municipal Water’s Contract Operations in New England, said: “Veolia applauds the City of Holyoke for selecting Veolia as the best option to help Holyoke transform its wastewater system for greater sustainability, improved performance and future growth. Veolia is indeed the recognized leader in America’s water industry, and as active partners with the communities we serve, we are excited to deploy the Hubgrade technology that will drive ongoing improvements.”

Veolia has served Holyoke since 2005, and the new contract will continue Veolia’s partnership with the City and its Department of Public Works through 2035, with the opportunity for an additional five-year extension. Holyoke’s leadership reached a unanimous decision to maintain the contractual relationship with Veolia following a competitive bid process.

The renewed collaboration between Veolia and Holyoke will see an even greater focus on modernization and operational efficiency – including an enhanced geographic information system to digitize the location of wastewater infrastructure, routine digital camera inspections of the system’s assets, shared energy-saving measures and a new centrifuge that will improve efficiency in hauling costs.

As part of the agreement, Veolia will continue operations and management of the conventional activated sludge plant, capable of treating as much as 17.5 million gallons of wastewater each day. Veolia will also continue to maintain 40 miles of dedicated sewer mains and 77 miles of combined sewer and stormwater mains. The Holyoke system features 13 combined sewer overflow outfalls, three interceptors, and seven remote pumping stations – all of which are held to rigorous regulatory standards by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Joseph Tackett, CEO of Veolia’s Municipal Water Contract Operations, said: “Partnering with Holyoke’s Department of Public Works on efficient and effective upgrades will help the City fulfill its potential for economic growth and environmental security. We appreciate the committee’s unanimous decision to renew with Veolia and its recognition of our committed staffers who serve the city every day, and we’re grateful for the opportunity to continue proving our commitment to Holyoke’s future.”

Veolia has a long-established reputation for high-quality operation of water and wastewater systems across New England, including facilities in Springfield, Westborough, and Taunton, Massachusetts. Veolia’s service to the region exemplifies its global GreenUp strategy, striving to lead the ecological transformation of the planet by accelerating water quality improvement, hazardous waste treatment and disposal, decarbonization and technological innovation.

Michigan is moving forward with its revised electric vehicle charging plan after receiving federal approval. The US Department of Transportation approved the state’s plan under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, allocating $52 million remaining from an original $110 million. The Trump administration froze the $52 million in February.

One of the biggest challenges for electric vehicles is the limited number of charging stations. Michigan plans to fund a total of 83 stations. Two are already operational and four more are under construction. The rest are still being planned.

General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), a leading U.S. automaker, is making strategic adjustments as it navigates evolving consumer demand and policy changes in the electric vehicle (EV) market.

In early September 2025, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) announced temporary production cuts at its Spring Hill, Tennessee EV plant, halting assembly of Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq SUVs through December and scaling back production into early 2026. The move follows weaker-than-expected demand after the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September.

The announcement came shortly after GM reported record U.S. EV sales in August, with over 21,000 units sold across popular models like the Chevy Equinox EV, Cadillac Lyriq, and GMC Sierra EV. While sales momentum has slowed, the corporation remains confident in its long-term EV growth, supported by demand for affordable models such as the Chevy Equinox EV under $35,000 and the upcoming Chevy Bolt EV near $30,000.

Strategically, the firm is bolstering its competitive edge through a partnership with Hyundai to co-develop new vehicles, including compact SUVs, sedans, pickups, and an electric van for North America. The collaboration focuses on shared R&D and sourcing of key materials like batteries and steel to improve efficiency and cost competitiveness, further cementing GM’s place among the best manufacturing stocks to watch in the EV space.

In a symbolic shift, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) also announced plans to move its headquarters from Detroit’s Renaissance Center to Woodward Avenue, underscoring a new era as the company balances internal combustion and EV production. CEO Mary Barra emphasized resilience amid supply chain disruptions and regulatory changes while reaffirming GM’s commitment to delivering vehicles that appeal to a broad range of consumers.

Chinese electric vehicles are affordable because their manufacturers leverage an exceptionally efficient supply chain, government support, large-scale production, and export-oriented flexibility.","In the last decade, Chinese electric vehicle (EV) brands have transformed from niche market participants into global contenders, disrupting the auto industry with models that cost thousands—sometimes tens of thousands—less than their Western counterparts.

In some markets, Chinese EVs are even priced competitively with used cars, yet they often boast advanced features like autonomous driving assistance, AI-powered infotainment, and rapid-charging battery technology.

If you’ve ever entered a “win a car” giveaway or browsed car competitions online, you may have noticed that Chinese EVs are increasingly showing up as prizes alongside high-end models from Tesla or Volkswagen. That’s no accident—their low cost makes them attractive for both consumers and promotional campaigns. But how exactly can these vehicles be so affordable? The answer lies in China’s unique supply chain ecosystem, strategic government policy, and innovative production methods.

1. Vertical Integration and Supplier Clusters

One of China’s biggest competitive advantages in EV manufacturing is its highly integrated supply chain. In industrial hubs like Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Changzhou, dozens of suppliers for batteries, motors, chips, and even seat upholstery operate within a few miles of each other.

This clustering reduces transportation costs, shortens lead times, and fosters faster communication between manufacturers and parts suppliers. In many cases, the EV manufacturer and its component suppliers share R&D facilities, allowing for synchronized design and production cycles.

By contrast, Western automakers often import parts from multiple countries, which adds shipping costs, tariffs, and weeks—if not months—to production schedules. When your entire supply chain fits into a few industrial parks, economies of scale kick in quickly.

2. Battery Manufacturing at Scale

Batteries are the single most expensive component of an EV, sometimes accounting for 30–40% of total production costs. China is the world leader in battery production, home to giants like CATL and BYD, which supply not only domestic brands but also global automakers like BMW and Tesla.

These battery manufacturers benefit from both vertical integration and massive production volumes, driving down the cost per kilowatt-hour. Additionally, China dominates the global refining of key battery minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. By controlling upstream raw material processing and downstream assembly, Chinese brands keep battery costs significantly lower than their foreign rivals.

3. Government Subsidies and Strategic Policies

For over a decade, the Chinese government has provided generous subsidies to EV manufacturers and consumers. While some of these programs have been scaled back recently, their long-term effects remain. Subsidies helped Chinese EV makers achieve early mass production, invest in R&D, and build domestic brand loyalty.

Furthermore, government-led infrastructure projects—like nationwide high-speed charging networks—reduce the consumer’s “range anxiety,” boosting demand and enabling further economies of scale. Many local governments also offer incentives for companies to set up manufacturing plants, providing cheap land leases, tax breaks, and low-interest loans.

4. Lower Labor and Compliance Costs

China’s labor costs are higher than they were a decade ago, but they are still lower than in Europe, Japan, or the U.S., especially for skilled manufacturing work. Coupled with longer working hours and fewer production bottlenecks, this allows for more flexible and cost-efficient production cycles.

In addition, environmental and regulatory compliance—while tightening in recent years—still imposes lower direct costs on manufacturers than in highly regulated markets like California or the EU.

5. Design-to-Cost Philosophy

Many Chinese EV makers use a “design-to-cost” approach from day one, which means every feature, material, and process is evaluated for its cost-effectiveness before production begins. This doesn’t necessarily mean lower quality—many Chinese EVs now rival or exceed Western models in tech features—but it does mean avoiding costly overengineering in areas the target market doesn’t value.

For example, while a European luxury EV might use premium leather and complex seat adjustment mechanisms, a Chinese brand might use high-quality synthetic materials and simpler mechanisms that still feel premium but cost less to produce.

6. Marketing Through Prize Campaigns

Interestingly, one way these brands expand their reach in foreign markets is by partnering with promotional campaigns, including car competitions and raffles. You’ve probably seen ads where you can “win a campervan” or “win a car” by purchasing tickets or entering a giveaway.

Chinese EVs, being cost-effective yet feature-packed, are increasingly popular choices for these prize draws. For the promoter, it’s a high-value prize that’s more affordable than a European or American equivalent. For the EV manufacturer, it’s free publicity and a way to put more cars on the road, creating organic word-of-mouth marketing.

7. Export-Ready Production Lines

Chinese automakers design their factories with export in mind. Many production lines are flexible enough to produce both left-hand and right-hand drive vehicles, and to meet various international safety standards. This flexibility allows them to quickly respond to demand in different countries without costly retooling.

They also leverage partnerships with foreign distributors to bypass some of the high costs of setting up independent dealer networks abroad.

8. The Future: Will Prices Stay Low?

While Chinese EV prices are likely to remain competitive for the foreseeable future, there are pressures on the horizon. Rising raw material prices, potential trade tariffs, and competition from other low-cost producers (such as in Southeast Asia) could squeeze margins. Additionally, as global safety and emissions standards become more stringent, compliance costs may rise.

However, Chinese manufacturers are already working on innovations like sodium-ion batteries, which could further slash costs. If these technologies succeed, we could see even cheaper EVs entering both domestic and global markets—possibly showing up even more often in promotional prize campaigns and giveaways.

Chinese electric vehicles are affordable because their manufacturers leverage an exceptionally efficient supply chain, government support, large-scale production, and export-oriented flexibility. By integrating production, controlling battery technology, and streamlining design, they are able to keep costs low without compromising on innovation or quality. This combination is reshaping the global EV market and challenging long-standing industry leaders.",https://evpowered.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Xpeng-G6-SUV-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 15:59:37.852764

Our economy continues to grow.","Indiana is booming. Smart leadership, sound policy and one of the most productive workforces in the nation have made us a paradigm of success. Wages for families are increasing. Investment in our local communities continues to pay off in the form of more tax revenue to fund critical services. These are just some of the examples of the groundwork we are laying for a more prosperous future for Hoosiers.

Take a look at Fort Wayne and Allen County. New investments in 2024 alone have pushed salaries 18% higher than the county’s average wage. This helps give families a leg up and keeps Indiana-grown talent in Indiana for the long term. Much of this investment is helping build the U.S. economy for the 21st century.

Keeping the momentum going means we must work together to achieve smart growth. Recently, there has been a great deal of attention paid to Indiana’s efforts to grow our energy capacity to power our industrial economy for the long-haul. These conversations are essential to ensure we advance solutions to our most pressing challenges so we can continue to make our economy thrive.

Story Continues Below

Fortunately, Indiana’s private sector partners are on the forefront of this growth and taking proactive steps to address energy demand. Google’s partnership with CTC Global is a great example of organizations working together to enhance our grid and help tackle our need for more energy. This partnership will work to identify areas to deploy advanced conductors across our electric grid. These technologies carry more power than standard transmission lines but can be used on existing infrastructure, meaning that more electricity can flow to homes and businesses when they need it, while keeping prices stable.

This announcement helps build on the success seen at the Statehouse this year. Strong progress was made on energy policy, incentivizing the players in the energy conversation to come together and take our state’s economy to the next level. Indiana Michigan Power’s agreement around interconnection rules for large-load customers put our state on a path to draw more investment to our communities. Solutions like these can only be found when we work together and put the needs of our communities first.

At the national level, the Trump administration has made it clear that returning the United States to being the global energy leader is a top priority. Not only is energy production and delivery essential for our national security but it also helps ensure that the United States, with Indiana leading the way, is well equipped to beat China in the AI race. To make this a reality, we must welcome investment here in Indiana and implement policy that backs it up.

Gov. Mike Braun recently reinforced his commitment to making Indiana a national energy leader by harnessing an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy while prioritizing the development of nuclear energy. A recent Purdue University study said that Indiana has the opportunity to deploy 24/7 carbon free electricity with the proliferation of small modular reactors. These reactors can be built in less time than traditional reactors, their construction will bring thousands of jobs to our state and they can secure Indiana’s role as an energy innovation leader.

Our neighbors in the Midwest continue to over-tax and over-regulate development, but here in Indiana, it is a different story. Our economy continues to grow. More talent is flocking here. Wages for families are on the rise. By working together, citizens, businesses and government, we can harness the opportunity before us and build a stronger state for generations to come.•

Dealerships across the U.S. are reporting unprecedented demand, with buyers scrambling to secure incentives that could save them thousands on models like the Tesla Model Y or Chevrolet Bolt. This last-minute rush, fueled by the impending deadline, has led to a temporary boom in sales, but industry analysts suggest it may lay the groundwork for sustained growth in electric mobility even after the rebates vanish.

Data from recent reports indicate that EV sales have spiked by as much as 30% in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the previous year, according to figures compiled by automotive research firms. This frenzy isn’t just about immediate savings; it’s prompting manufacturers to ramp up production and innovate in pricing strategies to maintain momentum post-incentive.

The Irony of Incentive Sunset: How Short-Term Panic Fuels Long-Term Shift

Experts argue that the end of the tax credit, enacted through recent Republican-led tax legislation, could paradoxically accelerate EV adoption by forcing the industry to address core barriers like cost and infrastructure. As noted in a detailed analysis by CNN Business, while short-term sales may dip, the pre-deadline surge is educating a broader consumer base about EV benefits, from lower operating costs to environmental advantages. Automakers, facing potential slumps, are already pivoting toward more affordable models without relying on government subsidies.

In states like California and New York, where EV penetration is highest, the rebate’s demise is seen as a test of market maturity. A report from the Times Union highlights that only about 3% of vehicles in New York are currently electric, but the rush is pushing dealerships to offer competitive financing and trade-in deals, potentially normalizing EVs in everyday budgets.

Market Dynamics Post-Rebate: Automakers’ Strategic Responses

Beyond the U.S., global trends offer clues to the future. In Singapore, the extension of EV early adoption schemes with reduced rebates through 2025 has not deterred buyers, as detailed in coverage by The Straits Times, where maximum incentives dropped but adoption rates held steady due to falling battery costs and improved charging networks. Similarly, U.S. manufacturers like Ford and GM are investing heavily in battery technology to cut production expenses, aiming to make EVs price-competitive with gasoline cars by 2027.

This shift is echoed in insights from Forbes, which posits that the credit’s end could “reshape the electric vehicle market” by testing whether consumers value EVs intrinsically, without fiscal crutches. Industry insiders point to falling lithium prices and economies of scale as key factors that could drive down sticker prices by 15-20% in the coming years.

Infrastructure Investments: The Unsung Hero of Sustained Growth

A critical element in this transition is the expansion of charging infrastructure, which has long been a hurdle for widespread adoption. Recent federal funding, separate from the tax credit, is accelerating the build-out of fast-charging stations, with companies like Seattle-based Electric Era raising fresh capital to deploy battery-integrated systems, as reported by GeekWire. This investment surge, timed with the rebate rush, is creating a more robust ecosystem that could outlast the incentives.

Consumer confidence is also building through real-world exposure. The pre-expiration buying bonanza is introducing EVs to demographics previously hesitant, such as rural drivers concerned about range. According to Cox Automotive, post-incentive strategies focusing on “cost, confidence, and convenience” will be pivotal, with automakers likely to emphasize total ownership savings over upfront discounts.

Global Parallels and Future Projections: Lessons from Abroad

Looking abroad, the UK’s introduction of discounts up to £3,750 on electric cars starting in July 2025, as announced by GOV.UK, suggests that targeted incentives can bridge gaps without long-term dependency. In India, events like the Global Clean Mobility Summit 2025 are poised to boost innovation, per EV Mechanica, highlighting how policy shifts can catalyze technological leaps.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-afb56ace-0503-4eff-ad97-4a6a83437de9.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 18:02:40.565532

GEAPP added that it plans to invest $7.5 billion over the next five years to expand clean energy solutions across the continent.

The contribution forms part of a wider collective drive. GEAPP, created in 2021 by the IKEA Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund, operates in more than 30 countries. It combines philanthropic and public financing to leverage development banks and private investors.

The alliance said such contributions aim to provide coherence and visibility to global efforts, showing that modest funding can create significant impact when aligned with large-scale strategies.

Despite growing mobilization, Africa’s energy needs remain vast. The International Energy Agency estimated in 2024 that developing countries outside China must multiply clean energy investments sixfold to reach $1.6 trillion annually by the early 2030s to meet climate commitments.

In this context, contributions like GEAPP’s are critical, particularly when they integrate into collective initiatives that pool resources and align objectives. The trajectory of Africa’s electricity access will depend in part on the convergence of such efforts.

Race to Funding the Government, and Climate Assistance, Before Oct. 1

Congress is once again nearing a fiscal cliff which could lead to a government shutdown. Recently, the House pushed through a government funding extension (commonly called a “continuing resolution”) that was quickly voted down in the Senate. Senate Democrats then put forward a bill that, in addition to extending funding for the government, would have also extended key healthcare subsidies due to expire and reasserted Congress’ power of the purse. That bill was also voted down, deepening the stalemate between the two sides less than a week before the September 30 deadline.

As we often say here at FCNL, a government shutdown would be a disaster for everyone, but especially for the most vulnerable folks here at home and abroad. For the climate, a funding lapse would block critical international climate assistance from flowing to the communities in the Global South that most need support in adapting to the climate crisis. We’re continuing to push for Congress to pass a bipartisan funding bill that extends government funding and ensures no unnecessary delays in getting climate assistance out the door. Any government funding bill must include binding legislative measures that reassert Congress’ power of the purse and guarantee federal funds are fully and directly delivered to the initiatives to which Congress has designated them.

FCNL Advocacy Teams around the country are meeting with congressional offices this month to urge them to protect international climate finance in the FY26 appropriations bill with strong safeguards to ensure Congress’ appropriations are fully implemented.

Administration Is Attempting to Block Maryland’s First Offshore Wind Project

In a motion filed with the U.S. District Court in Maryland, the Interior Department asked a judge to revoke approval for a major offshore wind project near Ocean City, Maryland. The 114-turbine, 80,000-acre project is slated to begin construction over the next few years. Administration officials argue that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management made an “error” when assessing the turbines’ impacts on other activities like search-and-rescue operations and commercial fishing in the region.

This move by the administration marks a major setback to an industry already under significant pressure. The wind industry is racing against a narrowing window to secure clean energy tax credits. More than a decade in the making, the Ocean City windfarm was projected to deliver power to over 700,000 homes in a state already struggling with skyrocketing energy demand.

EPA Plans to Scrap Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has moved to end a program requiring large greenhouse gas polluters to publicly disclose the role their facilities play in driving climate change. The program began in 2009 and covers emissions from 47 source categories at 8,000 facilities across the country. Ending the program would be a major blow for scientists studying how best to address greenhouse gas pollution from major facilities. This is, unfortunately, just the latest in a string of proposals that EPA has made in recent months to pull back from its mandate to safeguard the country from climate change and the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions.

Why it matters to households and workers Clean energy hiring has outpaced the rest of the economy.","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) says it will send back more than $13 billion that had been set aside for clean energy programs. The agency hasn’t listed every program yet, but the decision ties to a new law that cancels “unobligated” money from recent climate and energy initiatives.

What changed — in plain terms

The move follows the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1), which became law on July 4, 2025. Parts of the law rescind unused balances from several Inflation Reduction Act programs across agencies. That includes energy loans, grid and transmission support, and other climate programs when funds weren’t yet obligated.

What the DOE and the White House say

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the money “was slated to go out to subsidize wind, solar, batteries, and electric vehicles.” He framed the step as giving money back to taxpayers and refocusing on “more affordable, reliable, and secure” energy. President Donald Trump has also criticized global climate efforts and subsidies for clean energy.

Officials did not release a detailed list of affected projects. Reporters asked for specifics, but the department didn’t share names of individual grants or awards.

What outside reporting and research say

Independent coverage confirms the plan to pull back more than $13 billion and notes that the department hasn’t identified each program that will lose funding. The reporting also captures Wright’s criticism of international climate policy and his current plan to skip the UN climate talks in Brazil.

Programs that could be touched

Analyses of the new law point to a broad set of IRA-era programs where unobligated money could be rescinded, including parts of the DOE loan authority and some transmission and industrial decarbonization efforts, as well as non-DOE programs at EPA, DOT, USDA, and GSA. The Senate parliamentarian left some program authorities intact, but money that wasn’t obligated may still be clawed back.

How big is clean energy work today?

Clean energy jobs grew much faster than the rest of the U.S. workforce in 2024. The sector added almost 100,000 jobs and reached about 3.56 million workers. These roles span energy efficiency, solar, wind, EVs, batteries, and grid work. But new federal pullbacks could slow future growth, several groups warn.

Metric Clean Energy U.S. Workforce Source Job growth (2024) ~2.8% ~0.8% E2 report New jobs added ~100,000 — E2 report Total clean energy workers ~3.56 million — E2 report Share of new energy jobs ~82% — E2/PV Magazine

What supporters argue

Cost focus: Backers say rolling back subsidies can lower federal spending and keep energy “affordable and reliable.”

Policy reset: They argue that international climate deals haven’t delivered major global emissions cuts, so it’s time to change course.

Energy security: The administration highlights oil and gas output and grid reliability as near-term priorities.

What critics say

Jobs risk: Pulling funds may slow hiring and projects in solar, wind, EVs, batteries, and efficiency. Recent job gains are at stake.

Global standing: Critics warn the U.S. could cede clean-tech leadership to competitors like China.

Power bills: Some grid operators and analysts worry that freezing renewables while propping up costly coal can raise electricity costs.

How this fits into the new law

The budget law is broad. It touches climate and energy across many agencies, not just DOE. Public summaries and trackers note that it rescinds unobligated IRA funding and, in some cases, removes or narrows program authority. But because each agency had different timelines, the on-the-ground impact will vary by program and by whether an award was already committed.

What we still don’t know

Exact list of cuts: DOE hasn’t published a full list of projects or accounts that will lose money.

Schedule: The timeline for returning funds and its step-by-step process remains unclear.

Legal challenges: It’s not yet clear whether lawsuits will test parts of the rescissions, especially where stakeholders expected near-term awards. (Inference based on prior budget rescission disputes.)

Why it matters to households and workers

Clean energy hiring has outpaced the rest of the economy. Many of those jobs are in energy efficiency, which includes common work like HVAC upgrades and building retrofits. If funding slows, some projects may pause or shrink, which could affect local contractors and suppliers. On the other hand, supporters say reducing federal subsidies might ease fiscal pressure and steer investment toward technologies they view as more dependable today.

The state found about 12,000 locations that no longer needed service, according to Broadband Expanded.","COLUMBIA — The state Broadband Office is preparing to hook into the information superhighway the last remaining South Carolina homes and businesses without high-speed internet access.

The public has until just before midnight Friday to comment on the state’s plan, which state broadband chief Jim Stritzinger called “the anchor leg of the broadband investment relay race here in South Carolina.” The office will then submit for final approval the plan for spending its share of a $42 billion federal grant program.

The milestone is one to celebrate. The final round will complete an effort that began in 2020.

By the 2030 deadline, the combined public-private effort will have connected more than 200,000 locations statewide, Stritzinger said in a statement.

Still, how the state plans to link up about half of its final locations raises concerns about affordability and reliability, some broadband groups say.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of broadband and the state’s digital divide. Without high-speed internet, people couldn’t work or attend classes amid closures. In rural areas where healthcare access is thin, patients are increasingly turning to virtual visits with doctors. But being diagnosed by a physician over a video call is nearly impossible without a good connection.

Legislators recognized broadband was a critical need, not a luxury.

In response, they designated $490 million over two years toward extending access statewide, the bulk of it from federal COVID aid packages. The biggest single chunk — $400 million approved in May 2022 — came from the $2.5 billion that flowed to state coffers from the American Rescue Plan Act.

People across SC connected to high-speed internet with $400M: ‘It completely transformed us’

With that $400 million, combined with $263 million in private investment, state-contracted companies added high-speed internet access to more than 117,000 homes, businesses and community buildings, such as schools and libraries.

When that money ran dry last year, there were about 20,480 locations still without a connection, according to the latest data from the state Broadband Office — down from an earlier estimate of about 32,000.

Infrastructure funds for broadband

The state then turned its attention to a federal grant program — Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) — funded through the federal Infrastructure Investment spending package passed by Congress in November 2021.

That program, pushed by U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., brought $551.5 million into the state, but under the final plan up for review, the state says it needs only a fraction — 7.5% — of it.

According to the Broadband Office, which the Legislature officially created in 2021, the state’s early investments of pandemic relief funds toward broadband, starting with $50 million in June 2020, provided a head start. Private companies also have expanded their service areas and made investments that helped fill in gaps.

What will become of the remaining funds is unknown.

States were supposed to be allowed to use leftover funds to pay for things other than broadband deployment. But the federal telecommunications agency has not yet released guidance since the Trump administration revised the rules in June.

“There’s a lot of fear right now that (the National Telecommunications and Information Administration) may try to call that money back, which would be a big shame,” Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband in the Chicago area, told States Newsroom affiliate Stateline.

South Carolina is far from the only state with a potential surplus:

In Oklahoma, critics noticed the updated plan would not be using $225 million of the state’s allocated funds.

In Nevada, that number is nearly $250 million.

Arizona — $481 million left over

Kentucky — $623 million

Mississippi — $633 million

Louisiana — $750 million

North Carolina — $1 billion

And the list goes on, according to the Benton Institute, which has been tracking these plans.

Most of the state plans do not mention how they would like to spend the remaining funds.

But Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, in a letter sent earlier this month, asked the U.S. Department of Commerce, which administers the program, to allow states to spend it on artificial intelligence efforts and education and workforce initiatives. Louisiana also previously sought to spend the funds on rural healthcare.

Program changes

The program changes implemented by the Trump administration, which put a focus on driving down costs as much as possible, also has led to other shifts, said Alex Karras, a researcher with the Broadband Expanded project at New York Law School.

Namely, more states have turned to satellite internet companies that cost less to build but tend to have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable, favored for its speed and durability.

That includes Elon Musk’s Starlink, which states could award about $10 billion worth of projects nationwide, according to The Wall Street Journal. There’s also Amazon’s Project Kuiper, which has yet to start service as it has struggled to get satellites into space, the Journal also reported.

Under South Carolina’s state plan, the two tech giants are in line for $7.9 million worth of contracts, covering 49% of the remaining unserved homes and businesses. While these locations are scattered across the state, there are clusters in the rural areas surrounding Greenville, Columbia, Florence and Orangeburg, as well as Cherokee, Darlington, and Hampton counties, that will rely on the satellites for service, according to a map put out by the Broadband Office.

It’s a bird, it’s a plane. No, it’s broadband!

While not as fast as fiber-optic cables, the satellites could reach parts of the state where installing cables is difficult, Stritzinger has previously said.

And though satellite internet makes up a large chunk of this latest investment round, it accounts for just 5% of the locations where the state has worked to add service, according to data from the Broadband Office.

Whether satellite internet technology will be able to consistently meet the minimum speed requirements under the federal program remains in question. In a Starlink test program, only 17.4% of users were getting high enough speeds over the first three months of 2025, according to an analysis by Ookla, a company that measures internet speeds.

However, the analysis noted, the company’s speeds have increased significantly over the past several years. The challenge will be maintaining that speed as the company adds more customers.

“If four out of five subscribers aren’t getting broadband speeds today, what do people think is going to happen when you add in hundreds of thousands of new users?” Sascha Meinrath, a professor at Penn State and co-author of a recent study questioning whether Starlink, the internet division of SpaceX, can meet the program’s requirements, told Spotlight Pennsylvania.

Also under the program rule changes, while internet providers must still offer low-cost residential service options, states no longer have the power to dictate the rates.

Amazon has yet to publicize the rates it plans to charge when its satellite system is operational. In the test program, Starlink gave free equipment, valued at $350, to each user who agreed to sign up for a one-year plan that cost $120 per month for higher speeds and $80 per month for lower ones.

A grant program offering low-income families a $100 discount to buy equipment and a $30 monthly discount on their internet bill ended last year without additional funding from Congress.

Remaining locations

While states have been finalizing their plans this month, rollout of the BEAD program was delayed after the Trump administration asked states to recheck their list of unserved locations to search for duplications and other unnecessary service areas.

For South Carolina, that proved to be a useful exercise. The state found about 12,000 locations that no longer needed service, according to Broadband Expanded.

The vast majority of those — about 6,790 locations — already received service via high-speed fiber installed during other projects funded by COVID relief dollars or a state-funded grant program.

Another 3,370 locations already had privately funded internet access. And about 1,800 were mistakes and duplications on the map.

A smaller portion of the locations were found to be structures that didn’t actually need service — garages, barns, grain silos, demolished or uninhabitable buildings.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/internet-access-2048x1366.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 16:00:16.118717

But with the explosion of Artificial Intelligence, which will be powered by data centers, these facilities are rapidly expanding into new parts of the country.
However, a planned data center or one under construction does not impact current electric prices.
If those data centers want to also use the electric grid as a backup, again, they must pay their fair share for maintaining that infrastructure.
It’s also worth saying that the rush to falsely blame data centers as the single greatest contributing factor to rising electric bills is not benign.","Rarely, if ever, do our nation’s most complex public policy problems have a singular cause. Such is the case of rising power bills across the country, and the misleading narrative that electricity is becoming more costly solely because of the growth of the data center industry.

For starters, consider Georgia, where the plan to build multiple new data centers is actually keeping electricity prices steady – bucking the national trend of rising power rates. In fact, Georgia Power, the state’s regulated utility, just got approval to freeze its rates for three years. This rate freeze is possible because data centers are pumping vast sums into the state’s economy and creating sufficient revenues for Georgia Power to stabilize rates for everyone else.

It is also worth noting, that for all the talk about data center development driving up rates across the country, current data centers are actually clustered in a small handful of states like: Virginia, Texas, California, Illinois, Florida, and New York. But with the explosion of Artificial Intelligence, which will be powered by data centers, these facilities are rapidly expanding into new parts of the country.

However, a planned data center or one under construction does not impact current electric prices.

For example, Louisiana just approved what might one day be the largest data center on the planet for Meta (Facebook’s parent company). In the frenzied lead up to the vote by the state’s Public Service Commission to approve electric service for the facility, the false narrative of data centers and higher electric prices took hold. It led to inaccurate headlines like “Louisiana’s electricity costs rise amid data center boom” even though the state only has a handful of data centers, with no impact on Louisiana’s energy prices.

Also, in some states where electricity costs are going up, it’s because of external factors that have created roadblocks preventing new sources of generation. For example, PJM, the mid-Atlantic grid operator that encompasses 13 states and the District of Columbia, has become a regime incapable of bringing sufficient new electrons onto the grid.

Now, anger at PJM’s failings is bipartisan, with nine Governors – Democrats and Republicans – in the PJM footprint recently sending the grid operator a letter stating, among other things, that: “…PJM’s multi-year inability to efficiently connect new resources to its grid and to engage in effective long-term transmission planning has deprived our states of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment…”

PJM’s dysfunction means that its available capacity today is about the same as it was in 2024. So, it’s no surprise that with the rise of electric demand, including from data centers, that PJM’s electricity prices are skyrocketing to alarming levels and creating economic hardships for millions of customers.

Another factor driving up energy costs is that electrification means more Americans are plugging in their electric vehicles, converting to electric stoves, furnaces and water heaters, and using an ever-increasing number of electrified devices. Also, we cannot ignore the fact that parts of the country are experiencing weather extremes, forcing people to use large amounts of electricity to stay comfortable year-round. This drives up energy bills and customers are understandably frustrated.

Other reasons energy prices are rising is because after years of insufficient investment, states now need to spend billions on grid improvements like new transmission lines and distribution wires to people’s homes and businesses. Because of this long-term lack of investment in our electric grid, we are dealing with a series of electricity bottlenecks across the country that drives up electricity costs. Data centers, utilities, regulators and grid operators need to come together on this crisis, to ensure that electricity can move more efficiently across the nation.

It’s also worth noting, that because the construction of data centers is so appealing to states looking to create jobs and fill tax coffers, many will be built. But, again, that doesn’t mean they need to drive-up electricity rates. In Georgia, an additional reason they could implement a three-year rate freeze, was because the electric utility, working with state regulators and their data center customers, was able to create a special rate class for data centers to ensure they cover their share of grid maintenance, and those costs are not passed onto customers.

Other options to protect customers from rate hikes due to data center expansion, include using AI to coordinate with the utilities so that when demand spikes – say during a heatwave – those data centers can be throttled down to use less electricity. Data centers can also have their own generation onsite to reduce demand and lower electricity prices. If those data centers want to also use the electric grid as a backup, again, they must pay their fair share for maintaining that infrastructure. But with coordination and common sense, utilities and data centers can profit without exposing customers to risk.

It’s also worth saying that the rush to falsely blame data centers as the single greatest contributing factor to rising electric bills is not benign. After all, if lawmakers and regulators seek to lower energy costs, by throwing up roadblocks to data center construction, they will be trying to solve a problem by addressing the wrong cause. In the end, the result will be poorly crafted public policy that hamstrings the tech sector and our economy but fails to help the American people cope with rising electricity costs.

New York Solar Energy Industries Association (NYSEIA) applauds Governor Hochul for taking action to accelerate renewable energy project development and construction.","As part of New York’s all-of-the-above energy strategy, Governor Kathy Hochul today announced a coordinated set of actions to accelerate the deployment and construction of reliable and clean energy across New York State that will help stabilize energy prices. Recognizing the near-term need for power to meet increasing electricity demand as well as economic development needs and the importance of adapting to shifting federal policies, Governor Hochul is launching a new solicitation for renewable energy and directing state agencies to work together to responsibly advance shovel-ready renewable energy projects as quickly as possible. These efforts are designed to support New York ratepayers by using sunsetting federal clean energy tax credits to bring down costs.

“While the federal government takes us backward on energy policy, New York will not be thwarted in its commitment to clean energy. By directing our state agencies to move projects across the finish line, we are seizing every opportunity to leverage federal incentives, reduce costs for ratepayers, and build a more resilient, sustainable and reliable energy grid,” Governor Hochul said. “Together, these actions are expected to unlock billions in private investment, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and build a durable energy economy that benefits New Yorkers for decades to come.”

New York's current pipeline of large-scale renewable energy is comprised of 102 solar, land-based wind, hydroelectric and offshore wind projects operating and under development that will deliver over 9.7 gigawatts of clean power to the grid when completed – enough energy to power over 3 million New York homes. The development of projects as a result of this solicitation is expected to spur over five billion dollars in clean energy investments and create more than 2,500 family-sustaining jobs in the energy economy across New York.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “New York is all about progress and we are not stopping. We are going to continue building out our energy economy and growing our already robust land-based renewables portfolio. This solicitation will serve as another building block to help ensure a continuous pipeline of viable large-scale projects as part of New York’s versatile clean energy future.”

2025 Land-Based Renewable Energy Solicitation (Tier 1 RFP)

NYSERDA today launched the 2025 Land-Based Renewable Energy Solicitation seeking to procure eligible large-scale wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects to support advancement of clean energy deployment while delivering reliable energy to all New Yorkers.

The solicitation is designed to advance late-stage large-scale renewable energy projects ready to commence construction in New York. It incorporates best practices and lessons learned from prior procurements, including key provisions on component cost indexing, labor provisions, stakeholder engagement requirements, disadvantaged community commitments, and agricultural land preservation to ensure an equitable energy transition that benefits all New Yorkers. To expedite contracting, NYSERDA has also streamlined bid requirements, with full details outlined in the solicitation documents.

The process for submitting proposals into the land-based renewables solicitation will be conducted in two steps:

Eligibility applications are due on October 21, 2025.

Final proposals from eligible participants are due on December 4, 2025, by 3 p.m.

For details, please visit the Large-Scale Renewables Solicitation page. Conditional award notifications are expected to be issued to proposers in February 2026, followed by an announcement of selected projects once the awarded contracts have been executed.

Directive to Focus on Projects that May Qualify for Existing Federal Tax Credits

State agencies will intensify efforts to advance shovel-ready renewable energy projects, with a focus on qualifying projects that seek to access existing federal tax credits that will expire. This whole-of-government approach will responsibly streamline permitting, interconnection, financing, and contracting processes to ensure that as many projects as possible reach construction quickly, providing clean power to New York homes and businesses.

New York State Public Service Commission Chair and CEO Rory M. Christian said, “We stand ready to assist our sister agencies in the development of appropriate clean energy projects in New York State. Governor Hochul’s very timely announcement will help ensure a continuous development of renewable energy projects that will help spur the creation of much needed clean energy which will strengthen the reliability of our electric grid while creating good-paying jobs.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, “Renewable energy development is one of the most important keys to reducing harmful pollution, generating green jobs, and creating more sustainable communities here in New York and across the country. Governor Hochul’s directive announced today will help further accelerate clean energy momentum already underway by comprehensive policies, programs, and investments that continue to make New York State a national leader in zero-emission energy production. DEC continues to work with our partner agencies to ensure efficient permitting processes that support these efforts.”

State Senator Kevin Parker said, “Accelerating renewable energy projects is critical to ensuring New York families have access to clean, affordable, and reliable power when they need it most. Every day we move forward means more jobs created, more communities protected from rising costs, and more progress toward a healthier environment. While uncertainty in Washington threatens to slow the clean energy transition, New York is proving that we will not wait we will lead. I remain committed to making sure our state continues to deliver for working families and disadvantaged communities, advancing projects that strengthen our energy future and our economy.”

Assemblymember Deborah Glick said, “Thank you, Governor Hochul, for recognizing that New Yorkers need an expanded grid with reliable, clean energy and lower costs. With our current federal government working hand in glove with the fossil fuel industry, it is important for New York to fully utilize the remaining federal tax credits to realize as many renewable energy projects as possible. This will not only be better for the environment, but will provide cleaner, more reliable, and less expensive energy and reduce our reliance on the more volatile and polluting fossil fuel industry.”

State Senator Peter Harckham said, “This is exactly the kind of forward-thinking climate action New York needs. Renewable energy projects are a major economic opportunity waiting to be unlocked. Expediting the Land-Based Tier 1 Renewable Energy Solicitation will mean more good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, lower utility bills for ratepayers and cleaner air for all. Thank you to Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for moving this critical work forward.”

New York League of Conservation Voters President Julie Tighe said, “While the federal government retreats, New York continues to march forward with reliable, affordable clean energy. NYSERDA’s plan to accelerate the construction and deployment of renewables is a critical step forward that will cut pollution, create good-paying jobs, and make our communities healthier and our grid more resilient. We applaud Governor Hochul for prioritizing the clean energy transition and showing the country what strong state leadership looks like.”

New York State AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento said, “Today’s announcement marks another significant step toward ensuring energy reliability and moving us closer to achieving New York’s renewable energy goals. We look forward to continuing to work with NYSERDA to ensure these projects adhere to robust labor standards and protections, creating pathways to solid union careers as we continue to advance toward a clean energy future.”

New York State Building Trades President Gary LaBarbera said, ""The continued advancement of clean energy development in New York State represents significant progress in establishing our green economy and the good paying union careers that come with it. The deployment of these projects will not only help us reach our standard-setting climate goals and deliver reliable clean energy to all New Yorkers, but it will also open up countless opportunities for hardworking people to pursue the middle class and support their families. We applaud NYSERDA for their ongoing work to streamline these crucial energy initiatives and look forward to our continued collaboration in pushing these projects forward.""

Alliance for Clean Energy New York Executive Director Marguerite Wells said, “Wind and solar projects are ready to meet the moment and provide affordable power to New Yorkers. We applaud Gov. Hochul for advancing these clean energy technologies at a time when we need them most. Against a backdrop of rising costs and the ever-present realities of climate change, renewables can revitalize upstate economies, provide much-needed power, and do so in an efficient and cost-effective manner.”

Natural Resources Defense Council Managing Director of Power Kit Kennedy said, “Building clean energy projects quickly and fairly is crucial for cutting electricity costs and creating quality jobs for New Yorkers. Every action that New York State takes to speed up renewable energy deployment helps achieve these goals. With the federal government in full retreat and denial, New York’s climate leadership is more important than ever.”

New York Solar Energy Industries Association Executive Director Noah Ginsburg said, “As the federal government eliminates support for affordable clean energy, states need to act quickly to protect electric ratepayers and the clean energy workforce. New York Solar Energy Industries Association (NYSEIA) applauds Governor Hochul for taking action to accelerate renewable energy project development and construction. These actions will ensure that New York leverages federal funding for clean energy projects today while setting the stage for cost-effective permitting and interconnection tomorrow.”

Advanced Energy United New York Policy Lead Kristina Persaud said, “We commend Governor Hochul for delivering clean, reliable, and affordable energy to New Yorkers. Large-scale renewable projects don’t just keep energy costs in check—they also strengthen our electric grid and create good jobs across the state. This procurement keeps New York on track to meet our nation-leading clean energy targets and reaffirms the Empire State’s commitment to building a clean, affordable energy future.”

The US plans to impose a 25% duty on imported heavy trucks starting on Wednesday, Trump announced in a post on Truth Social, without providing more details. Daimler Truck shares fell as much as 4.9% in Frankfurt, while Traton’s stock dropped 3.1%. Both companies operate assembly sites in Mexico that may be affected by the levies.

Shares of Sweden’s Volvo AB — which makes Volvo and Mack trucks locally — rose as much as 3.45% in Stockholm. The company may be better positioned than its peers because it relies less on manufacturing in Mexico, according to Bernstein analysts led by Harry Martin.

Trump’s latest moves add to mounting trade hurdles hitting the transport sector, with 15% duties on cars imported from the European Union weighing on the likes of Porsche AG and Volkswagen’s Audi. The truckmakers have in recent years made significant investments in new technologies including batteries and hydrogen fuel cells.

The US is Daimler Truck’s largest market, where the company generates about 40% of its global sales with brands such as Western Star, Thomas Built Buses and Freightliner. The latter dominates the country’s heavy-duty truck segment. Daimler Truck operates plants in North Carolina and Oregon but also ships in vehicles from Mexico, exposing it to potential cross-border disruptions sparked by tariffs. The company said it’s closely monitoring the situation but too early for a more detailed comment.

Traton had seen deliveries and orders slump on tariff uncertainty in the US even before Trump’s announcement. The truckmaker in July flagged poor demand in North America and earlier this year cut a shift at an International Motors plant in Mexico. The company declined to comment on the tariffs.

The local content of Volvo’s US trucks is between 60% and 70%, the company said in an email, adding that it still needs to import some components that aren’t made in the country.

The law, which primarily impacts Duke Energy, faced pushback from opponents for delaying clean energy sources.","RALEIGH, N.C. (CN) — Duke Energy argued in North Carolina Thursday that claims it worsened the climate crisis should be dismissed.

Carrboro, a small town north of Raleigh, sued the utilities giant in December 2024, claiming it is causing and accelerating climate change. Duke has attempted to conceal the dangers of climate change from the public, it said, despite understanding the dangers of fossil fuel emissions since 1968. It claimed Duke is misleading the public over the causes and consequences of climate change and has “materially slowed the transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy,” failing to timely retire coal plants, increasing reliance upon natural gas and refusing to make meaningful investments in clean energy.

The company is one of the planet’s most significant emitters of fossil fuel emissions, Carrboro said, and has caused decades of delay in implementing measures necessary to transition away from fossil fuels. The impacts of the climate crisis will cost the town millions of dollars in damages, it said, as temperature impacts and more extreme precipitation will require roads to be replaced more frequently, and more devastating storms will necessitate new anti-flooding and anti-erosion infrastructure. As temperatures go up, Carrboro will have to pay Duke, its electricity provider, millions to cool buildings, it said.

Carrboro has failed to meet the threshold to prove injury, counsel for Duke said.

“I can’t say I have a trespass injury by the clouds, right?” asked attorney Hampton Bruton, pointing toward Carroboro’s trespass by climate change claim. Duke’s regulation by the local utilities commission should also be factored in, Duke’s attorneys said.

“The fact that Duke Energy is a regulated utility means that the very decisions that Carrboro is complaining about today, the fact that Duke Energy continues to use fossil fuel products — they would say longer than they should have — implicates decisions by utilities commissions and the General Assembly here in North Carolina and in similar bodies across the country where those types of decisions about generation fuel mix are being made,” said Duke attorney Sterling Andrew Marchand.

Matthew Quinn, counsel for the plaintiffs, argued for the case to remain in state court and survive Duke’s motion to dismiss. The state is able to establish its own regulatory standards more restrictive of emissions than federal guidelines, he said, assuring Business Court Judge Mark Davis that the case won’t inch too closely to federal emissions law, including the Clean Air Act.

“The source of Duke’s liability is their deception. It’s not emissions,” said Quinn, calling Carrboro’s case a common law tort.

“We are not second-guessing energy policy. Our claim is a basic claim for money damage based on common law,” Quinn said, emphasizing that Duke’s messaging that climate change doesn’t exist — and, more recently, that it is now a renewable energy company — is deceptive.

Factoring in emissions is critical, counsel for Duke argued, to determine if Carrboro was injured, and if Carrboro isn’t going to do that because it involves federal legislation, then the town can’t blame Duke for climate change. Carrboro can’t claim that Duke deceived the global population or America, they argued, and that its communications swayed them to use more fossil fuels.

“Because they’ve attributed their injuries to global climate change, which, again, concerns things besides emissions, concerns things outside the United States, outside of North Carolina, they’ve attributed their injury to something they cannot trace back to a deception by Duke,” said Bruton.

Duke’s status as a regulated utilities producer shouldn’t exclude it from liability, Quinn said.

“If you engage in a deception campaign, you know bad things are going to happen,” he said. “And under the law of the state of North Carolina, you don’t have to foresee the precise way in which an injury is going to occur.”

Even if Duke had not made these statements, the state’s utilities commission could still have chosen to go with the same fuel mix that they did, Marchand said.

“You can’t connect billions of decisions across the world back to statements on Twitter,” he said.

Duke has downplayed the seriousness of fossil fuel emissions, launched public relations campaigns arguing that fossil fuel emissions don’t pose a serious risk, opposed all solutions to curbing fossil fuel emissions and promoted its transition from coal-fired generation to natural gas as being cleaner, while knowing it worsens the crisis, the town argued in its complaint.

Duke’s communications made people “highly skeptical” about fossil fuels being dangerous, Quinn said.

“It cannot possibly be true that you can deceive everybody all the time about fossil fuels and not suffer related consequences,” he said.

In July, the state legislature passed a bill into law repealing a 2021 requirement that electric regulators must take steps to reduce their carbon dioxide output 70% from 2005’s levels by 2030, in order to reach carbon neutrality. The law, which primarily impacts Duke Energy, faced pushback from opponents for delaying clean energy sources. Supporters said it would decrease costs incurred trying to meet target goals.

“We are committed to our customers and communities and will continue working with policymakers, regulators and other state leaders to deliver reliable and increasingly clean energy while keeping rates as low as possible,” Duke Energy said in a statement after the hearing. Counsel for Carrboro declined to comment.

Davis asked the parties to submit additional briefing. He did not say when he planned to rule.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/09/raleigh-courthouse.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-09-26 18:04:23.228427

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered.","SOCIAL CIRCLE, Ga. (AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Sept. 16 east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits.

Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger off-road machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Key To Profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly.

But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity.

Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.”

Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company said it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So, they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

The Challenges

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%.

By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis recently canceled Ram’s electric truck program.

Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

State Incentives

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average.

Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, said he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged that “the road to get here has not been smooth.”

He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefiting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt.

Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre site near Social Circle, about 45 miles east of Atlanta.

As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology.

And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Opposing Views

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away.

He said his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs.

But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/_Y8veZM4JS1AXAYbmLY33-mT05I=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/KCV7PYBHVNFQZCXOMCQRWV4IDE.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 15:01:13.587863

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has overhauled tax credits and sharply shortened eligibility windows for solar and wind projects as part of an “energy dominance” agenda focused on oil, gas, coal and nuclear, in a sharp departure from the green energy-focused policies under his predecessor Joe Biden.

“There’s likely to be consolidation due to a variety of federal moves of late, including the recently passed tax bill (OBBBA) which eliminates investment tax credits,” said Gregg Felton, CEO of Connecticut-based Altus Power.

Clean energy deals surged to 63 with a combined value of around $34 billion in the first half of 2025, according to KPMG, versus roughly 57 deals worth about $7 billion in the second half of 2024.

Compounding the worries, the Inflation Reduction Act, which had allowed projects to use or sell credits to lower construction costs, was rolled back earlier this year, while loan guarantees for green projects were scrapped in late December.

The compressed deadlines and reduced support could force smaller players to merge, form joint ventures, or sell assets to survive, said John Villali, senior research director at IDC Energy Insights.

Sunnova Energy NOVAQ.PK recently lost a $2.92 billion loan guarantee.

The cancellation of federal loans will likely drive M&A in the utility sector, particularly for distressed clean energy assets, said Gregg Semler, CEO of InPipe Energy.

Savvy buyers await

Private equity firms and utilities are already circling.

In late August, CBRE Investment Management agreed to acquire ClearGen, a clean energy developer and manager backed by Blackstone BX.N with more than 250 projects across 14 states.

Disruptions are industry-wide but nimble developers and market-aware investors will still find opportunities, ClearGen CEO Rob Howard said.

Larger utilities and private equity investors with stronger balance sheets and risk tolerance are lapping up the undervalued assets.

“We are on the buy side…actively dealing with greenfield developers and other energy companies,” said independent power producer Agilitas Energy CEO Barrett Bilotta.

The company plans more M&A announcements this year after having acquired a solar project in Rhode Island in August and two hydropower projects in West Virginia and Maryland in June.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/09/8900033_web1_8734353-dbccd1d96db94115821dabff2a42ff18.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 16:00:38.150142

September new-vehicle sales are expected to grow 6% year-over-year, with a SAAR of 16.2 million despite fewer selling days.

EV sales reached a Q3 record of 410,000 units, about 10% of total sales, fueled by expiring federal tax credits.

The Big Four automakers — GM, Toyota, Ford, and Hyundai — are driving market growth, while others see minimal gains or declines.

U.S. new-vehicle sales are projected to rise in September, reflecting continued market resilience despite economic uncertainty and shifting policy. Cox Automotive forecasts the seasonally adjusted annual rate, or SAAR, for September at 16.2 million units, up from 15.8 million a year earlier and slightly higher than August’s 16.1 million pace. Overall, sales volume is expected to increase 6% year-over-year, while declining 14.9% from the previous month due to fewer selling days.

The third quarter saw strong consumer demand, supported by low inflation, steady unemployment, and a healthy stock market. A significant part of this growth stems from high demand for electric vehicles, as consumers rush to make purchases before the $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September.

Electric vehicle sales are on track to set a quarterly record. Cox Automotive estimates that 410,000 EVs will be sold in Q3, a 21.1% increase from the same period in 2024 and more than 30% above Q2 figures. EVs are expected to account for roughly 10% of all new-vehicle sales, surpassing the previous peak of 8.7% in Q4 2024. EV sales are expected to slow in Q4 as incentives expire, although long-term growth remains likely.

Overall, Q3 new-vehicle sales are forecast to climb 6.2% year-over-year but fall 1.6% compared to Q2. The majority of gains are expected from the four largest automakers — General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Hyundai — which are projected to post combined sales growth of 11.2%. Other automakers are expected to see minimal gains of just 0.1%. Year-to-date, the Big Four have increased sales by 9.1%, while other automakers have experienced a 2% decline.

Looking ahead, analysts anticipate that market conditions will become more challenging. EV sales are likely to drop in the final quarter, while higher import costs and new tariffs could push vehicle prices upward.

However, the strong performance in Q3 has improved the industry outlook.

Duke Energy is making permanent repairs to three substations across the region that experienced flooding during the storm.

Jeff Brooks with Duke Energy said the substations are operational, and the repairs will help strengthen the grid impacted by Helene.

A total of 2.7 million Duke Energy customers in the Carolinas lost power during the storm. Additionally, more than 350 substations were damaged, some requiring extensive repairs due to flooding. Brooks said he's never seen the scale of infrastructure damage Helene caused.

The power company is using technology to improve its systems.

“We’re upgrading polls and wires to make them stronger and more resistant to high winds. We're adding things like self-healing technology that can automatically restore power when an outage occurs, and we’re increasing capacity,” Brooks said. “This is a growing area, and we need to make sure that power stays reliable.”

Last year, the upgrade to self-healing technology kept many customers from losing power.

“Self-healing technology automatically detects an outage and then looks for other power lines to reroute power, and that technology helped to avoid more than 100,000 outages just here in Buncombe County last year, and nearly half of those were during storms,” Brooks said.

While standing in Duke Energy’s Asheville operations center Friday, Brooks said that as they reflect on a year since the storm, they remember how important it is to be there for customers.

3 Procedures for Chemical Risk Evaluation Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 90 Fed.
8 Designation of Ten Chemical Substances for Initial Risk Evaluations Under the Toxic Substances Control Act, 81 Fed.","As previously covered in a Holland & Knight alert, the 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) required the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a regulatory process for evaluating the risks of existing chemicals, leading to the issuance of the 2017 Framework Rule under the first Trump Administration.1 The Biden Administration subsequently released the 2024 Framework Rule, which made substantive changes to the 2017 Rule, including, most notably, requiring EPA to 1) evaluate every ""condition of use"" associated with the chemical substance, 2) issue a single risk determination for each chemical as opposed to determining risk on a use-by-use basis and 3) make certain assumptions about the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by workers.2 Industry and labor associations challenged the 2024 Framework Rule in federal court, but litigation is currently stayed pending EPA's ongoing rulemaking to revise the Framework Rule.

Key Changes in Proposed Framework Rule

EPA's Proposed Framework Rule, published on Sept. 23, 2025, includes several substantial policy shifts from the 2024 Framework Rule, largely reverting the Framework Rule back to 2017 Rule. These changes include:

Discretion to Scope Conditions of Use. The Proposed Rule rescinds the 2024 Rule's requirement that EPA evaluate all conditions of use and exposure pathways, instead stating that the agency has ""discretion"" to determine which conditions of use to evaluate and focus on uses that pose the greatest exposure risk.

Risk Determination on a Use-by-Use Basis. The Proposed Rule restores the 2017 Rule's requirement for EPA to make a determination of unreasonable risk for each of the conditions of use within the scope of a chemical's risk evaluation, reversing the 2024 Rule's requirement to make ""a single risk determination on the chemical substance as a whole.""3

Account for Use of PPE in Evaluating Exposures. The Proposed Rule reverses the 2024 Framework Rule's approach to consideration of the use of personal protective equipment by workers, which resulted in varying interpretations across industry groups regarding whether the approach to PPE applied at the risk evaluation or risk determination stage. Instead, the Proposed Rule allows EPA to account for ""reasonably available information on the implementation and use of occupational exposure control measures such as engineering and administrative controls and personal protective equipment when evaluating exposure risks.""4

Removal of Overburdened Communities. The Proposed Rule removes the 2024 Framework Rule's addition of ""overburdened communities"" to the regulatory definition of ""potentially exposed and susceptible subpopulations.""5

Manufacturer-Requested Risk Evaluations. The Proposed Rule scales back the information manufacturers would be required to provide to EPA for a manufacturer-requested risk evaluation from what was included in the 2024 Framework Rule and clarifies that ""manufacturers that withdraw a request before it is granted do not incur fees.""6

If finalized, EPA will apply the changes in the Proposed Rule ""to all risk evaluations initiated on or after the date of the final rule and would be applied to risk evaluations that are in process as of the date of the final rule, but not yet finalized, to the extent practicable.""7 Given the potential impact of the Proposed Rule on chemical regulation across numerous industries, it is likely that EPA will receive a substantial number of public comments and may ultimately modify these proposals in the Final Rule. It is anticipated that EPA will publish a final Framework Rule sometime in 2026.

Implications for Ongoing Risk Evaluations

The Proposed Rule, once finalized, will be the third version of a Framework Rule to be implemented by EPA. While litigation on the 2017 Framework Rule resulted in a 2019 court decision that rejected that rule's exclusion of ""legacy uses and associated disposals"" from the conditions of use that EPA would include in risk evaluations, the court declined to rule on other policies (such as the requirement that EPA make risk determinations for each condition of use rather than for the whole chemical, as well as the discretion for EPA to exclude conditions of use or entire exposure pathways from the conditions of use). Similarly, although litigants raised some of the same (and additional) policy issues in litigation on the 2024 Framework Rule, that case has been stayed pending EPA's finalization of this Proposed Rule.

In the meantime, EPA has indicated its intent to revise the risk evaluation for 1,4-dioxane, one of the ""first ten"" chemicals to undergo TSCA risk evaluation,8 and remains under consent decrees to issue final risk evaluations for most of the ""next twenty"" chemicals to undergo TSCA risk evaluations.9 While EPA has stated that it would continue to comply with the 2024 Framework Rule until this proposed Framework Rule is finalized and it would only incorporate the final provisions into ongoing risk evaluations to the extent practicable, the prolonged absence of settled foundational risk evaluation policies has created some regulatory uncertainty for the industry since TSCA's amendments were passed in 2016.

Finally, it is important to note the potential implications of these and other existing chemical developments on state preemption – one of industry's top priorities when U.S. Congress enacted the 2016 TSCA amendments. The finalization of risk management rules is the statutory trigger for TSCA's more stringent and permanent state preemption provisions; however, the majority of the risk evaluations initiated by EPA to date have not completed the risk management stage. Moreover, temporary ""pause preemption"" has expired for the ""next 20"" chemicals and has not begun for the five chemicals EPA designated as high priority in December 202410. Accordingly, states could, in theory, promulgate their own regulations on these chemicals, setting the stage for a potential regulatory patchwork morass.

Next Steps and Considerations

Companies who may be impacted by the Proposed Rule should consider submitting public comments to EPA by Nov. 7, 2025.

Holland & Knight's Public Policy & Regulation Group is distinctly qualified to assist with TSCA considerations. The team includes key contributors to the drafting and negotiation of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, a former assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and a litigation team that worked on behalf of the industry challenging the 2024 Framework Rule. In addition, members of Holland & Knight's Environmental Team – who focus on TSCA and chemicals – continue to monitor ongoing developments and evaluate the potential impacts to businesses and industries.

Weiss commented: After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC.
There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.
The report forecast U.S. storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.
Otherwise, your data will be deleted if pv magazine has processed your request or the purpose of data storage is fulfilled.","The United States had a record quarter for battery energy storage deployment in Q2 2025, adding 5.6 GW of installations, said a report released by the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie.

Utility-scale storage led the way, adding 4.9 GW in quarter and growing 62% year-over-year. This is enough to power 3.7 million U.S. homes during average peak demand hours, said ACP.

California, Texas and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of storage in the quarter, said the report. Wood Mackenzie forecast that Florida and Georgia will be major growth markets ahead due to aggressive procurements by vertically integrated utilities. For example, Georgia Power just issued a request for proposals for 500 MW of grid-scale storage.

However, supply challenges may hamper utility-scale growth, said Allison Weis, global head of storage, Wood Mackenzie. Weiss commented:

After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC. While domestic cell supply is ramping up, supply chain shortages are possible, although developers are continuing to consider supply from China to fill in any gaps. A rush to start construction under the more certain near-term regulatory framework uplifts the near-term forecast. Projects that have not met certain milestones by the end of 2025 are at risk of exposure to changing regulations. There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.

The residential storage market saw a leap in installations in Q2 as well. It added 608 MW in the quarter, representing a 132% increase year-on-year. Most of the growth was driven by California, Arizona and Illinois, as attachment rates hit new highs and higher-capacity systems gained market share.

Batteries are included at an increased rate in quoted residential solar projects, said a report from EnergySage. Outside of Hawaii, which has a 100% battery attachment rate, California led the way among top-ten solar state markets, with 79% of quoted projects including batteries. This was followed by Texas (61%), Arizona (47%), Utah (44%), Florida (43%) and Illinois (25%).

“Residential storage is expected to outpace solar due to stronger policy resilience, high attachment rates in key markets like California and Puerto Rico, and continued ITC access through third-party ownership,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst, Wood Mackenzie.

The community-scale, commercial and industrial segment expanded 11% in Q2, adding 38 MW. California and New York led Q2 in the segment’s storage installations, accounting for over 70% of total capacity, while Illinois gained traction, said ACP.

The report forecast U.S. storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.

However, the report warns U.S. utility-scale storage installations could drop 10% year-over-year in 2027 largely due to uncertainty over pending Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations on battery cell sourcing.

Guatemala’s Government Procurement Law requires most government purchases over $116,000 to be submitted for public competitive bidding.
Guatemala ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) in November 2006 and the Inter-American Convention against Corruption in 2001.
Additionally, roughly 5.1 million individuals, or 70.8 percent of the total workforce, work in the informal sector, including some who are too young for formal sector employment.
However, many workers, especially in the agricultural sector, do not receive the full compensation package mandated in the labor law.","Bribery is illegal under Guatemala’s Penal Code. Guatemala scored 25 out of 100 points on Transparency International’s 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index and improved its ranking from 154 to 146 (out of 180 countries), globally, and 27 out of 32 countries in the region. The law provides criminal penalties for official corruption, but the Public Ministry (MP) prosecuted very few government corruption cases.

Investors report pervasive corruption in public procurement, including requests for payment of bribes in exchange for awarding public contracts. Investors and importers are frequently frustrated by opaque customs transactions, particularly at ports and borders. In 2021, Tax and Customs Authority (SAT) implemented additional customs reforms that route flagged shipments to a dedicated interagency secondary inspection team for resolution, rather than assigning the case to the original inspector. The change eliminates opportunity for an inspector to impose deliberate delays, but allegations persist that shipments are held by secondary inspection teams in order to extract corrupt payments from importers and exporters.

From 2006 to 2019, the UN-sponsored International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) undertook numerous high-profile official corruption investigations, leading to many indictments. For example, CICIG unveiled a customs corruption scheme in 2015 that led to the resignations of the former president and vice president. In 2019, then-President Morales terminated CICIG. Subsequent actions taken by Attorney General Consuelo Porras have impeded and undone the work of anti-corruption investigations including the infamous Odebrecht bribery scandal, increased and posed additional risks for potential new investors. In 2024, the Guatemalan tax authority (SAT) revealed it had uncovered a tax fraud scheme (“B410”) in which a network of 410 companies with government contracts sought to evade 800 million quetzales (approximately $105 million) in taxes between 2021 and 2023. To date, the Public Ministry has made no arrests. The administration of President Arevalo has prioritized anti-corruption efforts, including promulgation of a code of ethics for government employees, establishment of probity units at various ministries, and efforts to promote transparency through digitalization, but these have produced limited results.

Guatemala’s Government Procurement Law requires most government purchases over $116,000 to be submitted for public competitive bidding. Guatemalan government entities are required to use Guatecompras, which tracks government procurement processes. Guatemalan government entities must also comply with government procurement commitments under CAFTA-DR. In August 2009, the Guatemalan Congress approved reforms to the Government Procurement Law, which simplified bidding procedures; eliminated the fee previously charged to receive bidding documents; and provided an additional opportunity for suppliers to raise objections over the bidding process. Despite these reforms, large government procurements are often subject to appeals and injunctions based on claims of irregularities in the bidding process (e.g., documentation issues and lack of transparency). In November 2015, the Guatemalan Congress approved additional amendments to the Government Procurement Law that aimed to improve the transparency of the procurement processes by barring government contracts for:

some financiers of political campaigns and parties,

members of Congress,

other elected officials,

government workers, and

their immediate family members.

However, there continue to be multiple allegations of corruption and nepotism in the procurement process. The 2015 reforms expanded the scope of procurement oversight to include public trust funds and all institutions (including NGOs) executing public funds. The U.S. government continues to advocate for the use of open, fair, and transparent tenders in government procurement as well as procedures that comply with CAFTA-DR obligations, which would allow open participation by U.S. companies.

Guatemala ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) in November 2006 and the Inter-American Convention against Corruption in 2001. In 2012, the Guatemalan Congress approved an anti-corruption law that increased penalties for existing crimes and added new crimes, such as:

illicit enrichment,

trafficking in influence, and

illegal charging of commissions.

Guatemala National Civil Police (PNC) data indicates homicides declined in 2024 to 16.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, a 3.6 percent decline compared to 2023. This decrease for a second consecutive year followed a slight uptick in 2021 and 2022 after the Guatemalan government lifted the pandemic restrictions in 2021, but numbers are still below pre-pandemic levels and follow over a decade of declining rates. The judicial system faces significant delays in case processing and investigation, including lack of transparency and systemic bureaucratic inefficiency in the Public Ministry. Police often lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. Criminal groups operating in Guatemala are involved in a number of illicit activities, including:

armed robbery,

carjacking,

extortions,

violent street crime,

drug trafficking,

kidnapping, and

arms trafficking.

Crimes of opportunity, including theft, are frequent.

The political climate in Guatemala is generally stable but characterized by periodic civil disturbances. In November 2020, civil unrest sparked by congressional approval of the 2021 budget proposal, which added to long-standing grievances. Initially peaceful protests were marred by isolated acts of vandalism and violence, including setting fire to the national congress building, as well as acts of violence by both security forces against some protestors and by some protestors against security forces. The main source of tension among indigenous communities, Guatemalan authorities, and private companies is the lack of prior consultation and alleged environmental damage from major investment projects, including mining.

In October 2021, former President Giammattei declared a State of Siege in El Estor as dozens of protestors – including environmental defenders, indigenous activists, and outside agitators – blocked coal trucks from accessing a nickel mine and allegedly clashed with National Police (PNC) forces who attempted to clear the road for mining traffic. Protests and highway roadblocks organized by transportation workers, public health and education workers, and military veterans have caused disruption and heightened security, impacting general mobility and traffic on a recurring basis in recent years.

Despite this history of unrest, general elections in 2023 were largely peaceful and there were no major incidents of reported violence. Attempts to undermine the results of the election by antidemocratic forces, however, led in October 2023 to widespread road blockages and protests for several weeks that largely stopped economic activity across the country. These protests were led principally by indigenous communities and widely supported by urban residents upset with the antidemocratic actions. Although nationwide in scope, these protests and roadblocks were uniformly peaceful and there was a noticeable lack of conflict between protest groups and government security forces. A negotiated solution allowed economic activity to resume after several weeks and involved:

indigenous leaders,

civil society,

the incoming government, and

private sector groups.

Since the inauguration of President Arevalo in January 2024, there have been occasional incidents of large demonstrations or roadblocks to protest specific government policies, particularly in Guatemala City, but these have been resolved peacefully and have generally only lasted a few days. Damage to projects or installations is rare. However, there were instances in August 2017 and October 2018 in which unidentified arsonists burned machinery and other equipment at the site of a hydroelectric construction project near the northern border with Mexico. Additionally, activist groups at times have engaged in blockades to prevent personnel, materials, and equipment from entering or leaving disputed installations.

According to the 2021 national survey of employment and income, the Guatemalan workforce consists of an estimated 2.1 million individuals employed in the formal sector. Additionally, roughly 5.1 million individuals, or 70.8 percent of the total workforce, work in the informal sector, including some who are too young for formal sector employment. According to the 2022-2023 National Survey on Household Income and Expenditures, 17.8 percent of children ages 10 to 14 are engaged in child labor, particularly in rural areas. The informal economy represented 22 percent of GDP in 2019 according to official data. About 75.7 percent of female workers and 84.9 percent of indigenous workers were employed in the informal sector.

Approximately 30 percent of the total labor force is engaged in agricultural work. The availability of a large, unskilled, and inexpensive labor force led many employers, such as construction and agricultural firms, to use labor-intensive production methods. Roughly 14 percent of the employed workforce is illiterate. However, in developed urban areas education levels are much higher and there is a growing service sector that requires workers with higher levels of skills. Highly capable technical and managerial workers remain in short supply.

Export-processing zones are subject to regular labor laws and do not receive any special labor exemptions. The minimum wage varies according to the employer’s geographic location and economic sector. The economic sector with the lowest minimum wage is manufacturing, followed by the agricultural sector. All other sectors are subject to the highest minimum wage. The labor code and a Ministry of Labor agreement, based on ILO Convention 175, allow part time work. Employers can hire workers for six hours or fewer per workday for wages and benefits equivalent to the fraction of full time work they complete.

The Labor Code requires that at least 90 percent of employees be Guatemalan, but the requirement does not apply to high-level positions, such as managers and directors. The Labor Code sets out:

employer responsibilities regarding working conditions, especially health and safety standards;

benefits;

severance pay;

premium pay for overtime work;

minimum wages; and

bonuses.

Mandatory benefits, bonuses, and employer contributions to the social security system can add up to about 55 percent of an employee’s base pay. However, many workers, especially in the agricultural sector, do not receive the full compensation package mandated in the labor law. All employees are subject to a two-month trial period during which time they may resign or be discharged without any obligation on the part of the employer or employee. For any dismissal after the two-month trial period, the employer must pay unpaid wages for work already performed, proportional bonuses, and proportional vacation time. If an employer dismisses an employee without just cause, the employer must also pay severance equal to one month’s regular pay for each full year of employment. Guatemala does not have unemployment insurance or other social safety net programs for workers laid off for economic reasons.

Guatemala’s Constitution guarantees the right of workers to unionize and to strike, with an exception to the right to strike for security force members and workers employed in hospitals, telecommunications, and other public services considered essential to public safety. Before a strike can be declared, workers and employers must engage in mandatory conciliation and then approve a strike vote by 50 percent plus one worker in the enterprise. If conciliation fails, either party may ask the judge for a ruling on the legality of conducting a strike or lockout. Legal strikes in Guatemala are extremely rare. The Constitution also commits the state to support and protect collective bargaining and holds that international labor conventions ratified by Guatemala establish the minimum labor rights of workers if they offer greater protections than national law. In most cases, labor unions operate independently of the government and employers both by law and in practice. The law requires unions to register with the Ministry of Labor and their leadership must obtain credentials to carry out their functions. Delays in such proceedings are common. The law prohibits anti-union discrimination and employer interference in union activities and requires employers to reinstate workers dismissed for organizing union activities. A combination of inadequate allocation of budget resources for labor rights enforcement to the Ministry of Labor and other relevant state institutions, and inefficient administrative and justice sector processes, act as significant impediments for more effective enforcement of labor laws to protect these workers’ rights. As a result, investigating, prosecuting, and punishing employers who violate these guarantees remain a challenge, particularly the enforcement of labor court orders requiring reinstatement and payment of back wages resulting from dismissal. The rate of unionization in Guatemala is very low.

Both the U.S. government and Guatemalan workers have filed complaints against the Guatemalan government for allegedly failing to adequately enforce its labor laws and protect the rights of workers. In 2014, the U.S. government convened an arbitration panel alleging that Guatemala had failed to meet its obligations under CAFTA-DR to enforce effectively its labor laws related to freedom of association and collective bargaining and acceptable conditions of work. In 2017, the panel issued a decision recognizing that Guatemala had failed to adequately enforce its labor laws but that the United States did not prove this failure impacted trade between the two countries. Separately, the Guatemalan government is facing an International Labor Organization (ILO) complaint filed by workers in 2023 alleging that the government has failed to comply with ILO Conventions 87 and 98 on freedom of association and collective bargaining and calling for the establishment of an ILO Commission of Inquiry, which is the ILO’s highest level of scrutiny when all other means failed to address issues of concern. The Guatemalan government continues to provide the ILO with quarterly updates on its efforts to improve its compliance with these conventions. This complaint follows a similar complaint filed by worker organizations in 2012 alleging non-compliance with ILO Convention 87. That complaint was closed in 2018 after the Guatemalan government agreed to implement a roadmap with social partners to address shortcomings in labor law enforcement and workers’ rights protections. The government continues to implement this roadmap.",https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Seal_only-1.png,N,,2025-09-26 14:02:43.933027

Vanderbilt Law’s Energy, Environment & Land Use (EELU) Program and Environmental Law & Policy Annual Review (ELPAR) hosted John Cruden for the 2025 Distinguished Lecture on Climate Change Governance.
For nearly two decades, this “top-down” approach positioned the United States as the global leader in environmental governance.
“That actually drives up interest and perhaps creates the kind of momentum we need for the future.” Private governance is augmenting the influence of corporations in driving environmental and climate action.
For students entering environmental law, the future will be defined by crisis-driven opportunities, and rapid public response will open windows for reform.","In the latter half of the 20th century, landmark U.S. environmental laws were passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities—the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, the Clean Water Act in 1972, and the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990. This statute-driven era reflected a top-down model of governance, positioning the United States as a bellwether in global environmental policy. Today’s policy landscape looks markedly different. With gridlock at the federal level, environmental governance now emerges in waves of top-down statutes and increasingly influential bottom-up initiatives as the world’s governments, corporations, and citizens contest the future direction of environmental law.

Vanderbilt Law’s Energy, Environment & Land Use (EELU) Program and Environmental Law & Policy Annual Review (ELPAR) hosted John Cruden for the 2025 Distinguished Lecture on Climate Change Governance. The event was presented by EELU Faculty Co-Directors Michael P. Vandenbergh and J.B. Ruhl and made possible by the Sally Shellenberger Brown EELU Fund.

Mr. Cruden is Principal at Beveridge & Diamond, P.C., where he advises clients on high-stakes environmental litigation, enforcement, and compliance matters. He previously served as Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) at the U.S. Department of Justice, where he led landmark cases including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the Volkswagen emissions scandal. His four-decade career spans service as Chief Legislative Counsel of the U.S. Army and combat duty in Vietnam, senior leadership at ENRD, and presidency of the Environmental Law Institute.

The Origins of Modern Environmental Law

Cruden tied the birth of modern U.S. environmental legislation to what he called “Cuyahoga moments”—highly visible crises that galvanized public awareness and political response. The term references the 1969 Cuyahoga River Fire caused by the river being so densely polluted with industrial waste that it ignited. It represented the first of a series of environmental disasters that sparked national outrage and laid the groundwork for the Clean Water Act, which Congress enacted over President Richard Nixon’s veto.

“A lot of our statutes were born of tragedy,” Cruden noted. Love Canal’s toxic contamination prompted the creation of Superfund, the Exxon Valdez oil spill led to the Oil Pollution Act, and deadly widespread smog accelerated the Clean Air Act. These events, he argued, defined an era when bipartisan consensus enabled sweeping legislative reforms. For nearly two decades, this “top-down” approach positioned the United States as the global leader in environmental governance. Congress, the courts, and newly created agencies—most notably the Environmental Protection Agency—worked in tandem to build a comprehensive statutory framework.

“The United States didn’t actually create much law in our lifetime. We got most of it from the Greeks and Romans and Brits,” he said. “There is an exception—we created environmental law without question. The body of law that people talk about as environmental law, it came from the United States. Now 93 percent of the countries in the world have something that looks like our National Environmental Policy Act.”

From Top-Down to Bottom-Up Governance

After the golden era of bipartisan statute-making ended in 1990, the top-down model for environmental governance effectively ended. Congressional gridlock has since prevented passage of major statutes, even as new challenges and climate social movements have emerged.

Cruden described a shift in governance toward bottom-up approaches, driven by state initiatives, corporate policies, and international frameworks. He pointed to reform of the Toxic Substances Control Act as a key example. This effort not originate in Congress, but from mounting pressure at other levels of governance. Eighteen states enacted their own chemical safety laws to protect air and water, filling what he described as a regulatory vacuum. At the same time, international developments exerted influence, particularly the European Union’s adoption of REACH—more expansive and stringent than U.S. law. “Out of the state issues, out of a little Cuyahoga moment, out of what was happening internationally, there became a consensus for change,” he explained.

“I’m thinking this is a ‘bottom-up’ because Congress tried and failed. But what happened? People underneath them, people like me and you, corporations but also NGOs and runway groups, they then were responsible for change.”

The Role of Technology and Private Governance

New tools and technologies—ranging from drones and satellites to low-cost air and water testing kits—are reshaping environmental governance by transforming how pollution can be monitored and enforced. “For a relatively small amount of money now, you can get testing data for both air and water that is pretty accurate,” Cruden noted, adding that these tools empower citizens to hold agencies and corporations accountable. “That actually drives up interest and perhaps creates the kind of momentum we need for the future.”

Private governance is augmenting the influence of corporations in driving environmental and climate action. Contrary to widespread public criticism, Cruden argued that multinational companies are shaping greener outcomes through supply chains and contracting practices. Walmart, for instance, can compel thousands of suppliers to adopt stricter environmental standards simply as a condition of doing business. CEOs at firms like DuPont and Johnson & Johnson have invested in greener product design and efficiency measures to align with consumer demand. But Cruden cautioned that corporate action is not a substitute for public law. “Two-thirds of America still believes corporations are not doing enough,” he said, emphasizing that private commitments must complement statutory enforcement and work in coordination with regulators, NGOs, and international frameworks.

Passing the Baton

The next phase of environmental law demands effective advocates who know how to frame issues in ways that resonate with both the public and policymakers, Cruden said. He pointed to the Montreal Protocol as an example of bipartisan success, where leaders like George Shultz and President Ronald Reagan framed action on ozone depletion as an “insurance policy,” a phrase that diffused debates and built trust, negotiation, and consensus.

“If there is a Cuyahoga moment, are you ready?” he asked students. “We need good communicators if we’re going to do bottom-up.”

Looking ahead, he outlined the building blocks of the next era of governance. For students entering environmental law, the future will be defined by crisis-driven opportunities, and rapid public response will open windows for reform. Statutes and enforcement remain essential, but progress will increasingly depend on the interplay of state leadership, citizen engagement, corporate responsibility, and international standards. New technologies will only be effective if paired with legal frameworks and political will.

“I want you to be knowledgeable out there. I want you to study. I want you to be able to communicate,” Cruden said. “I’m asking you to know and understand and be able to talk about why we have billion-dollar events occurring, why we have sea levels rising, why we have fires everywhere, why all of that is occurring. I’m getting to the point of my life where I’m ready to pass the baton.”",https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-sub/wp-content/uploads/sites/281/2025/09/26115844/John-Cruden-1024x614.png,N,,2025-09-26 14:02:48.040484

The Collaborative will ensure that elected leaders representing the 67 million people PJM serves have a greater voice in decisions that affect household energy bills and grid reliability.

In launching the Collaborative, the governors signed a joint statement of intent(opens in a new tab) “to promote greater state and consumer representation in the governance and decision-making processes of PJM Interconnection, in order to ensure the provision of affordable, safe, and reliable electricity for their residents and businesses.”

At the historic summit this week in Philadelphia, more than 450 stakeholders from across PJM gathered in Philadelphia gathered to address rising energy costs, grid reliability, and PJM’s governance issues.

Governor Shapiro, who has consistently pushed PJM to reform its processes and lower consumer costs, opened the Summit(opens in a new tab) by warning that if PJM fails to act decisively, Pennsylvania and other states may be forced to consider alternatives to the current PJM grid. Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, Governor Wes Moore of Maryland, and Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey also addressed the Summit, advocating for real reform to PJM’s governance structure and markets.

“For nearly a century, Pennsylvanians have trusted PJM to keep the lights on,” said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. “But PJM has been too slow to bring new generation online and too quick to saddle families with higher bills. It’s not working anymore – and it’s time to get serious about reform. If PJM won’t move fast enough, Pennsylvania and our partner states are prepared to chart a new course in the interest of hard-working families we represent. The PJM Governors’ Collaborative will create a forum for the states to discuss the issues most impacting consumers and put forth a united voice when navigating these critical discussions.”

“Rising electricity costs are stretching the paychecks of working Delawareans, from small business owners trying to budget to families just trying to make ends meet,"" said Delaware Governor Matt Meyer. ""Large new load projects like data centers are part of the story, but so are delays in bringing more power online and permitting regulations that haven’t kept up with diverse needs. With the PJM Governors’ Collaborative, we’re insisting on accountability and a stronger voice for states in how our grid is managed. Together, we can bring new generation online faster and ensure every Delaware family has a utility bill they can manage.""

""For far too long, PJM has made decisions with minimal input from the states, leaving families and businesses to bear skyrocketing energy costs and rising reliability risks,"" said Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. ""I’m proud to join this bipartisan collective to ensure states have a meaningful voice in shaping the region’s energy future. Together, we’re sending a clear message that PJM must prioritize affordability, reliability, and accountability for the people it serves.""

“As Maryland families see double-digit rate increases and Maryland businesses see the ability to compete threatened by rising energy expenses, we are calling for increased transparency and accountability to improve the grid and lower costs for our citizens,” said Maryland Governor Wes Moore. “I am proud to stand with my fellow governors and we will continue in this fight for a grid that is safe, reliable, and affordable.”

“We must build a system that works better and more transparently for the millions of people in the region that PJM serves,” said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. “I’m glad to see our regional states coming together across party lines to demand better. This week’s historic conference and this collaborative effort will continue to strengthen our engagement on this issue as the PJM states unite in our push for reforms to deliver affordable electricity.”

""Virginia’s growth has led to the fastest expansion in energy demand since WWII,” said Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. “Unfortunately, rather than providing energy and power strategies that deliver for Virginia’s needs by unlocking investment and fast-tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills, and leave families and businesses hurting. We cannot afford a grid operator that is slow to adapt and blind to the realities of surging demand, and we won’t sit back and accept a system that puts bureaucratic process over results. That’s why I’m joining governors of other PJM states to launch the PJM Governors Collaborative. Together, we are demanding real reforms from PJM that put consumers first, accelerate new generation, and restore confidence in the future of our grid.""

Governors Unite to Demand Change

PJM governors are joining together to raise concerns about the grid management organization’s reactive approach that have driven energy costs higher for families and businesses across the 13-state region. Together, the governors are taking action to ensure states have a stronger voice in PJM’s governance and decision-making.

The governors underscored that while PJM is the nation’s largest grid operator, serving 67 million people, it also has the fewest avenues for states and consumers to influence outcomes that directly affect energy bills. They emphasized that states deserve a seat at the table to ensure PJM reforms its governance structure, speeds up interconnection of new energy projects, and prevents future price spikes.

Energy leaders have also been direct(opens in a new tab) about the need to reform PJM’s markets — a message echoed throughout the Summit as states, regulators, and utilities alike called for accountability and faster action.

Over the last decade, PJM has assumed greater responsibility for balancing supply and demand, yet has repeatedly failed to move new generation through its interconnection queue – earning a D- rating(opens in a new tab) for speed. These delays come as demand is surging, driven in part by rapid data center growth, and as the Trump Administration cuts funding for near-complete clean energy projects.

The result: record-high PJM capacity auction prices, leading to billions of dollars in added costs for consumers across the region.

Collaborative will Push Forward Ideas for Real Reform

The Summit also served as a launching pad for three major reforms, which will be the subject of future discussions among the PJM Governors Collaborative:

Improved load forecasting – to remove speculative projects that inflate prices but are unlikely to be built.

A bifurcated PJM auction – capping prices for existing power plants while allowing new plants to receive higher rates, ensuring reliability without excessive costs.

Governance changes – to give states and their citizens a stronger voice, including through the new Governors’ Collaborative.

The PJM Governors’ Collaborative will continue meeting after this week’s Summit to develop and advance shared proposals for reform.

Governor Shapiro’s Track Record of Delivering Results

Since taking office, Governor Shapiro has consistently fought to hold PJM accountable(opens in a new tab):

Created a fast-track Reliability Resource Initiative (RRI) to allow quicker interconnection of key projects. This will result in 9.3 GW of baseload power (mostly gas) to be built across the region in the next seven years.

Included the Crane Clean Energy Center in RRI, allowing it to enter service years sooner than would otherwise have been possible. This will add 3,400 jobs to Dauphin County and bring 835 MW of clean, reliable power to the grid.

Entered into a settlement with Pennsylvania following the 206 complaint that lowered the maximum price of its capacity auction for two years, likely saving consumers more than $16 billion.

Accepted the Governor’s proposal to begin planning for a sub-annual capacity market, which is expected to save consumers billions of dollars over time.

Pennsylvania has a long legacy as an energy leader and the Summit is a demonstration of Governor Shapiro’s commitment to Pennsylvanians to create energy jobs, lower costs for consumers, and ensure the Commonwealth continues to be a national energy leader for decades to come.

The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)—the two agencies that share oversight of LNG export terminal projects (“LNG Terminals”)—are reshaping the regulatory landscape to ease approval of new LNG infrastructure.

Traditionally, LNG Terminals have faced lengthy reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), with the preparation and revision of environmental impact statements (EIS), often stretching out for years.[1] Sponsors must clear both FERC (for construction) and DOE (for exports), creating a process that is notorious for delays. FERC has the authority for approving the “siting, construction, expansion, or operation of an LNG terminal,” while the DOE has the “exclusive authority over the export of LNG as a commodity.”[2]

Now, in response to the President Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” agenda,[3] DOE and FERC have taken steps to cut red tape, speed approvals, and broaden discretion in environmental review. For project developers, this shift promises shorter timelines—and new strategic considerations—as the Trump administration pushes to expand U.S. LNG exports.

Rescission of NEPA Implementing Regulations

The Trump administration has moved to completely change the way that agencies apply NEPA by rescinding the existing regulations governing NEPA review.[4] NEPA’s statutory language requires that federal agencies conduct environmental reviews for all “major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”[5] When an agency determines that an action is a “major federal action,” it must prepare a detailed EIS.[6] An EIS “forces the agency to take a ‘hard look’ at the environmental consequences of its actions” and “ensures that these environmental consequences, and the agency’s consideration of them, are disclosed to the public.”[7]

Since 1978, agencies have relied on NEPA-implementing regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) when conducting environmental reviews. Many agencies, including FERC, have applied the CEQ’s regulations or referred to them in their own NEPA-implementing regulations.[8] However, Unleashing American Energy revoked the executive order that gave the CEQ the authority to issue these regulations and directed the agency to rescind them within 30 days.[9] The CEQ subsequently issued an Interim Final Rule rescinding the regulations.[10] On July 3, 2025, FERC issued a final rule revising its NEPA-implementing regulations to conform to the change.[11] The DOE followed suit with an Interim Final Rule issued the same day.[12]

While FERC’s changes simply removed all cross-references to the CEQ, the DOE’s changes were more significant. In addition to removing all references to the CEQ, the DOE revised its regulations “so that it includes only DOE’s existing categorical exclusions in appendix B, related requirements, and a provision for emergency circumstances.”[13] All of the DOE’s other NEPA procedures were removed from the Code of Federal Regulations and moved to a document titled U.S. Department of Energy National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures.[14] Unlike the prior regulations, these procedures are non-binding and do not “impose legal obligations upon DOE,” and the agency is free to “adopt approaches on a case-by-case basis that differ from those described in these procedures.”[15]

Elimination of Stays on LNG Facility Construction While Rehearing Is Pending

Natural Gas Act (NGA) § 7 requires that parties opposing FERC’s approval of a construction project first request rehearing before FERC before they can seek judicial review of the approval. Under Order No. 871, FERC had previously barred construction of LNG and pipeline projects while those rehearing requests were pending.[16]

On June 18, 2025, FERC voted unanimously to at least temporarily permit construction to go forward while FERC considered rehearing requests by approving a one-year waiver of Order No. 871[17] and issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to permanently rescind that order.[18] FERC cited the “pressing nationwide near-term demand for expanded natural gas transportation capacity, as well as the reliability concerns associated with maintaining the natural gas system” as its reasons for the policy change.[19] Both the waiver and the potential permanent rescission of Order No. 871 have the potential “to expedite efficient energy development and reduce construction delays resulting from” pending rehearing requests.[20]

Expansion of Blanket Certificate Authority

FERC has issued a waiver and Notice of Inquiry for regulations pertaining to a certificate holder’s blanket certificate authority. Under NGA §7, interstate natural gas pipelines that hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity can conduct certain construction activities without first seeking case-specific authorizations, if those activities fall below a certain cost threshold.[21] The cost threshold was last increased to $41,100,000 in 2024.[22] If the construction activity falls below this threshold, the certificate holder can file a “prior notice request” for authorization with the Commission, and the Commission will provide notice of the request in the Federal Register.[23] If no one protests the request within 60 days, the certificate holder can commence construction on the project.[24]

On June 18, FERC unanimously approved a two-year waiver increasing the cost threshold.[25] The waiver order increases the threshold to $61,650,000.[26] The Commission also issued a Notice of Inquiry to consider permanent revisions to the cost threshold.[27] The Notice of Inquiry requests comments on whether FERC should include more projects within the scope of blanket certificate authorization, what the cost threshold should be, and what the rate treatment should be for these projects.[28]

Department of Energy LNG Export Study

Under section 3(a) of the Natural Gas Act, the DOE must approve natural gas export requests unless it finds that the proposed export “will not be consistent with the public interest.”[29] Exports to countries with which the United States has a free-trade agreement requiring national treatment for natural gas (FTA) are automatically deemed to be in the public interest.[30] For non-FTA countries, courts and the DOE have traditionally relied on a rebuttable presumption favoring exports.[31] However, on January 26, 2024, the Biden administration’s DOE paused approvals until it completed a 2024 study on LNG exports, which studied whether these exports were in fact “in the public interest.”[32] The study, which the DOE published on December 20, 2024, did not make any definitive findings on whether LNG exports were in the public interest, but it was negative in its evaluation of LNG exports.[33]

The Trump administration DOE reversed course when finalizing the 2024 study in a Response to Comments, striking a much more supportive tone.[34] The final report concluded “that exports of LNG from the United States will not be inconsistent with the public interest.”[35]

Courts Focus on Ensuring Approvals Are Adequately Supported

Over the last year, the judiciary has continued to evaluate agency approvals on a case-by-case basis, and the outcomes have largely turned on whether an agency supported its LNG approval with adequate reasoning and evidence. In City of Port Isabel v. FERC,[36] the D.C. Circuit considered petitions for review challenging the FERC reauthorization of two LNG terminals and an associated pipeline in Texas. The Court found that FERC did not adequately support its order and erred by failing (1) to issue supplemental EIS addressing environmental justice; (2) to treat a proposed carbon capture system (CCS) as a connected action; (3) to treat that CCS system as a reasonable alternative; and (4) to adequately explain why it decided to consider air quality data.[37] The court initially vacated the FERC’s approvals, but it reconsidered and remanded them instead.[38] FERC is now evaluating the decision and preparing to act on remand.

In Sierra Club v. Louisiana Dep’t of Environmental Quality,[39] the Fifth Circuit evaluated whether the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) erred by issuing pre-construction permits for the Commonwealth LNG, LLC (“Commonwealth”) LNG export facility in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. The Sierra Club asked for the permits to be vacated because the LDEQ’s decision was arbitrary and capricious, since the facility’s emissions will exceed National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and the LDEQ failed to require Commonwealth to use the best available control technology to limit those emissions. The court rejected the challenge, finding that state law review standards govern federal review of state environmental permitting, and that LDEQ met those standards. The project now remains scheduled for a 2026 startup.

It was a market signal that U.S. lithium policy is entering a new phase.
Demand, Prices, and the Rollercoaster Market Lithium demand will rise quickly.
Without a reliable domestic lithium supply, the country risks falling behind in the global EV race, remaining dependent on supply chains controlled by rivals.","The lithium sector took center stage this week when Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) stock soared nearly 95% on reports that the Trump administration is considering taking an equity stake in the company’s Thacker Pass mine in Nevada. If it happens, this move would be one of the biggest government actions in U.S. mining in years. It shows how important lithium is to national policy now.

Behind the headlines lies a deeper story: America’s ambition to lead the clean energy transition risks colliding with a stark supply shortage. We highlight below, with the two charts, both the opportunity and the vulnerability facing the United States in this lithium quest.

A Lithium Crisis in the Making

The United States faces a lithium crisis that makes its clean energy ambitions look more like an aspiration than an execution. Current domestic production is only 2,700 metric tons a year. That’s too small compared to the 500,000 tons needed by 2030 to hit electric vehicle (EV) goals.

To put this in perspective:

The lithium in an iPhone weighs about the same as a penny.

A Tesla Model 3 battery pack requires around 12 kilograms.

A Ford F-150 Lightning demands closer to 17 kilograms.

At present mining levels, the U.S. produces enough lithium for only about 158,000 Tesla Model 3s annually. That’s in a market where Americans bought 1.4 million EVs in 2024 alone, with demand expected to climb sharply in the coming years.

This gap reveals a harsh reality: America’s lithium supply chain is ill-prepared for its electrification goals.

From Marginal Producer to Top Four — If Thacker Pass Delivers

The government’s solution to this issue is projects like Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass. It’s one of the largest lithium deposits in North America. If fully developed, it could boost U.S. production to around 40,000 tons each year. This would place the country among the top four producers, following Australia, Chile, and China.

That would mark a tenfold increase in output, but it is still far from enough. Even under the most optimistic forecasts, Thacker Pass would meet just 8% of projected U.S. demand by 2030, and a mere 3% of the 1.2 million tons expected by 2035.

Meanwhile, China has spent more than a decade locking up supply chains, securing lithium assets in Africa, South America, and Australia. It is also building refining infrastructure that now processes nearly 80% of the world’s lithium.

The comparison is striking: Zimbabwe produces eight times more lithium than the U.S. Even smaller producers, like Argentina, surpass American output. In this context, Washington’s sudden push for equity stakes is less about profits and more about survival in a high-stakes race for supply.

Reserves Rich, Supply Poor: The Untapped U.S. Advantage

The second chart points to America’s hidden strength: the U.S. ranks first globally in lithium reserves, with more than 100 million tonnes identified. Despite this geological advantage, those resources remain largely untapped.

Encouragingly, the U.S. now ranks third in global exploration budgets, reflecting a deliberate policy pivot. Billions of dollars are going to exploration and project development, from Nevada to North Carolina. If even a fraction of these reserves is unlocked, the U.S. could rival today’s top producers and reduce dependence on foreign supply chains.

However, converting reserves into production requires more than exploration. Projects can hit delays with permits, face environmental lawsuits, struggle with financing, and deal with local opposition. All these issues can stretch timelines into decades. This is why federal involvement is becoming more important. This includes equity stakes, subsidies, and fast-tracking permits.

Why the LAC Surge Matters

The near-doubling of Lithium Americas’ stock was not just a speculative rally. It was a market signal that U.S. lithium policy is entering a new phase.

Government backing reduces financing risk, making it easier to attract institutional investors.

Aligning policies with EV makers like General Motors, which has a big stake in Thacker Pass, ensures supply security and offtake agreements.

National security framing places lithium on the same level as oil and gas. This makes lithium a strategic commodity and allows for more state intervention.

For automakers and battery manufacturers, this could mark the start of a more stable domestic supply base. For investors, it highlights how policy can rapidly change the outlook for mining equities.

Demand, Prices, and the Rollercoaster Market

Lithium demand will rise quickly. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI) predicts that consumption of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) will surpass 2.4 million tonnes by 2030. That’s almost four times what we use now. By 2035, demand could climb past 5 million tonnes, fueled by electric vehicles and large-scale battery storage.

The industry needs hundreds of new projects to meet this surge. However, BMI points out that permitting delays, financing issues, and tech challenges are slowing supply growth.

Battery demand adds another layer of urgency. Analysts predict global battery capacity will reach nearly 4 terawatt-hours by 2030. This highlights lithium’s vital role in the clean energy shift.

The U.S. is still a minor player. Most refining and conversion happens in China, which holds about 80% of processing capacity. This imbalance shows why Washington supports projects like Lithium Americas. They want to secure a local supply.

Litium prices, meanwhile, have been highly volatile. After lithium carbonate reached over $80,000 per tonne in late 2022, prices dropped sharply. In 2023–2024, they fell by more than 80%, going below $10,000 earlier this year. BMI attributes the crash to oversupply from South America and weaker near-term EV sales in China, which created a temporary glut.

However, the consultancy stresses that volatility is cyclical, not structural. Demand is strong, and prices should bounce back. In fact, last August, prices climbed when China’s major battery player closed its major mine.

New supply can’t keep up with long-term consumption. BMI warns that without steady investment and diversification of supply, future shortages could push prices sharply higher again by the late 2020s.

For the U.S., this shows why public investment matters. It helps create a strong domestic lithium industry. This will support electrification goals and better handle global changes.

Stabilize supply — A guaranteed domestic source reduces reliance on external shocks.

Mitigate short-term volatility — If Thacker Pass operates under a model combining private and public capital, it could offer a more stable supply corridor insulated from market swings.

Signal future project structures — The U.S. may increasingly demand “state-option carve-outs” or partial equity as a condition for major critical mineral projects.

In a market where excess supply can drive prices into unprofitable territory, having a strategic anchor on flagship projects becomes a competitive edge.

Lithium as a Strategic Commodity

Lithium is no longer just a commodity for battery makers — it is now a strategic asset shaping national policy. The U.S. has the reserves, capital, and political will to be a major producer. But it will take years of teamwork to turn potential into production.

The Trump administration’s willingness to consider a government equity stake in Lithium Americas suggests a broader trend: future large-scale projects may require some form of state participation to succeed.

For the U.S., the stakes could not be higher. Without a reliable domestic lithium supply, the country risks falling behind in the global EV race, remaining dependent on supply chains controlled by rivals. With it, America could not only meet its clean energy goals but also secure a critical pillar of its industrial future.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2500491163.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 14:03:24.149145

According to a release, Crane will help strengthen grid reliability, restore jobs and add a source of emission-free energy to the grid.
In addition, Constellation is pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane.
Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center”.
“I’m excited for projects like the Crane Clean Energy Center that will bring even more energy onto the grid because by creating more energy, we will create more opportunity for Pennsylvanians,” said Shapiro.","Crane Clean Energy Center, the former Three Mile Island Unit 1, remains in the spotlight one year following Constellation‘s announcement to restart the plant.

According to a release, Crane will help strengthen grid reliability, restore jobs and add a source of emission-free energy to the grid. The plant’s restart has been made possible through a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft.

Constellation has accelerated the restart to 2027, hired hundreds of workers and made what the company calls “significant progress.” Per the release, the project has provided momentum to state and federal policymakers and some of the world’s largest technology companies to partner with industry to increase investment in new and existing nuclear technology to power the digital economy and U.S. competitiveness.

“Six years ago, the closure of this plant symbolized more than a decade of policy failures that focused only on new clean energy resources that couldn’t match the reliability of nuclear energy, and both the security of our energy grid and air quality suffered,” Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation, said in a statement. “Today it symbolizes the best in American innovation and an overdue recognition that we need to value and invest in existing sources of clean and reliable energy as we also build the grid of the future.

“As we confront the challenge of rising energy demand to support America’s economic growth, it’s critical that we look to Crane as a reminder of the consequences of not learning from past mistakes,” added Dominguez.

In addition, Constellation is pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane. It could add up to 2,000 megawatts of new, clean and reliable baseload capacity to the grid.

“In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power,” Gov. Josh Shapiro said. “As an all-of-the-above energy governor, I hope to produce even more energy here in Pennsylvania from all sources – from natural gas and solar to geothermal to nuclear.”

Workforce and site development milestones achieved in the past year include the following:

The facility is nearly 80% staffed, with 500 full-time employees on-site and dozens more pending. A second Initial License Training class will begin in early 2026 to allow reactor operators to train and obtain a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license to operate the plant.

Inspections of steam generators, main generator, emergency diesel generators, and underground piping have been completed or are near completion, alongside enhancements to the training center and control room simulator.

Technical and regulatory progress includes:

Constellation’s interconnection request to PJM, the regional grid operator, received accelerated approval, clearing the path for grid integration and allowing Constellation to accelerate the restart to 2027.

NRC licensing and regulatory filings remain on track, supported by a Restart Panel overseeing review and inspections. Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center”.

Continued progress with state and local environmental agencies to secure permits for water usage and environmental protection.

Progress made in economic impact and community engagement include:

An independent economic study confirmed the plant will result in approximately 3,400 direct and indirect jobs, over $16 billion added to Pennsylvania’s GDP and more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

Constellation is making good on its commitment to community investment, including more than $1 million in charitable giving over five years to support workforce development and local organizations. In 2025, the company donated $200,000 to more than a dozen local charities, nonprofit organizations and workforce development programs.

Crane’s community engagement manager Dave Marcheskie has been meeting frequently with residents and community groups to gather feedback and offer philanthropic support.

The funding comes as the U.S. prepares to cut off imports of uranium from Russia in 2028. But experts fear the funding will not go far enough.

Major obstacles stand in the way to domestically enrich the uranium that’s needed to power the 94 large reactors in the U.S. today, which provide roughly a fifth of electricity on the grid.

Still, the funding, which is viewed as seed money for an enrichment revival in the U.S., could come as soon as the end of this month — and may be offered to multiple companies.

“This will be a $900 million opportunity going to one, maybe two companies,” Nima Ashkeboussi, vice president for government relations and communications at the firm Global Laser Enrichment, said in an interview. “DOE is using this money as essentially a grant to the awardee to incentivize them to accelerate and maximize capacity deployment.”

Two other sources who were granted anonymity to speak freely about sensitive federal funding confirmed the funding could go to multiple companies and could come as early as next week. The funding, according to the sources, is for the low-enriched uranium used in traditional reactors, not the next-generation fuel needed for a new wave of small reactors that are currently seeking regulatory approval.

The funding, which stems from a program put in place last year by the Biden administration, would mark a major escalation in federal efforts to boost domestic enrichment and the broad nuclear sector in the U.S., just as the World Nuclear Association said in a recent report that global uranium demand will nearly double by 2040.

“The DOE’s money is like a sourdough bread starter,” said Curtis Roberts II, vice president of communications for Orano USA, a subsidiary of a French government-owned enricher. “We can’t stand up a market without it, really.”

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has raised the ante on nuclear power, pledging to quadruple it by midcentury to “win the AI race” and meet skyrocketing electricity demand forecasts for the coming years. Trump has released several executive orders on nuclear energy since taking power, and in May he called for “10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said nuclear power is the “single biggest issue” on his agenda. Wright and other nuclear supporters say the electricity source is a critical way to operate artificial intelligence projects across the country with baseload power, a term typically used to describe nuclear and fossil fuels for their ability to provide around-the-clock electricity.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is working with Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of a meltdown at a different reactor in 1979. And the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office is financing a loan for Holtec International to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan.

Speaking at an Atlantic Council event Wednesday, Julie Kozeracki, director of strategy at the LPO, said the office “will be doing financing for nuclear.”

Large reactors back in vogue

U.S. policymaking on nuclear power in recent years often focused on the development of small modular reactors, and companies are actively seeking approvals and permits for small reactor construction and operation. But SMRs don’t currently provide any electricity to the grid, and some policymakers have recently prioritized construction of large, traditional reactors that use low-enriched uranium, or LEU.

“I think you’ve seen a sea change in the last 18 months to a year,” said Andrew Shaw, a lobbyist with Bracewell LLP. “Prior to that, everybody was talking about SMRs, but now, with this significant load growth projected, there’s a lot of new interest in AP1000s.”

AP1000s are the newest large reactors built by Westinghouse. The most recent U.S. example is the Vogtle plant in Georgia.

Global Laser Enrichment, or GLE, and Orano are two of six companies selected by DOE in December last year to “compete for future work to supply” LEU. That’s the nuclear fuel used today in large U.S. reactors. LEU differs from the next-generation fuel eyed for small reactors, which is typically referred to as high-assay, low-enriched uranium, or HALEU.

“There’s a defined market right now for LEU, whereas future demand when it comes to HALEU is pretty uncertain,” Shaw said. “You just don’t know how many of these reactors are actually going to go forward and how many will not.”

The other companies selected are a Centrus Energy subsidiary; Urenco; LIS Technologies; and General Matter, a new firm backed by conservative financier Peter Thiel and run by former SpaceX employee Scott Nolan, who attended a White House event on nuclear earlier this year. DOE signed a lease with General Matter in August that allows the company to use a former enrichment site in Paducah, Kentucky, along with the uranium at the location.

While the U.S. currently imports roughly an eighth to a quarter of its enriched uranium from Russia, a law passed last year by Congress requires the U.S. to cut off Russian imports by 2028. The law is part of a U.S. push to penalize Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.

“We allowed ourselves to fall under dependence of both China and Russia for critical minerals,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Sunday, according to a White House pool report. “America buying uranium from Russia is not acceptable and so we’re working very hard … to make sure we’ve got a plan so that the United States can get back into domestic enriched uranium production as quickly as possible.”

Domestic enrichment ‘as quickly as possible’

The Trump administration nuclear strategy has come with controversy. A Trump official has pushed the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to “rubber-stamp” new reactors tested by DOE and the Defense Department.

Meanwhile, Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) has spelled out concerns that federal programs will benefit Oklo, a nuclear company with a board of directors that featured Wright before his resignation in February. Oklo is on a rapid rise, although some industry experts think its stock value is wildly inflated.

DOE did not respond to an E&E News request for comment.

Dan Leistikow, vice president of corporate communications at Centrus, said the U.S. needs to step up on enrichment.

“Centrus offers the only proven, American-made enrichment technology,” Leistikow said. “We will introduce new supply diversity and price competition to a dangerously over-concentrated market.”

While Centrus doesn’t produce LEU in the U.S., it is the only company currently producing HALEU domestically, having already secured a contract with DOE.

The company announced on Thursday plans for a significant expansion of its HALEU enrichment plant in Ohio. This project could create 1,300 jobs, Centrus says, and requires billions in private and public investment, along with federal funding decisions.

But the U.S. offices of Orano and Urenco — jointly owned by the British and Dutch governments and two German utilities — are looking to get into the game too. Urenco operates America’s only commercial-scale enrichment facility in New Mexico, and Orano has announced plans to construct a plant in Tennessee that would be the state’s largest single investment ever.

“One of [President Trump’s] goals is to bring in foreign investment,” Roberts with Orano said. “Our Project IKE is a $5 billion development with the DOE support, and so with our proposal, that money is spent here in the U.S. — all of it.”

Lee Robinson, founding member of General Matter, said U.S. nuclear plants may run into “shortage territory” on enriched uranium supply in the coming years.

“The supply of that feedstock was previously, in part, coming from Russia,” he said Wednesday at the Atlantic Council event. “The U.S. market needs to catch up to that. Otherwise, they’re not going to have options.”

The DOE announcement on the Kentucky lease awarded to General Matter says enrichment activities will launch “by the end of the decade.” General Matter did not respond to a request for comment.

Jay Yu, chief executive officer at LIS Technologies, says his company is helping to pioneer cutting-edge laser enrichment technologies that could dramatically cut costs over current gas centrifuge technology.

“There’s no company in the world or country that has successfully scaled laser uranium enrichment,” he said in an interview. “We’re going to focus on where the market is, so probably LEU.”

Yu said the approaching cutoff of Russia uranium is a “boost” to U.S. enrichers. In the last year, he said his company raised more than $45 million in capital. Meanwhile, GLE’s Ashkeboussi said staff at his company is at 115 people, up dramatically from a dozen in 2021.

Russian cutoff challenges

But even with the DOE funding for new enrichment, experts say the 2028 Russian uranium cutoff may be too challenging to meet.

Roberts with Orano said every month counts as developers prepare to deploy dozens of advanced reactors over the next decade.

“It takes a certain amount of time to license it, to build a facility to hit that,” he said. “Advanced reactors actually are going to be coming online [in the] 2028 or so time frame. So if we want to license and build, ramp up facility production, the timing is now.”

And each of the contract competitors is subject to criticism from others in the nuclear sphere. GLE, LIS Technologies and General Matter are comparative newcomers brandishing commercially unproven technology.

Many blame Centrus for America’s dearth of enrichment capacity, noting that the company hasn’t commercially enriched uranium in more than a decade despite significant government support.

Orano’s chief executive in Paris said the company will not make a financial investment decision on Project IKE until 2027.

Urenco’s New Mexico enrichment facility, the lone commercial one in the U.S., recently expanded and is able to supply about a third of enriched uranium used in the U.S. But the company has seen production go down, not up, since 2018.

That’s a stark contrast from past decades. In 1985, government-operated enrichment plants processed more than six times the uranium the nation enriches today and nearly four times what American reactors consumed.

Many experts are concerned that atrophy in the U.S. nuclear sector paves the way for China to usurp American leadership globally. China currently has 32 reactors under construction and 44 more planned, according to the World Nuclear Association, and the country has exported enriched uranium to the U.S. in recent years.

“I’m quite concerned about the role that China may have in the global nuclear market and the implications of that for the United States,” said Paul Saunders, a Russia expert and president of the nonprofit Center for the National Interest. “China has a very substantial domestic reactor construction program underway.”

“It’s not a given that the United States stays ahead,” he said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2c/f5/9dd4ca11419591ab21e1c430864c/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1248874494,N,,2025-09-26 16:00:01.509147

​‘Motherfucking wind farms’?” Jackson says in a mock angry voice at the end of the video.
It manages a wide range of projects, from hydroelectric dams to offshore wind farms.
For example, offshore wind farms generated 17% of the U.K.’s electricity last year.
The ad’s wind turbines were superimposed post-production using video footage of a real Vattenfall wind farm in Denmark.","Standing alone on a rocky coastline wearing a seaman-style knit hat, Samuel L. Jackson reaches into a snack bag and gazes intensely through binoculars. Wind turbines spin ominously on a watery horizon.

“Motherfucking wind farms. Loud, ugly, harmful to nature,” the ​“Pulp Fiction” actor says. Then, shaking his head knowingly and shifting his tone, he adds, ​“Who says that? These giants are standing tall against fossil fuels, rising up from the ocean like a middle finger to CO2.”

The 60-second ad, released in July, immediately went viral. It also ran on television channels in Finland, Sweden, Germany, and other European countries. It’s part of a marketing campaign launched by Vattenfall, a century-old Swedish energy giant whose clean energy portfolio includes a famous 11-turbine project built within view of President Donald Trump’s Scotland golf course.

The ad reached 600 million viewers across 33 countries within four days of its release, according to a Vattenfall spokesperson. Trump isn’t named in the video, but Jackson’s script is a comedic wink-and-nod to the president’s frequent anti-wind rants.

“So, what’s it going to be? ​‘Motherfucking wind farms’?” Jackson says in a mock angry voice at the end of the video. He then repeats the question, grinning widely and raising his eyebrows cheekily: ​“Or ​‘motherfucking wind farms’?”

Research shows that comedy plays a powerful role in making climate change information salient for public audiences. That’s especially useful now, as the Trump administration works to derail the clean energy transition, but such efforts also come at a fraught moment for comedy in America.

Satire under fire

It’s a tough time for political satire. In July, CBS cancelled ​“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” after Colbert used the phrase ​“big fat bribe” to describe a $16 million settlement the network’s parent company, Paramount, agreed to pay Trump. CBS said the show was killed for financial reasons, but the timing led to speculations that the decision may have been politically motivated.

Then in mid-September, ABC pulled late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air ​“indefinitely” after comments he made related to the assassination of Charlie Kirk provoked a veiled threat from Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr. The network’s parent company, Disney, reversed course on Monday following public backlash, and Kimmel was back on air Tuesday.

“There’s this tragedy of killing freedom of speech. … The reason this is happening is because [Trump officials] don’t have the superpower of comedy,” said Staci Roberts-Steele, a producer for the wildly successful film ​“Don’t Look Up.” The 2021 Netflix movie used satire to point out the absurdity of delaying climate action.

America now has a president pumping the brakes on the clean energy transition, most recently by attempting to scuttle numerous U.S. offshore wind farms already in development.

Trump has called wind turbines ​“ugly,” ​“terrible for tourism,” and responsible for ​“driving the whales crazy.” His dislike of ​“windmills” dates back to his unsuccessful court battle in the U.K. to stop a Vattenfall offshore wind farm from being installed within view of his Aberdeen, Scotland, golf course. All 11 turbines were eventually built in 2018.

Some Americans who saw the foul-mouthed Jackson ad on social media relished a major Hollywood movie star poking fun at Trump’s favorite anti-climate talking points. Roberts-Steele said she is glad that big European companies like Vattenfall are turning to humor to call out climate disinformation — and that the content is finding American audiences. She hopes it emboldens U.S. comedians and institutions to follow suit.

“The Europeans have been doing it much longer than us. … That’s totally true,” she lamented, adding that U.S. public relations firms and film studios have been less bold about taking big swings at climate skepticism.

“Don’t Look Up” was a rarity for Hollywood. But its chart-topping success mirrors Jackson’s ad in several ways.

Both employed comedy to tackle the topic of climate change. Casting major Hollywood actors drew loads of viewers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, and Jonah Hill all starred in what became Netflix’s fourth most successful movie of all time.

Hollywood hasn’t generated a major climate comedy since.

Roberts-Steele is now leading Yellow Dot Studios, a new nonprofit aimed at keeping the climate jokes coming. The studio hosts live comedy events, develops podcasts, and produces short-form videos that, among other things, mock the fossil-fuel industry.

But mainstreaming this kind of comedy isn’t easy, even with Hollywood director Adam McKay as the group’s founder and board member.

“It hasn’t yet trickled up,” said Max Boykoff, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies the fusion of climate change and comedy. After years researching the topic, he’s now trying to catalyze it.

Boykoff and his students — in collaboration with CU Boulder theater professor Beth Osnes-Stoedefalke — are part of an ongoing collaboration with some of the nation’s top writers’ rooms.

They’ve been working with writers on ​“The Daily Show,” ​“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” and Comedy Central to make climate change news funny and memorable. On Saturday, Boykoff and his students produced a climate-themed comedy show with professional comedians in New York City, timed to coincide with Climate Week NYC.

“Comedy has this power to point out the contradictions in which we live,” said Boykoff. ​“It’s through comedy that people feel like they’re not being talked down to or lectured.”

With late-night shows facing intimidation under Trump, Boykoff said the involvement of independent academics — like himself — is more important than ever. He added that Europe’s role should not be discounted either.

Europe is still laughing

The Samuel L. Jackson ad was the brainchild of the communications team at Vattenfall, a Swedish state-owned energy company that has been around for more than 100 years. It manages a wide range of projects, from hydroelectric dams to offshore wind farms. The company’s long-term goal with its outreach is to spread the idea of freedom from fossil fuels, said Monica Persdotter, vice president and head of brand.

Unlike past campaigns, she said, this one ​“took off.”

“We’ve always been very bold in the way that we present ourselves to the world, with the messages that we have, which always circles back to fossil-free energy and fossil freedom,” said Persdotter.

The ad hit Vattenfall’s core market — the U.K. and European Union — where the offshore wind sector has grown steadily for decades. For example, offshore wind farms generated 17% of the U.K.’s electricity last year.

Vattenfall operates more than 1,400 wind turbines across 14 wind farms, with a total installed capacity of approximately 6.6 gigawatts in five European countries, according to Persdotter. Several other Vattenfall wind projects are also in the works.

Meanwhile, the U.S. only has one large-scale offshore wind farm in operation. Four others are currently being built in America’s waters. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum abruptly paused construction on a fifth one, Revolution Wind, in August, but this week, the project’s developer, Ørsted, a Danish state-owned company, won a court-ordered injunction lifting the freeze.

Given the contrast between Europe and the U.S., Jackson, a widely recognizable American actor, was a powerful choice for Vattenfall’s ad.

According to Persdotter, her team got a tip that Jackson had studied marine biology in college and, at one point, considered a career in the field. The actor, she said, liked the script, making just a few stylistic tweaks to better align with his voice.

The ad was filmed along the California coast to accommodate Jackson’s schedule. The Golden State has no wind turbines installed in its waters yet — though the Los Angeles Times reports that the state, despite losing some federal funding, has not backed down from its plans to deploy the technology. The ad’s wind turbines were superimposed post-production using video footage of a real Vattenfall wind farm in Denmark.

As for the snack bag Jackson dips into — that’s a nod to the fact that wind farms can provide benefits beyond generating carbon-free electricity, for example, serving as sites for seaweed farming. The seaweed snack Jackson is munching — which he calls ​“serious gourmet shit” — isn’t commercially available yet, but Persdotter said it was harvested from experimental seaweed farming ​“lines” strung between wind turbines at Vesterhav Syd, a Vattenfall project in Denmark’s waters. (Vattenfall sent Canary Media a bag of the prototype snack, and a reporter verified that it tasted like conventional seaweed snacks.)

Last week, during a press conference in England with the U.K. prime minister, the president went on an unprompted rant about the clean energy resource, saying, ​“We don’t do wind because wind is a disaster. It’s a very expensive joke, frankly.”

Trump may not like jokes. But if the popularity of Vattenfall’s video is any indication, Europeans are clearly having a laugh at him. Roberts-Steele said Americans will keep laughing, too, as long as comedians are free to make the jokes.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Vattenfall_Campaign_image01.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a159baa1a3c76a550c608b5e43b56b48,N,,2025-09-26 13:04:32.274950

The meeting focused on promoting the Third SIEPAC Protocol, a key instrument for modernizing regional governance, strengthening legal security, attracting greater private investment, and preparing Central America's electricity system for the challenges of energy transition and Vision 2050.

Participants highlighted the results achieved in more than a decade of operation of the MER and the regional transmission system. In 2024 alone, the market negotiated more than 3,700 GWh of energy –equivalent to some US$350 million— with the participation of more than 300 private agents, consolidating the MER as a unique energy integration model in Latin America.

""SIEPAC has demonstrated that regional cooperation can transform strategic sectors. Thanks to this shared vision, Central America has reduced costs, increased energy security, and opened space for new investments,” IDB Executive Vice President Jordan Schwartz said. “Now we must take the next step: complete the second circuit, update regulation, and open the door to even greater integration. Under the América en el Centro program, the IDB will remain a committed partner every step of the way.""

The event also underscored the importance of fostering extra-regional integration with Mexico, Colombia, and Belize, as well as incorporating new technologies such as storage, smart grids, and digital tools to manage the growing penetration of renewable energy in the region.

Looking ahead to 2050, the meeting also served to reaffirm a shared vision of a Central America consolidated as a competitive and sustainable energy hub, capable of guaranteeing energy security, attracting investment, and exporting clean energy. ""The IDB reaffirms its commitment to continue being a strategic partner for Central America and the region, supporting regulatory modernization, infrastructure financing, and technological innovation that will enable progress towards a more secure, efficient and sustainable electricity system,"" said Marcelino Madrigal, Head of the Energy Division of the IDB's Infrastructure and Energy Sector.",https://www.iadb.org/themes/custom/outline_frontend/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-26 14:02:35.586246

In addition to proposed nuclear microreactor manufacturing in Wyoming, TerraPower’s liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear power facility is expected to begin operations in 2030 outside Kemmerer.
Part of federal policy leaning toward nuclear energy began during the Biden administration, which named Wyoming and Idaho as part of a Tech Hub within the Intermountain-West Nuclear Energy Corridor.","IDAHO FALLS—A couple hundred nuclear energy industry officials, along with two western state governors, a Trump administration official and the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, gathered Monday at the Idaho National Laboratory’s sprawling 890-square-mile testing center to discuss nuclear power’s future in the West.

In a large, posh tent with clear plastic walls offering views of the surrounding high-plains sagebrush steppe, these leaders, their staff and a gaggle of media gathered for a reception a short drive away from the world’s premier nuclear energy testing ground.

“We’re standing here, not very far from where [Experimental Breeder Reactor II] proved out the fundamental technology that I believe is ultimately the future for humanity — for energy abundance, reliability and affordability,” Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of nuclear power plant developer Oklo, told the crowd. The success of 1960s-era EBR II was “one of the most phenomenal technological stories in human history and, frankly, one that’s radically under-told and underappreciated.”

After being pushed to the sidelines, nuclear energy technology is back in the spotlight, DeWitte noted. Today’s rush to feed power-hungry artificial intelligence and data computational centers has private investors and governments around the world pouring money into the next generation of nuclear energy, he said. That is already resulting in notable investments in Wyoming, including Bill Gate’s next-generation nuclear project in Kemmerer, but also raising questions about the potential for spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation in the Equality State.

Here at INL, Oklo and subcontractor Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co. will build and test the first Aurora Powerhouse — a liquid-sodium-cooled “fast reactor” generating up to 75 megawatts of electricity that backers hope to deploy around the world. Oklo’s nuclear reactor demonstration is among a dozen or so reactor and nuclear fuel tests in queue at INL that advance the industry’s technology and business models, according to INL officials. The lineup includes Radiant Industry’s “portable” Kaleidos microreactor, which the company proposes to mass-produce in Wyoming at a facility outside Bar Nunn.

Though Radiant’s proposal, along with another in Campbell County, has garnered significant opposition, Gov. Mark Gordon has joined with his counterparts in Idaho and Utah in a declaration of a unified effort to establish the tristate area as the epicenter of America’s nuclear energy resurgence.

“This is what an abundance mentality is all about,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in his opening remarks at the Western Governors’ Association workshop at INL’s Idaho Falls campus later that day. “It’s not Utah versus Idaho versus Wyoming. We’re going to be much stronger if we’re working together, because we have some differences that are important and similarities that are important.”

Energy ‘superabundance’

As chairman of the WGA this year, Cox launched the Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West initiative, which focuses on meeting skyrocketing electrical demand by bolstering nuclear energy. Nuclear power generation, Cox suggested, represents the most reliable form of electricity and a viable means of meeting increasing energy demand.

Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, Cox noted, already share infrastructure under utility Rocky Mountain Power, as well as a shared workforce and a similar “mindset” that’s attractive to the industry.

“I would love to have [Oklo] in Utah, and I can’t lie about that, but that’s good for all of us,” Cox said, adding that all three states are already on the industry’s radar.

The Department of Energy’s national laboratory in Idaho is an obvious draw, he noted. In addition to proposed nuclear microreactor manufacturing in Wyoming, TerraPower’s liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear power facility is expected to begin operations in 2030 outside Kemmerer. Rocky Mountain Power has tentatively agreed to take on the power plant and potentially partner with TerraPower to add more Natrium plants in Utah.

“I can just tell you, by signing that MOU together, it’s given this region much more interest from nuclear partners,” Cox said. “They’re seeing this as a game changer, and so they’re coming. I don’t care if they come to Wyoming or they come to Idaho or they come to Utah.”

The tristate initiative has the backing of the Trump administration, which has ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to speed up nuclear licensing and has directed the DOE to have 10 new “large reactors” under construction by 2030 with a goal of adding 300,000 megawatts of nuclear power to the grid by 2050. One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes.

Part of federal policy leaning toward nuclear energy began during the Biden administration, which named Wyoming and Idaho as part of a Tech Hub within the Intermountain-West Nuclear Energy Corridor.

Challenges

Despite enthusiasm among private industry and state and federal officials, there are significant challenges to implementing a nuclear resurgence in the region.

Several speakers at the WGA event noted that AI and data center developers favor new power generation facilities that are, in a regulatory sense, apart from the shared electrical grid, or “behind the meter.” That complicates the utility regulatory environment and rate structures. Also, the U.S. is still reliant on other nations for nuclear components and several aspects of the fuel supply chain, which will take years to provide domestically. Others noted that the Trump administration’s demands on federal agencies — like fast-tracking and licensing a massive buildout of nuclear power plants — are at odds with recent staff downsizing.

Industry leaders are also worried about a dearth of workers for jobs that require specific training and certifications.

“We know that we need a significantly expanded workforce for the modernization and expansion of the grid,” Deloitte Specialist Executive Bill Abolt said. The nation’s long lull in building nuclear energy has left the industry with skilled experts who are retiring and an empty “pipeline” to replace them, he added. “The people that built the last nuclear power plant didn’t just stick around and wait for the next one.”

Though states have made advancements in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education and training, nuclear fields have been a blind spot, several industry officials agreed.

“At some point, you need to figure out how to get Mike Rowe involved,” INL’s Innovation and Technology Manager Chris Lohse said, referring to the television personality who touts the nobility of skilled trades and “dirty” physical labor.

Yet perhaps the industry’s biggest challenge remains its image as a dangerous liability to human health and the environment — a legacy of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, perpetuated in cinema and The Simpsons. Though the WGA event was stacked with those who are certain of the safety of the industry, some noted that local opposition to things like wind farms extends to nuclear energy proposals.

In fact, many residents in Bar Nunn and Gillette — communities that have long supported heavy energy industries — are not convinced they want to welcome nuclear facilities. Campbell County commissioners recently drafted a resolution to solidify their interim stance on the potential for spent nuclear fuel waste storage until putting the question to a public vote in the 2026 election. Until there’s a vote, the commission would remain opposed to such proposals.

“There is a lot of time that’s being spent engaging with communities, local governments and people on the ground who may have been upset about a wind turbine,” National Association of State Energy Officials Chief of Staff Cassie Powers said. “There does need to be some real, honest public engagement to demystify investments in nuclear.”",https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/INL-Demonstration-of-Microreactor-Experiments-DOME-DBleizeffer.jpeg?fit=1200%2C1005&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-26 16:00:04.883358

Building on a seven-year alliance, the two entities are embarking on a new venture with a focus on the “vibro-acoustics of electric powertrains.”

The new chair or research alliance aims to facilitate the automotive industry’s shift towards electrification by addressing the challenge of electric motor and gearbox noise.

Set to continue until 2032, the partnership will see Arts et Métiers’ Laboratory of Engineering of Physical and Numerical Systems (LISPEN) and Laboratory of Electrical Engineering and Power Electronics of Lille (L2EP) researchers applying their knowledge in electrical engineering, experimental techniques, digital computations, and vibratory mechanics.

Valeo will contribute its market know-how and incorporate its calculation, testing, and design practices into the research.

The research will concentrate on two primary objectives: first, to develop “electro-magneto-mechanical simulation tools” that can predict vibrations and noise from the design phase of motors and their control strategies.

Second, to devise electrical control solutions and methods for decreasing noise and vibration, including the use of technologies such as viscoelastic materials, piezoelectric absorbers, and meta-materials.

Valeo said that the initial collaboration, which revolved around the chair on “Nonlinear Dynamics for Future Absorbers,” brought together experts from LISPEN in Lille and Valeo.

The new chair director and professor-researcher, who is responsible for initiating the partnership, Olivier Thomas, said: “Acoustic comfort has become a critical success factor for electric vehicles.

“If the NVH (Noise Vibration Harshness) exceeds a critical threshold, it jeopardises customer acceptance of this powertrain, as silence remains a strong promise of electric mobility. Today, we are taking a new step forward to further strengthen Valeo’s leadership in electric mobility.”

Recently, Valeo inaugurated a new production site in Shanghai’s Waigang Industrial Park, located in the Jiading District, China.

Murphy’s Funeral Service, 703 S. Harrison St., celebrated its 50th anniversary in business. Founded in 1934 by Loren “Pat” Murphy, the home originally operated out of a small house before moving to South Harrison in 1937 when state law required professional embalming. In the early days, visitations were often still held at home, with funerals in churches, but by the 1970s most services had shifted to the mortuary. Duane Murphy became full-time in 1946 and later expanded the building in the 1970s to accommodate larger gatherings. In 1984, Charles and Illiana Hartman purchased the business, continuing its role as a fixture in the community.

1975: Major Hospital was considering a new around-the-clock emergency room coverage plan. The proposal called for doctors to be on duty 24 hours a day instead of relying only on on-call physicians, reflecting the growing demand for full-time emergency care in the community.

1965: A new educational building was under construction at Fairland Baptist Church, which connected directly with the old church building.

(Biogas systems also capture energy from waste at landfills, on farms, and at dedicated food waste biogas facilities.)
ABC’s new research shows that the industry added roughly 100 biogas facilities per decade at wastewater facilities from 1960 to 1990.
Because wastewater biogas capture systems are typically smaller than other types of biogas facilities, they produce only 12.5% of total U.S. biogas output despite their relative prevalence.
However, digesting local food waste with sludge at wastewater plants offers wastewater facilities a powerful opportunity to enhance biogas output while recycling organic waste into energy.","WASHINGTON – September 25, 2025 – Today, the American Biogas Council (ABC) released new data showing the extensive role municipal wastewater facilities can play to recycle organic waste into renewable energy and fertilizer using biogas systems. Today, more than 1,200 U.S. wastewater treatment plants capture biogas from their wastewater sludge and use it to produce the electricity equivalent of 7.3 billion kWh per year. The data also show significant untapped potential: About 3,800 additional wastewater facilities – over three times as many – could build biogas capture systems but have not. If every suitable wastewater facility installed biogas systems, the sector could capture 171.8 billion cubic feet of biogas each year – enough energy for 1.3 million U.S. households.

The ABC’s research provides the first comprehensive survey of U.S. biogas capture systems at wastewater plants in more than a decade. The analysis draws on data collected from more than 5,000 wastewater plants that treat at least a million gallons of wastewater a day (1 MGD).

“Biogas systems have the potential to unlock an unprecedented supply of U.S.-made energy, and wastewater facilities can help make that happen” said the ABC’s Executive Director Patrick Serfass. “Investing in biogas capture at wastewater facilities creates a win-win scenario. Waste is recycled instead of discarded, and the U.S. can tap enough new energy to power the homes of millions of Americans across the country.”

Wastewater biogas facilities convert their sludge, or biosolids, using anaerobic digestion systems, which capture biogas produced as the waste breaks down. Even though wastewater plants frequently use their biogas to generate power on-site and put only excess electricity onto the grid, they significantly ease electricity demand, which is soaring from data centers and an increase in domestic manufacturing. (Biogas systems also capture energy from waste at landfills, on farms, and at dedicated food waste biogas facilities.)

The wastewater industry pioneered the use of biogas systems in the U.S. beginning in the 1920s, at first simply to reduce the volume of sludge they needed to manage from wastewater treatment (digesting the sludge cuts its volume by about 50%). In the decades that followed more and more facilities have added anaerobic digesters, increasingly to provide biogas to generate electricity or heat for plant operations. ABC’s new research shows that the industry added roughly 100 biogas facilities per decade at wastewater facilities from 1960 to 1990.

Today, 49% of all biogas capture systems in the U.S. operate at wastewater plants, followed by farms (24%) and landfills (23%). Because wastewater biogas capture systems are typically smaller than other types of biogas facilities, they produce only 12.5% of total U.S. biogas output despite their relative prevalence. However, digesting local food waste with sludge at wastewater plants offers wastewater facilities a powerful opportunity to enhance biogas output while recycling organic waste into energy.

The data also detail how plants use captured gas: 80% generate energy, with 58% producing electricity and 22% producing heat. Only 4% of wastewater plants upgrade raw biogas to renewable natural gas (RNG), a lower proportion than in other biogas sectors.For more information on this data and more visit americanbiogascouncil.org.

In just a few years, Washington D.C. has shifted from a protector of environmental policy to an obstacle.
These shifts in policy are so shocking because of how sharply they depart from previously bipartisan environmental policy.
While the current political cycle in the United States encourages partisan thinking when it comes to environmentalism and public health, preserving our lands and pursuing public health was not always a ballot box issue.
Grassroot support for bipartisan environmentalism already exists.","In his first hundred days in office, President Donald Trump took 145 actions undoing clean air, water and climate laws. He has since ordered Environmental Protection Agency scientists to stop publishing their research, fired climate experts in droves and has subjected meteorologists to political loyalty tests. His Interior Department, once a hallmark of American environmentalism, has stripped protections from over 245 million acres of public land, while implementing new rules allowing the removal of endangered species’ habitat. These rollbacks are not isolated policies; they represent a coordinated attack on science, conservation, and the very idea that the government should safeguard public health. The Trump administration is waging a silent war on environmentalism and is actively dismantling decades of bipartisan progress. Urgent action is needed to reverse this trend.

In just a few years, Washington D.C. has shifted from a protector of environmental policy to an obstacle. Trump’s dismantling of American environmentalism has been swift and unprecedented. On his inauguration day, Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, making it the only country to have ever done so. He has abandoned clean energy projects on public land and threatened to block any on private land. In the past few weeks, he and his administration have fired thousands of employees from the EPA, the Interior Department, the Department of Energy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

These shifts in policy are so shocking because of how sharply they depart from previously bipartisan environmental policy. While the current political cycle in the United States encourages partisan thinking when it comes to environmentalism and public health, preserving our lands and pursuing public health was not always a ballot box issue. The EPA, created to protect both human health and the environment, was established by both Democrats and Republicans and signed into law by Richard Nixon. Similarly, the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act both had bipartisan support, and both were signed by Republican presidents (George W. Bush and Gerald Ford, respectively).

Beyond public health, America’s modern day conservation movement was also once bipartisan. Theodore Roosevelt, one of the Republican Party’s great figures, created the modern-day National Park system, following in fellow Republican Ulysses S. Grant’s legacy. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, for its part, includes numerous conservation benefits, such as the Klamath Basin, Delaware River Basin and Lake Tahoe restorations. These examples make Trump’s reversal of policy even more jarring; they contradict not only established environmental science, but his own party’s tradition of stewardship.

Hope is not lost, however. Despite these reversals in policy, the American people remain ahead of their leaders. In a recent poll, 60% of Republicans, 59% of Independents and 86% of Democrats suggested they would have a more favorable impression towards their member of Congress if they pursued natural climate solutions. The same poll found a 91% consensus across parties to provide a financial incentive to converse natural areas, while 89% approved of building a year-round workforce to restore coastlines, forests, farmlands and other natural areas.

Grassroot support for bipartisan environmentalism already exists. Americans want to take pride in their wild spaces and live clean, safe lives. Across party lines, Americans agree that they want a nation that they can be environmentally proud of. This makes Trump’s policies not only reckless, but a betrayal of his party’s and his voters’ values. Environmentalism aligns perfectly with conservative ideals of stewardship, responsibility, and national pride.

Even fiscally, pro-environmental policy advances Republican goals. In 2023, the National Parks Service contributed $55.6 billion dollars to the American economy and supported over 415,000 jobs. This number has decreased after Trump’s recent mass firings of NPS’s staff. Worldwide, nations with stronger environmental policies have also been found to have stronger economies and efficient industries.

If the United States is to reclaim its legacy as a global leader in conservation and global health, it cannot afford to let environmentalism continue to be a casualty of partisanship. Trump’s rollbacks reveal not just an assault on policy, but a denial of shared values that once united Americans across the aisle. Protecting clean air, safe water, and public lands is not a Republican or Democratic issue – it is an American issue. The public already acknowledges this; it is time for American leaders to act accordingly. It is time for them to reach across the aisle to protect not only our public lands and health, but also our American values. Rebuilding environmental bipartisanship is not optional – it is the only way to safeguard America’s health, land and values from reckless leadership.",https://i0.wp.com/dailycampus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-274.png?fit=719%2C456&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-26 18:01:55.180325

It means lawmakers should respect local control over energy facilities and data centers and means Gov.","Pennsylvania is at the epicenter of a dangerous fossil fuel agenda — and unfortunately, Governor Josh Shapiro is paving the way.

Since taking office, Shapiro has taken no meaningful climate action. Instead, he has advanced fossil fuel interests by fast-tracking permits for so-called “reliable” energy — a phrase used to greenwash gas, biodigesters, and other methane-emitting projects. And he promotes an “all-of-the-above” energy approach, which props up oil and gas under the guise of sustainability. Too often, he sides with polluters over people.

Our state has been part of the U.S. Climate Alliance since 2019, a coalition committed to a net-zero future by advancing state-led, high-impact climate action. Yet Pennsylvania is America’s second largest extractor of fossil fuels — and no significant climate-mitigating legislation has been established during Shapiro’s tenure as governor.

If you find yourself turning to our coverage more and more, please consider making a donation to strengthen our independent, nonprofit newsroom.

President Donald Trump has a bullseye on Pennsylvania shale gas, with promises of liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals, massive AI data centers powered by dedicated gas-fired power plants, and additional false solutions like pyrolysis (burning plastic, which creates toxic emissions) and carbon capture and sequestration (an ineffective and dangerous attempt at storing carbon underground, transported through hazardous pipelines that can poison communities with CO2 gas leaks). These projects only delay the transition to real renewable energy.

Data centers bring the threat of noise, higher electric bills, water pollution, and high water usage. And in Pennsylvania, they also bring the health harms of increased fracking and new gas-fired power plants. Amazon and Blackstone plan to use fracked gas to fuel their data centers. And proposed LNG export terminals bring incredible risks of explosion and pollution to densely populated areas on the East Coast.

A bill in the state House, HB 502, is being shoehorned into state budget legislation after failing to get out of committee. It allows a centralized board to override municipal land use decisions by issuing a “Certificate of Reliable Energy Supply.” Once that certificate is granted, municipalities are legally barred from taking any action that might “materially impede” the project — even if that action is rooted in zoning law, comprehensive planning, or legitimate public health and safety concerns.

Yet Shapiro’s administration is pushing the bill hard, threatening the autonomy and voices of the people of Pennsylvania. In fact, Article I, Section 27 of Pennsylvania’s constitution — the Environmental Rights Amendment — establishes the people’s right to clean air and pure water, and requires all levels of government, including municipalities, to act as trustees of our natural resources. By stripping towns of their authority to protect residents through zoning and planning, HB 502 prevents them from fulfilling that constitutional duty. Courts have already struck down similar overreach in the Robinson Township case.

Instead of being a champion for his constituents who are suffering health harms from fossil fuel extraction in the state, Gov. Shapiro has been busy developing alliances and deals with the gas industry, creating significant roadblocks to meaningful climate action. Now, with the announcement from President Trump of over $90 billion coming to Pennsylvania for an AI hub in our state, our communities face major threats of increased pollution and health harms from fracking, methane gas pipelines, data centers, and other oil and gas infrastructure.

We need Gov. Shapiro not to sell us out. Instead, he needs to hold polluters accountable.

That means stop pushing AI data centers powered by fracked gas. It means stop backing LNG exports and false solutions like burning plastic, carbon capture, and hydrogen production from fracked gas. It means lawmakers should respect local control over energy facilities and data centers and means Gov. Shapiro should make good on promises to address the toxic impacts of fracking and ban road spreading of toxic, radioactive drilling waste.

We’re watching closely. Pennsylvanians demand leadership that centers on genuine community collaboration, real solutions to the health crisis created by fracking, high-impact actions on the climate crisis, and on respect for frontline communities where residents are suffering.

Pennsylvania can lead the way in creating union jobs, building renewable energy, protecting communities, and ensuring every family has clean air and water.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ashburn-virginia-2048x1192.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 13:04:35.741851

30%: EV Sales Shatter New Record Ahead Of Projected Slowdown

Americans bought nearly half a million battery-powered cars in the third quarter, rushing to claim federal tax credits of up to $7,500 before they expire on Sept. 30.

The research firm Cox Automotive projected on Thursday that EV sales will hit 410,000 for the quarter, pushing the electric share of the U.S. car market to a landmark 10% for the first time ever. Cox had expected that milestone by year’s end, but it arrived a quarter early thanks to sweeping EV policy changes under the Trump administration.

The end of the tax credits “sparked an unmistakable pre-expiration rush as consumers and dealers moved quickly to lock in benefits before the incentives phased out,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, the director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told reporters during a sales forecast call on Thursday.

Automakers, meanwhile, are squeezing every last drop out of the federal incentives bucket before they vanish, rolling out aggressive lease and financing deals, cash-back discounts, and trade-in bonuses to sway more Tesla owners toward rivals like Lucid and Polestar.

In the third quarter, sales were down for market-leader Tesla, according to Cox Automotive data, but EV sales volumes set a new record regardless of that. That’s thanks to the likes of General Motors, Honda and Hyundai stepping up.

Chevrolet is now the number two EV seller in the country, thanks to models such as the Equinox EV, Blazer EV and Silverado EV. Cadillac has also seen a surge in EV sales with its popular Lyriq and Optiq crossovers.

But Valdez Streaty warned that a slowdown could be coming. “The quarter delivered record EV sales and market share, but the pace will ease in Q4 and beyond as the impact of the IRA tax incentive begins to fade,” she said.

Analysts have predicted a slowdown after Sept. 30, but the extent of the damage is still unknown. And automakers are already preparing to thrive in a post-tax-credit world, moving to address the key challenge for the EV industry, which is affordability.

The results of that are now just starting to show, thanks to new low-cost models such as the next-generation Nissan Leaf, the upcoming Chevy Bolt EV, Tesla’s affordable Model Y-based EV, Kia EV3 and more such models in the pipeline.

The end of the tax credits may put more pressure on automakers to drive organic growth in sales. That means launching EVs that compete on merit rather than drool-worthy monthly deals and zero down payments.

60%: Tesla Urges The EPA To Preserve The Tailpipe Emissions Regulations

Tesla may no longer market itself aggressively as a car company, but it’s quietly behaving like one. The automaker, which is now pivoting to AI and robotics, urged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to preserve the tailpipe emissions regulations that the Trump administration is seeking to repeal.

In a regulatory filing submitted by Tesla and posted by the EPA on Wednesday, the automaker has argued that the EPA’s “Endangerment Finding,” which concludes that greenhouse gas emissions threaten public health and welfare, is backed by robust science and facts. The Trump EPA wants to scrap the finding, the bedrock of emissions regulations in this country, after over a decade on the books.

Under the Biden administration, the EPA finalized the most stringent emissions rules in U.S. history. The rules would have required automakers to make cars that release fewer and fewer CO2 emissions over time, encouraging them to sell more EVs to meet their emissions target. Automakers can also sell hybrids and plug-in hybrids to meet these goals.

Tesla said rolling back these regulations would disrupt investments, hand automakers a free pass on emissions, and hurt U.S. competitiveness. It also said the agency hasn’t provided enough scientific or economic justification for rolling back the standards and its analysis ignores the cost savings and pollution benefits of EVs.

The biggest reason Tesla has a horse in this race? It has earned billions of dollars over the years selling carbon credits to automakers who can't meet various emissions rules. So it should want policies like the Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules, California's EV sales requirements and EPA regs to remain in effect.

90%: The Trump Administration Wants To Buy A Stake In Lithium Americas

Weeks after the Trump administration bought a 10% stake in American semiconductor company Intel, it is now seeking to do something similar with Lithium Americas, which is building one of the country’s largest domestic lithium mining projects in Nevada.

The Thacker Pass lithium project could help the U.S. become more independent, and help boost the country’s domestic lithium production and move away from Chinese supply chains. The raw material is used in everything from electric vehicles to consumer electronics and home appliances.

The scale of the Thacker Pass projects is among the largest in the world for a single site. Currently, the U.S. produces less than 5,000 metric tons of lithium at Albemarle’s Nevada facility. Thacker Pass's first phase is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium annually, enough to power 800,000 EVs, Reuters reported.

General Motors owns a 38% stake in the mine, and reportedly has the right to purchase all of the lithium output from the project’s first phase. The Trump administration is seeking guarantees from GM that it will buy the lithium and is also pushing the automaker to give up control over parts of the projects and hand them over to the U.S. government.

(TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF) is beginning to capture investor imagination with a plan that moves beyond extraction and into the linchpin of the supply chain: refining. “You’re not going to have anything on the mining extraction side work or come to fruition unless you have the refining to go with it,” said Pat Ryan, the company’s CEO and Chairman, in a recent conversation. “We’re breaking that mold. We’re bringing it back to America where it needs to be, and the stock is appreciating because of it.”

Ryan’s emphasis on refining as the bridge between mines and end-use technology reflects a broader shift in how investors and governments are evaluating rare earths. Ucore has become a dual-track story: a Canadian company with a demonstration facility in Kingston, Ontario, and a U.S. deployment play with a commercial plant under development in Alexandria, Louisiana. The latter is backed by a US$22.4 million funding agreement with the U.S. Army Contracting Command-Orlando. As Ucore disclosed earlier this month, the Louisiana project now carries a Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating, giving its supply orders preferential treatment under U.S. law. Engineering work, site surveys, and long-lead material sourcing are already underway, with full-scale RapidSX™ equipment testing progressing toward mid-2026 commercial output.

At the heart of Ucore’s strategy is its RapidSX™ technology, which Ryan describes as a modernization of solvent extraction chemistry. “We have a computerized column-based technology,” he explained. “The work that we’ve done at the Kingston demo plant—we’ve taken over 10,000 testing metrics to check conventional solvent extraction versus our RapidSX technology—and you get the same purity, the same recovery. So the chemistry is the same, but the deployment of chemistry is so much better.” The efficiencies, he said, translate into a 70% increase in throughput on a smaller footprint with reduced waste and stronger ESG attributes. “It all just gets better from there,” Ryan said, stressing that scalability is aligned with the measured pace of the western market.

Investors have taken note of Ucore’s positioning. Institutional capital, Ryan said, “is starting to understand the U.S. story,” with end customers “lining up in droves” to secure off-take. He pointed out that a year ago many potential buyers “didn’t even know what they wanted,” but today “they understand what those rare earth oxides we’re producing—those ‘seeds of technology,’ as it’s called—they need them.” Demand clarity, coupled with supportive U.S. and Canadian funding, has helped fuel the company’s recent surge in valuation.

Despite geopolitical tensions around tariffs and trade, Ryan described the cross-border operating environment as stable, aided by parallel Canadian and U.S. government backing. “The Canadian government and U.S. government are looking at the data points that we’re collecting for both programs and saying, ‘Hey, this is great. We’ve got to move forward together for the western world.’” Looking further afield, Ucore has signed agreements with Australian companies Metallum and ABx, a move Ryan suggests could position Australia to “trailer hitch with what’s going on in North America.” While he acknowledged the possibility of Australian government involvement, his near-term focus remains squarely on North America, where Ucore intends to build the first stage of a 2,000 tonne per annum separation facility.

The combination of technological differentiation, government prioritization, and intensifying customer demand situates Ucore Rare Metals in a rare position: a refining story at the center of a global supply chain realignment. As Ryan put it, “We’ve taken our technology, we’re putting it in Louisiana, we’re building out our commercial plant there. That doesn’t mean we’re not coming back to Canada to continue the work we’re doing. It’s about Canada and the U.S. moving forward together—let’s make this work.”

That’s the latest take from analytics firm Enverus Intelligence Research, which said in a new report this week that the marginal cost of U.S. oil supply is projected to rise from $70 per barrel WTI price at present, to as much as $95 per barrel by the mid-2030s. The expected $15 per barrel surge in costs would be driven by a shift from economically proven inventory to more speculative locations as the core inventory is depleting, according to Enverus Intelligence Research (EIR).

Soaring Cost, Waning Global Influence

The looming depletion of North America’s core oil and gas inventory will have implications for global energy markets, especially the U.S. ability to meet global demand, Enverus’ report says.

“North America’s dominance in supplying global oil demand growth is waning,” Alex Ljubojevic, director at EIR, said in a statement.

“Over the next decade, its contribution to consumption growth is expected to fall below 50% — a stark contrast to the previous 10 years when it supplied more than 100%,” Ljubojevic added.

Still, the Permian basin in West Texas and New Mexico and the Canadian oil sands are and will continue to be North America’s lowest-cost sources of scalable oil supply, Enverus reckons.

The oil sands would benefit from strong Western Canadian Select (WCS) prices and sunk infrastructure costs, and additional takeaway infrastructure capacity could unlock significant upsides to the estimates of Canadian oil production growth. Currently, Enverus expects Canada’s oil output to rise by 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, up from an expected record-high for 2025.

The U.S. shale patch, however, will have to contend with flatter growth curves going forward amid oil prices close to current breakevens and depleting core inventory, which will make companies change investment strategies.

“As core shale oil inventory in the U.S. depletes, the industry is entering a new era of higher costs and more complex development. This shift will reshape the cost curve and redefine investment strategies across the continent,” Enverus’ Ljubojevic said.

U.S. Shale Slows Drilling

Amid lower oil prices this year, the U.S. shale patch is in a wait-and-see mode, expecting to ride the price decline with minimal tweaks to strategies. U.S. oil producers are trimming capital expenditure budgets, relying on efficiency gains from current drilling activity to keep output levels.

American oil production is rising, due to the lag between oil price slides and drilling, but large shale producers are already calling the peak of oil output, despite the Trump Administration’s best efforts to support the fossil fuels industry.

For example, efficiency gains, as well as synergies from the Endeavor merger and lower service costs, allowed Diamondback Energy to reduce its 2025 capital budget by another $100 million, or about 3%, from the prior midpoint, to $3.4 - $3.6 billion.

“With volatility and uncertainty persisting, we see no compelling reason to increase activity this year,” CEO Kaes Van't Hof told shareholders in a letter in early August.

Since the Q1 letter to shareholders, Diamondback “Continue to believe that, at current oil prices, U.S. shale oil production has likely peaked and activity levels in the Lower 48 will remain depressed,” Van't Hof said.

Higher costs and continued uncertainty, including with U.S. trade policies, led to another decline in oil and gas activity in the Permian, executives from producers and services firms said in the latest Dallas Fed Energy Survey published this week.

In the survey, most executives, 57%, estimate that regulatory changes since the Trump Administration took over in January 2025 have reduced their firms’ breakeven costs for new wells by less than $1 per barrel. An additional 25% estimate reductions between $1 and $1.99 per barrel, while none of the large E&P firms have seen more than $5 per barrel cost reduction, according to the executives polled.

Moreover, most executives report they have delayed investment decisions in response to heightened uncertainty about the price of oil and/or the cost of producing oil, the survey showed.

“The administration is pushing for $40 per barrel crude oil, and with tariffs on foreign tubular goods, [input] prices are up, and drilling is going to disappear. The oil industry is once again going to lose valuable employees,” one E&P executive commented to the survey.

Another one outright blamed both the previous and current administrations for breaking the U.S. shale business.

“What was once the world’s most dynamic energy engine has been gutted by political hostility and economic ignorance,” the executive said.

The previous administration vilified the industry and cheered when Wall Street walked away from shale, they added, but noted that “Now the current administration is finishing the job.”

“Guided by a U.S. Department of Energy that tells them what they want to hear instead of hard facts, they operate with little understanding of shale economics,” the executive said.

“Instead of supporting domestic production, they’ve effectively aligned with OPEC—using supply tactics to push prices below economic thresholds, kneecapping U.S. producers in the process.”

The shale patch consolidation has been fueled by the collapse of capital availability. This consolidation, in turn, is pushing out independents and entrepreneurs who once defined the shale revolution, according to the executive.

“In their place, a handful of giants now dominate but at the cost of enormous job loss and the destruction of the innovative, risk-taking culture that made the U.S. shale industry great.”

The study, “PFAS Destruction by a Hazardous Waste Incinerator: Testing Results,” and its findings were published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development. Testing was conducted in collaboration with officials from the EPA and U.S. Department of Defense at a Clean Harbors facility in November 2024, and protocols for the test were an extension of previous testing conducted in 2021 and 2022 using EPA standards.

“In recent years, scientific evidence has repeatedly proven the adverse health effects of many of these PFAS chemicals. The EPA and other federal and state regulatory authorities have begun establishing frameworks to protect human health from the impacts of these compounds,” says Mike Battles, co-CEO of Clean Harbors. “We partnered directly with the EPA for our recent testing to ensure that we not only met their latest standards but gathered the most comprehensive data to help regulators develop effective new regulations for PFAS and protect the country from its health impacts.”

Researchers sought to demonstrate that high-temperature combustion (2,000-2,200 F) safely and effectively could destruct PFAS compounds while simultaneously testing for the EPA’s new OTM-50 and 0010 emission standards. They conducted sampling and analysis for key PFAS compounds, as well as any residual volatile or semivolatile elements. Data reviewed the incinerator’s process waste feed streams, solid and liquid process residue streams and stack gases.

Key findings include:

most PFAS (99.999 percent) were destroyed completely or mineralized;

no products of incomplete destruction were observed;

upon C2F6 injection, no C2F6 was measured in the stack; and

destruction efficiencies surpassed 99.99 percent.

“These study results further validate that we can safely and thoroughly destroy a wide variety of PFAS compounds in our high-temperature RCRA-permitted hazardous waste incinerators,” says Eric Gerstenberg, co-CEO of Clean Harbors. “We have always been confident in the capabilities of our facilities as it relates to PFAS compounds. There has been misinformation around incineration and whether it is safe to destroy PFAS. We excelled using both OTM-50 and 0010: the EPA’s strictest and newest testing standards for PFAS. We are the only company to have achieved that designation. Most importantly, we demonstrated with certainty that we can effectively eliminate the threat from forever chemicals in its multiple forms and at commercial scale with consistent outcomes.”

Deer Poacher Convicted – Genesee and Wyoming Counties

On July 14, a Wyoming County man pleaded guilty and paid a penalty for numerous deer poaching incidents in Genesee and Wyoming counties, ending a nearly two-year ECO investigation.

ECO Fuerch responded to a complaint in September 2023 of a headless deer in a field in the town of Bethany, Genesee County. The complainants reported that the deer was shot between 9:30 p.m. and 6 a.m. Officer Fuerch responded to the location and observed the large, headless deer approximately 100 yards off the road with a small-caliber bullet hole in its carcass.

ECOs investigated and identified Tyler D. Jennings, 29, of Attica, as a subject. With search warrants and evidence analysis, ECOs obtained time- and date-stamped photos and text messages confirming the illegal take of 15 antlered deer, mainly large bucks, dating back to 2019. ECOs also discovered the subject shot a large buck out of season in September 2023 and tagged it with an expired 2018 tag, trespassed regularly to take deer illegally, and unlawfully shared antlered-deer tags.

On Feb. 27, 2025, Jennings was arrested and charged with four counts of illegally taking wildlife (misdemeanor), two counts of taking big game after legal hours (misdemeanor), one count of taking deer over the limit (misdemeanor), and nine counts of criminal mischief in the third degree (felony).

DEC worked with the Wyoming County District Attorney’s Office and in July, the subject pleaded guilty and was required to pay $6,000 in fines and $750 in court surcharges. DEC also revoked Jennings’ hunting privileges for five years.

Nothing but Net – Suffolk County

On Sept. 16, ECO Francis responded to a call about a deer stuck in a soccer net on a residential lawn in the town of Islip. Officer Francis arrived at the location and observed the deer with several feet of net wrapped around one antler. The deer’s other antler was broken off near the base from the deer trying to free itself. ECO Francis managed to cut some of the netting away without getting too close, but needed assistance from the homeowner and a neighbor to use a tarp to hold the animal still while they cut the remaining netting away. The buck took a moment to recover before running off down the street.

I’ve saved thousands on gas and maintenance, my commutes are smoother and faster and I’m doing my part to cut air pollution in my community.

Going electric is no longer a novel luxury. Simply put, it’s a smart investment in more affordable transportation and a healthier future.

Unfortunately, buying an EV is about to get more expensive. Why? Because Congressman Mark Amodei and MAGA Republicans jammed through their “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a law that strips away $7,500 in federal tax credits for Nevada families that choose to drive electric. That means Nevadans will pay more while fossil fuel corporations keep cashing in.

Families are already struggling with rising grocery prices, housing expenses and energy costs.

Those EV savings aren’t pocket change; they’re thousands of dollars each year that can make or break a working household. Right now, with gas prices in Nevada averaging about $3.92 per gallon, a typical family driving 15,000 miles a year in a gas-powered car spends more than $2,300 on fuel annually. Using Nevada’s average electricity rate of $0.13 per kilowatt hour, that same family in an EV would spend only about $585 charging at home. That’s a savings of roughly $1,700–$1,800 every year, plus another $500 annually in lower maintenance costs, since EVs don’t need oil changes or costly transmission work.

Put it all together, and families in Nevada can save around $2,200–$2,300 a year by driving electric.

Beyond family budgets, more EVs on the road mean cleaner air, fewer asthma attacks and lower risks of heart and lung disease, especially in working-class communities that often bear the brunt of air pollution.

When I think of Nevada’s progress, I see charging stations popping up along our highways and in our towns, making road trips stress-free. I see 21,000 new clean energy jobs statewide created by former President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, more than half of which were created right here in Mark Amodei’s district. That’s thousands of Nevadans building our clean energy future, billions of dollars in investment, and thousands of dollars in family savings that Amodei voted to put on the chopping block. Instead of protecting the health and livelihoods of his constituents,

Amodei chose to side with Big Oil and against Nevada workers.

Nevada should be leading the nation in EV adoption, clean energy production, and homegrown jobs. Instead, we’re racing against the clock before these savings expire at the end of the month.

My advice: take advantage of these credits while they last and remember who’s taking them away.

This Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement lasts in perpetuity and has been credited for accelerating North Carolina’s transition from tobacco toward tech.

Today, one North Carolina town is trying to draw a similar parallel between a corporation’s long-running policies and alleged damages the town has incurred. Carrboro in Orange County has sued Duke Energy for what it claims was a knowing effort to deceive the public about the threat of climate change. It is the first time a municipality has sued its local electricity utility for this reason, the town and company both believe.

Carrboro says it is poised to face higher future climate-related costs, from road repairs, to stormwater protections, to cooling public buildings on increasingly hot days. It believes Duke Energy should help pay.

The two sides met in N.C. Business Court for the first time Thursday to debate Duke’s motion to dismiss the case. Several legal concepts were discussed over the five-plus-hour hearing, but a key one revolved around whether Duke Energy could be treated like a tobacco company in the 1990s. Duke’s lawyers, obviously, said no and contended the contrast lay in the link between alleged actions and damages.

“The difference in tobacco cases was saying Lucky Strike ... told me that tobacco wouldn’t kill me or give me cancer or wouldn’t cause these problems. I then went out, I bought cigarettes, I smoked. I kept smoking a cigarette. Now I have cancer,” Hunter Bruton of the law firm Smith Anderson said. “So, you can trace it right back. There’s never a, Philip Morris lied to the public about the dangers of cigarettes, and then that caused somebody else to smoke cigarettes, and then that person was smoking cigarettes and caused us municipal harm because it smells bad in Carrboro.”

In a May filing, Carrboro compared Duke’s alleged climate change deception to cigarette companies paying scientists to undermine the connection between tobacco use and cancer. And its lawyers fought Duke’s framing of the case as one that tries to regulate the emissions of an already state-regulated monopoly.

Even a highly regulated company can be held liable for deception, attorney Matthew Quinn argued. “We’ve seen that in the various climate cases throughout the country,” he said. “We’ve also seen that in American jurisprudence, from the tobacco litigation, (methyl tertiary butyl ether) litigation, opioid litigation.”

Carrboro wants to make its case before a jury. Duke wants it to go away immediately. A judge will decide what happens next.

Who wants to talk about H-1B visas?

H-1B work visas are a sensitive topic. I’ve spoken to one major corporation who would only discuss their usage on background. And this week, a retail chain asked me if its name could be removed from an article on how the state’s largest employers use or don’t use the popular program, which pairs educated foreign workers with U.S. employers big and small. (We didn’t remove it.)

I’ve gotten few personal threats as a journalist, but one was in my inbox after we published a series a few years ago on H-1B workers in the Triangle and their families.

The H-1B debate reemerged last Friday when President Donald Trump ordered employers to pay a $100,000 fee on all future visa applications. Smaller companies in the Triangle said the price was a nonstarter. Larger companies either said they needed more time to understand the policy — which is likely to be challenged in court — or they said nothing at all.

North Carolina schools use H-1B visas to fill teacher vacancies, with some telling my colleague T. Keung Hui they will need a fee exemption or face greater staff shortages. Most H-1B visas go to the tech sector, not education, making the issue particularly relevant to the Triangle. We’ve put together a list of which North Carolina companies hire the most H-1B workers, though the data comes with a huge caveat, which you can read about in that story.

While you’re here, I encourage you to click on some of my past H-1B reporting. There are weird classified job ads that exploit green card loopholes and local visa workers who considered moving to Canada, only to see that country also become less welcoming.

What’s it like to be the spouse of an H-1B worker? What’s it like for their children? And why did IBM begin ‘scaling back’ its use of these visas long before Trump retook office?

This practice, known as solar grazing, helps lower emissions and costs while allowing farmland to serve multiple purposes.

The Hornet Solar project is one of the largest in the U.S. and hopes to serve as an example for large-scale solar grazing.

TULIA, Texas — Off of a dirt road near Tulia, Texas, a solar farm four times larger than New York City's Central Park soaks up the sun. Beneath its panels, more than 2,000 sheep and 11 dogs maintain the land.

These four-legged employees are solar grazing, a practice of using livestock, typically sheep, as natural mowers. Vesper Energy, based in Dallas, unveiled the Hornet Solar project in April 2025 as one of the largest operations in the U.S. It is now hoping to also encourage the practice of solar grazing on a large scale.

""This is our first time to do it, and it's been really interesting to see how it's working,"" said Rick Knauth, head of asset management at Vesper Energy. ""It's been a really good experience here. Everyone's happy.""

What is solar grazing?

Solar grazing is the practice of using livestock, typically sheep, as a natural mowing service at solar farms. Knauth added that the sheep are used to help keep vegetation low at Hornet Solar. The hope is to eventually go fully solar grazing, not needing the mechanical mowers that can sometimes damage equipment.

""That doesn't happen with sheep, which is another nice benefit,"" Knauth said. ""The way it is panning out here, it is cheaper, it is working fine, and there's been no negative feedback.""

Solar grazing also helps lower emissions and costs, and allows farmland to serve multiple purposes. The sheep’s wool and meat can be harvested, further helping agricultural industries, according to the American Solar Grazing Association.

“Farm incomes are down, and solar grazing allows farmers to increase and diversify revenues without taking land out of food production,” stated the American Solar Grazing Association’s website. “Sheep are naturally suited to the job of solar grazing. They enjoy the shade of the solar panels on hot days, napping and grazing where humans would struggle to reach.”

Hornet Solar, Vesper Energy aim to continue growth in power and sheep

With more than 1.36 million photovoltaic modules covering 3,900 acres and a capacity of 600 MWac, Hornet Solar has the largest capacity in Texas, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. It is the second largest in the U.S. as of September 2025, following Gemini Solar Hybrid’s 690 MW capacity in Clark, Nevada, according to cleanview.co.

With this size, the Hornet Solar flock has room for expansion. As of Sept. 23, the flock has 2,275 ewes and 244 lambs. It expects an additional 550 lambs to be born in the second week of October, and will continue to grow as rams are brought in for the fall breeding season.

Hornet Solar’s flock also has 11 guardian dogs, led by Buck. The two newest dogs in the pack are named after the project, Vesper and Solar. The guardians include Great Pyrenees, Anatolian Shepherd and Akbash breeds and mixes.

“(Buck) is a sweet dog that will approach anyone who visits the sheep,” Vesper Energy stated in a fact sheet. “Yet, he won't put up with coyotes or other predators that get near his sheep. Thousands of years of selective breeding have instilled an inherent desire to protect sheep.”

With the massive scope of this project, and the usage of solar grazing, Knauth hopes this becomes an example for others.

""I'm hoping, by how well we're doing and how it's just working out in a really uncomplicated fashion, that this could serve as an example for others who are thinking about it,"" Knauth said. ""We're serving as sort of a proving ground for large scale sheep operations.""

Ben Inskeep is with the consumer and environmental advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition. He said it's a big change from NIPSCO's plans seven years ago.

Elimination of buyer incentives combined with regulatory uncertainty is expected to slow domestic electric vehicle adoption as the technology advances in other global markets, a forecasting model has found.

This is according to consulting firm EY’s September 2025 “EY Mobility Lens Forecaster,” an AI-powered modeling tool developed to predict electric vehicle adoption timelines in the key U.S., China and EU markets through 2050.

For the U.S. market, EY’s forecaster projects EV adoption will begin to slow with the elimination of the federal EV tax credit on Sept. 30, as well as from tariffs and other legislative uncertainty surrounding the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which was approved by Congress in July.

The company’s forecasting model, which it launched in 2021, uses neural networks and other macroeconomic variables to evaluate long-term global consumer behavior, regulatory trends, the rollout of advanced vehicle technology and OEM strategies to predict how EV adoption might accelerate in the three global markets through 2050.

In addition, factors such as escalating trade tensions, rare earth shortages are expected to further slow EV adoption in the U.S. to a more moderate pace year over year, from 7.3% in 2024, to under 2% annually each year through 2030. EVs are projected to account for only 11% of all U.S. light vehicle sales by 2029 as a result of “policy roadblocks,” according to EY’s data. Still, EVs are on track to reach 32% of U.S. light vehicle sales by 2035.

Although the EY forecaster predicts a short-term spike in U.S. EV sales in Q3 as buyers rush to take advantage of the EV tax credit of up to $7,500, the timeline to reach 50% EV adoption won’t happen now until 2039 — five years later than previously forecast. But, sales of hybrid vehicles in the U.S. and EU markets will continue to grow.

“Hybrids will be the selection, and I think it will be the bridge to get us to full electrification,” said George Lenyo, EY Americas Automotive Leader, in an interview with Automotive Dive.

The hybrid vehicle segment in the U.S. is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, according to EY’s data. Despite an overall cooldown in the U.S. EV market, hybrid vehicles are expected to account for 34% of all passenger vehicles sold by 2034. Sales of hybrid vehicles are expected to climb to over 3 million units in the U.S. by next year, according to EY’s data.

“The near- to mid-term future will feature a diverse mix of powertrains, shaped by regulatory shifts, tariffs, and evolving consumer behavior,” said Constantin M. Gall, EY Global Aerospace, Defense & Mobility Leader, in the release. “What’s clear is that e-mobility will remain central to the future of transportation.”

OEMs adapt to a new tariff-fueled business environment

U.S. OEMs must also navigate a new tariff-fueled business environment, which extends to their global supply chains. But to help mitigate their impact, automakers are expected to boost their domestic sourcing for EVs, including battery manufacturing, according to EY.

EY’s data shows that U.S. automakers are currently absorbing tariff costs by holding prices steady and shifting their product mix towards higher-margin vehicles to offset inflationary pressures. But it’s unclear how long this strategy will work. Tariffs are likely to result in car shoppers seeing higher prices.

But U.S. automakers have historically been successful at adapting to changes in market conditions, according to Lenyo. He expects that the Big Three should will be able to weather any slowdowns in EV sales and grow their hybrid vehicle sales in the interim.

“The domestic OEMs are extremely resilient, I think they’re very good at figuring out a solution,” Lenyo said. “The advantage that these domestic U.S. automakers have is that ability to continue to balance the investment, balance the powertrain, keeping one foot in today, but an eye towards tomorrow,” he said.

Still, along with an anticipated slowdown of EV adoption, the rapid pace of innovation will continue, and automakers may face a loss of market share if they don’t keep up with the technological advancements of their competitors, including autonomous driving, advanced hybrid and EV battery chemistries, as well as the rollout of software-defined vehicles.

Policy changes will help boost EV sales in the EU, but not until after 2027

In Europe, the Mobility Lens Forecaster indicates that economic pressures, a reduction in incentives and weaker emissions penalties will slow EV adoption from now through 2027. But stricter emissions regulations combined with the launch of more affordable EVs are expected to result in a sales rebound after 2027.

EY forecasts that EVs will account for 50% of all vehicle sales in the EU by 2032. In the interim, hybrid and plug-in hybrids are also expected to serve as a bridge towards EV adoption like in the U.S., outselling fully electric models through 2030. By 2041, EVs are expected to reach a 95% market share in the EU as a result of more advanced low-cost batteries and reduced cost of ownership, according to EY.

China will remain a dominant force in EV adoption

But as the U.S. and EU fall behind in the global EV race, EY forecasts that China will remain a dominant force in EV growth over the next decade, even as the market share of China OEMs declines due to growing competition, which is what Tesla is currently facing.

“China’s got great technology,” said Lenyo. “They’ve got governmental policies that are supportive of EV, climate that is supportive of EV, and I think they’ve got a willing consumer.”

EY predicts that pure EVs will account for over 50% of China’s light vehicle sales by 2033, due to their lower costs compared to ICE vehicles, as well as strong government support.

“New energy vehicles” in China, a broader category that includes both EVs and plug-in hybrids, are expected to reach 50% of China’s car sales this year, and account for 90% of the country’s passenger vehicle sales by 2034, five years ahead of the projected 50% EV adoption rate in the U.S. EV adoption in China will continue to climb beyond that.

“By 2050, almost every car that will be sold [in China] will be a battery electric vehicle [BEV],” said Lenyo. EY’s data estimates that BEVs will account for nearly 96% of all passenger vehicle sales in China by then.

Despite the varied EV adoption timelines across the three key markets, the auto industry’s gradual pivot to electrification will continue over the long-term, according to Lenyo. This means that automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors, which currently rely on the sales of full-size ICE vehicles for a bulk of their profits today, must not lose sight of their long-term EV goals to remain competitive as the market continues to evolve.

Numbers were being shared that sounded almost too good to be true and, in many cases, were. Some offers circulating were roughly half the cost of more realistic market pricing, while others reflected the higher expense of incorporating greater levels of domestic content. That’s not a small difference. It’s a gap that can decide whether a project pencils out or falls apart.

The reality is that these ultra-low price points aren’t sustainable without heavy support from the Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credits. And come Jan. 1, 2026, compliance with Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions will be mandatory — making it even harder to deliver numbers that look appealing on a slide but collapse under the realities of compliance and delivery.

Pricing is only part of the story

Even if the numbers hold on paper, another challenge remains: Can suppliers actually deliver?

Building a solar manufacturing facility in the United States is far more complex than building in other countries. Permitting takes longer, public scrutiny is greater and, in many cases, the U.S. workforce is still developing the highly specialized skills required for high-volume solar manufacturing. These realities affect both cost and timing. At ES Foundry, we selected an existing building already rooted in the community. By repurposing space that was familiar to local stakeholders, we reduced permitting hurdles, reduced concerns about the unknown and signaled that we were committed to building alongside — not apart from — the community.

That’s why track record is critical. Announcing a multi-gigawatt factory is one thing; producing consistent, high-quality output is another. Developers, investors and offtakers should be asking how far along suppliers really are — and whether actual production matches press release announcements.

Questions that matter

Rather than focusing only on the lowest headline number, the industry should be asking whether the quoted price will hold as Section 45X incentives phase out and Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) compliance costs are factored in. The industry is beginning to recognize that not all U.S. manufacturers qualify for the 45X incentive, and that the ability to sustain low prices without this support is becoming a critical measure of viability. It’s also important to consider whether the supplier has a proven track record of delivering projects at scale and to look closely at how actual production compares to the volumes announced in press releases.

Finally, buyers should examine what contractual protections are in place if pricing shifts or compliance standards change, ensuring that projects remain both viable and bankable.

Balanced approach

The U.S. solar industry has a historic opportunity to build a competitive and resilient domestic supply chain, but chasing unsustainable pricing puts projects, investors and credibility at risk.

Realism doesn’t mean pessimism. It means acknowledging that higher levels of domestic content carry a premium, and that suppliers with real operating track records are worth more than those with just a press release.

If we commit to asking the right questions and structuring deals around numbers that reflect today’s realities, we’ll build projects and partnerships that stand the test of time.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/pexels-kindelmedia-9799712-1200x900.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 12:05:27.774957

You type a prompt, and your answer instantly, effortlessly appears. But the magic is an illusion. This one prompt uses roughly 10 times more energy than a standard search. Pull back the curtain, and you discover vast warehouses of computers with a voracious appetite for energy, water and raw minerals. New data centers are fueling a trillion-dollar industrial revolution. “This is the biggest infrastructure project in history.” All of this, quite literally, scars the earth. Right now, A.I.’s environmental impacts are growing, and the consequences are hitting home. “My car is gone.” “I’m OK. It’s OK.” “Everything’s gone.” Spruce Pine is like a secret. It’s a small, sleepy town in North Carolina. Very few people realize how crucial it is in the A.I. supply chain. I came here last fall as part of my work to map the hidden costs of artificial intelligence. I’ve been studying the impacts of A.I. for over a decade. I didn’t realize it, but I was about to see those costs up close and personal. But first, let me show you what I came to see. Below us is the world’s main source of high-purity quartz. As much as 90 percent of the world’s supply of this crucial mineral comes from this five-square-mile quarry. This is what it looks like before it’s mined. This is pegmatite that I picked up in Spruce Pine. It was formed in a rare deposit about 300 million years ago. So what has this ancient rock got to do with A.I.? First, the quartz from these rocks is shipped east to China and Taiwan. The purity and heat resistance make it essential in producing this. A semiconductor microchip. They perform the millions of calculations needed to run A.I. models. But to do this work, they demand vast amounts of power and water. Demand that is expected to dramatically increase in the next decade. “Well, we needed a building. We looked, basically, for factories that had been abandoned, but the —” Take Elon Musk’s company xAI, which boasts that it has built the world’s largest A.I. supercomputer, in South Memphis. Musk calls it Colossus. The local power grid couldn’t support its energy demands, so the company set up dozens of methane gas generators, releasing nitrogen oxides and formaldehyde into the air. This historically Black community was blindsided, and they’re calling for fines and an investigation. “Everyday people don’t get a deal, but Elon Musk does.” In Virginia, data centers already consume more than a quarter of the state’s total electricity. “People’s utility bills may double in the next seven to 10 years just to power data centers. Pollution is rising, and water supplies are being stretched thin.” Worldwide, data centers will soon be using as much energy as Japan and are predicted to match India’s energy usage by 2030. It’s like adding a whole new industrial nation onto the grid. But instead of limiting the environmental impacts, this is happening. “Stargate, put that name down in your books. A new American company that will invest $500 billion, at least, in A.I. infrastructure in the United States.” Just days after he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, President Trump announced plans to build sprawling A.I. data centers across the country. “The fact that we get to do this in the United States is, I think, wonderful. OpenAI’s new data center, code-named Project Ludicrous, is being built right now in Texas. It’s larger than Central Park. There are plans to construct at least 20 of these across the country. Now generative A.I. will compete with you, for power, water and land. It’s driving up electricity bills while releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. All of this comes at a cost. “We’re back with more breaking news on Hurricane Helene. Now a very powerful Category 4 storm.” Days after I visited, Hurricane Helene slammed into Spruce Pine. The deadliest U.S. hurricane since Katrina, it killed more than 200 people in the region. The plane that I’d flown in over the mines just a few days earlier, destroyed. The North Toe River, poisoned with sewage, oil, and mining runoff. People had lost everything. With all the focus on the rapid build-out of A.I. factories, what gets less attention are the real risks they pose to our environment. Of course, we can’t pin one hurricane on climate change, but the science is clear. The warming planet will produce more dangerous storms and in places that have never seen this level of severity, like Spruce Pine. This is the reality we face. Now, tech evangelists claim that A.I. will fix climate change in the future. But right now, A.I. is making the situation worse. None of this is inevitable. A.I. technologies could still benefit societies as a whole, or they could enrich a small cadre of interests. Washington has made its choice. It will be up to local communities to take up a grass-roots fight to protect their land, air and water. Because technological progress that isn’t sustainable isn’t really progress.

Buyers in the US looking to take advantage of the federal electric vehicle tax credit have one last weekend to hunt for a good deal.

Wording in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that killed the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set a hard Sept. 30 deadline for claiming the tax credit, but the IRS is giving buyers and automakers a break by allowing a “written binding contract” for the purchase of the vehicle to qualify for the credit in lieu of delivery of that vehicle by Sept. 30.

This weekend, automakers like GM (GM), Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA), and Rivian (RIVN) will try to entice Americans to go electric. Tesla even updated its website to say “order by September 30” and included a countdown clock on the site.

But despite traditional media and social sites’ ongoing coverage of the tax credit's expiration, it seems a huge percentage of Americans don’t understand how the credits work.

“While most shoppers have heard of the credit, a recent study from Cars.com shows only about a third really understand how it works,” Cars.com Detroit bureau chief Aaron Bragman said to Yahoo Finance.

“That’s important, because nearly 80% of car shoppers considering EVs say it factors into their decision to go electric, and almost half say they might speed up their plans before the deadline hits,” he added.

Here’s how the rules work.

To be eligible, the EVs need to be assembled in North America and must also prove battery materials and components do not originate from countries deemed foreign entities of concern (FEOC), which includes China, Russia, and North Korea. A full list of eligible vehicles is available on the fueleconomy.gov website.

Once that’s out of the way, there are price restrictions. For vehicles like coupes and sedans, the MSRP limit to get the tax credit is $55,000. For trucks and SUVs, the limit is $80,000.

Then, buyer income must be limited to $300,000 in adjusted gross income for joint filers or $150,000 for individual filers to qualify.

Finally, there is the lease exemption. Under the law, leasing EVs falls under the commercial EV credit of the law (known as the 45W credit for commercial clean vehicles), which doesn’t require North American assembly or income requirements.

Basically the rule says any taxpayer (and automaker) that leases a clean vehicle to customers is eligible to claim the commercial EV credit, meaning every foreign automaker from Kia (000270.KS) to Mercedes (MBGAF) qualifies, as well as very expensive EVs from any automaker.

Another part of the confusion is how the credit is paid out.

The past version of the federal EV tax credit only allowed the taxpayer to apply for a “credit” of $7,500 when filing their annual tax return. Now, for EV purchases purchased under the current law, dealers are able to deduct the amount at “point of sale,” meaning they can take the credit at the time of purchase and file with the IRS later. A similar scheme is in place with leases, with the $7,500 deducted from the buyer’s lease payments across the length of the contract immediately.

Buyers should also be on the lookout for any automaker incentives aimed at moving inventory.

“Some automakers and dealers are also offering their own discounts and financing deals, which can stack on top of the credit to bring prices down even more. And don’t forget—many states and cities offer their own incentives that will still be around even after the federal program ends,” Cars.com’s Bragman said.

Indeed, the state of New York offers a $2,000 “Drive Clean Rebate” for some vehicles, and California offers up to $7,000 in rebates for eligible buyers.

But buyers need to act now to “stack” dealer and local offers with the big federal tax credit.

“Time is running out for anyone thinking about buying or leasing an electric vehicle,” Bragman said, adding that if you want to get the federal EV tax credit savings, “Don’t wait.”

Utility-scale segment drives surge with 4.9 GW added; Texas, California, and Arizona each top 1 GW as residential storage doubles year-over-year

The U.S. energy storage sector posted its strongest quarter on record in Q2 2025, adding 5.6 GW of new capacity, according to the latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie. Most of that momentum came from the utility-scale segment, which logged 4.9 GW of installations, enough capacity to cover peak demand for 3.7 million homes.

Utility-scale storage dominates new capacity

Texas, California, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of large-scale storage last quarter, reflecting the steady role batteries now play in managing grid stress. The Southwest Power Pool (SPP) also showed renewed life, with Oklahoma bringing three projects online—the region’s first since 2022.

In the Southeast, vertically integrated utilities are leaning harder into storage, with Florida and Georgia receiving major forecast upgrades thanks to aggressive procurement activity.

“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP’s vice president of energy storage. He added that while regulatory uncertainty lingers, domestic manufacturing of grid batteries is scaling fast enough to meet 100% of U.S. demand in the years ahead.

Residential and CCI markets expand

The residential sector added 608 MW in Q2, more than doubling year-over-year and posting an 8% increase from Q1. Most growth came from California, Arizona, and Illinois, with higher-capacity systems gaining share as attachment rates climbed.

The commercial, community, and industrial (CCI) segment expanded modestly at 38 MW, led by California and New York, though Illinois also showed progress. Policy and cost hurdles continue to slow community storage uptake despite the growing need for neighborhood-scale solutions.

Headwinds on the horizon

Despite near-term growth, the report projects utility-scale storage could dip 10% year-over-year in 2027, largely due to uncertainty over pending Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations that will dictate eligible battery cell sourcing for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC).

“All segments of the storage market are feeling both opportunity and risk,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Residential storage is expected to outpace solar because of stronger policy resilience and consistent ITC access. But pricing pressure, FEOC rules, and sluggish community storage deployment could slow overall growth.”

Allison Weis, Wood Mackenzie’s global head of storage, noted that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act preserved the ITC, but compliance hurdles remain. “A rush to start construction under today’s regulatory certainty is boosting the near-term forecast. Projects that don’t meet milestones by the end of 2025 face real exposure to policy changes.”

Looking ahead

The report forecasts the U.S. market will reach 87.8 GW of cumulative storage by 2029, driven by utility and residential adoption. But headwinds could trim as much as 16.5 GW from the five-year outlook if supply shortages and permitting delays persist.",https://solarbuildermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/big-battery-storage-photo.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 12:05:39.590033

In the final version, it may barely make an appearance.

The draft rule to undo the endangerment finding leaned heavily on a new legal reading of the Clean Air Act asserting that EPA has no authority to regulate greenhouse gases for their effect on climate change. But EPA also floated an “alternative” rationale — one focused on science and drawn almost exclusively from a Department of Energy report that downplayed the risks and severity of climate change.

That report is now in limbo after DOE disbanded the so-called Climate Working Group that wrote it. The agency has come under fire — and a lawsuit — for the process that led to the establishment of the working group, which was staffed with five climate contrarians hand-picked by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

The legal uncertainty — and last week’s report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine calling climate change “beyond scientific dispute” — may be enough to convince EPA to drop its scientific argument altogether, some experts said. EPA gains little and risks much by wading into the choppy waters of climate science in its bid to overturn the 2009 finding that greenhouse gases harm human health.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t play much of a role at all in the final rule,” said Jody Freeman, director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School. “That would be smart. If they’re not smart and they leave it in there, they’re just inviting a court to say, ‘You ignored the overwhelming science, and under arbitrary and capricious review, you can’t.’”

Jeff Holmstead, a partner with Bracewell who led the EPA air office during the George W. Bush administration, agreed that EPA could drop the scientific rationale in the final rule. The agency, he said, could explain its decision by pointing to the public comments it received for the draft rule, many of which likely mention the National Academies report.

“One option they would have is just to say ‘we’ve gotten all these comments and we’ve been persuaded that climate change is a serious problem, but nevertheless, we don’t have authority to regulate CO2 emissions from vehicles … because it’s not the kind of pollution that Congress wanted us to deal with,’” Holmstead said.

EPA proposed the endangerment repeal in July and plans to finalize it in December. In the rush to get it across the finish line, even some conservative activists seem willing to scrap efforts to question scientific consensus as part of the rulemaking.

“The scientific establishment is locking arms,” Myron Ebell, who led President Donald Trump’s first-term EPA transition team, said, referring to the National Academies report. “And perhaps the right way to proceed is to just make it on the legal argument. To do it very quickly after the comment period is closed and the comments have been addressed, get it done fairly soon and get it into court.”

‘The report is not usable’

EPA’s proposed repeal of the endangerment finding references the DOE report 28 times to challenge the scientific consensus that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health by driving harmful warming.

Scientists have widely criticized the DOE report, which relies on cherry-picked data and misleading climate claims. Former Biden officials and environmental groups also say DOE violated laws governing how agencies seek advice and recommendations from outside experts, as well as skirted requirements to vet research used in policy decisions.

EPA’s proposed endangerment repeal states that the agency “reviewed and relied upon” a draft version of the DOE report dated May 27 — two months before it was issued publicly.

Rachel Cleetus, policy director for Union of Concerned Scientists, said that indicates both agencies violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act. UCS and the Environmental Defense Fund have sued DOE and EPA, asserting that DOE violated the act in setting up the working group and EPA in using it as the basis of a policy decision.

“What [EPA is] citing is a draft version of the report, so they clearly had access to the report well before it was sprung on the public,” Cleetus said. “What that means and how much they were involved — this is why we’re asking for release of documents and records, because they’re violating [the Federal Advisory Committee Act] in a lot of different ways.”

Wright dismantled the working group and argued in court filings that it made the lawsuit moot. Report author Judith Curry has since said DOE “really didn’t dot all the I’s and cross the T’s” to make the group official.

Last Thursday, a federal judge agreed that the DOE working group should have followed laws governing how agencies solicit advice from outside experts. Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts dismissed DOE’s claims that the Climate Working Group qualified for an exemption to federal advisory committee laws because it existed merely to “exchange facts or information.”

”No reasonable jury could find that these words, arranged as they are, do not constitute advice or recommendations for a renewed approach to climate policy,” Young, a Reagan appointee, wrote in his opinion.

Young declined the environmental groups’ request to bar EPA from using the DOE report in its final rule to repeal the endangerment finding. DOE has said the July report is a draft and that the public comment period — which ended on Sept. 2 — served as the legally required “peer review” for important scientific reports. But the department declined to answer inquiries from POLITICO’S E&E News about plans to respond to the nearly 350 submitted comments or whether a final report would ever be published.

“DOE determined that the draft report and the public comments it solicited achieved the purpose of the [Climate Working Group], namely to catalyze broader discussion about the certainties and uncertainties of current climate science,” said DOE spokesperson Andrea Woods. “We will continue to engage in the debate in favor of a more science-based and less ideological conversation around climate science.”

Chris Frey, who headed EPA’s research office during the Biden administration, said DOE’s missteps in producing the report would compromise any government action that relied upon it.

“If you don’t develop the report in a credible way, the report itself — regardless of whatever content is in it — is not credible,” he said. “So, from a federal science policy perspective, the report is not usable. EPA should not be using it to inform its rulemaking, because it does not meet the science policy requirements that EPA has held to.”

Freeman of Harvard said the National Academies report also makes it harder for EPA to rely on the DOE report. The Clean Air Act requires EPA to disclose findings and recommendations from the National Academies in its rulemakings.

The report — which the National Academies undertook in response to EPA’s proposal to repeal the endangerment finding — reaffirmed the 2009 finding that greenhouse gases harm human health.

The National Academies, a nonprofit institution created by Congress to provide the federal government with independent scientific advice, has a statutory role under the Clean Air Act. DOE’s Climate Working Group does not.

Ticking clock

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is racing the clock to finalize its endangerment finding repeal and defend it in court. Internal EPA notes and slides seen by E&E News show the agency has given itself less than two months to submit a final rule to the White House.

By repealing the 2009 finding — which underpins nearly all climate rules — the Trump administration hopes to prevent future administrations from regulating climate pollution.

That would require the Supreme Court to uphold the repeal with a sufficiently sweeping ruling, which could be two or three years away. EPA is under pressure to finalize a repeal quickly enough to ensure the Trump administration can oversee the repeal’s defense.

Tom Lorenzen, senior counsel at Crowell & Moring, said EPA could create legal problems for itself if it relies on scientific findings that haven’t been finalized for the endangerment finding repeal.

EPA’s draft repeal and supporting documents say virtually nothing about why it chose to lean so heavily on one scientific review by five scientists over the many syntheses and scientific assessment reports that have been published over the years by global climate science bodies and U.S. government researchers. If the “alternative rationale” survives in the final rule, EPA will have to “beef that up,” Lorenzen said.

The courts afford agencies broad deference on scientific matters if they explain their reasoning, he said. But a Supreme Court ruling deferring to EPA on the science wouldn’t prevent a future Democratic administration from reinstating the endangerment finding and regulations.

“It would be entitled to the same high level of deference for its scientific and technical conclusions that this administration is entitled to,” said Lorenzen. “So that is at best a backup argument for EPA if they don’t win the legal issue.”

Freeman said that having the embattled DOE report attached to EPA’s final rule repeal would “feed an impression that the court might have, which is that this agency is not operating on the level.”

The Internal Revenue Service has been slow in recent weeks to approve and pay federal tax credits for electric vehicles, according to auto dealers and industry analysts — creating confusion for car dealers and hindering EV sales less than a week before the tax break is slated to disappear.

The delays began in earnest in mid-September, according to accounts shared with CNBC from three dealers in different parts of the country. Auto analysts and two national trade associations also confirmed to CNBC dealership reports of delays.

The dealerships say it forces them into a tough choice: carry the cost to keep offering the credit, or pull back and risk losing vehicle sales.

""We're continuing to pay the tax credit, though with a lot of anxiety,"" said Jesse Lore, founder of Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, New Hampshire. ""We're out close to $100,000 right now.""

Most consumers access the tax break — worth up to $4,000 for used EVs and $7,500 for new EVs — as an upfront rebate at the point of sale. That rebate can serve as a full or partial down payment, or reduce a car's overall cost, for example.

Car dealers generally front that money to qualifying consumers after getting online approval from the IRS, and the agency then repays dealers.

Prior to mid-September, that entire process generally happened within a few days, dealers said.

Now, the IRS is taking an unusually long time to approve and pay EV tax credits, dealers said. They say they are unable to get in touch with the agency, and as a result are in limbo and without an idea of when — or if — they'll get those funds.

A White House official said in an e-mail that all valid EV tax credits applied for before the Sept. 30 deadline would be granted and paid out.

Robyn Capehart, an IRS spokesperson, wrote in an e-mail that ""any submissions through the Energy Credits Online portal have always been subject to IRS review and approval.""

""Once approved by the IRS, seller reports (also known as time of sale reports) support vehicle eligibility for the credit, even if that acceptance followed an IRS review period,"" Capehart wrote.

The White House and the IRS offered no explanation for the reported delays.

'We're in the dark'

Some dealerships have continued to issue the EV tax credit to qualifying buyers, hoping the federal government will pay them back later.

A dozen new applications Lore has submitted to the IRS since Sept. 15 are still listed as ""pending,"" he said. Three others were approved on Thursday. None have been paid yet. Lore showed screenshots of the transactions to CNBC.

Such a delay had previously rarely occurred since the tax break first became available as an upfront rebate, in January 2024, Lore said.

""We're in the dark,"" he said.

He also hasn't been able to provide customers with the time-of-sale report that they need to reconcile the tax credit on their annual tax return, Lore said.

EV tax credit delays come at 'worst possible time'

It's unclear why and to what extent delays are happening.

Some dealers speculated they may be tied to backlogs at the IRS due to reduced staffing and higher volume of EV sales. Others said they think it could be a purposeful move by the Trump administration in an effort to reduce EV sales.

Regardless, the roadblocks come at a bad time, dealers and analysts said.

Republicans ended the EV tax credit after Sept. 30 as part of the so-called ""big beautiful bill"" passed in July. The tax break was supposed to last through 2032.

Consumers have rushed to buy EVs before the tax break disappears, to secure the cars at a discounted price.

That helped push new and used EV sales to record highs in August, according to Cox Automotive data. September was expected to be another blockbuster month.

But some dealers have pulled back amid the uncertainty, unable to float big sums of cash to consumers.

""I know for a fact there are dealers saying, 'We're not doing it anymore. We're not getting paid,'"" Lore said. ""Others are saying [to consumers], 'We're holding the cars, and you can't drive the car home until we get paid in full.'""

Gary Pretzfeld, co-owner of AutoTrust USA in Miramar, Florida, said the IRS owes him about $80,000 to $90,000 in rebates that he has floated to EV buyers this month.

""There are definitely some dealers who can't afford to do it this way,"" Pretzfeld said.

Car dealerships are a ""really cash-intensive business,"" and payment delays threaten to tip dealers into a ""cash crunch"" at a time when they were expecting to sell huge volumes of EVs, said Scott Case, the CEO of Recurrent, an EV market research firm.

""It's a quiet, festering problem at the worst possible time,"" Case said.

The National Independent Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group that represents used car dealers, is aware of the issue, said spokesperson Richard Greene.

""The dealers and NIADA have engaged the IRS,"" Greene said in an e-mail. ""NIADA hopes the payments are processed by the IRS before the program's expiration.""

Amy Hunter Wright, a spokesperson for the National Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group, also said some members had experienced delays.

""Anecdotally, we have heard some dealers report that recent submissions have been placed in pending status since last week,"" she wrote in an e-mailed statement. ""NADA has been and continues to work with the IRS and the Department of Treasury regarding the portal and they have been cooperative.""

Why the upfront rebate is important to buyers

Of course, dealers aren't obligated to offer the tax credit as an upfront payment.

Consumers can still try to claim the tax break when they file their annual tax returns next year.

But the point-of-sale rebate has been a big draw for consumers, said Al Salas, CEO of Eco Auto, a dealer with operations in Massachusetts and Washington state, and which is expanding to Florida, Georgia and New Jersey.

It's a quiet, festering problem at the worst possible time.

Scott Case

CEO of Recurrent

Getting the tax break upfront reduces monthly payments for consumers who finance their purchase and reduces the total sales tax on the purchase, Salas said.

For example, a consumer who buys a used EV might pay $80 to $100 more per month on a five-year loan if they're unable to get the $4,000 tax credit upfront, Salas said.

The tax break is also harder for certain consumers to access at tax time. While the point-of-sale rebate is available to qualifying consumers regardless of their tax liability, that's not true for those who claim the tax break on their annual tax return: They must have a tax liability to claim even a partial credit.

The IRS has approved some applications Salas submitted last week, while others are pending.

""As dealers, it's a really unfortunate situation, because we are fronting the money,"" Salas said. ""And in a lot of ways, we're financing the consumer's ability to get a new vehicle.""

The IRS owes him about $50,000 of tax credits, Salas said. He expects the federal government to pay him back eventually.

So does Pretzfeld, the dealer based in Miramar, Florida.

Pretzfeld saw all EV sales submitted to the IRS for tax credit approval listed as ""pending"" starting around Sept. 15, he said.

One submitted Sept. 16 and one from Sept. 17 have been approved, and he's awaiting payment.

""The timeline is now longer, and it's murkier,"" Pretzfeld said. ""That's the part that's freaking everyone out.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108204125-1758828528395-gettyimages-1375785091-2p1a1672.jpeg?v=1758828547&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-09-26 12:04:28.430929

In a large, posh tent with clear plastic walls offering views of the surrounding high-plains sagebrush steppe, these leaders, their staff and a gaggle of media gathered for a reception a short drive away from the world’s premier nuclear energy testing ground.

“We’re standing here, not very far from where [Experimental Breeder Reactor II] proved out the fundamental technology that I believe is ultimately the future for humanity — for energy abundance, reliability and affordability,” Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of nuclear power plant developer Oklo, told the crowd. The success of 1960s-era EBR II was “one of the most phenomenal technological stories in human history and, frankly, one that’s radically under-told and underappreciated.”

After being pushed to the sidelines, nuclear energy technology is back in the spotlight, DeWitte noted. Today’s rush to feed power-hungry artificial intelligence and data computational centers has private investors and governments around the world pouring money into the next generation of nuclear energy, he said. That is already resulting in notable investments in Wyoming, including Bill Gate’s next-generation nuclear project in Kemmerer, but also raising questions about the potential for spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation in the Equality State.

Here at INL, Oklo and subcontractor Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co. will build and test the first Aurora Powerhouse — a liquid-sodium-cooled “fast reactor” generating up to 75 megawatts of electricity that backers hope to deploy around the world. Oklo’s nuclear reactor demonstration is among a dozen or so reactor and nuclear fuel tests in queue at INL that advance the industry’s technology and business models, according to INL officials. The lineup includes Radiant Industry’s “portable” Kaleidos microreactor, which the company proposes to mass-produce in Wyoming at a facility outside Bar Nunn.

Though Radiant’s proposal, along with another in Campbell County, has garnered significant opposition, Gov. Mark Gordon has joined with his counterparts in Idaho and Utah in a declaration of a unified effort to establish the tristate area as the epicenter of America’s nuclear energy resurgence.

“This is what an abundance mentality is all about,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said in his opening remarks at the Western Governors’ Association workshop at INL’s Idaho Falls campus later that day. “It’s not Utah versus Idaho versus Wyoming. We’re going to be much stronger if we’re working together, because we have some differences that are important and similarities that are important.”

Energy ‘superabundance’

As chairman of the WGA this year, Cox launched the Energy Superabundance: Unlocking Prosperity in the West initiative, which focuses on meeting skyrocketing electrical demand by bolstering nuclear energy. Nuclear power generation, Cox suggested, represents the most reliable form of electricity and a viable means of meeting increasing energy demand.

Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, Cox noted, already share infrastructure under utility Rocky Mountain Power, as well as a shared workforce and a similar “mindset” that’s attractive to the industry.

“I would love to have [Oklo] in Utah, and I can’t lie about that, but that’s good for all of us,” Cox said, adding that all three states are already on the industry’s radar.

The Department of Energy’s national laboratory in Idaho is an obvious draw, he noted. In addition to proposed nuclear microreactor manufacturing in Wyoming, TerraPower’s liquid-sodium-cooled “Natrium” nuclear power facility is expected to begin operations in 2030 outside Kemmerer. Rocky Mountain Power has tentatively agreed to take on the power plant and potentially partner with TerraPower to add more Natrium plants in Utah.

“I can just tell you, by signing that MOU together, it’s given this region much more interest from nuclear partners,” Cox said. “They’re seeing this as a game changer, and so they’re coming. I don’t care if they come to Wyoming or they come to Idaho or they come to Utah.”

The tristate initiative has the backing of the Trump administration, which has ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to speed up nuclear licensing and has directed the DOE to have 10 new “large reactors” under construction by 2030 with a goal of adding 300,000 megawatts of nuclear power to the grid by 2050. One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes.

Part of federal policy leaning toward nuclear energy began during the Biden administration, which named Wyoming and Idaho as part of a Tech Hub within the Intermountain-West Nuclear Energy Corridor.

Challenges

Despite enthusiasm among private industry and state and federal officials, there are significant challenges to implementing a nuclear resurgence in the region.

Several speakers at the WGA event noted that AI and data center developers favor new power generation facilities that are, in a regulatory sense, apart from the shared electrical grid, or “behind the meter.” That complicates the utility regulatory environment and rate structures. Also, the U.S. is still reliant on other nations for nuclear components and several aspects of the fuel supply chain, which will take years to provide domestically. Others noted that the Trump administration’s demands on federal agencies — like fast-tracking and licensing a massive buildout of nuclear power plants — are at odds with recent staff downsizing.

Industry leaders are also worried about a dearth of workers for jobs that require specific training and certifications.

“We know that we need a significantly expanded workforce for the modernization and expansion of the grid,” Deloitte Specialist Executive Bill Abolt said. The nation’s long lull in building nuclear energy has left the industry with skilled experts who are retiring and an empty “pipeline” to replace them, he added. “The people that built the last nuclear power plant didn’t just stick around and wait for the next one.”

Though states have made advancements in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education and training, nuclear fields have been a blind spot, several industry officials agreed.

“At some point, you need to figure out how to get Mike Rowe involved,” INL’s Innovation and Technology Manager Chris Lohse said, referring to the television personality who touts the nobility of skilled trades and “dirty” physical labor.

Yet perhaps the industry’s biggest challenge remains its image as a dangerous liability to human health and the environment — a legacy of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, perpetuated in cinema and The Simpsons. Though the WGA event was stacked with those who are certain of the safety of the industry, some noted that local opposition to things like wind farms extends to nuclear energy proposals.

In fact, many residents in Bar Nunn and Gillette — communities that have long supported heavy energy industries — are not convinced they want to welcome nuclear facilities. Campbell County commissioners recently drafted a resolution to solidify their interim stance on the potential for spent nuclear fuel waste storage until putting the question to a public vote in the 2026 election. Until there’s a vote, the commission would remain opposed to such proposals.

“There is a lot of time that’s being spent engaging with communities, local governments and people on the ground who may have been upset about a wind turbine,” National Association of State Energy Officials Chief of Staff Cassie Powers said. “There does need to be some real, honest public engagement to demystify investments in nuclear.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/inl-demonstration-of-microreactor-experiments-dome-dbleizeffer1758882424.jpeg?h=f1704810&itok=7DEUI4Lr,N,,2025-09-26 11:06:28.727833

CALIFORNIA TRYING TO KEEP OIL AND GAS FIRMS FROM LEAVING THE STATE

Newsom noted that about one-fourth of new vehicles sold in California are alternative-fueled, which is the highest share in the nation. He added that the state has 60 EV manufacturers and has created an ecosystem favorable for EVs, which he said helped facilitate the rise of Elon Musk's Tesla.

He also emphasized that California plans to continue to invest in EV infrastructure and renewable energy through its cap-and-trade program, which sets greenhouse gas emissions limits and has emitters purchase ""allowances"" – which are effectively permits to emit one ton of carbon dioxide equivalents – and sell excess allowances to companies that require offsets. The program's revenue from allowance auctions helps fund projects aimed at reducing emissions.

Through next December, the effort will support about 80 people cleaning up overlooked areas across 25 western North Carolina counties.

The Army Corps assigned much of North Carolina’s debris removal to AshBritt, a Florida-based company, with payment determined by volume of material.","Tractor trailer tires. Halloween candy wrappers. Sheet metal roofing. Ceramic dinner plates. Car parts. Shoes—a lot of shoes.

“I have a little trouble sometimes when I pick up the shoes,” admits Zack Davis as he rattles off the trash he’s been encountering in the Swannanoa River near Asheville, North Carolina. “Did those belong to somebody who was swept down the river, and did they make it out or not? It just leads the mind to wander on those things.”

Davis leads the Swannanoa River cleanup team for the Asheville-based conservation nonprofit MountainTrue. Although a year has passed since Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina—the storm made landfill in Florida on September 26, 2024, and tore through the Carolinas a day later—the region is still grappling with much of the physical and emotional wreckage left behind. That’s especially true along the Swannanoa and other waterways, which flooded to record levels and destroyed almost 1,000 homes.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is almost ready to declare its own cleanup complete. The US Army Corps of Engineers and its contractors, responsible for federally funded debris removal in North Carolina’s waterways, estimate they’ve completed 99 percent of their work, having hauled off nearly 6.6 million cubic yards of material. Yet while those efforts cleared major rivers like the French Broad, many smaller tributaries, creeks, and streams—critical for both the environment and the region’s outdoor recreation industry—weren’t part of the mission.

As federal officials step out, Davis and his colleagues are stepping up. With the support of $10 million from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, MountainTrue has launched a new initiative to restore local waterways. Through next December, the effort will support about 80 people cleaning up overlooked areas across 25 western North Carolina counties.

Key to MountainTrue’s approach, says Jon Stamper, is harnessing local knowledge and ecological concern. A longtime outdoor guide who ran an outfitter before Helene, he’s now the nonprofit’s river cleanup operations manager. Many of those he’s hired, including Davis, are fellow rafting or fishing guides who lost their livelihoods due to the storm. (Full-time cleanup crew members receive a minimum hourly rate of $22.50 plus benefits, close to the living wage for Asheville calculated by the nonprofit Living Wage Institute.)

His team’s deep experience has helped Stamper prioritize cleanups around areas previously used for fishing and kayaking in an effort to get the outdoor recreation industry restarted more quickly. And as the effort moves into less accessible places, he says, former guides are well-suited to treating vulnerable ecosystems with an appropriately light touch.

“We are a scalpel, where [the Army Corps] might have been a chainsaw. We are on the ground, walking in the rivers, hand-picking all this to bring in trash.”

He recalls one instance where a crew encountered an intractable nest of black PVC irrigation line tangled around trees on a river island. Where less skilled contractors may have brought in an excavator and uprooted the whole mess, trees and all, the MountainTrue team used swift-water rescue techniques to set up a kayak relay system with pulleys. Workers could then cut away the plastic and send it to the riverbank by boat while saving the vegetation.

“We are a scalpel, where [the Army Corps] might have been a chainsaw. We are on the ground, walking in the rivers, hand-picking all this to bring in trash,” Stamper explains. “Our main goal here is to approach this in an ecologically sound way, to protect the rivers and not create any more damage.”

Stamper and his colleagues say they’re particularly careful about how they work given the issues they observed with the federal cleanup. The Army Corps assigned much of North Carolina’s debris removal to AshBritt, a Florida-based company, with payment determined by volume of material. That arrangement incentivized the contractor to harvest live trees and other plants from riverbanks, along with fallen logs and other organic debris that would’ve decomposed naturally and created wildlife habitat.

Will Harlan, the Asheville-based Southeast director and senior scientist with the national nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, says that the contractors’ practices also damaged rare species such as the federally endangered Appalachian elktoe mussel. He recalls standing in front of heavy machinery in the French Broad River on Memorial Day to stop workers from smashing one of the state’s biggest populations of hellbender salamanders.

“The hellbenders and mussels hung on through Helene. They’ve been living with floods and extreme weather for millions of years, and they know how to withstand even catastrophic events,” says Harlan, who isn’t affiliated with the MountainTrue cleanup. “What they can’t survive are bulldozers, backhoes, and dump trucks going up and down rivers that are being used as highways 30 times a day, crushing all the animals and habitat in their path. You can’t adapt to that.”

That Memorial Day showdown sparked a meeting between concerned residents and Chuck Edwards, the area’s representative in Congress. The Republican subsequently called the debris removal “improper” and demanded greater federal oversight.

Asked for comment on these criticisms, Army Corps spokesperson Nikki Nobles thanked residents for holding workers accountable and outlined a dedication to protecting the environment.

“Debris removal missions are often challenging due to the large quantities and various types of debris that storms can leave behind, as well as the vast geographic areas where cleanup can be needed, but USACE, operating under FEMA’s Public Assistance Program guidelines, is committed to conducting our debris removal missions within strict environmental safeguards,” Nobles wrote in a statement. “Our contractors are trained and required to minimize disturbances to streambeds, avoid reshaping natural waterway contours, and follow best management practices to prevent harm to wildlife.”

Federal contractors, Harlan adds, often didn’t consult with local landowners before starting their work. To avoid those tensions, the MountainTrue effort is putting in extensive groundwork to connect with residents and gain access to cleanup sites.

“Imagine your friend comes over and offers to mow your lawn. There’s just a weight lifted off your shoulders. But then imagine that tenfold, where somebody offers to clean all this trash from your devastated home. Maybe it feels a little better in your backyard. It gives you a little more hope.”

Cleanup team leader Donovan Green, for example, started attending meetings in the small community of Bat Cave weeks before putting her boots in the water. Although the area had become a target for online misinformation about storm response in the weeks following Helene, she says she was warmly welcomed after shaking hands in person and sharing her desire to help.

“They’ve already treated us like community, like family,” she says. “The very first day my team was out here, the sheriff and the chief of the fire department came over and said, ‘Hey, we have this homemade peach cobbler for y’all—please eat it!’”

Picking up trash supports the environment, Green continues, but it’s also a deeply meaningful gesture for people who are still rebuilding their lives. In some cases, crews can find personal items that victims of Helene thought were gone forever, like a pig-faced molcajete stone bowl Green recently reunited with a family who lost their house to floodwaters. In others, simply clearing clutter can be the support someone needs to carry on.

“Imagine your friend comes over and offers to mow your lawn. There’s just a weight lifted off your shoulders,” Green says. “But then imagine that tenfold, where somebody offers to clean all this trash from your devastated home.

Renewables already supply over 30 percent of global electricity, a record high, and that momentum will only grow. Investment in renewables reached over 700 billion dollars in 2024, record investment for over 20 years.

Yet the untapped potential is even greater. EMBER estimates 92 percent of countries have renewable potential, more than ten times their current demand.

As Kenya’s President H.E. Dr. William Ruto said at the UN Climate Summit: “... endless debate continues over fossil fuel reserves, while our immense endowments in sunlight, wind and geothermal lies underutilised...”

This momentum shows that markets and industry are delivering, but the market alone will not deliver the acceleration needed. governments must now accelerate action to match. This means governments must:

Publish renewable energy plans with specific technology targets that set clear pathways for solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower and storage, aligned with the tripling agenda.

Remove the barriers that hold back deployment, including slow planning and permitting, underinvestment in transmission, and bottlenecks in grid connection.

Maintain policy certainty and investment security by embedding renewable goals into national strategies, avoiding sudden policy changes, and providing stable frameworks for investors.

Scale finance in emerging and developing economies. 89 percent of 2035 NDCs are conditional on finance or technical assistance. Lowering the cost of capital, scaling public investment and unlocking blended finance are essential.

Plan for a future proof energy system by prioritising implementation of the COP29 Grids and Storage Pledge, making these solutions central to national energy strategies, so renewable energy targets translate into real-world delivery.

Advance action on fossil fuel phase-out, with an honest dialogue at COP to accelerate the shift.

Renewables are already the cheapest power in almost every market, driving 10 percent of global GDP growth last year and shielding consumers from fossil fuel volatility and trade insecurity. The Global Renewables Summit held this week in New York showed how governments and industry are ready to work together to scale solutions.

Claims that renewables are unreliable and uneconomic are a denial of reality, aimed solely at stalling progress. In 2024, renewables accounted for more than 90 percent of new power capacity worldwide, cutting fossil fuel costs by 460 billion dollars. The facts are clear: renewables are powering economies, creating jobs, and delivering energy security.

The task now is to turn commitments into delivery, bridge the 1.5°C gap, and ensure that renewables are scaled fairly across all regions whilst phasing out fossil fuels.

GWEC welcomed the endorsement of renewable energy demonstrated at the United Nations this week, calling on governments to ignore the noise and focus on the facts:

Wind energy delivers more than 1.1TWh of electricity – equivalent to more than 500 million homes - and is responsible for 1.5m jobs around the world.

Wind turbines are generating clean and secure renewable energy in 124 countries, and countries are delivering new plans, policies and action to install new capacity.

Renewable energy, with wind at its core, is now recognised not only as a climate necessity, but as the foundation of energy security and economic growth.

Last year, over 90 percent of newly added renewable power capacity was cheaper than new fossil fuel alternatives, with onshore wind leading the way - costing less than half the price of the lowest-cost fossil option.

“The renewables sector welcomes the recognition of renewable energy’s crucial role in the future global economy” said Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council and Chair of the Global Renewables Alliance. “NDCs are much more than climate plans, they are a roadmap for delivering clean jobs, reinvigorated economies and shared global growth. As the energy transition continues to gain momentum, the noise from those that aim to slow global progress must not deter those working for a cleaner, fairer future. These roadmaps must now be backed up with concrete measures to deliver, so that countries and communities can realise the enormous benefits of renewable energy.”

The world will now turn its attention to COP30 in Belem, Brazil.

Despite My Misgivings, the EV Tax Credit Was a Win To be honest, EV tech was probably not ready for the hype, and that’s why, over the last few years, the cracks started to show.
Still, the EV tax credit was a powerful tool—and it worked.
The End of the Credit Should Bring a Focus on Research So, where does this leave us when the EV tax credit ends on the 30th?
For now, let’s pour one out for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit in its final hours.","The end of the $7,500 federal electric car tax credit on Sept. 30 arrives with strong emotions from many people. Whether it’s the defeated lawmakers and clean energy advocates who worked tirelessly to push the legislation through, or—on the other end of the spectrum—relieved rural car dealerships that have struggled to sell EVs, and are hoping they’ll now be gone for good.

For me, my career switch to journalism coincided with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which introduced the credit. EVs were my first beat, and what a thrill it was to cover the palpable excitement across the country. That year, Ford boldly electrified the Ford F-150 pickup, a classic symbol of American manufacturing might, now with faster acceleration but no V8 engine to rev. Amazon’s first Rivian delivery vans hit the road with funky headlights, and Sony and Honda joined forces in an unusual partnership to develop an EV in which you could watch movies and play video games.

I was spending my weekends driving the $130,000 Mercedes AMG EV, interviewing kids in rural New York state about their electric school bus, and doing donuts in a Ford Mustang Mach-E in a helmet and harness. It was a brave new world—but it didn't last.

Despite My Misgivings, the EV Tax Credit Was a Win

To be honest, EV tech was probably not ready for the hype, and that’s why, over the last few years, the cracks started to show. I had my own concerns about range, particularly in the cold Chicago weather where I lived. Living in a rented apartment, I had limited access to charging options. As I attended car shows and got drinks with auto executives, I privately felt the whole industry was catering to wealthy, single-family homeowners while ignoring large swaths of the population like me, whose lifestyles made buying and operating an EV downright difficult.

Still, the EV tax credit was a powerful tool—and it worked. (And no, not just wealthy people cashed in on the credit, because it had buyer income caps. And while we're in parentheses, let's not forget there are many oil and gas subsidies that are more costly to taxpayers than the EV credit.)

There are no articles I could write that could replace the first-hand experience of zipping down a highway in a swanky electric car with ultra-fast acceleration, a near-silent cabin, and a steering wheel that turns like butter. They are clearly an upgrade, but you have to experience it for yourself. Now, many people have, in large part, thanks to the credit. August 2025 saw record EV sales, at 10% of new cars sold, a massive jump from 3.2% in 2021.

In my view, the tax credit was supposed to help get people to love EVs, while in the background, prices would naturally come down and range would go up, making them more appealing on their own—no federal assistance necessary. The range did go up, so that part is working.

But the EV prices remain stubbornly high. It’s hard to win an argument with an EV skeptic, or a presidential administration hellbent on destroying a so-called ""EV mandate,"" with such a high up-front purchasing price. (The high-profile articles of rare EV fires also don’t help, but that would require a whole other op-ed.)

To Solve EV Adoption, We Need to Solve Battery Tech

Why do EVs cost so much? The battery. Why do we charge EVs? Their batteries. When you talk about anything related to EVs, it's all about the battery. Otherwise, they are mostly the same as any other car, with four wheels and a steering wheel (OK, and also some weird Elon Musk goodies, if you have a Tesla).

There have been rumors of lithium prices coming down and cheaper models hitting dealerships, but that's not what I see. My list of EVs under $40,000 got smaller every year after I first wrote it in 2022. Batteries remained too expensive, and car companies got sick of bleeding money, leading to the end of affordable models like the Chevy Bolt. They want a sustainable, more profitable business model. Who can blame them?

The US hasn't yet solved the battery affordability problem, and has watched helplessly as China has. Our biggest rival has become an automotive powerhouse over the past few years, with mega-brands like BYD, which makes the $9,700 Seagull and the $16,000 Dolphin with a 260-mile range, as Electrek reports. No EV for sale in the US comes close to that low price.

This is why Ford CEO Jim Farley called China’s EV business “humbling.” The country’s manufacturing prowess, EV government subsidies, and worldwide control of the mines that crank out lithium and other critical battery minerals are almost impossible to compete with.

The End of the Credit Should Bring a Focus on Research

So, where does this leave us when the EV tax credit ends on the 30th? Will we be standing in a black void, condemned to a life of inhaling gas exhaust and reminiscing on the good old days when we invented the Model T? Adoption will likely slow, but not stop, as car companies kill less popular models, like the Acura ZDX and Nissan Ariya, both of which bit the dust this month, and don't replace them with new models.

Some states will maintain their own clean vehicle credits, which help offset the loss of the federal one to a smaller degree. The real legacy of the EV push will be the public's increasing openness to hybrids and plug-in hybrids, and automakers offering more of them, which we are certainly seeing.

It’s possible the next administration will institute another tax credit to get adoption back on track, but only more affordable, powerful batteries can cement EVs as a permanent fixture in America. We need a long-term tech solution.

A breakthrough battery that's cheaper, lighter, and more powerful would change the world, not just EVs. It would revolutionize warfare, home energy, and even cell phones. Batteries are the future of energy independence, and even Elon Musk knows it—even if he seems more interested in autonomous driving software than making new cars these days.

I’ve reported on incredible companies that received grants from the Biden Administration to develop futuristic silicon and lithium-sulfur batteries, which have double the range, with less weight, and use more abundant elements than lithium. I strongly believe we’ll see it in the market in about 7 years; they’re already testing with major automakers behind the scenes, but passing safety standards and getting to dealers is a long process. When they do arrive, they won't be cheap, like all new tech.

The biggest risk of the slowing EV momentum we face is the devaluation of this research and development. If that happens, it might become the real reason electric cars don't replace gas-powered cars in our lifetimes—not the end of the federal tax credit. “To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete,” as futurist Buckminster Fuller put it. It won't be easy, to say the least.

But that's a problem for another day. (Many days, really.) For now, let’s pour one out for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit in its final hours.

The latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor from the groups reports 5.6 GW of installations during the second quarter of 2025.
The groups said utility-scale energy storage had a record 4.9 GW of new installations in Q2.
“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP vice president of Energy Storage.
“After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC,” said Weis.","A new report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie shows the U.S. energy storage market set a record for quarterly growth in April through June of this year. The latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor from the groups reports 5.6 GW of installations during the second quarter of 2025.

The groups said utility-scale energy storage had a record 4.9 GW of new installations in Q2. The groups in a news release wrote, “While early adopters continue leading in deployment, activity across the country shows clear demand for utility-scale energy storage as a solution to rising electricity prices and soaring energy demand.”

The report said that states of Texas, California, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of energy storage. It noted that some markets, including the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), saw renewed activity. Three projects were brought online in Oklahoma, the first in that state in three years, while “Florida and Georgia saw major forecast upgrades due to aggressive procurements by vertically integrated utilities,” according to the report.

“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP vice president of Energy Storage. “Despite regulatory uncertainty, the drivers for energy storage are strong and the industry is on track to produce enough grid batteries in American factories to supply 100% of domestic demand. Energy storage will be essential to the expansion of the U.S. power grid and American energy production.”

Residential, CCI Markets Expand

The report said the residential storage market expanded by 608 MW in Q2, a 132% increase year-over-year, and an 8% jump quarter-over-quarter. The groups said that growth was led by California, Arizona, and Illinois, as attachment rates hit new highs and higher-capacity systems gained market share.

Community-scale, commercial and industrial (CCI) storage expanded 38 MW, an 11% year-over-year increase.

California and New York led quarterly CCI storage installations, accounting for more than 70% of total capacity. The report said, “Community storage deployment remained limited due to high costs and policy constraints.”

Resilient Market Despite Policy Uncertainty

The report said U.S. energy storage installations will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, with growth “driven by residential and utility-scale segments amidst a constantly evolving policy environment.” The groups noted, though, that “U.S. utility-scale storage installations could drop 10% year-over-year in 2027 largely due to uncertainty over pending Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations on battery cell sourcing.”

“Pricing and FEOC uncertainty, and slow community storage development are expected to limit CCI segment growth below 1 GW by 2029, though Massachusetts’ SMART 3.0 may help boost future deployment,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Residential storage is expected to outpace solar due to stronger policy resilience, high attachment rates in key markets like California and Puerto Rico, and continued ITC access through third-party ownership.”

Allison Weis, Global Head of Storage at Wood Mackenzie, noted that while recent federal legislation preserved the investment tax credit (ITC) for energy storage, there are still challenges to deployment, and the the five-year buildout could be reduced by 16.5 GW.

“After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC,” said Weis. “While domestic cell supply is ramping up, supply chain shortages are possible, although developers are continuing to consider supply from China to fill in any gaps. A rush to start construction under the more certain near-term regulatory framework uplifts the near-term forecast. Projects that have not met certain milestones by the end of 2025 are at risk of exposure to changing regulations. There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fig1-technicians-walking-energy-storage.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 12:05:45.883645

Indeed, figures from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie show that the US residential storage market added a record 458MW in the first quarter of this year, with California and Puerto Rico driving 74% of this growth.
“Historically, it’s hard to deny that the investor-owned utilities in California have viewed customer-sided solar and storage as competition,” said Luo.
“Electrification is actually, very clearly, a good thing for the utilities’ profit margins as more people needing more electricity is good for the utilities,” Luo explained.
“It’s unclear to me if the interaction in the complaint will be very collaborative, unfortunately.","These timelines, combined with the actual process of reviewing, are collectively known as Rule 21, according to Kevin Luo, policy and market development manager for CALSSA, who spoke with PV Tech Premium exclusively on the association’s complaint. He said that the utilities are required to use “reasonable efforts” to meet the timelines imposed by Rule 21, but that this has consistently not been the case.

“The approval process, to me, should be simple and straightforward,” said Luo. “The issue is that utilities are not following that rule, and starting from the year 2020, the commission has required utilities to self-report data on how long it takes them to review each project, and we have about nearly five years of data on utility performance, and there’s a clear pattern of repeated violations of those interconnection timelines.”

When asked about the decision to levy fines in particular, Luo said that responsibility for enforcing these rules and imposing fines for non-compliance should fall on the CPUC, but that this has not happened.

“It’s been a point of frustration for customers in the industry that it’s fallen to us to really move the ball forward on enforcement,” Luo explained. “What we lay out in the complaint is that state law actually requires the commission to penalise the utilities for this … they have not chosen to do so and it’s really an unfortunate reality. It’s our hope that by filing the formal complaint and moving the ball forward we can force the issue.”

As a result, CALSSA has found itself in an unusual position for a trade association, a feeling of obligation to enforce rules upon the utilities with which it works. However, Luo said that he thinks CALSSA has a “strong case”, and pointed to fines levied on utilities for violating power shut-off rules as examples of fines being used elsewhere to force utilities to comply with regulations.

Is it foul play?

For its part, SCE emphasised that its focus remains on delivering “timely and efficient interconnection”. In a statement provided to PV Tech Premium this week, SCE spokesperson Jeff Monford said that: “We are focused on providing timely and efficient interconnection, which is critical to supporting California’s clean energy goals and maintaining trust with our customers.

“We take the complaint seriously, and are working with the CPUC to thoroughly address any issues related to our interconnection processes.”

PG&E, meanwhile, has not replied to requests for comment as of the publication of this article.

When asked about the utilities’ intentions, Luo doubled down on a comment made earlier this month when CALSSA first announced the fines that the utilities’ work amounts to “suppressing what they consider to be their competition”.

“What I said before is still true in the sense that ultimately the consequence of the utilities’ violations of these interconnection timelines is the suppression of customer-side solar and storage,” he told PV Tech Premium.

“That is the ultimate consequence because what’s happening is that you’re adding extra time and extra costs to normal folks trying to install solar and storage on their roofs, on business, on schools and on farms. All these folks have other stuff going on – nobody wants to sit around and wait for an extra six months, one year or two years! – because utilities are dragging their feet on following the rules.”

The inaction of these utilities comes as California’s energy mix is undergoing a rapid period of change following the passage of the net energy metering (NEM 3.0) rules. The rules slashed prices for selling electricity generated at residential solar systems to the grid, in a bid to incentivise more installations of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the residential sector; this saw a significant uptick in the co-location of solar and storage projects in the Californian residential sector within a year of its passage.

Indeed, figures from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie show that the US residential storage market added a record 458MW in the first quarter of this year, with California and Puerto Rico driving 74% of this growth.

How a decentralised energy system can threaten utilities

However, Luo noted that this rapidly changing energy mix means that utilities have started to see residential storage applications, and by extension, the solar systems to which they are often attached, as competition.

“Historically, it’s hard to deny that the investor-owned utilities in California have viewed customer-sided solar and storage as competition,” said Luo. “Even though California has ambitious climate goals and utilities are technically required to procure a certain amount of clean energy, the evidence shows that the utilities try as hard as possible to avoid including customer-side solar and storage in that renewable energy mix that the state needs in the future.”

“It’s been clear that the utilities have preferred to pursue utility-scale solar projects, mainly because those utility-scale projects require much more grid expansion – you build all these utility-scale solar and wind farms out in the desert then you need to build all the transmission lines to bring the energy to customers – and for the utilities that’s really the honey pot.”

This phenomenon is not unique to California. Earlier this year, Sean Garren of advocacy group Vote Solar spoke to PV Tech Premium about the passage of the latest Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) in Georgia, which featured a number of new fossil fuel projects at a time where the energy transition ought to be accelerating.

Garren noted that the shift from fossil fuels to renewables is also, often, a shift away from large, centralised grids to a series of smaller, decentralised power systems, which is more difficult for a single utility to control and, crucially, turn a profit on.

Working with grid operators

However, this is not to say that the relationship between utilities and residential prosumers needs to be antagonistic; indeed, Luo noted that a trend towards greater electrification is often of benefit to all parties.

“Electrification is actually, very clearly, a good thing for the utilities’ profit margins as more people needing more electricity is good for the utilities,” Luo explained. “If load on the grid is expected to increase as much as it should for the electrification that’s required to hit California’s clean energy goals, there should be more than enough profits to go around.”

“So, in theory, the utilities shouldn’t be as ardent as they are about, I guess, their dislike for customer-side solar and storage, but it seems that the profits they should get from electrification isn’t enough, they want more. That’s my own interpretation of this.”

Luo also noted that there are different priorities and relationships within the utilities, which has helped drive a wedge between utilities and others in the California energy system. He drew a distinction between “the staff from the utilities that are on the ground”, with whom CALSSA has “a lot of respect”, and decision-makers at the utilities who are “deciding how many resources their on-the-ground staff have”.

“There’s that second relationship with the higher-level folks who are deciding how many resources those staff have, and a lot of the issues are that the staff are often extremely overworked – we’ve heard about a lot of staff turnover – and [experience] very poor training,” Luo explained. “It’s unclear to me if the interaction in the complaint will be very collaborative, unfortunately.

“The fact that we’ve had to file the formal complaint itself goes to show that having conversations outside of a formal venue has not made progress.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seia.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 14:03:28.883869

“[This] is not in any way a normal pendulum swing of climate policy that we expect to see with any change in administration,” said Freeman, founder of the Environmental & Energy Law Program, in opening remarks to students, scholars, and leaders in business, government, and the nonprofit sector. She then moderated a panel called “Climate Law Under Siege (And the Path Forward).”

“What we are seeing is an unraveling of all federal climate policy,” she said, “the greatest retrenchment of climate law and policy we’ve ever seen in this country.”

Since taking office in January, participants noted, the administration has decimated policies that seek to protect the environment. In addition to announcing plans to reverse a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency “endangerment finding” that has been the basis for efforts to regulate greenhouse gases, the federal government has removed obstacles to oil and gas drilling on federal lands and waters, cancelled nearly $700 million in funding for offshore wind projects, eliminated offices that promote environmental justice, and significantly reduced the agencies and departments that seek to enforce federal environmental protection laws.

The backpedaling on greenhouse gases alone — part of what the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, called an effort to “[drive] a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion” — is catastrophic to mitigating the harms from the changing climate, said Richard J. Lazarus ’79, the Charles Stebbins Fairchild Professor of Law, who teaches environmental law and natural resources law.

“In Boston, we call that ‘the ball game,’” he said.

The panel, which also included Andrew Mergen, the Emmett Visiting Assistant Clinical Professor of Law in Environmental Law and faculty director of the Emmett Environmental Law and Policy Clinic, and Carrie Jenks, executive director of the Environmental & Energy Law Program, agreed the Trump administration’s arguments against the endangerment finding were not persuasive — Lazarus called them “disingenuous.”

“A lot of this stuff is probably unlawful,” he said, noting that it “takes quite a long time for the courts to catch up.”

States and the private sector are taking some steps to promote and invest in environmental protections — there are “huge co-benefits” for climate investments, including bringing down costs for consumers and long-term investment goals, Jenks said — but the federal government is challenging those efforts as well.

The panelists acknowledged that the Clean Air Act, while hugely successful in tackling many environmental harms, has not been a perfect fit for addressing climate change. Because of those shortcomings, past presidents, including Barack Obama ’91 and Joe Biden, relied extensively on regulatory authority to address climate threats. That, Lazarus acknowledged, “created a backlash,” including in the U.S. Supreme Court, which “wants clear congressional authorization” for any regulatory actions.

Nevertheless, Jenks said, past presidents, including Donald Trump during his first presidential term, generally have sought to replace rules rather than get rid of them. The current administration isn’t doing that.

“They’re … not proposing an alternative,” Jenks said. “They’re just proposing to eliminate. They’re trying to prevent a future administration from doing something different. It’s not really a rollback; I think it’s a complete elimination.”

Mergen thinks the courts will continue to exercise their power in preventing unlawful actions and emphasized that many dedicated career civil servants remain in the government.

“Things are falling apart, but the center can hold,” Mergen said. “We don’t have a lot of time for the center to hold, but there are some very good people trying to hold the institution together, and that matters.”

The panelists said they remain inspired by the younger generation, including the students in their classes and programs, and, in response to audience questions, they offered advice for anyone hoping to change the direction of climate policy in the United States.

“You can talk, argue, write, give money, give your time, volunteer, engage, go work on campaigns, go work for states while the federal government is out of action,” Freeman said. “Figure out where your talents lie and go deploy them.”

Lazarus agreed.

“This problem is not going away … and you’re our future so you can’t give up. You’ve got to double down,” he said.

During a recent conversation with Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law Noah Feldman, Primus explained his theory that the enumerated powers were intended as a baseline for Congress’ authority — not a limit.
The argument that congressional authority is limited to the enumerated powers, Primus explained, did not triumph until the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, which began in 1801.
“It can’t be the case that the enumerated powers are that expansive, or else why would they be enumerated?","In the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8 lists 27 powers explicitly given to Congress. Throughout American history, a robust consensus has existed that these “enumerated” powers are intended to limit federal legislative authority.

According to constitutional expert Richard Primus, the Theodore J. St. Antoine Collegiate Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School, that assumption is fundamentally flawed.

During a recent conversation with Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law Noah Feldman, Primus explained his theory that the enumerated powers were intended as a baseline for Congress’ authority — not a limit. In her introduction of Feldman and Primus, Professor Jeannie Suk Gersen praised Primus’s groundbreaking perspective and noted that the two constitutional law theorists have been longstanding interlocutors.

“Once in a really long while, you read something that makes you wonder if you’ve been doing it all wrong. And that is the effect that Richard Primus’s book ‘The Oldest Constitutional Question’ had on me,” she said. “I’m really delighted to be hosting this conversation between Richard Primus and Noah Feldman … who have been engaging in earnest with each other about constitutional theory since they were teenagers.”

Feldman and Primus then began to unpack the thesis of Primus’s latest book, which attempts to debunk what scholars call “enumerationism,” the view that congressional authority is limited to the enumerated powers outlined in the nation’s founding document.

“The text of the Constitution does not say what enumerationism teaches us to say,” said Primus. “The historical story that says the framers enumerated the powers of Congress in order to limit the reach of Congress, I think, is mostly wrong.”

“It’s my view that the enumeration of powers is a wheel that turns no part of the mechanism of federalist limitation. That’s not what it does,” he said. “That’s not what it was written to do. And when we press it into service to try to limit Congress, it functions very badly because it’s not well designed for that.”

Primus argued that, for the Constitution’s framers designing a federal government, assigning Congress an explicit but non-exclusive list of powers made sense. In its infancy, Congress would have to contend with the executive and judicial branches in addition to the well-established state governments already in place.

“If you’re trying to get something powerful going, against opposition, in a world where there are other power players, it’s sometimes helpful to specify with particularity what its warrant is.”

According to Primus, historical accounts from the drafting and ratification of the Constitution support his hypothesis that the list was not intended to be comprehensive. Although some framers at the constitutional convention, such as Luther Martin and George Mason, initially called for limiting congressional power via enumeration, those efforts, Primus said, were rejected.

“We can find voices like that. But, as far as I can tell, they mostly get pushed aside. These are ideas that are articulated in the [constitutional] convention, but people stand up after that and say, ‘Yeah, that’s just not going to work. It’s not practical to enumerate all the powers that this Congress is going to need,’” said Primus. “And they give various reasons why they think it’s not. So, those calls for enumerated powers don’t get picked up and turned into enumeration.”

He also contended that, prior to ratification, the perception of enumeration as a limit on Congress mostly arose when federalist framers were attempting to sell the idea of a new Constitution to anti-federalists who opposed establishing a strong national government.

“The opposition is going to come mostly from people who think this government is too strong. So, as a rhetorical matter, the supporters of the Constitution need to try to say it’s actually not going to be as strong as you think it is,” said Primus.

While some supporters of the proposed Constitution interpreted it as giving Congress general legislative power, he contended, many of them argued otherwise to appease those hesitant to vote in favor of ratification.

“It’s not helpful to make that argument at that point, so [federalists] argue, ‘No, the powers are enumerated,’” he said. “And they especially argue it in response to the leading anti-federalist objection, which is: ‘Why does this thing have no bill of rights?’”

But if enumerationism did not come from the framers, as Feldman asked, “Where’s the smoking gun? Who’s the bad guy who invented enumerationism and pulled the wool over all of our eyes?”

“I have a sinking suspicion that I know who the answer to that is,” added Feldman, who authored “The Three Lives of James Madison: Genius, Partisan, President” in 2017. “But I’ll let you tell it. How did it become the consensus view?”

According to Primus, enumerationism emerged in earnest during the debate over whether to establish a national bank. Madison, who opposed its formation, pointed to the absence of an enumerated power authorizing Congress to create such an institution. Madison, despite being hailed by history as the “Father of the Constitution,” lost that debate about the document’s meaning. Congress passed, and President George Washington signed, legislation creating the First Bank of the United States in 1791.

The argument that congressional authority is limited to the enumerated powers, Primus explained, did not triumph until the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, which began in 1801.

“The Jeffersonians, who like making arguments, pick [enumerationism] up and it becomes orthodoxy over the course of the first several decades of the 19th century,” said Primus, “But it never is the way government actually works. It becomes an orthodoxy in speech and not in practice.”

He also noted that treating the enumerated list as a floor on its powers and not a ceiling is more consistent with how Congress has operated since the New Deal in the 1930s. As such, his theory retroactively exonerates the expansion of congressional authority beyond the powers listed in Article I, Section 8 — a century-long trend that some constitutional originalists have lamented.

“The going intuition among many constitutional lawyers has been: We must be doing something wrong,” said Primus. “It can’t be the case that the enumerated powers are that expansive, or else why would they be enumerated? And what I want to say is, ‘No, we haven’t all been doing it wrong for 100 years.’ It’s not the case that judges, appointed by presidents of both political parties for going on 100 years, have been doing it all wrong. We’ve been doing it fine.”

“What we’ve been doing wrong is talking about it the wrong way,” he said. “We’ve been expecting the enumerated powers to do a thing that they were not built to do, and then we get disappointed and upset when they don’t do them.”",https://hls.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_09_15_HLS-Beyond-Richard-Primus_LGranger_002-1-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:04:58.774319

BOSTON (September 25, 2025) - Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced an agreement with American GreenFuels, LLC that resolves an alleged violation of the Clean Air Act (CAA) at the company's biodiesel production facility in New Haven, Connecticut. EPA found that American GreenFuels failed to properly operate its facility to adequately comply with CAA requirements over a two-year period beginning in August 2020.

""Protecting human health and the environment is EPA's core mission,"" said EPA New England Regional Administrator Mark Sanborn. ""The agreement with American GreenFuels will better protect Connecticut residents and local air quality.""

American GreenFuels' New Haven facility produces biodiesel with used vegetable oil, animal fats, methanol, sulfuric acid, and sodium methoxide. Based on inspections of the facility and additional information provided by American GreenFuels, EPA found that the facility failed to control the release of certain air pollutants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), during system repairs and maintenance from August 2020 to August 2022. American GreenFuels will pay a $143,000 penalty to resolve the alleged violation, and, to EPA's knowledge, the facility is now in compliance with CAA regulations.

A detailed summary of the alleged violation can be found in the consent agreement, which is available from EPA upon request.

Why this matters:

VOCs include a variety of chemicals that are emitted from various sources, including industrial processes. VOCs are a key precursor in the formation of ground level ozone that can degrade the air we breathe. People at greatest risk of harm from breathing air containing ozone are people with asthma, children, older adults, and people who are active outdoors, especially outdoor workers.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:05:14.445809

Every action that New York State takes to speed up renewable energy deployment helps achieve these goals.
New York Solar Energy Industries Association (NYSEIA) applauds Governor Hochul for taking action to accelerate renewable energy project development and construction.","As part of New York’s all-of-the-above energy strategy, Governor Kathy Hochul today announced a coordinated set of actions to accelerate the deployment and construction of reliable and clean energy across New York State that will help stabilize energy prices. Recognizing the near-term need for power to meet increasing electricity demand as well as economic development needs and the importance of adapting to shifting federal policies, Governor Hochul is launching a new solicitation for renewable energy and directing state agencies to work together to responsibly advance shovel-ready renewable energy projects as quickly as possible. These efforts are designed to support New York ratepayers by using sunsetting federal clean energy tax credits to bring down costs.

“While the federal government takes us backward on energy policy, New York will not be thwarted in its commitment to clean energy. By directing our state agencies to move projects across the finish line, we are seizing every opportunity to leverage federal incentives, reduce costs for ratepayers, and build a more resilient, sustainable and reliable energy grid,” Governor Hochul said. “Together, these actions are expected to unlock billions in private investment, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and build a durable energy economy that benefits New Yorkers for decades to come.”

New York's current pipeline of large-scale renewable energy is comprised of 102 solar, land-based wind, hydroelectric and offshore wind projects operating and under development that will deliver over 9.7 gigawatts of clean power to the grid when completed – enough energy to power over 3 million New York homes. The development of projects as a result of this solicitation is expected to spur over five billion dollars in clean energy investments and create more than 2,500 family-sustaining jobs in the energy economy across New York.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “New York is all about progress and we are not stopping. We are going to continue building out our energy economy and growing our already robust land-based renewables portfolio. This solicitation will serve as another building block to help ensure a continuous pipeline of viable large-scale projects as part of New York’s versatile clean energy future.”

2025 Land-Based Renewable Energy Solicitation (Tier 1 RFP)

NYSERDA today launched the 2025 Land-Based Renewable Energy Solicitation seeking to procure eligible large-scale wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects to support advancement of clean energy deployment while delivering reliable energy to all New Yorkers.

The solicitation is designed to advance late-stage large-scale renewable energy projects ready to commence construction in New York. It incorporates best practices and lessons learned from prior procurements, including key provisions on component cost indexing, labor provisions, stakeholder engagement requirements, disadvantaged community commitments, and agricultural land preservation to ensure an equitable energy transition that benefits all New Yorkers. To expedite contracting, NYSERDA has also streamlined bid requirements, with full details outlined in the solicitation documents.

The process for submitting proposals into the land-based renewables solicitation will be conducted in two steps:

Eligibility applications are due on October 21, 2025.

Final proposals from eligible participants are due on December 4, 2025, by 3 p.m.

For details, please visit the Large-Scale Renewables Solicitation page. Conditional award notifications are expected to be issued to proposers in February 2026, followed by an announcement of selected projects once the awarded contracts have been executed.

Directive to Focus on Projects that May Qualify for Existing Federal Tax Credits

State agencies will intensify efforts to advance shovel-ready renewable energy projects, with a focus on qualifying projects that seek to access existing federal tax credits that will expire. This whole-of-government approach will responsibly streamline permitting, interconnection, financing, and contracting processes to ensure that as many projects as possible reach construction quickly, providing clean power to New York homes and businesses.

New York State Public Service Commission Chair and CEO Rory M. Christian said, “We stand ready to assist our sister agencies in the development of appropriate clean energy projects in New York State. Governor Hochul’s very timely announcement will help ensure a continuous development of renewable energy projects that will help spur the creation of much needed clean energy which will strengthen the reliability of our electric grid while creating good-paying jobs.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, “Renewable energy development is one of the most important keys to reducing harmful pollution, generating green jobs, and creating more sustainable communities here in New York and across the country. Governor Hochul’s directive announced today will help further accelerate clean energy momentum already underway by comprehensive policies, programs, and investments that continue to make New York State a national leader in zero-emission energy production. DEC continues to work with our partner agencies to ensure efficient permitting processes that support these efforts.”

State Senator Kevin Parker said, “Accelerating renewable energy projects is critical to ensuring New York families have access to clean, affordable, and reliable power when they need it most. Every day we move forward means more jobs created, more communities protected from rising costs, and more progress toward a healthier environment. While uncertainty in Washington threatens to slow the clean energy transition, New York is proving that we will not wait we will lead. I remain committed to making sure our state continues to deliver for working families and disadvantaged communities, advancing projects that strengthen our energy future and our economy.”

Assemblymember Deborah Glick said, “Thank you, Governor Hochul, for recognizing that New Yorkers need an expanded grid with reliable, clean energy and lower costs. With our current federal government working hand in glove with the fossil fuel industry, it is important for New York to fully utilize the remaining federal tax credits to realize as many renewable energy projects as possible. This will not only be better for the environment, but will provide cleaner, more reliable, and less expensive energy and reduce our reliance on the more volatile and polluting fossil fuel industry.”

State Senator Peter Harckham said, “This is exactly the kind of forward-thinking climate action New York needs. Renewable energy projects are a major economic opportunity waiting to be unlocked. Expediting the Land-Based Tier 1 Renewable Energy Solicitation will mean more good-paying jobs for New Yorkers, lower utility bills for ratepayers and cleaner air for all. Thank you to Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for moving this critical work forward.”

New York League of Conservation Voters President Julie Tighe said, “While the federal government retreats, New York continues to march forward with reliable, affordable clean energy. NYSERDA’s plan to accelerate the construction and deployment of renewables is a critical step forward that will cut pollution, create good-paying jobs, and make our communities healthier and our grid more resilient. We applaud Governor Hochul for prioritizing the clean energy transition and showing the country what strong state leadership looks like.”

New York State AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento said, “Today’s announcement marks another significant step toward ensuring energy reliability and moving us closer to achieving New York’s renewable energy goals. We look forward to continuing to work with NYSERDA to ensure these projects adhere to robust labor standards and protections, creating pathways to solid union careers as we continue to advance toward a clean energy future.”

New York State Building Trades President Gary LaBarbera said, ""The continued advancement of clean energy development in New York State represents significant progress in establishing our green economy and the good paying union careers that come with it. The deployment of these projects will not only help us reach our standard-setting climate goals and deliver reliable clean energy to all New Yorkers, but it will also open up countless opportunities for hardworking people to pursue the middle class and support their families. We applaud NYSERDA for their ongoing work to streamline these crucial energy initiatives and look forward to our continued collaboration in pushing these projects forward.""

Alliance for Clean Energy New York Executive Director Marguerite Wells said, “Wind and solar projects are ready to meet the moment and provide affordable power to New Yorkers. We applaud Gov. Hochul for advancing these clean energy technologies at a time when we need them most. Against a backdrop of rising costs and the ever-present realities of climate change, renewables can revitalize upstate economies, provide much-needed power, and do so in an efficient and cost-effective manner.”

Natural Resources Defense Council Managing Director of Power Kit Kennedy said, “Building clean energy projects quickly and fairly is crucial for cutting electricity costs and creating quality jobs for New Yorkers. Every action that New York State takes to speed up renewable energy deployment helps achieve these goals. With the federal government in full retreat and denial, New York’s climate leadership is more important than ever.”

New York Solar Energy Industries Association Executive Director Noah Ginsburg said, “As the federal government eliminates support for affordable clean energy, states need to act quickly to protect electric ratepayers and the clean energy workforce. New York Solar Energy Industries Association (NYSEIA) applauds Governor Hochul for taking action to accelerate renewable energy project development and construction. These actions will ensure that New York leverages federal funding for clean energy projects today while setting the stage for cost-effective permitting and interconnection tomorrow.”

Advanced Energy United New York Policy Lead Kristina Persaud said, “We commend Governor Hochul for delivering clean, reliable, and affordable energy to New Yorkers. Large-scale renewable projects don’t just keep energy costs in check—they also strengthen our electric grid and create good jobs across the state.

These projects will remove 1.2 million tonnes of CO₂ annually, using world-leading carbon capture technology to decarbonise two of the most emissions-intensive industries: cement and waste-to-energy. Without carbon capture, these sectors have no viable route to cut emissions.

The projects are the first anchor developments to join Eni’s Liverpool Bay Transportation & Storage network, part of the HyNet carbon capture cluster, which was approved by the Prime Minister earlier this year. HyNet spans North Wales and the North West, using new and repurposed infrastructure to safely capture and store carbon emissions underground.

Together, Padeswood and Protos will directly support 500 skilled jobs, including roles for engineers, technicians, construction workers and health & safety experts. They form part of the 2,800 jobs expected across the wider HyNet network.

These shovel-ready projects are a cornerstone of the government’s Industrial Strategy, backed by £9.4 billion in funding announced in the June Spending Review. They will not only secure long-term employment in Britain’s industrial heartlands, but also position the UK as a global leader in carbon capture technology.

By investing in proven decarbonisation solutions, the UK is preserving proud British industries while creating export opportunities for homegrown innovation. British companies will gain a competitive edge in the global green economy, driving growth and sustainability.

Michael Shanks, Energy Minister, said:

“Our clean energy mission means good jobs, regional growth, and investment for local communities.

“These trailblazing projects showcase North Wales and the North West’s workforce on the global stage – leading the charge in the clean industries of the future and powering Britain’s reindustrialisation.”

The final investment decisions, signed with the Low Carbon Contracts Company, mean construction will begin shortly. These projects provide a crucial lifeline for the cement and waste sectors, ensuring their survival in a low-carbon future.

As the UK accelerates towards net zero, the launch of these carbon capture facilities sends a clear message: clean growth, secure jobs, and industrial resilience are at the heart of Britain’s green transition.

TCI wasn’t the only cap-and-trade program in which the Cooper administration expressed interest.
Roy Cooper, who was attorney general when the Democrat-controlled U.S. House passed legislation to create a national cap-and-trade program in 2009, has not commented on whether he supports a federal cap-and-trade program or a federal carbon tax.
North Carolina Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R‑Rockingham) and other SB 266 supporters point to official government projected savings for ratepayers of $13 billion over the next two and a half decades.","The road to a U.S. Senate majority in 2027 and 2028 runs through North Carolina, where the race to replace Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), which pits former Governor Roy Cooper (D) against former RNC chairman Michael Whatley (R), is likely to be the nation’s most expensive 2026 midterm contest. Roy Cooper underscored a theme of his campaign in a September 21 post on X, blaming dysfunction in Washington for a host of ills, among them “rising energy prices.”

Roy Cooper, who has never lost an election, appears confident about his ability to convince voters that Republicans on Capitol Hill are responsible for rising gas prices and utility bills. The Cooper campaign’s effort to equate GOP policies with increasing energy costs, however, will be confounded by aspects of Cooper’s own record as governor, namely his expressed interest in regional cap-and-trade programs, both existing and proposed.

In 2021, for example, then Governor Cooper registered his official support for a regional cap-and-trade program called the Transportation and Climate Initiative (TCI). TCI proponents lobbied legislators and other state officials for years, but the plan ultimately fell apart when it became clear that no more than three states were going to join the regional program. The way in which TCI would drive up gas prices was a key reason why TCI was rejected in 10 of the 13 northeastern and mid-Atlantic states targeted for adoption, mostly blue states where Democrats run state government. TCI proponents themselves conceded that the program would necessarily raise gas prices, with projections estimating that TCI would raise the price of gas more than 30 cents per gallon in member states.

Despite the unpopularity of TCI, even in the blue states targeted for membership, Governor Cooper signed onto a letter committing to collaboration with TCI member states in order “to shape the program to reflect the evolving needs of the region and welcome other jurisdictions to join.” Meanwhile, Maine Governor Janet Mills (D), who is now running for U.S. Senate like Cooper, faced pressure to join TCI that Cooper never had to deal with. Despite that, Mills declined to sign her Democrat-run state onto that same letter of commitment for TCI collaboration that Cooper signed on behalf of North Carolina.

Some North Carolinians saw Governor Cooper’s quiet commitment to collaboration with TCI member states, which wasn’t reported in any North Carolina media outlets, as the first step toward eventually imposing cap-and-trade in North Carolina. TCI wasn’t the only cap-and-trade program in which the Cooper administration expressed interest.

A spokesman for Cooper confirmed in 2021 that membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), an existing regional cap-and-trade program that limits and imposes a cost on carbon emissions from electric utilities in 11 northeastern states, was under consideration. Whereas TCI would’ve capped transportation-related emissions, RGGI focuses on the emissions produced by electric utilities.

North Carolina legislators were so concerned that Roy Cooper might seek to impose cap-and-trade by executive order, just as Governor Josh Shapiro (D-Pa.) is still trying to do in Pennsylvania in the face of bipartisan opposition, that the GOP-led General Assembly enacted a budget in late 2021 with a provision preventing Cooper or any future governor from imposing cap-and-trade without legislative approval.

Roy Cooper, who was attorney general when the Democrat-controlled U.S. House passed legislation to create a national cap-and-trade program in 2009, has not commented on whether he supports a federal cap-and-trade program or a federal carbon tax. That 2009 cap-and-trade bill, which went on to die in the Democrat-led Senate, was criticized over the way in which it would’ve put upward pressure on utility bills and gas prices. Former Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) demonstrated the bipartisan opposition to that national cap-and-trade proposal when he shot a copy of the bill with a rifle in a 2010 campaign ad.

This past summer provided a more recent, North Carolina-specific example of bipartisan opposition to emissions caps that are projected to drive up energy costs. At the end of July, members of the North Carolina House and Senate enacted Senate Bill 266, legislation repealing the 70% carbon emissions reduction mandate for electric utilities that would’ve taken effect in 2030. Despite Governor Josh Stein’s (D-N.C.) opposition to SB 266, three Democrats in the North Carolina House joined with Republicans to override Stein’s veto when only one defection was needed. That veto override vote actually understates the bipartisan support for SB 266, which 11 Democrats voted for on initial passage, prior to Stein’s veto.

North Carolina Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R‑Rockingham) and other SB 266 supporters point to official government projected savings for ratepayers of $13 billion over the next two and a half decades. “It is written in a way to explicitly save ratepayers dollars,” said Rep. Dean Arp (R‑Union), House sponsor of SB 266, about the need to repeal the 2030 emissions reduction mandate.

In his veto statement, Governor Stein contended that repeal of the 2030 carbon emissions reduction mandate will actually raise costs, with Stein alleging that the move “shifted billions in risk onto working families.” Organizations opposing SB 266, such as the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, also point research projecting that repeal of carbon emission reduction mandates would drive up utility bills.

“By overriding this veto, the General Assembly is standing up for energy affordability and sound economic policy,” said Donald Bryson, president and CEO of the John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina-based think tank, about the enactment of SB 266. “North Carolinians deserve an energy strategy that prioritizes cost, reliability, and transparency — not one driven by expensive, arbitrary mandates.”

In addition to providing an opportunity to explain his past interest in cap-and-trade, along with his support for other regulations that raise costs for consumers, Roy Cooper’s Senate bid is likely to have him facing questions never posed by the North Carolina press corps. For example, Cooper has spoken out many times in the past against the personal and corporate income tax cuts that the GOP-run North Carolina General Assembly enacted over the past 12 years, but Cooper has never said how high he’d like to ratchet back up the rate.

Cooper has complained about the personal income tax rate cuts enacted by GOP legislators, but does Cooper want North Carolina’s top marginal rate to return to 7.75%, where it was before Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly began flattening and cutting the rate in 2013? He hasn’t said.

Cooper opposes the ongoing phaseout of North Carolina’s corporate income tax, but has not said how high he thinks the rate should be. Would Cooper like to see the corporate tax rate return to 6.9%, where it was before legislators began reforming the tax code? Cooper hasn’t said. Cooper has also criticized the federal corporate rate cut enacted by President Trump and congressional Republicans, yet he has not specified how high he thinks the federal corporate rate should be.

Roy Cooper is undefeated in elections, but his lengthy record will likely face more scrutiny in the coming year than it has in the previous decade. That is a key reason why many Republicans are optimistic that Cooper’s 2026 U.S. Senate bid will be the political equivalent of the 2007 New England Patriots’ 18-1 season.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d2a9f0ca95dadd755ba766/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-26 09:59:11.668178

(Reuters) -The Trump administration's rapid retreat from renewable energy has kicked off consolidation and asset sales among smaller U.S. solar and wind power companies as they scramble to stay afloat, industry insiders and analysts said.

President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has overhauled tax credits and sharply shortened eligibility windows for solar and wind projects as part of an ""energy dominance"" agenda focused on oil, gas, coal and nuclear, in a sharp departure from the green energy-focused policies under his predecessor Joe Biden.

""There's likely to be consolidation due to a variety of federal moves of late, including the recently passed tax bill (OBBBA) which eliminates investment tax credits,"" said Gregg Felton, CEO of Connecticut-based Altus Power.

Clean energy deals surged to 63 with a combined value of around $34 billion in the first half of 2025, according to KPMG, versus roughly 57 deals worth about $7 billion in the second half of 2024.

Compounding the worries, the Inflation Reduction Act, which had allowed projects to use or sell credits to lower construction costs, was rolled back earlier this year, while loan guarantees for green projects were scrapped in late December.

The compressed deadlines and reduced support could force smaller players to merge, form joint ventures, or sell assets to survive, said John Villali, senior research director at IDC Energy Insights.

The U.S. Energy Department said on September 24, it intends to cancel more than $13 billion in funds for green energy, further darkening the outlook for such projects.

That followed axing in May of more than $3.7 billion in funding for 24 green energy projects approved under Biden, including one at an ExxonMobil refinery in Texas.

Sunnova Energy recently lost a $2.92 billion loan guarantee.

The cancellation of federal loans will likely drive M&A in the utility sector, particularly for distressed clean energy assets, said Gregg Semler, CEO of InPipe Energy.

SAVVY BUYERS AWAIT

Private equity firms and utilities are already circling.

In late August, CBRE Investment Management agreed to acquire ClearGen, a clean energy developer and manager backed by Blackstone with more than 250 projects across 14 states.

Disruptions are industry-wide but nimble developers and market-aware investors will still find opportunities, ClearGen CEO Rob Howard said.

Larger utilities and private equity investors with stronger balance sheets and risk tolerance are lapping up the undervalued assets.

""We are on the buy side...actively dealing with greenfield developers and other energy companies,"" said independent power producer Agilitas Energy CEO Barrett Bilotta.

The company plans more M&A announcements this year after having acquired a solar project in Rhode Island in August and two hydropower projects in West Virginia and Maryland in June.

Liz Burdock, president and CEO of Oceantic Network, a nonprofit focused on developing the ocean renewables market and its supply chain, emphasized the importance of offshore wind, noting that the economic benefits are paramount. The nonprofit found that in the past ten years, the U.S. has invested $24 billion in the industry’s supply chain, ranging from large shipbuilding and steel manufacturing operations to small businesses across forty states. Ports have been a particular beneficiary, with three different types needed to support the industry: manufacturing ports, staging and marshalling ports, and operations and maintenance ports. Port openings have reinvigorated dormant shipyards and brought communities like New Bedford, Massachusetts and Albany, New York, back to life. Steel manufacturing has also been a highlight, with new plants in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Texas representing investments of $500 million or more to supply the four-inch steel for foundations and towers. “So we’re looking at bringing back industries that have been sitting dormant and that are, quite frankly, aligned with this administration,” Burdock expressed. These industries are not the only ones benefiting from offshore wind. “It’s all the ancillary services that help support that activity… And so the job multiplier is huge,” Burdock said.

Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), added that offshore wind boosts the country’s national security, “and that’s because we are competing globally when it comes to energy, and when it comes to offshore wind, it allows us to compete in many areas,” he explained. Beyond advancing the nation’s maritime dominance, it also allows us to compete with China, the dominant player in the space. Additionally, Milito pointed out that “it’s a national security interest of ours to make sure we have the power to fuel our economy,” with an increased use of electricity for data centers, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and more, requiring all the power generation we can get.

Additionally, Burdock labelled offshore wind “the workhorse of the clean power industry,” adding that “despite some of the things that you might have heard, it is base load generation.” She used the South Fork Wind project off the coast of New York as an example of just how efficient the resource can be. In the first half of 2025, it achieved a net capacity factor of 53%, compared to 53.7% for the state’s most efficient natural gas facilities. During a heat wave in June, South Fork even reached an 87.4% capacity factor, meeting emergency demand. Additionally, it is a cost-effective resource, particularly in the Northeast, where wind speeds are high. Burdock quoted Bob Blue, CEO of Dominion Energy, which is developing the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. Blue said, “Offshore represents the fastest and most economical way to deliver almost 3 GW of electricity to Virginia’s grid, to support America’s AI and cyber preeminence in the largest data center market in the world.”

Burdock and Milito cited numerous ways that the industry is pivoting to overcome obstacles. Burdock emphasized that although these projects are typically located off the coasts of blue states, they are generating jobs in red states. She explained, “One of the criticisms of my industry is that we haven’t done a good enough job to really illustrate how those jobs are being created in the red states. We didn’t talk enough to those constituencies to make sure that they were talking to their representatives, so that they really understood what this industry meant to them from an economic standpoint.” The industry will need to pivot this messaging going forward.

Milito discussed the importance of a bipartisan path forward and returning to a time when there was no contempt for any energy resources because people recognized that we needed it all to achieve America’s goals. “We’re working with both sides of the aisle in Congress… We’re trying to bring people to the middle,” he clarified. Milito added that stop-work orders for projects do not “provide certainty and predictability to companies who want to invest in the U.S.” He described a similar situation that once faced the oil and gas industry, but regarding which they found success in the courts, offering hope for the fate of offshore wind.

In the face of the administration’s opposition to offshore wind, Burdock urged other industries to step up and say that it is bad for business overall because, “this isn’t just affecting this one industry. It’s going to affect all of the investments in major infrastructure that we have.” She summarized, “Anybody who has a fully permitted project for the federal government should be shaking in their boots right now at what is happening to this industry.” Milito offered a different approach, suggesting that there may be “continued discussions between this administration and a lot of state governments to see if there are ways to come to a compromise and work together to meet the goals of everyone.” If the administration is looking for something in return, it may be a route to seeing these projects green-lighted, even though “that’s not the way we want to see permitting and the regulatory system work.”

Another critical piece of the puzzle is addressing the misconceptions about offshore wind, which Burdock attempted to do during the panel discussion. She noted that it has been proven untrue that the industry hurts tourism or devalues homes. Commercial fishing benefits from the installations, not only because the projects have attracted biodiverse life that has not lived in the area in decades, but also because the fishermen themselves are often paid to act as guard vessels or to monitor for whales. Burdock also rejected the claim that offshore wind is solely a European industry, with U.S. contracts increasing over the past four years, “…it’s a U.S. industry now.”

Milito noted that although it is a “nascent emerging industry,” the offshore wind industry has the potential to expand to all fifty states through additional ports, manufacturing, and infrastructure if the federal government stops interfering. He concluded, “This is something that’s going to benefit all Americans, and we’ve got to make sure we get out of the way.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/491617187_1241656167967195_8465522526178236569_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:04:07.960037

Under the high renewables scenario, 1689 km2 for wind development and 1089 km2 for solar PV development are projected to intersect with these areas by 2050.
When land exclusions are established, they may prevent siting in higher energy resource (e.g., high wind speed) areas.
We study the potential to reach high renewables scenario solar and wind generation levels in 2050 under 27 different siting restriction cases (Table 1).","In this section we first provide an overview of the projected power plant capacity, siting locations, and amount of land required to support new power plant infrastructure under the high renewables and business-as-usual scenarios given current siting policies. Next, we identify the intersection of projected power plant locations with three types of land that could potentially become new siting restrictions: DAC census tracts, important farmland, and land in close proximity to natural areas. Last, we evaluate the impacts of combinations of potential new siting exclusions on the ability to achieve the solar and wind generation in the high renewables scenario.

30% more land dedicated to solar and wind generation is needed in the Western US under a high renewables scenario compared to a business-as-usual scenario

Results from the capacity expansion analysis show that approximately 85% of new power capacity deployed in the Western US by 2050, under either a high renewables or business-as-usual scenario, will consist of solar photovoltaics (PV) and onshore wind (Fig. 1). Across the eleven states representing the Western US electric grid, we see over 260 gigawatts (GW) of new solar PV and nearly 220 GW of new onshore wind capacity deployed by 2050 under the high renewables pathway. To put this in perspective, the 2021 installed power capacity of all technologies (renewable and non-renewable) in the US Western Interconnection was 286 GW33. In contrast to the high renewables scenario, the business-as-usual scenario has 30% less solar PV and onshore wind capacity across the same timeframe. Most of the capacity additions under high renewables (42%) take place in California and Utah, which see nearly 150 GW and 100 GW of new additions, respectively. Comparing these values to total retirements in the same timeframe (approximately 136 GW in business-as-usual and 150 GW in high renewables), we see an overall net increase in capacity of approximately 264 GW under business-as-usual and 421 GW under high renewables. Natural gas-fired technologies make up the largest fraction of retired capacity under both scenarios, predominantly in California and Arizona. Projections for new capacity additions are comparable to those seen in recent literature exploring US capacity expansion plans. In Princeton University’s Net Zero America study, for example, the authors project nearly 295 GW of solar additions (PV and rooftop) and nearly 250 GW of wind additions (onshore and offshore) in aggregate by 2050 for the 11 Western US states under their high electrification scenario19.

Comparing the scenarios in terms of total land use by 2050, the high renewables scenario requires 25,002 km2 across all eleven states in the Western US, whereas the business-as-usual case needs just over two-thirds of this amount, 17,736 km2. For perspective, this difference (7266 km2) is larger than US state of Delaware. At the state level, we see considerable disparities in land requirements. In California, for example, land use under the high renewables scenario is more than 50% greater than in the business-as-usual case (Fig. 1c, d). Overall, Arizona, California, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah are projected to see the largest net land development by 2050, mostly consisting of wind and solar. Supplementary Table 7 shows projected capacity and land usage values shown in Fig. 1.

There are additional indirect land impacts associated with electricity generation facilities that are not included in this analysis. These can include cropland needed for corn ethanol production for biomass, land dedicated to natural gas pipelines and gas extraction to support gas-fired generation facilities, and others. When considering aggregate net land use, wind- and solar-driven capacity expansion plans could lead to net decreases in land usage if land previously used for biomass fuel production are no longer needed. For the Western US, however, this may be less impactful given that most cropland dedicated to corn and ethanol plant production is located in Midwestern US states34 and much of the biomass resource in the Western US is solid biomass associated with forest and mill residues as secondary products35. Similarly, for natural gas, while there is a net decrease in installed capacity by 2050 under both scenarios, most extraction of natural gas resource occurs in states outside the Western US36, meaning that any decrease in indirect land usage for well pads, roads, and other supporting infrastructure would mostly occur outside the region, though some areas in California and Colorado may see impacts.

Given the project-level land use perspective in this analysis, the amount of directly disturbed land (e.g., land used for solar array panels, not including spacing) can be smaller than the project area depending on the technology type. For example, wind turbines and other infrastructure typically permanently disturb a small fraction of land (2–5%37) of the project area, with most project area allocated to spacing. While direct disturbance of total project area can be small, road and transmission line development as well as any setbacks requirements can result in greater landscape fragmentation and impact. Figure 1c, d represents project-level land use and does not represent the direct conversion of land. Due to the lower direct land use of wind turbines (2–5%) and solar arrays (approximately 75%10), when not considering spacing between infrastructure, total land use can drop considerably in the Western US (5088 km2 and 7153 km2 for business-as-usual and high renewables, respectively), though these estimates will vary based on individual plant characteristics. While not all land used for spacing of turbines or solar arrays would be available for other applications due to onsite buildings and setbacks, it stands to reason that at least some fraction could be multi-purpose (e.g., agrivoltaics). A table on estimated direct land conversion under a range of direct land percentage assumptions is provided in the Supplemental Information by state and technology (Supplementary Table 6).

Figure 1c, d additionally shows the estimated amount of land that becomes available due to plant retirements. These are presented as the total km2 of land that was previously dedicated to a generation facility that was later retired but did not see any new development by 2050 (see, “Methods”). Given the higher capacity density per unit of land of natural gas-fired generation, it is unsurprising that despite the substantial fraction of natural gas in the retirement mix, a smaller fraction of land becomes available due to natural gas facility retirements (702 km2 under business-as-usual and 770 km2 under high renewables). The largest land availability comes from pre-existing wind retirements. A substantial portion of this is due to increased capacity density assumptions by 2050 where pre-existing lower capacity density wind retires and new higher capacity density wind is developed, using less project land space. In some states, especially those that had higher amounts of pre-existing wind, we see that the total land use can even be smaller. For others, such as Arizona, Montana, and Utah which currently have less wind, they see a large increase in land use by 2050. Note that the net change in land use is particularly sensitive to capacity density assumptions of future wind. This is discussed more in Section “Sensitivity analysis of increasingly restrictive siting policies identifies cases where projected generation needs cannot be met, implying the need for policy coordination” where we explore the sensitivity of capacity density assumptions as well as in the “Limitations” section.

Previous studies have evaluated historic land-use conversion and buildouts in wind and solar farms, and then use those findings to infer land use impacts under future energy pathways4. The expectation set by this method is that recent developments can serve as indicators of future development barriers and siting opposition, which may or may not be the case. Our geospatially explicit analysis allows us to track the locations of individually sited and retired power plants under each scenario. Figure 2 presents projected cumulative power plant additions and retirement locations under both the business-as-usual (Fig. 2a) and the high renewables scenario (Fig. 2b) from 2025 through 2050. Figures showing the changes in deployments and retirements in each 5-year timestep for both the business-as-usual and high renewables case are provided in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2. From Fig. 2 we can see clusters of solar PV and wind deployments in key subregions of each state in both scenarios. Notably, we see large amounts of wind sited in central Montana, southeastern Wyoming, southern and northern California, along the Columbia River marking the border of Oregon and Washington, and in eastern Colorado. For solar PV, the larger clusters are found throughout Utah, with smaller pockets scattered in California, Colorado, and Arizona. We observe from this figure how the additional capacity deployed under high renewables (Fig. 1) is primarily projected to be sited as larger clusters of wind and solar deployments in the same areas that business-as-usual sees deployments.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the scope of project area land use under different pathways. Projecting the placement and quantity of deployments at a high resolution facilitates additional insights and impacts. From an environmental perspective, studies have shown that land use change can impact biodiversity and the behavior of species38,39,40,41. Solar PV arrays have also been linked to changes in soil properties such as soil moisture, microbial activity, and pH levels42,43 and have been found to impact water runoff and erosion in the siting area44,45. In addition to environmental concerns, there is also research that highlights the negative human and social impacts of development such as changes to the character of the landscape and job dislocation40,46,47. Large power plant projects are also often located in communities that are more likely to face hardships (e.g., have high levels of poverty)48. Siting in these areas can exacerbate difficulties already seen in these communities if project benefits are not equally distributed to those locally impacted. These communities can face displacement or reduced accessed to land, without necessarily seeing the advantages that may come with a project such as decreased energy costs40,47,49.

New energy infrastructure development can also lead to positive economic impacts. New generation, renewable or non-renewable, can lead to job growth and local economic stimulation and it is important to consider all associated benefits as well as costs. Co-locating solar on agricultural land can provide additional benefits including reducing heat stress on the solar panels and reduced drought stress on crops50,51. Wind farms, similarly, have also been co-located with land used for agriculture and livestock grazing given the relatively small land cover directly converted due to the large spacing between turbines52. These opportunities can also increase the economic value for the land owner51. With mindful collaboration and planning and consideration of impacts and tradeoffs, synergistic benefits can be identified for multiple parties.

More than half of all projected land use for new power plant infrastructure in the Western US by 2050 under a high renewables scenario is located within DACs or near natural areas

We use the geospatially explicit siting projections under the high renewables and business-as-usual scenarios to evaluate how much land for new power plant development intersects with various types of land not generally used in current policies to exclude siting. Figure 3 shows cumulative power plant additions and retirements under the high renewables scenario by 2050 overlaid on top of federally identified DACs as of 2024 (3a), important farmland (3b), and composite natural areas plus the surrounding 1 km area (3c). See Supplementary Fig. 3 for the business-as-usual case.

The results shown in Fig. 3 have several high-level takeaways. First, we note that DACs (Fig. 3a) are prominent in the Western US and can cover greater than half of state land area in some cases. An overwhelming fraction of the census tracts in the state of New Mexico, for example, fall under this categorization53. The amount of land supporting power plant infrastructure located in DACs is projected to grow from 1200 km2 in 2020 to over 8000 km2 under business-as-usual and to over 11,800 km2 under high renewables by 2050. When looking specifically at solar PV and wind, we find an additional 1783 km2 of land for onshore wind and 1690 km2 for solar PV is projected to be sited in DACs by 2050 to achieve a high renewables scenario over the business-as-usual case (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for all intersection values). California, Montana, and Utah especially, are projected to see increases in development within DACs for these technologies. As noted earlier, large utility-scale wind and solar development can have a range of positive and/or negative impacts at the community scale (e.g., on jobs, health, ecosystems). We find that 45% of DACs in the Western US that are projected to see the retirement of at least one coal-, oil-, or natural gas-fired power plant by 2050 also see new renewable investment (solar PV, solar CSP, or onshore wind) by 2050 under high renewables (49 US census tracts in total).

Important farmland in the Western US (Fig. 3b) is a composite of US Department of Agriculture-identified prime farmland, farmland of state importance, farmland of local importance, and farmland of unique importance54. Most of the important farmland in the Western US is attributed to the category of farmland of state importance and exists mostly in eastern Oregon, southeastern Washington, and the California Central Valley. Under the high renewables scenario, 1689 km2 for wind development and 1089 km2 for solar PV development are projected to intersect with these areas by 2050. The smaller intersection with these high value agricultural areas is a reflection that farmland qualification in the Western US is fewer than our other layers (DACs and natural areas). This result would naturally be different in the Midwest and Great Plains regions of the US, which both have a greater quantity of land with better physical and chemical characteristics and moisture supply for agricultural production.

The composite natural area layer (Fig. 3c) demonstrates the immensity of natural areas in the Western US. The shaded areas in this diagram represent areas that are within or less than 1 km away from land protected for preservation, conservation, viewshed, recreation and similar reasons as of 2024 (e.g., national parks, national monuments, critical habitat areas, marine sanctuaries). We can see that many of the projected power plant sitings by 2050 are close to or within these areas. Given trends in local exclusions based on natural area preservation11,18,26, these types of locations may be particularly susceptible to siting opposition. Our additional analyses that looked at sitings within 5 km and 10 km of natural areas revealed a substantial amount (>4800 km2 and >5700 km2, respectively) of intersections with these areas in the state of California alone (see Supplementary Fig. 4). Across all Western US states, these analyses reveal that 75% of projected land usage for new infrastructure by 2050 under a high renewables scenario may be located within 10 km of natural areas. This indicates that natural areas could be a particularly influential factor in future infrastructure siting in the region and that further evaluation of tradeoffs and alternatives may be needed.

Sensitivity analysis of increasingly restrictive siting policies identifies cases where projected generation needs cannot be met, implying the need for policy coordination

Estimating resource generation potential is an important consideration for future energy planning. Important factors include the consideration of geospatial heterogeneity of siting limitations, spatiotemporal variance in generation potential in projected futures, and uncertainty regarding projected technology advancement, policy, and social acceptance of development12. Recent research has investigated renewable generation potential under varying circumstances and through a variety of analytical techniques with these considerations in mind. These analyses often include geographical assessments of generation based on meteorological conditions or resource availability which can provide detailed generation data but may not fully reflect local siting constraints55,56,57,58. Others asses from the perspective of land feasibility and evaluate eligibility and resource potential when considering the valuation of the landscape and potential social costs, benefits, and barriers18,59,60,61,62. These assessments provide valuable boundary conditions on available generation but oftentimes do not consider future uncertainty of land-based constraints in their analysis. McKenna et al.12, which provides a thorough review of recent methods and techniques for wind valuation specifically, stresses that energy modeling of projected resource availability must not only consider the technical feasibility of siting the resource in a given location but also consider the social constraints as well as their related uncertainty.

When land exclusions are established, they may prevent siting in higher energy resource (e.g., high wind speed) areas. In this case, reaching the same generation target in lower resource potential locations will require a greater number of wind turbines or solar arrays, increasing both the spatial footprint of the renewable facility and the resulting land-use conversion and impact. Additionally, the exclusion of high resource potential areas makes the implicit assumption that the land remaining has adequate wind or solar resource potential to meet target generation—which may not be the case. We examine these issues with a series of sensitivity analysis cases.

We study the potential to reach high renewables scenario solar and wind generation levels in 2050 under 27 different siting restriction cases (Table 1). These cases range from our baseline siting restrictions (e.g., avoid steep slopes, avoid proximity to airports, [refer to “Methods”]) to cases where we add various combinations of restrictions for DACs, important farmland, three different levels of increasing environmental area restriction (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3), and three increasing amounts of spatial buffer around composite environmental areas (1 km, 5 km, and 10 km). Detailed descriptions of how these new restrictions were created are provided in the “Methods” section as well as in this manuscript’s meta-repository. Supplementary Tables 1–5 list the individual geospatial layers that are included in the composite exclusion areas.

As an example, Fig. 4 illustrates wind and solar land availability and resource potential under our baseline case #1 and for case #19 that additionally excludes DACs, important farmland, and areas within 1 km of Level 1 environmental areas. For wind, we find that the additional siting constraints decrease available land by 39% (a 737,238 km2 decrease); for solar the decrease is 27% (a 559,917 km2 decrease). By comparing the projected 2050 capacity factors within the remaining suitable land, we find an overall decrease of 60% in total wind generation potential and 64% in solar generation potential in case #19 compared to the baseline siting exclusions. This shows how siting policies can severely constrain generation potential and that robust energy plans need to consider these land use-based issues.

We evaluated all 27 cases described in Table 1 at the individual state-level, at the zonal representation of electricity trading regions (i.e., the California Grid, the Northwest Grid, and the Southwest Grid, as defined in the capacity expansion model), and at the total Western US level. For the remainder of our sensitivity analysis results presented here, we focus on the trading region scale because it reflects which states are able to transfer electricity given their transmission infrastructure. Figure 5 shows the projected solar and wind generation in 2050 in each grid region for each case as a multiple of the terawatt-hour (TWh) generation projected under a high renewables scenario. In cases where the available generation is to the left of the dashed vertical line (1x), we determine that there is insufficient generation potential from the remaining land available for siting to achieve total projected high renewables solar PV and onshore wind generation. In cases where the available generation is to the right of the dashed vertical line, enough land with adequate generation potential is available. For example, a value of 100 for wind indicates that you could generate 100x the wind generation needed using the available land and its corresponding wind resource potential after all land constraints are applied in the given scenario. We conducted this analysis under four capacity density assumptions for wind (6, 12, 18, and 24 MW/km2) and solar (15, 30, 45, and 60 MW/km2) as well as two wind turbine hub height (100 m and 120 m) assumptions. The results shown in Fig. 5 correspond to the 6 MW/km2, 120 m hub height wind case and the 45 MW/km2 single-axis solar PV case. Other results are discussed at the end of this section with additional figures available in Supplementary Figs. 5–12.

For the case illustrated in Fig. 5, our analysis shows that in 64 out of 81 (approximately 80%) possible case-region combinations (27 cases across 3 trading regions), there is sufficient available land to meet or exceed wind generation requirements for the high renewables scenario by 2050. For solar generation we see sufficient land for 70 out of 81 combinations (approximately 86%). These cases generally consist of individual exclusions (e.g., farmland or DACs), combinations with lower levels of environmental exclusion (e.g., Level 1), or combinations where the environmental buffer is 1 km or less.

In the other case-region combinations (17 for wind and 11 for solar), our findings show that the remaining available land is insufficient. This outcome occurs most often under higher levels of environmental exclusion (e.g., Level 3), and when large buffers surrounding natural areas are also excluded (e.g., 10 km buffer), though the outcomes vary by trading region. The California grid region is found to be particularly sensitive to increased environmental exclusions and buffer extents. It is the only trading region to have insufficient land to support 2050 wind generation under five scenarios: a Level 1 environment + 10 km buffer scenario (#7), a Level 2 environment + 10 km buffer scenario (#11), the two scenarios with these restrictions plus the exclusion of important farmland and DACs (#25 and #26), and the case with Level 2 environment + 5 km buffer plus the exclusion of important farmland and DACs (#23). The two other regions (Northwest Grid and Southwest Grid) each have sufficient wind generation under these cases. Cases in which environmental areas, DACs, and important farmland are simultaneously excluded affect land availability across all regions. For example, when important farmland, DACs, and the lowest level of environmental restriction (Level 1) with no buffer applied are all excluded (scenario #16), wind generation potential in the Northwest Grid is reduced by more than half.

The large fraction of cases with sufficient land suggests adequate coordinated planning can lead to situations with lower land use tradeoffs. It is worth noting that there are likely to be economic tradeoffs for renewable energy developers to avoid these areas and more analysis is needed to determine whether disincentives from an economic viability perspective would be enough to reduce total generation achievable. Larger, more expensive wind farms placed in lower capacity factor areas, for example, may be infeasible from a developmental perspective under current financial incentive structures, though positive long-term viability could still be achievable dependent on competing technologies and future energy prices. Additionally, this analysis did not include potential impacts from wake effects within and across large utility-scale wind farms63,64. This can be mitigated to some degree with wake steering65,66 and adequate planning but remains a factor that could further decrease projected production in this analysis, identifying cases where wind generation availability is lower than identified in Fig. 5.

Figure 5 demonstrates that wind generation is more sensitive to increasingly restrictive siting policies compared to solar PV, due in part to lower capacity density per unit of land assumptions. This implies a shift to solar generation may be beneficial, however, land impacts and tradeoffs from solar farms may be higher than wind farms, especially in agricultural applications as crops and solar arrays compete for sun exposure areas. Shifting onshore wind resources to offshore areas or to rooftop solar PV may be other potential alternatives, however, these are not without their own impact and cost challenges. Additional alternatives to finding land use tradeoffs for solar and wind are to deploy higher capacity density technologies. The high renewables scenario capacity expansion projections used in this experiment do not deploy large amounts of carbon capture sequestration or nuclear technologies. These technologies have their own costs and siting conflicts and can raise objections for several reasons in additional to the ones discussed in this paper.

Excluding Level 3 (moderate risk and higher) environmental areas in combination with important farmland and DACs is impactful in all three trading regions. To meet generation requirements under the high renewables scenario, viewsheds, habitats, and migration corridors may be impacted. If new transmission corridors are developed between trading regions with sufficient resource availability, fewer impacts may be attainable. The Northwest Grid, for example, has more wind resource availability compared to other regions under Level 3 environmental restrictions and could export excess wind generation to the California Grid region. Transmission expansion on this scale can be complex and costly, however. For example, the Pacific Intertie consists of a set of large capacity transmission lines stretching from the northern Oregon border all the way to Southern California. The project, which came into service in the 1960s, took decades to come to fruition, suggesting that this would not necessarily be an expeditious solution67.

We conducted this analysis across a range of assumed capacity density assumptions of solar and wind installations and around the assumed turbine hub-height. When the rated capacity per km2 of solar is reduced to 30 MW/km2, reflecting scenarios in which greater setbacks or spacing between panels is required, only one additional instance across grid regions and cases lead to inadequate generation. If this is further reduced to 15 MW/km2, the number of additional cases increases to three. In contrast, if capacity density of were to increase to 60 MW/km2, generation becomes achievable for two additional cases over the results shown in Fig. 5. For wind generation, a capacity density assumption of 12 MW/km2 decreases the number of cases that saw insufficient generation in any of the grid regions by four (13 cases in total). However, capacity density increases beyond this point were shown to have limited additional improvement, only increasing one additional case for all capacity assumptions beyond 12 MW/km2. Turbine hub-height sensitivity analyses showed that decreasing hub height to 100 m paired with each of the capacity density assumptions did not change the number of insufficient generation cases. Overall, these results imply that pathways that focus on wind capacity density improvements may have diminishing returns in helping to address land use conflicts.

This study uses results from an internally consistent, multi-model integrated framework developed by the Grid Operations Decarbonization Environmental and Energy Equity Platform (GODEEEP) project73 conducted at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The framework links a global human-Earth systems dynamics model with subnational detail in the US (Global Change Analysis Model-USA [GCAM-USA], an hourly electricity demand model (Total ELectricity Loads [TELL])74, a geospatial power plant siting model (Capacity Expansion Regional Feasibility [CERF])30,31, an hourly solar and wind generation model (Renewable Energy Potential [reV])75, and an hourly grid operations model (GridView)76. Model inputs are harmonized using a dynamically downscaled meteorological dataset following Representative Concentration Pathway 8.577, and downscaled US population78 projections following the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 scenario. Through this multi-scale, dynamic process, we project high-resolution power plant deployment and grid operations in the Western US through 2050 in 5-year timesteps for two scenarios, high renewables and business-as-usual. Figure 6 presents the multi-model framework for the experiment for a single time-step. The sections below provide more details on each of the models in the integrated chain and the specifics of the power plant siting approach and land availability analysis.

Global human-Earth system dynamics model with subnational detail for the US (GCAM-USA)

This study uses v6.0 of GCAM-USA, an open-source, dynamic recursive, human-Earth systems model that represents interactions across energy, agriculture, land, and water systems in 32 global regions, with subnational detail in the US, including all 50 states plus the District of Columbia79,80,81. GCAM-USA is a market equilibrium model that iteratively solves for a set of prices that simultaneously balances supply and demand across all markets in all regions in each modeling period (5-year time-steps). For example, model inputs for energy markets include supply curves to produce primary energy resources such as coal and natural gas, fixed and variable operating cost assumptions for electricity generation technologies (e.g., capital costs, heat rates, capacity factors), and price elasticities of demand. In the electricity market, technologies compete based on their levelized cost of energy (incorporates fixed and variable costs and assumed capacity factors). The levelized cost of energy is used in a logit formulation to address cost variability and prevent winner-takes-all outcomes in determining market shares. Based on the assumed capacity factors, GCAM-USA competes electricity generation technologies to serve different portions of a load duration curve with peak, sub-peak, intermediate, and baseload segments. For example, high capacity factor technologies such as coal and nuclear would compete to serve the baseload, while gas turbine-based technologies would compete to serve peak and sub-peak demands due to their lower capacity factors. The shape of the load duration curve is fixed in this version of GCAM-USA. It is scaled to represent the projected total electricity demand in each region at each time step.

In addition to supply curves, demand elasticities, and technology parameters, the model uses exogenous, region-specific, time series assumptions regarding population and economic growth, heating and cooling degree days, land availability, crop productivity, and runoff to calculate changing demands for energy, land, and water at each time step. The model can be forced with carbon dioxide emissions constraints or used with a reduced order climate model to target particular warming levels to represent alternative climate mitigation policies. Within the US, electricity generation, refined liquids production, and end use energy demands by buildings, transportation and industry are all modeled at the individual state level. Markets for oil, gas, and coal resolve nationally, and biomass feedstocks are modeled at a water basin scale (22 basins in the US). States are grouped to approximate the North American Electric Reliability Corporation grid regions and electricity trade is conducted across regions.

GCAM-USA simulates the high renewables and business-as-usual scenarios used in GODEEEP3 and passes its results to the other models in framework as shown in Fig. 6. The high renewables scenario includes emissions constraints to achieve a carbon-free US electricity system by 2035 and an economy-wide goal of net zero US greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The business-as-usual scenario assumes a continuation of recent policies (as of 2024), including major state-level clean energy policies but does not include national net-zero economy goals. Both scenarios include US Inflation Reduction Act incentives for clean electricity generation, building energy efficiency, clean vehicle, and low-carbon fuels are in place between the years 2025 and 2035. Both scenarios also assume that carbon capture and sequestration technologies are available. The exogenous socioeconomic drivers are based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2, and heating and cooling degree days within the US include dynamic climate impacts using a projection based on the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario.

As described in the following subsections, the other models in the framework use GCAM-USA’s state-level projections from each scenario for the annual demand for electricity, electricity generation by technology (including retirements), the national-scale projections of fuel prices, as well as GCAM-USA’s assumptions for electricity generation variable operating costs.

Power plant siting model (CERF)

CERF is a high-resolution, open-source power plant siting model30 that ingests regional capacity expansion plans and combines geospatial and economic analysis to determine feasible on-the-ground siting locations on a 1 km2 grid to evaluate the power plant landscape over time. CERF identifies sites for both renewable and non-renewable technologies using a suite of geospatial siting suitability data for dozens of specific power plant technology configurations (e.g., cooling types, turbine types, with or without carbon capture). By integrating the detailed geospatial suitability data31 with an economic algorithm, CERF selects optimal plant locations based on factors like grid interconnection costs and the locational marginal value of new generation (Fig. 7). These technology-specific sitings are provided on a 1 km2 basis in the form of x/y coordinates using the Albers Equal Area Conic projection. For this study, CERF evaluates the GCAM-USA electricity system expansion results for 11 states in the Western US: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

CERF’s geospatial technology-specific suitability data determine the available installed capacity for each technology type that can be sited in a 1 km2 area. For non-renewables, this corresponds with the total project capacity (e.g., natural gas combined cycle capacity of 727 MW6). For wind and solar PV this corresponds with the rated capacity of the wind turbines and the solar arrays that can be placed within a 1 km2 area. For solar, we conducted an analysis of the spatial footprints of existing single-axis utility scale solar projects in Western US states82 and evaluated the total rated direct current (DC) capacity per project area assuming 75% of project land area is allocated to solar arrays directly10. This analysis showed that the majority of values fell in the range of 20–60 MWDC/km2. A value of 30 MWDC/km2 was chosen for CERF single-axis PV model runs as it aligned with assumptions provided in the literature which estimated capacity density of solar PV based on a best-fit analysis of values found in the previous studies which gave a value of 30.0583. Recent studies have shown that rated capacity densities of new installations of solar may be in the higher portion of this range68 and that previous literature may be underestimating the available capacity. Higher capacity densities for solar PV would decrease the total amount of land required. However, recent increases in setback requirements may limit improvements in this space18. To account for this uncertainty, the exploratory sensitivity analysis presented in Section “Sensitivity analysis of increasingly restrictive siting policies identifies cases where projected generation needs cannot be met, implying the need for policy coordination” evaluates single-axis solar PV capacity densities between 15–60 MWDC per km2 to evaluate projected future generation under a range of rated capacity scenarios. We additionally discuss the implications of lower capacity density assumptions for solar PV in the “Limitations” section.

Rated wind capacity per km2 can vary considerably by project due to differences in required turbine spacing, turbine characteristics, setbacks, and a multitude of other factors. Recent estimates of individual rated wind turbine capacity place the value at approximately 3 MW6 per turbine and projections of average rated capacities in 2035 are 5.5 MW per turbine84. Due to the computational complexity of the integrated experiment, a simplified approach is used to allocate rated wind capacity to km2 for CERF model runs. In our experiment we assume approximately three wind turbines per km2 based on an assumed rotor diameter of 130 m6 and spacing of 3–4 rotor diameters apart while noting that these are typically highly site- and technology-specific components. While this method does not capture site-level variation, it offers a tractable approximation for large-scale integrated experiments where more detailed modeling is infeasible. Future research in this space aims to enhance this modeling to capture local factors that influence turbine spacing and wind farm layout. The spacing between turbines is heavily dependent on primary wind direction which is not currently considered in the modeling and remains an area for future development. Under multi-directional wind conditions or when turbines have longer rotor diameters, for example, the required spacing between turbines can be much higher, leading to lower capacity density assumptions85. The total available rated wind capacity assumed in the CERF model is the sum of the assumed rated capacity across turbines in each km2, which is assumed to increase over time. For 2025 and 2030 runs capacity density corresponds to 12 MW/km2, for 2035 and 2040, this corresponds to 16 MW/km2, and for 2045 and 2050 runs this corresponds to 21 MW/km2, representing large technological advancements and land use efficiency improvements over time, aligning with recent trends in wind technology scaling84,86. These values are higher than historic estimates found in the literature9, which gives an average of just over 5 MW/km2, however, these estimates are only for plants operational prior to 2009 and rated turbine capacities have since increased86. Other literature suggests that most capacity density per km2 estimates for wind overestimate land allocated to spacing areas and include spacing areas between turbine clusters and areas on wind farm edges87. These researchers found that removing these areas led to a mean installed power density of nearly 20 MW/km2 for existing international installations as of 2021. The methodology used within this study makes it more challenging to compare to empirically-based estimates, however68. Substantial variation exists in the literature on estimating values for existing facilities. Recent estimates68 using harmonized methodologies, which were published after the completion of this analysis, have shown that values of existing sites may be even lower than 5 MW/km2 which could have large implications for future land use if future values are aligned closer to these estimates. We discuss this recent research and what it could mean for future land use projections in the “Limitations” section. To capture uncertainty related to rated capacity per km2 for wind, the exploratory sensitivity analysis presented in Section “Sensitivity analysis of increasingly restrictive siting policies identifies cases where projected generation needs cannot be met, implying the need for policy coordination” evaluates wind capacity densities in 2050 between 6–24 MW/km2 and evaluates generation at both 100 m and 120 m hub heights. There is considerable uncertainty surrounding technology advancement in future years, future work in this area aims to explore this uncertainty in the experiment modeling structure directly.

The economic algorithm in CERF determines individual power plant locations through a competitive process, considering technology-specific costs for connecting to the nearest substation and natural gas pipeline (if necessary), along with the technology-specific value of new generation in that location based on wholesale electricity prices (locational marginal prices) from GridView. Specific generation technology costs and parameters including heat rate, variable operations & maintenance, fuel cost, and technology operating life are also gathered from GCAM-USA for each timestep and factor in to the economic algorithm to determine operating cost in each location on an annualized basis30. Considering dynamic factors such as protected lands, population density, existing infrastructure, and water availability, CERF serves as a form of ground-truthing to both ensure the viability of broader expansion planning models and depict the evolution of the power plant landscape under various climate, socioeconomic, technological, and policy scenarios. Population-density based siting restrictions used in CERF are consistent with Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 population projections in each run year78.

reV renewable generation model

reV is an open-source renewable generation model that assesses resource potential given specific wind and solar farm characteristics75. In each run year, solar and wind farm configuration and location data is collected from CERF and run through reV to provide hourly resource profiles. The wind and solar models require several meteorological inputs. The wind model requires pressure, temperature, wind speed, and wind direction at the turbine hub height. The solar model requires temperature, pressure, wind speed and solar irradiance. The solar irradiance must be supplied in the form of global horizontal, diffuse normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance. A complete description of the wind and solar data preprocessing and their evaluation is described in Campbell et al.88. Climate data used in reV to create the generation output is consistent with the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (hotter) climate scenario used throughout the GODEEEP experiment77.

TELL hourly electricity load model

The TELL model74 projects hourly electricity demand over time in response to weather and climate variability. The model is machine learning-based and was trained on historical hourly meteorology and energy demand data for 54 balancing authorities in the US. TELL takes as input the annual state-level total electricity demand projections from GCAM-USA and downscales them to hourly load time-series at the county-, state-, and BA-scale. Loads across all scales coming out of TELL are conceptually and quantitatively consistent. The electricity demand projection used in the GODEEEP experiment are publicly available89.

GridView

GridView76 is a proprietary grid operations tool that models transmission and optimization of electric grid resources. Power plant locations and their grid interconnection points provided by CERF30, as well as renewable generation profiles from reV75, are imported into GridView, which solves a Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch optimization problem to determine the least-cost dispatch solution that meets electricity demand, reserve requirements, and other operating constraints. Operational costs and parameters for each technology type such as fuel cost, variable operations & maintenance, and heat rate are provided to GridView from GCAM-USA in each timestep to maintain consistency regarding operational assumptions. Hourly electricity demands are provided by TELL74. At each hour of the year, GridView minimizes the total system operating cost by selecting the most economical combination of generation units and transmission capacities, while satisfying a range of constraints. These include unit-specific constraints (e.g., generator capacity limits, minimum operating times, ramp rates) and system-wide constraints (e.g., transmission capacity limits, operating reserves, and emission constraints). The optimization algorithm (FICO XPRESS) used to solve the Unit Commitment/Economic Dispatch problem, formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming Problem (MILP), ensures that the solution is feasible in the sense that all constraints are met without violating any limits. If any incompatibility between the newly added generation and GridView’s constraints is detected (e.g., excessive generation that cannot be effectively used in the dispatch or inefficient generation to meet demand), GridView addresses the issue by shedding load or generation through appropriately designed penalties and dispatch costs. This adjustment guarantees optimality in the sense that the load balance constraint is satisfied at each simulated hour, meaning that the total generation matches the total demand (plus reserves) for each time step, and the system operates efficiently under the given constraints.

The integrated engineering and economic analysis conducted by the model produces locational marginal prices for each substation in its nodal network. These locational marginal prices are used by the CERF model in subsequent timesteps to determine net operating value from each interconnection point on the grid. Note that the substation infrastructure network is assumed to remain consistent throughout the experiment timeline. GridView was chosen as the appropriate grid operations model for the GODEEEP experiment because it is a commonly used tool by long-term and operational planners in utilities across the Western US.

Determining the land usage of power plant additions and retirements

Land usage in this analysis corresponds with project-level land use of the generation facility. Each km2 accounts for the generation infrastructure, spacing between wind turbines, spacing between solar arrays, buildings, and other supplemental infrastructure necessary for plant operation. Indirect land usage beyond the direct generation facility is not included in the total land usage. Examples of indirect land usage not covered here can include cropland for corn based ethanol production for biomass90 and mining facilities for coal, natural gas, and petroleum production91.

Direct converted land estimates are discussed in Section “30% more land dedicated to solar and wind generation is needed in the Western US under a high renewables scenario compared to a business-as-usual scenario” and provided in Supplementary Table 6 by state and technology. For wind, we analyze a range of 2–5% of project area that corresponds with directly converted land37. For solar PV, direct land use can vary considerably and was approximated based on the ratio of total land use per MW and direct land use per MW for various utility scale systems10. To capture a range of values, we analyzed direct land use for 60, 75, and 90% of project area. For all other technologies, the converted land fraction is assumed to be close to 100% of project area with minimal land available for alternative applications. The range applied to these technologies, therefore, is 90, 95, and 100%.

To calculate the land usage of pre-existing power plants that are retired in the experiment timeframe (Fig. 1) on an equivalent basis as new additions which are sited by the CERF model, point geometry locations of non-CERF-sited generation facilities were converted to 1 km2 polygon geometries by square buffering point locations by 500 m. For utility-scale non-renewable facilities, this aligned with the 1 km2 land usage assumption in CERF directly. For renewable facilities, point location data for existing individual wind turbines and solar array locations were also buffered by 500 m and then spatially joined to capture overlap as interior project space. To determine the amount of previously occupied land that became free for other non-generation purposes after facility retirement, any land occupied by new siting additions was spatially subtracted from land that saw retirement. This effectively removes land from the total that had facility retirement but then saw new generation overtake the space. This method was chosen to best represent the amount of land dedicated to electricity generation by 2050 in Fig. 1 under each scenario.

Evaluation of power plant siting interactions with DACs, important farmland, and natural areas

To gain insight into the amount of projected power plant sitings and associated land usage that intersects with areas of interest, we use high resolution geospatial raster data layers. These areas include federally identified DACs, combined important farmland, and composite natural areas. This section describes the methodology behind the projected infrastructure siting intersection analysis. Documented code to reproduce this analysis is provided in this article’s meta-repository92 (see “Code availability” section).

First, we use CERF power plant siting projections for both the high renewables and business-as-usual scenarios from the experiment workflow shown in Fig. 6 to determine the coordinates of new infrastructure sitings. Second, we overlay vector point CERF sitings on 1 km2 resolution geospatial raster representations of our areas of interest. Last, we use geospatial analysis to sum the number of intersections between power plant points and grid cell representations of indicated areas to determine the total number of km2 of sitings by technology.

Spatial representations of DACs, natural areas, and important farmland were collected from the Geospatial Raster Input Data for Capacity Expansion Regional Feasibility (GRIDCERF) database31,32 which provides a binary representation of the contiguous US that meet or do meet a specific criterion at a 1 km2 resolution.

Federally identified DACs include any census tract that is designated by the US Center for Environmental Quality as disadvantaged due to water, energy, climate, workforce, pollution, health, or transportation reasons as of 202453. Federally-identified DACs were included as an exclusion in our sensitivity analysis to capture a scenario in which these communities reject development of new power plant infrastructure due to potential adverse impacts40,47,48,49.

Important farmland includes any area designated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as prime farmland, farmland of state importance, farmland of local importance, or farmland of unique importance54. These areas have higher soil quality and moisture supply, indicating that they are valuable for agricultural purposes. We investigate the potential impacts if these lands were excluded from new power plant siting.

Natural areas are comprised of 28 unique environmental areas from the GRIDCERF database associated with undisturbed natural areas, protected natural areas, viewsheds, protected habitats, and similar. These layers can include areas such as US National Parks, national marine sanctuaries, scenic and recreational areas, US Bureau of Land Management outstanding natural areas, wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and many others. For the full list of layers included in the compiled natural area designation, refer to Supplementary Table 5.

Evaluating 2050 high renewables scenario solar PV and wind generation feasibility under various siting constraint combinations

We analyzed 27 different land suitability scenarios (Table 1) as part of our analysis to determine the feasibility of a high renewables capacity expansion plan under additional power plant siting restrictions. We began with the baseline siting exclusions for each technology (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) and layered additional exclusions including DAC areas, important farmland, three different levels of environment protection (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3), three different levels of spatial buffer around environmental areas (1 km, 5 km, and 10 km), and various combinations of each.

New geospatial raster layers were created for each of the siting suitability constraint scenarios where additional restrictions were layered onto existing siting restrictions for the given technology. For example, under the DAC scenario, the composite raster layer excludes all areas from siting that are either (1) included in baseline siting exclusion areas or (2) in a federally identified DAC. The baseline siting considerations for this analysis are consistent with Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 populations for 2050, to capture downscaled population dynamics within the 2050 GCAM-USA simulations. Baseline siting layers for solar and wind represent technology and policy siting constraints as of 202432.

Varying the degree of environmental area exclusion (Levels 1–3) is intended to determine the degree of generation potential if new areas are excluded from development above and beyond what is excluded from siting as of 2024. These include applying any current natural area exclusions that apply to either solar or wind to both solar and wind (Level 1), adding additional areas of high environmental risk (e.g., golden eagle habitats) (Level 2), and adding areas of moderate risk (e.g., golden eagle distribution) and above (Level 3). The designation of high risk and moderate risk areas is leveraged directly from U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s wind development assessment of the Western US93. Though some of the restrictions in Level 1 only apply to solar or wind, we decided to include Level 1 as an analysis to capture examples of new restrictions that exclude entire subregions from any renewable development26, regardless of whether one technology may be less impactful than another. Information with each of the individual areas included in Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 is provided in Supplementary Table 5.

In addition to varying the level of natural area protection, we also tested how sensitive results are to increasing the spatial area of existing and new environmental exclusion areas. The intention of this analysis is to determine if new policies that place additional buffers on environmental areas are particularly impactful to generation goals. One kilometer, 5 km, and 10 km were chosen as buffers to represent small, intermediate, and large buffered areas. Though there are examples of new policies that stretch beyond 10 km22, our results indicate that buffers beyond 10 km yield similar outcomes given the quantity of natural areas in the Western US.

To determine the resource potential within the remaining land area after each exclusion, we used 2050 capacity factor projections for solar and wind coincident with an Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (hotter) scenario94. The dataset employs regional atmospheric climate model results to produce wind and solar power generation throughout the contiguous US at a 1/8th degree (12 km2) resolution which was downscaled to 1 km2 for this analysis. For wind, these capacity factors are provided at the 125-meter height to be as consistent as possible with our 120-meter turbine hub height assumption used in the analysis. Total annual generation (in megawatt-hours), for each region subject to siting restrictions is determined by summing the product of the assumed rated technology power capacity in MW and the sum of hourly capacity factors in each grid cell across all hours of the year, across all available grid cells within the region.

Total area includes land used directly by each technology as well as land for clearance, buildings, roads, and other areas included in the site boundary. The sensitivity analysis was conducted under four capacity density assumptions for wind (6, 12, 18, and 24 MW/km2) and single-axis solar PV (15, 30, 45, and 60 MW/km2) as well as two wind turbine hub height (100 m and 120 m) assumptions. The sensitivity analysis results can be found in the Supplemental Information and in the paper’s meta-repository92.

Total generation potential was aggregated to various spatial boundaries including GCAM-USA trading region level, each of the 11 Western US states individually, and the Western US region as a whole (sum of all 11 states). Note that GCAM-USA electricity trading regions are approximated to state boundaries. There are three electricity trading regions in the Western Interconnection according to GCAM-USA: the Northwest Grid (Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah), the Southwest Grid (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming), and the California Grid (California). GCAM-USA trading regions are defined within the GCAM-USA model as clusters of states that have the capability to trade energy amongst one another and follow the US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration National Energy Modeling System Electricity Market Module Regions95.

The target solar and wind generation for 2050 under the high renewables scenario in each trading region is determined by summing generation across all states within each trading region in the GODEEEP GCAM-USA simulation output3. Total generation potential for solar and wind under each siting suitability scenario were compared to the target generation level to determine the ability to meet generation requirements. Scenarios in which available generation in a specified area was less than target generation for the same specified area was an indication that the remaining available land did not contain adequate resource potential to provide the total target generation.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02632-3/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2632_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-26 13:04:39.632920

The Powering the Offshore Act, introduced today, September 26, updates legislation related to offshore wind, tidal energy and the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick intertie.

“We’re unleashing Nova Scotia’s untapped potential to make our province a clean energy and economic powerhouse,” said Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau. “This means good jobs, stronger communities and more opportunities right here at home. And it means we can pay for the investment our province needs in areas like healthcare, highways and homes.”

The act changes three pieces of energy legislation:

Changes to the Electricity Act will allow power purchase agreements to keep all options open for using the tremendous resource of Nova Scotia’s offshore wind, including domestic use. Through Wind West, the Province is calling on the federal government to support the transmission infrastructure needed to export most of that energy.

Another amendment will change the generation facilities section of the Electricity Act, which has been used to designate clean energy projects outside of government procurements. Because supporting too many projects could pose a risk to ratepayers, the amendment will cap energy from these projects at their current volume of 1,140 megawatts so that no new project can be added unless another does not proceed.

Changes to the Marine Renewable-energy Act will create the ability to merge licences for tidal energy projects. This follows changes made last year that created the ability to split licences. Both changes are based on industry feedback and make the licensing process more responsive to changing business needs.

Changes to the Public Utilities Act will make it clear that Nova Scotia Power is exempt from municipal taxation and building code requirements for its capital assets – including when the utility co-owns an asset, such as the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick intertie. Municipalities receive payments in lieu of taxes from the utility for all the electricity infrastructure it owns.

Quick Facts:

the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator is starting the first phase of a licensing process to tap into Nova Scotia’s offshore wind to produce 62 gigawatts of clean energy

new sources of clean electricity added to the grid must be in the best interests of Nova Scotia ratepayers

housekeeping amendments to the Electricity Act include removing programs that have closed; tasking the Department with procurement administrator contract and fee negotiations, which is current practice; updating with neutral language; and renumbering the clauses

utilities are typically exempt from municipal taxes; the exemptions for Nova Scotia Power have been in place since it was a Crown corporation and then through the Nova Scotia Power Privatization Act since 1992

ARLINGTON — Sai Abhideep Pundla has been awake since 3 a.m. After a red-eyed flight from Las Vegas, where he briefed data center company executives and local government officials about the future of artificial intelligence, he’s back in a lab at UT-Arlington, tinkering with a prototype he thinks could solve one of the industry’s biggest challenges: how to keep data centers cool without draining finite water supplies.

Pundla, a doctoral candidate in engineering, is testing a system that cools the computer servers using a recirculating chemical refrigerant instead of water.

It’s a timely innovation. Texas is building dozens of massive data centers — some as large as New York’s Central Park — and experts say they’re expected to guzzle millions of gallons of water a year in a state facing an increasingly urgent water crisis.

Every snap of a photo, message sent, or Google search requires data, which has to go somewhere. That “somewhere” is a data center.

These massive facilities filled with servers that store and process everything we do online keep our digital lives intact. However, keeping all that data takes electricity to power the data centers and cooling systems to keep their equipment from malfunctioning. And both of those require water.

[Running Out: Texas’ water crisis — and the path forward]

While data centers currently consume a small portion of the state’s total water supply, according to the state’s water plan, some researchers warn that with droughts and population growth, data centers have the potential to help push water supplies to the brink — especially in Texas’ more arid regions.

The Houston Advanced Research Center, an independent nonprofit research organization focusing on sustainability solutions, estimates that existing data centers in Texas will consume approximately 25 billion gallons of water, or 0.4% of the state’s total water use in 2025.

By 2030, this demand could increase up to 2.7% of the total annual water use in Texas. That’s the equivalent water consumption of 1.3 million average U.S. households.

The state currently has more than 400 data center facilities, with about 70 more on the way.

“[It] may not feel like it's a whole lot at the state level,” said Margaret Cook, a researcher studying data center water use at HARC. But if massive data centers locate in small communities, she said, they may not be able to handle big jumps in water demand.

In the Texas Panhandle, for example, Amarillo residents recently held a community event to oppose five planned data centers and inform others of the potential risks to the Ogallala Aquifer, the region’s main water source that is being drained faster than it can be replenished.

“Our water sources aren’t as reliable as what would be needed for the data center,” said Madison Boyle, an event organizer.

This growing concern has highlighted the state’s limitations in tracking and forecasting water usage by emerging industries. In Texas, companies are required to report historical water consumption, but aren’t required to report how much water they expect to consume in the future or where it would come from, making it difficult for communities to plan or better manage their water supplies.

Other states are starting to act on data centers’ water use. California lawmakers recently passed a bill, which is awaiting the governor’s signature, that will require new data centers to report their projected water use before they start operations, while in Minnesota, data center developers are required to consult with the state’s environmental agency to make sure their proposed location has an adequate water supply.

Some data centers in other states are built near lakes, rivers or in colder climates where there’s natural free cooling. In Texas, many data centers are located in areas where water supplies already are under high stress, according to research by Yi Ding, an assistant professor at Purdue University’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

“You could consume the same amount of water in Texas and Iowa,” Ding said. “But the environmental burden is different because Texas is more dry.”

In the lab in Arlington, Pundla and his colleague Braxton J. Smith flip on power to a server packed with memory modules, processor chips and fans — the same components that make up massive data centers. A hum kicks in as vapor from a special liquid cools the system. No water involved.

Pundla said the industry knows their water and energy consumption is unsustainable.

“The thermal management side of data centers is now trying to play catch up” as the industry develops bigger, more powerful computing systems that need more electricity and generate more heat, he said.

The urgency to find solutions is growing. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion federal push, dubbed Stargate, to build AI data centers and their supporting power infrastructure in Texas. Without smarter cooling, Pundla’s engineering professor Dereje Agonafer said, it may come at a steep environmental cost: intensifying water scarcity, forcing homes and farms to compete with industry and disrupting aquatic biodiversity.

How data centers use water

Data centers use water in two main ways: directly, to cool their equipment, and indirectly, through the electricity they rely on.

The current Texas data center market requires 10,234 megawatts of electricity a year, which is equivalent to more than 8 million homes’ usage a month, according to the research firm Baxtel that tracks data centers and their development. Data centers are expected to help drive Texas’ power demand to nearly double by 2030.

Electricity generation also requires water, particularly to cool the natural gas, coal or nuclear power plants that generate most of the state’s electricity. That means the more electricity a data center uses, the more water is indirectly consumed.

Cook said whether data centers choose to connect to the grid or build their own power supply — some in Central Texas already are building on-site power plants — will impact their water needs for cooling.

The bigger driver of water use is the need to cool the data center’s servers, which run 24/7, generating tremendous heat that can cause servers to fail if they’re not properly cooled.

Over the years, different methods have evolved to solve the cooling problem. Traditional systems use arrays of big fans to blow cool air across the machines, but that requires a lot of electricity and the fans are notoriously loud.

Agonafer, the UT-Arlington engineering professor, said air cooling can account for up to 40% of an average data center’s total energy demand.

Seeking a more energy-efficient solution, the industry started exploring cooling servers with water. One method is through evaporative cooling: The hot air generated by servers is blown through a water-soaked material. As the water evaporates, it pulls heat from the air, which is then circulated around the servers to keep them from overheating.

There’s also liquid cooling, a method more AI data centers are adopting. Instead of cooling the air, this method cools the hardware directly. Cold plates are attached to individual chips, and a liquid — usually a mix of water and a chemical coolant — circulates through the plates, pulling heat away at the source.

Credit: REUTERS/Shelby Tauber/PoolThere’s also closed-loop cooling systems, a technique that will be used at one of the world’s largest AI data center now being built outside of Abilene as part of Stargate. In a closed-loop system the cooling fluid — the Abilene project will use water — circulates in a sealed circuit. The fluid absorbs heat from the electronic components, gets turned into vapor, then is condensed back into liquid, continuously recirculating through the system.

The data center will initially use 8 million gallons of Abilene city water to fill the cooling system. Jeremiah Bihl, an assistant director at Abilene’s water utility, said that total is minimal compared to the city's average daily use of 22 million gallons.

After that initial fill, the system will need some additional water, but Bihl couldn’t say how much or how often. He added that occasionally the system will also need to be completely drained and refilled for maintenance. But he said the center’s water use isn’t expected to put a deep dent in the city’s overall water supply.

“We may be the white elephant of all the other AI centers out there, just because of the kind of cooling system that [the data centers] have,” he said.

Tracking how much water data centers use is complicated

Texas’s water planning process is built on historical data. Long-term projections of the state’s water needs by the Texas Water Development Board rely on past usage trends and historical reported water use.

Experts say this model can leave the state’s water supply vulnerable to fast-moving growth of new industries like data centers.

“If you're having an industry that's having some kind of exponential growth in the state or just growing leaps and bounds, that historical data doesn't give you enough to go on to plan for future use,” said Julie Nahrgang, executive director of the Water Environment Association of Texas.

For example, generative AI, such as ChatGPT, uses graphics processing units, which are more complex than typical computer processors and generate more heat — which requires more water for cooling, said Ding, the Purdue professor.

The state has encountered similar issues before. When hydraulic fracturing first took off in the state’s vast oil fields, state planners were caught off guard by the immense water demand, said Carlos Rubinstein, a water expert and a former commissioner for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

He said the industry found alternatives like using brackish groundwater and reusing water.

“We managed it okay, but you can only keep managing it okay for so long,” Rubenstein said.

Credit: Ronaldo Bolaños for The Texas TribuneA similar scenario is unfolding now with data centers. There is no uniform method for reporting or tracking their water usage, and as a result, the state can’t accurately predict their future impact on an increasingly precious natural resource, according to experts.

“We have a shortage [of] water, but on the other side, we like the Texas economy,” Rubenstein said. “It's a tough balance, but we are coming to terms with the fact that water in Texas is the most limiting factor, and we need to find an answer [for meeting both].”

In 2024, the state water board tried to get a handle on data centers’ water consumption by sending surveys to nearly 70 data centers asking how much ground and surface water they used each month and who was supplying that water to them. Even though a response was required by state law, only one-third of them responded.

The consequences for noncompliance are minimal — a Class C misdemeanor with a maximum fine of $500.

In practice, the system relies on voluntary compliance or self-reporting. TWDB then validates the data in those reports. If the state knew what kind of cooling system each facility used as well as its electricity consumption, it could better estimate water consumption. But experts say companies do not always disclose that information for proprietary reasons.

In response to these challenges, the Water Development Board said it’s participating in industry conferences, reviewing new research, and working to switch data centers to another category of water user to better track them in future water plans. However, experts say data centers will likely not be reflected in state planning documents until 2032.

Cook, the HARC researcher, said she’s heard from nervous regional planners and groundwater conservation experts. Planning based on historical data “means that all of the planning that they've done is inaccurate,” Cook said. “We need to speed up.”

Doctoral students take on newer cooling technology

Inside the UT-Arlington lab, a small team is gathered around a table where the inner workings of a data center cooling machine have been laid out on a white table piece by piece.

Unlike the Abilene data center’s closed-loop cooling system, this technology uses a chemical mixture instead of water and cools the hardware directly. The refrigerant circulates through a plate mounted directly to the processing unit, the brain of a computer. As the liquid absorbs heat, it evaporates, carrying heat away before being condensed and recirculated, forming a closed loop.

This change from liquid to gas and back to liquid is a far more efficient way to remove heat than traditional air or liquid-only cooling systems, said Agonafer, the engineering professor.

""It's kind of like a refrigerator,"" said Smith, the engineering doctoral student.

The processing unit, originally cooled with fans, is now being adapted to use liquid-cooling closed-loop system. Credit: Ronaldo Bolaños for The Texas TribuneThe new technology has cut the energy an average data center uses to cool its equipment from about 40% of total energy use to 5% during lab testing. Though the current demo involves just one server, plans are in place to scale to 40 as the team fine-tunes liquid flow rates, temperature control, and pressure to minimize energy use.

It’s part of a larger, federally backed effort to transform how data centers are cooled. With a $2.84 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy’s COOLERCHIPS program, UT-Arlington is leading one of 19 projects aimed at slashing the energy and water demands of data center infrastructure.

As part of the project, Accelsius, an Austin-based company specializing in data center cooling technology, donated a rack with servers for students to test their system. The project is close to being ready for commercial use, Agonofer, the professor leading the student team, said.

Pundla, the doctoral candidate, said the technology is already drawing interest from data center companies. When the project is complete the students plan to launch a start-up company to sell the technology, with the university where it was developed as shareholder.

While there are no regulations in Texas requiring companies to adopt such systems, companies selling cooling system technology say data centers have a big incentive to bring down their power demand.

Texas law now requires large load consumers including data centers to consult with the state's main grid operator and provide details on how much power they plan to use and whether a project is planned in areas where the grid is already facing supply constraints. During this process data centers join a waitlist.

Finding ways to cut energy is more cost-efficient, said Liz Cruz, chief marketing officer at Accelsius. She said the companies she works with prefer to use electricity for computing, not cooling.

“Data centers are huge energy and water usage hogs,” said Liz Cruz, chief marketing officer at Accelsius. “So it is our responsibility as the builders of [cooling systems] to make the most sustainable decision.”

Floodlight made multiple inquiries to the federal Office of Community Development about those reports and the question of coastal relocation but never received a response.","Leaving the tight-knit community his family had called home for five generations along the Louisiana coast was one of the hardest things Chris Brunet has had to do.

But three years ago, he felt he had no other choice.

The Gulf of Mexico’s swelling waters were gradually consuming Isle de Jean Charles — the narrow strip of land in Terrebonne Parish that has been the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s.

“This is where I was awakened to my Native American identity,” Brunet says on a sticky late afternoon in August as he sits in his wheelchair, gazing upon the tattered remains of his family’s island home. “I would want to be here if I had any choice in the world.”

In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving fishing community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government.

The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres but has shrunk to about 320 acres due to erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, manmade canals and sea level rise spurred by climate change.

Isle de Jean Charles is a shell of a place once filled with life. The remaining strip is now dotted with the dilapidated homes of those who fled; a few properties are used as recreational camps by their owners.

Brunet says it’s hard to watch his beloved Louisiana coast wash away.

“I never expected that relocation was going to happen in my lifetime,” Brunet said. “Now that I see that it has happened, it’s not a celebration.”

This new chapter for former island residents is no fairy tale. They say their new homes are substandard, with rainwater seeping through doorways, malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards causing costly repairs.

“I just wish they would have given themselves a little bit more time to try to prevent so many of the issues that we had over here,” Brunet said. “Some things that immediately just broke down right away — whether it be electrical, whether it be plumbing, whether it be exterior, interior.”

And ironically, their new community — dubbed New Isle — could literally become an island surrounded by water if predictions of accelerating coastal land loss and inland flooding come to pass.

What was supposed to be a model for how the government could get people out of harm’s way along the country’s steadily eroding coastlines has instead become a cautionary tale for the estimated 2.5 million Americans who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years.

Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the United States. But leaders there have rejected a controversial nearly $3 billion plan — paid primarily by BP to compensate for a massive 2010 oil spill — designed to shore up the coastline.

And Louisiana has no further plans to help residents and businesses move away as rising water, hurricanes, storm surges and flooding eat away at the land underneath them.

In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found the United States has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way — and “limited” funds to do so.

Some of that money is being targeted for elimination by the Trump administration, which is seeking to defund the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which has provided $4.5 billion to mitigate harm from natural disasters and climate change. Trump also has cut about 10% of the Federal Emergency Management Agency staff, arguing states should be in charge of their own disaster relief.

In Alaska, more than 30 indigenous villages face imminent relocation due to flooding, land erosion, permafrost thaw or combinations of all the above because of climate change. But thus far, only one village, Newtok, has made successful strides in that direction — and even that took nearly two decades and about $60 million in federal funds.

Relocation causes rift

Brunet and the other 37 residents living on the island packed up their lives to move to a new community in Gray, 9 miles north of Houma and 40 miles north of their old homes. They are now dealing with substandard housing, and they accuse state leaders of ignoring their input in a rushed attempt to build their new community.

“It made us angry,” said Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation. “We thought we were going to have a community and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”

It was Naquin’s uncle who devised the original plan, seeing it as a way to reunite the tribe in a safer community after some had already fled the storm-ravaged island. But after the chief of another tribe, Citizens of the United Houma Nation, learned of the relocation funding, he lobbied for his members living on the island to be included.

The conflict led state officials to determine that any residents still living on Isle de Jean Charles or those whose homes had been disrupted by a 2012 hurricane would be eligible to relocate. That ended the original intent of the relocation and sparked a rift between the Choctaw Nation and the state.

Mathew Sanders was the point person for Louisiana’s Office of Community Development on the relocation. He says island residents had a “significant voice” in the process, but the state had to balance individuals’ goals with those of the tribal leaders.

“One of the things that we heard very early on in the project from the residents was that they didn’t really want either of the tribes to represent their interests,” Sanders said. “We wanted to do what the community was telling us they wanted to do. So, I would push back on the notion from either tribe saying they didn’t have a say.”

But looking back, he acknowledges that Louisiana officials — despite their experience with coastal planning and gauging flood risk — “were not prepared to really take on this type of effort.” In fact, no other state had ever attempted such a move, notes Sanders, who now works on disaster planning at the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts.

Marvin McGraw, spokesman for state’s Office of Community Development, wouldn’t say whether the agency considers the relocation a success. He said in a prepared statement that honoring the wishes and needs of “Old Isle” residents was the highest priority but “stakeholder wishes did not always align with federal laws and regulations governing the use of funds.”

McGraw pointed out that the Isle de Jean Charles relocation project was designed to relocate the community, not just certain tribal members.

“While most residents are Native American, some identify with one tribe, others with multiple tribes, and some with no tribal affiliation,” he wrote. “Federal guidelines prohibit determining eligibility for housing in the new community based on tribal affiliation.”

Louisiana: Leader in severe flood risk

Louisiana tops an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central when it comes to the amount of land projected to experience severe coastal flooding — approximately 9,200 square miles — over the next 25 years.

Those projections, released in April, were based on the assumption that the United States will honor its greenhouse gas emission goals. That means the outcome could be worse given the Trump administration’s systematic kneecapping of the climate-focused initiatives of the previous administration.

Louisiana’s coast contains 40% of the nation’s wetlands, which serve as an important protective barrier from severe storms.

For the past 20 years, Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) has led the state’s efforts to address its shrinking coastline through a master plan the agency updates every six years. That plan is essentially an unfunded wishlist of projects and science-backed initiatives designed to reduce rapid coastal land loss.

But in July, the agency cancelled the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, the nearly $3 billion centerpiece of the effort. Officials said the controversial project had become too costly and was stalled by permitting issues and ongoing litigation. The project also faced criticism from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who said it would negatively impact the coastline instead of helping it.

The project broke ground in 2023. It was designed to reintroduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into the basin, rebuilding up to 30,000 acres of coastal wetlands over 50 years. It was funded by the $8 billion-plus settlement Louisiana got from oil giant BP following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Advocates with Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, said the state was “throwing away more than $618 million” that had already been spent on the project.

Gordon “Gordy” Dove, chair of the CPRA, said the state will honor its “commitment to coastal restoration” by investing in a less costly and smaller sediment diversion project in the same area.

But Emily Guidry Schatzel, spokeswoman for Restore the Mississippi River Delta and the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf Restoration Program, called that project “outdated.” She noted the CPRA had discarded it from earlier master plans because it “failed to meet science-backed benchmarks” and couldn’t “deliver the scale or speed of land-building required to keep up with the coast’s rapid collapse.”

CPRA acknowledges the need for flood mitigation to protect businesses and people living along the coast, suggesting an organized retreat from the shoreline would be needed. But the agency says any such actions should be left to “community members and their local elected officials.”

Owners report leaking doors, broken appliances

The original plan for The New Isle settlement included more than 100 homes, walking trails, a community center, commercial and retail development and other amenities.

“We knew the money that was awarded wasn’t going to be enough,” Naquin said about the relocation project. “But we had opportunities for more funding.”

According to the OCD, the homes in New Isle would be energy efficient, able to withstand 150 mph winds, have insulation in the walls, ceiling and under floors; certified energy-efficient appliances and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Brunet grew up loving the marsh, the sound of boats slicing through swamp waters, the quiet stillness and wildlife encounters that came with living along the coast. He knew living in the suburbs would bring unforeseen challenges.

One thing he didn’t anticipate was their new homes breaking down.

Brunet’s neighbor, Kristi Naquin, says the handles on her front door leak from rainwater. During strong downpours and hurricanes, they put down towels to keep the water out. The shower also leaks onto the floor, she said. And the dishwasher and air conditioner have malfunctioned.

And Naquin says it feels like the house is leaning and there’s no insulation. She and her husband, Simon, Chief Deme Naquin’s brother, have had to pay for repairs.

“I’m honestly pissed,” Naquin said. “We should not have this many complaints. We should not have this many problems. It should have been (built) better than what it was.”

She added: “To come to a house that is falling apart, and we got no help, no help at all. They just washed their hands of us.”

Sanders had already left his position with the Louisiana development agency by the time construction began. But he says there was a sense of urgency to get New Isle developed because the state had a deadline of 2021 to use the federal money or risk losing it.

“You know, that’s a very short timeline to build out a 500-acre development,” he said, noting the COVID-19 pandemic slowed construction. “I mean, that’s almost impossible.”

In response to the complaints about the quality of the homes in New Isle, McGraw says all items that were under warranty were timely handled by the building contractors. After the warranty period on items had expired, he said, “responsibility for repairs shifted to the residents.”

Community-driven relocation touted

University of New Orleans urban planning Professor Marla Nelson and Traci Birch, director of the Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio at Louisiana State University, recently wrote about the pitfalls of relocation initiatives in that state. The best approach, they say, is to deeply involve the people who need to move away from the coast.

“It’s about the individuals and communities coming to the decision that, ‘Hey, you know, this isn’t viable to live here anymore,’ and what can be done to help expand people’s options,” Nelson said. “How do we empower individuals and communities who want to move, or need to move, to move?”

Renia Ehrenfeucht, professor of community and regional planning at the University of New Mexico, was a co-author on the piece. In 2018 and 2019, the three interviewed nearly 60 former residents who lived on the Louisiana coast and more than two dozen coastal planning professionals to understand the factors contributing to household decisions about relocating or adapting to sea level rise.

They concluded that even though residents living along the Gulf Coast recognized the need to relocate, the loss of historical ties, family bonds and cultural connections made them hesitant to leave. Local elected officials perceived the loss of tax revenue from property buyouts as “politically unacceptable.” And without funding or policies to relocate entire communities, many people decided to “focus on today’s problems” instead of the “problems of the future.”

Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, dubbed Louisiana’s Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline:

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.

If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.

All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.

All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

While that state has acknowledged the need for relocation since 2005, the researchers wrote that no agency in Louisiana has developed the funding or infrastructure to do so.

“True management would mean we’re thinking through the process from beginning to end,” Birch said. “There’s kind of ‘Do nothing.’ And then on the other end of the spectrum is, ‘We’re going to move everybody all at once.’ But the reality is, most of life happens somewhere in the middle.”

‘This conversation is hardly happening’

Cultural anthropologist Maida Owens along with Shana Walton, coordinator of the Bayou Culture Collaborative, have spent the past few years leading workshops discussing environmental adaptation, climate migration and relocation planning.

When asked if cities are ready for the shifts in population that climate-driven relocation will cause, Owens replied, “The simple answer is ‘no.’ ”

“It’s hard to get people to prepare for storms and hurricanes. It’s even harder for them to think about all this,” Owens said. “It’s hard because our brain is ‘Get fed today.’ I need food for today, and I’ll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. And that’s just as true for government officials.”

Owens, a Baton Rouge native, grew up enduring major hurricanes. But it was rain and floods in 2016 and 2017 that sent Owens and Walton into the climate preparation business. Owens said it was the flooding in 2016 that swamped most of the Baton Rouge metro area and damaged or destroyed over 100,000 homes.

For Walton, “What really tipped my boat was a heavy precipitation event in 2017 where I watched my car float away down the street in New Orleans … and this is just rain!”

Now they run relocation workshops aimed at the public and state and local officials.

There are many challenges government leaders need to consider: Is their infrastructure sufficient to withstand climate impacts? Is there housing for relocatees? Are there jobs for the people once they arrive?

“It just gets immensely complicated, really quickly,” Owens said. “Within (Louisiana) state government, this conversation is hardly happening.”

At the federal level, then-President Joe Biden’s administration tried to start the conversation about a national relocation effort. It published two reports identifying next steps federal agencies could take toward community-driven relocation and existing federal resources to get started.

But all traces of those reports were scrubbed shortly after Trump took office.

Floodlight made multiple inquiries to the federal Office of Community Development about those reports and the question of coastal relocation but never received a response.

“I think states and local governments need to lean in on the idea that they’re going to have to be engaged in relocation activities before they think they need to,” said Sanders, formerly of the Louisiana Office of Community Development. “They need to really take this seriously before it becomes a dire sort of emergent situation like it was in Isle de Jean Charles.”

High insurance costs driving coastal retreat

And even if the water is not wiping out homeowners — yet — the cost of insurance might be.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, said sharply rising property insurance premiums caused by climate-fueled disasters are already prompting people to move away from the coasts. And the cost of insuring homes there is convincing the companies themselves to pull out.

“(Insurance companies) are a pretty good witness of what’s coming at us and they’re saying, ‘Hey, coastal areas, wildfire adjacent areas, we’re outta here’,” Whitehouse told reporters in July during an interview hosted by Covering Climate Now.

Whitehouse, one of the loudest voices on Capitol Hill when it comes to climate change-related issues, says historically when coastal areas were hit by hurricanes and floods, the federal government would swoop in to help people rebuild. But that doesn’t mean they can — or should — stay.

“The fact that it’s going to continue to happen and continue to get worse and worse and worse, this isn’t like a one off thing where you come in and rebuild the house and everything’s back to normal,” Whitehouse said. “This is a continually degrading situation.”

Scientist Joshua Elliot argues the federal government must step in to subsidize insurance programs tied to flooding if they want coastal areas to remain habitable.

“At what point does the cost of inaction then become so great that it overcomes the political will for inaction?” said Elliot, chief scientist for Renaissance Philanthropy, a nonprofit that works on climate mitigation, including “advanced research for climate emergencies.”

“There are things that can be done,” Elliot said. “And there are things that are being done. Although, we need to do a whole lot more if we actually want to get ahead of this problem and not end up instead in the position of having to play catch up when it’s too late.”

If carried out, the project would also support jobs at Centrus’s centrifuge manufacturing plant in Tennessee and throughout its manufacturing supply chain, which currently spans 14 major suppliers in 13 states.

Awaiting contracts: Centrus is one of several companies chosen in late 2024 to compete for federal enrichment contracts and recently submitted proposals to the Department of Energy. Four potential HALEU enrichers were announced in October, and two laser enrichment companies were added to the four for a total of six potential LEU contractors announced in December. Since being named, all six companies have signaled they are eager for enrichment task orders from the DOE.

Centrus: Centrus was named for both LEU and HALEU enrichment and claims the status of “the only active enricher that uses American technology and manufactures centrifuges and supporting equipment exclusively in the United States.” The DOE extended Centrus’s existing HALEU production contract by one year in June.

General Matter: General Matter emerged from stealth mode in fall 2024 to be named for both LEU and HALEU enrichment, and in August signed a lease with the DOE’s Office of Environmental Management to build an enrichment facility at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky and gain access to depleted uranium hexafluoride for reenrichment.

Urenco USA: Urenco USA, which operates an LEU enrichment facility in Eunice, N.M., was named for both LEU and HALEU enrichment, and announced in May that it had initiated production in its newest centrifuge enrichment cascade, the first in a 15 percent site capacity addition to be completed in 2027.

A state of readiness: Centrus’s potential expansion would be supported by more than $1.2 billion raised in a pair of convertible note transactions over the last 12 months and more than $2 billion in contingent purchase commitments from utility customers in the United States and around the world, according to the company, with other potential investments from industry partners.

Centrus says it has begun hiring in anticipation of the expansion and is partnering with JobsOhio—a private nonprofit economic development corporation—to identify and recruit potential job applicants.

“The time has come to restore America's ability to enrich uranium at scale,” said Centrus CEO Amir Vexler. “We are planning a historic, multibillion-dollar investment right here in Ohio—supported by a nationwide supply chain to do just that.”

Support in Congress and the governor’s office: Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, and U.S. Rep. Dave Taylor all back the expansion.

""Centrus’s commitment to expand and upgrade its Piketon facility underscores Ohio's importance in supporting our nation's economic and national security,"" said DeWine. ""Uranium enrichment operations in Piketon have played a critical role in U.S. national defense since the earliest days of the Cold War, and Centrus’s facility provides the only technology available today capable of building out domestic enrichment at an industrial scale.""

The total savings for this project, including PF and lower interest costs, is estimated to be $8,319,897 over the 30-year term of the loan, or 60% of the total project costs as compared to the authority financing it independently.

In addition, this project created an estimated 166 direct single-year construction jobs.

A CHP system runs on a fuel source, often natural gas, biogas, or even methane captured from the wastewater treatment process to generate electricity through a turbine or engine. Biogas produced during the digestion process is captured and refined through a gas conditioning system and then used to fuel a combustion engine connected to 1,000 KW power-generating units.

Unlike traditional power plants, which waste much of the heat they produce, a CHP system captures that heat and puts it to work for things like heating buildings, drying solids from sewage, or powering the treatment process.

More energy is produced from the same fuel, resulting in less waste and lower costs. This efficiency is particularly important in the water treatment industry which requires a lot of energy. Innovative facilities like the GCUA are proving that proactive investment in alternative energy pays off for budgets, ratepayers and the planet.

The electricity generated by the GCUA CHP will directly power the wastewater treatment facility, significantly reducing reliance on the electrical grid.

With this system in place, the GCUA anticipates operating at, or near net-zero energy.

In the Commonwealth Fund’s State Scorecard on Climate and Health, researchers ranked Kentucky as 50th overall among the 50 states and District of Columbia for health impacts of electricity generation emissions, flood risk posed to health care facilities, energy efficiency policies, health sector greenhouse gas emissions and more. Only West Virginia ranked lower.

Michael Seilback, the nationwide advocacy and state public policy expert at the American Lung Association, said the pollution in Kentucky’s air contributes to asthma attacks, lung cancers and premature death.

“When we turn on a light switch, we don’t often think about where that energy is coming from,” Seilback told the Lantern. “And what we’re talking about here is that these power plants that are fueled from coal — the burning of that coal to produce energy produces massive amounts of emissions.”

Kentucky’s longstanding loyalty to coal is “a major contributor to the state’s poor grade” in this report, Seilback said. About 68% of Kentucky’s electricity generation came from coal in 2023, the third-largest share among the states after West Virginia and Wyoming, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“Often we think about how much energy you’re using in your house, and that’s relevant, but the question is, ‘where is that energy coming from?’” Seilback said. “If you were able to say all of Kentucky was being powered through wind, solar, hydropower, there would be less of a concern about using electricity because you weren’t producing all those emissions.”

This report “should be another data point for decision makers to say ‘we really need to move away from fossil fuels and towards green energy, which will improve the health of Kentucky residents,’” Seilback said.

Cabinet for Health and Family Services data shows 12,266 people visited emergency departments in Kentucky for asthma treatment in 2024. There were more than 1,000 hospitalizations, as well, and 34 deaths related to asthma that same year. Air pollution can cause asthma, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, as well as worsen its symptoms.

“The exposure to these pollutants are literally shortening people’s lives,” Seilback said.

Kentucky has the nation’s highest rates of cancer and lung cancer.

Among the eight indicators on which each state was evaluated, Kentucky ranked best on risks facing health care facilities from natural hazards, defined as vulnerability of health care facilities to natural hazards. “On average, health care facilities in Kentucky are located in areas facing less risk from natural hazards than facilities in other states,” the report states.

At the same time, Kentucky’s number of inpatient beds in high-hazard flood zones significantly raises the flood risk to the state’s health care facilities, according to the report.

Hawaii ranked worst on health harms from electricity generation, the report said, because of the islands’ high use of petroleum to generate power. Kentucky and West Virginia ranked next worst. The researchers quantified health effects of power plant pollution by using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) — described as “a common measure of the burden of disease, representing years of healthy life lost” — to calculate “the standardized health burden for every unit of electricity generated.”

“In Kentucky, emissions from electricity generation result in more negative health impacts per unit of electricity than in other states,” the report says. “Negative health impacts are represented by years of healthy life lost.”

The commonwealth is joined by Louisiana and West Virginia as the worst-ranked states overall, meaning they “face more frequent and intense hazards and lack supportive energy and environmental policies.”

The highest ranking states in the report are Vermont, New York and Washington, meaning those states “have lower environmental risk and vulnerability as well as stronger decarbonization and clean energy policies.”

Dr. Joseph R. Betancourt, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, said in a statement that “I hope this scorecard inspires states to learn from one another’s efforts to reduce pollution, prepare for environmental risks, and better protect people’s health.”

Heavy reliance on coal has eroded a KY economic advantage. Can Trump reverse the trend?

“As a physician, I have seen firsthand how closely the environment and health are linked,” Betancourt said. “People are better off when they can breathe clean air and when the hospitals they depend on are prepared for extreme weather.”

Calls to action for Kentucky and beyond

The Commonwealth Fund, founded in 1918, is a private foundation seeking to improve the country’s health care system through independent research and grantmaking. The report recommends a series of policies for states and health systems to consider. They include:

Prioritize decarbonizing energy sources and improving efficiency, through mechanisms like renewable portfolio standards and updated building energy codes, to reduce emissions and protect public health.

Set health care decarbonization goals and incentivize performance improvement through payment reforms in Medicaid as well as private and employer insurance.

Require standardized, verified and transparent reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, strategic planning, and mitigation targets by health care facilities and their suppliers.

Prioritize building resilience to extreme weather; expand public health investment in relief centers and early warning systems, especially in high-risk areas.

Assign executive-level sustainability responsibility and employ designated leaders at each health care facility.

Collect and report sustainability and resilience data in areas prioritized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and The Joint Commission.

Purchase reusable and environmentally preferable products and champion waste reduction and clean energy.

Seilback, with the Lung Association, said the Trump administration’s moves to undo “many air quality protections” have put more responsibility on states to act.

“Without a strong federal government, we really need state and local bodies to step up,” he said. “We want to see more investments in the wide range of cleaner, greener technologies.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47652/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/img_5813-1024x7681758884203.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=ED8XdWLF,N,,2025-09-26 09:59:35.500674

World Maritime Day

On World Maritime Day, attention turned to the role of ports in powering the clean energy transition.

Today’s joint event between C40 Cities and Arup highlighted how subnational governments and cities are already proving what’s possible when ambition meets innovation, celebrating the launch of our joint report: ‘Ports as Clean Energy Hubs’, which highlights strategies to decarbonise ports and boost socioeconomic benefits, improving public health and unlocking local economic opportunities.

The ports in California have an indispensable power and influence over the global economy. 40% of all goods entering the United States and 30% of everything that leaves passes through California’s ports. In the world’s largest economy, imagine how much room for impact there is there. We are leaning into the power of ports, and as leaders, we are taking it very seriously. That’s why we thank the C40 team for your leadership. It is shining through.

Good green jobs

A new report from C40 Cities, the Climate Migration Council, and the Mayors Migration Council revealed the scale of opportunity in the green economy: Green jobs in cities are set to represent almost half of all jobs in construction, transport, and waste management by 2040.

But with up to 6 million roles at risk of going unfilled, action is needed now. The report called for two new key shifts:

Scaling up skills training for local workers

Easing barriers to migrant employment in the climate sector to ensure no community is left behind in the transition

Dealing with extreme weather in cities

Earlier today, Mayor of Montréal, Valérie Plante, along with journalist Maeve Campbell, UN-Habitat (United Nations Human Settlements Programme)’s Director for Africa Oumar Sylla, and The Climate Group’s CEO Helen Clarkson, focused on the tangible and real solutions cities are implementing to support their residents both proactively and reactively.

Their discussion highlighted cities’ efforts to address major challenges through practical and effective measures.

We deliver essential city services, but the climate crisis demands more. Unprecedented flash floods – a month’s rain in just two hours – are overwhelming our sewage system. Replacing the entire underground network is costly and slow. Our immediate solution? We’ve implemented ‘sponge infrastructure,’ able to capture the equivalent of four Olympic pools of water, gradually releasing it to protect our city. This action isn’t just about solving flooding; it’s a commitment to our residents, immediately reducing risk while longer term helping with insurance, affordability, and the sustained value of their homes.

Recent data from CARFAX reveals a significant surge in the sales pace for electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids. This acceleration in consumer purchasing is occurring as the federal tax credit for these vehicles approaches its expiration, even as prices remain stable.

Key Highlights

EV and hybrid sales have accelerated by approximately 30% since the beginning of summer.

The federal tax credit, offering up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used eligible vehicles, is set to expire on September 30.

This sales spike marks a major departure from the overall vehicle market, which has remained steady.

Despite the sharp increase in demand, CARFAX data shows that prices for EVs and hybrids have not seen a significant increase.

Market Reacts to Expiring Tax Credit

According to CARFAX, the demand for EVs and hybrids has broken from traditional sales patterns. Analysis shows that while overall vehicle sales have remained mostly flat, the market for electric and hybrid models is experiencing a notable spike. This shift in consumer behavior is directly linked to the imminent end of federal incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The program provided significant tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and select plug-in hybrids and $4,000 for used models. With Congress voting to end these credits, September 30 is the final day for a purchase to be eligible.

“EV and hybrid sales are spiking, yet prices remain stable,” stated Patrick Olsen, Editor-in-Chief at CARFAX. “For shoppers considering a purchase, experts say now is the time to act.”

CARFAX Tips for Used EV & Hybrid Buyers

For those navigating the used EV and hybrid market, CARFAX provides the following recommendations:

Do Your Research: Always review a CARFAX Vehicle History Report to check for reported accidents, service history, and previous ownership details.

Know Your Budget: Explore financing options ahead of time and remain flexible on makes and models that fit your financial plan.

Take a Test Drive: Get a feel for the vehicle’s performance, comfort level, and unique features before committing to a purchase.

Ask Questions: Inquire with the seller about the vehicle’s history, battery health, charging requirements, existing warranties, and included accessories.

Get an Inspection: A pre-purchase inspection by a trusted mechanic can identify potential issues that are not visually apparent.

I remember the first Earth Day in 1970. I read about it in my “Weekly Reader” (a popular educational newspaper for schoolchildren in those days), and discussed it with my teacher. She was the same teacher who advised us not to ride gas-operated mini-bikes as it was harmful to the environment.

It was an exciting time to come of age. Environmental awareness had creeped into the American consciousness. It was a time when a river in Ohio made international news by catching on fire and our cities were experiencing the choking haze of worsening air pollution. People just knew something had to be done about it.

That first Earth Day was universally celebrated by both political parties. It was that same year that then-President Richard Nixon (a Republican) signed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

It is impossible to talk about that first Earth Day, and what the distinguished author Douglas Brinkley calls the “Silent Spring Revolution” and the “Great Environmental Awakening,” without first mentioning a fearless and courageous woman, Rachel Carson.

Rachel Carson’s watershed book “Silent Spring” was published in 1962 and is often credited as the linchpin to the modern environmental movement. In the book, Carson warns of the dangers of widespread use of DDT and other pesticides. Of course, she was viciously attacked by the chemical industry.

When Nixon created the EPA by executive order in 1970, it was in response to this rising environmentalism and was almost immediately effective in setting about to reduce pollution. State and municipal governments soon followed suit.

These ideas were not radical. They were about protecting the commons, the air that we breathe and the water that we drink. Today, I feel as though the EPA is retreating from these important accomplishments. One step up and two steps back, it would appear.

Last month, the EPA published its repeal of the endangerment finding, which provides the legal underpinning for limiting greenhouse gas emissions from cars and other sources. The EPA administrator said, “Today marks the death of the Green New Scam.” I think we need to be careful about oversimplification and sloganeering.

It was the EPA, under the authority of the Clean Air Act, that established standards for limiting the amount of lead in gasoline and other emissions, including carbon monoxide. I remember filling my motorcycle up with leaded gasoline when I was in high school. Leaded gasoline was extremely harmful, especially to children.

Years later, during port calls in developing countries, I could personally witness the harmful effects to people in places that did not have these same protections and regulations. It took decades to phase out the use of leaded gasoline. How long will it take us to recover from misguided actions we might be undertaking today?

I am a sailor, not a scientist, but it just makes sense to protect humanity and all living things on this rapidly warming planet. Undoing the regulatory framework that Nixon put in place in 1970, over a half a century ago, is misguided. Touch gently the earth our children and grandchildren rest upon.

Pertamina Geothermal Energy and Toyota are working to create an ecosystem for green hydrogen, expanding opportunities for geothermal energy in Indonesia.

PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGEO) and PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia (TMMIN) have signed a joint declaration to develop an ecosystem for green hydrogen in Indonesia. The signing of the declaration was announced as part of this year’s Indonesia International Geothermal Convention and Exhibition (IIGCE) in Jakarta.

The joint development agreement is founded on the possibility of supplying green hydrogen produced from geothermal energy to future hydrogen-based vehicles. This also builds on the recent groundbreaking of a green hydrogen production facility at the site of PGEO’s Ulubelu geothermal power plant in Lampung.

“Although the economic aspect remains a challenge, PGE is optimistic that green hydrogen can be a clean energy solution if supported by the right ecosystem and business model,” said PGEO President Director Julfi Hadi in a written statement. He further added the green hydrogen is only one of the alternatives to power generation that PGEO is pursuing, as the company continues to seek for geothermal applications and derivative products that benefit society and the environment.

“Indonesia needs a variety of energy sources, from affordable to premium, low-emission fuels. Geothermal energy could be one of the pillars of clean energy in the future,” added TMMIN Technical Director Widjanarko.",https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Jakarta_traffic.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:04:26.384158

So now they just call it climate change because that way they can’t miss.
Climate change, because if it goes higher or lower, whatever the hell happens, there’s climate change.
Climate change, no matter what happens, you’re involved in that.
Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. contributed $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund, which is an element of the pact and helps lower-income countries combat climate change.","In an hourlong address before the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 23, President Donald Trump lashed out at those promoting “the green energy agenda,” saying it had left many European countries “on the brink of destruction” and dismissing climate change as a “hoax” and “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

Along the way, Trump made numerous false and misleading claims about renewable energy and climate change, many of which we’ve fact-checked before.

Wind Farms in China

Trump wrongly claimed that while China sells most of the world’s wind turbines, “they have very few wind farms.” In fact, China has more wind farms than any other country in the world, by far.

“Most” wind turbines “are built in China and I give China a lot of credit,” Trump said. “They build them, but they have very few wind farms. So why is it that they build them and they send them all over the world, but they barely use them? You know what they use? Coal. They use gas. They use almost anything, but they don’t like wind. But they sure as hell like selling the windmills.”

As we’ve written, it’s true that China dominates the wind turbine manufacturing market. According to Wood Mackenzie, a research and consulting firm, China led the global wind turbine manufacturers’ market share in 2023, accounting for 65% of global wind capacity.

But it’s not accurate to claim that China has very few wind farms. To the contrary, according to Global Energy Monitor, which produces data on energy infrastructure around the world, China had an operating wind farm capacity of about 444,000 megawatts, as of February. That’s about 44% of the global total and nearly triple the capacity of the U.S., which ranks second. China also ranks first in the number of operating wind farms, with 31.5% of the world’s total. That’s nearly five times the total in the U.S., which ranked fourth (Germany and France were second and third, respectively).

In a video address to a U.N. climate summit on Sept. 24, China’s president, Xi Jinping, vowed that China would double its wind capacity over the next decade, according to the Financial Times.

Trump also wrongly claimed wind energy is the “most expensive energy ever conceived” and that it can’t exist “without massive subsidies.” As we’ve explained, offshore wind energy is currently very expensive, but nuclear energy is typically the most expensive power type. Power generated from wind turbines on land is cheaper and has a similar or lower cost as natural gas and coal plants, even without subsidies, when using the standard measure of levelized cost of electricity.

In addition, he misleadingly mocked wind energy as “not strong enough to fire up the plants” and useless when “the wind doesn’t blow.” As we’ve written, wind power does come with extra variability, since the wind is not always blowing. Intermittency “would be a problem if we were trying to build an energy system that relied 100% on wind power,” Columbia University’s Matthew B. Eisenson told us for our February story. “But nobody is trying to do that.” People don’t lose power when the wind isn’t blowing because wind is one of many energy sources coming into the electrical grid.

Global Warming Not a ‘Hoax’

The president blamed tens of thousands of heat-related deaths in Europe each year on a lack of air conditioning, which he said is “all in the name of pretending to stop the global warming hoax.”

For a number of reasons, Europeans historically have used air conditioning to a much lesser degree than Americans. But it’s false for him to call global warming a “hoax.”

There is overwhelming evidence that the planet is warming and that it is being driven by human activity, as NASA says, and as we wrote in 2024. The most recent National Climate Assessment in 2023 similarly said, “Human activities — primarily emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel use — have unequivocally caused the global warming observed over the industrial era.” As more carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases have been emitted into the atmosphere over time, land and ocean temperatures have risen, along with sea levels. On the other hand, sea and land ice have declined.

And temperatures in Europe in particular are increasing “at around twice the global average rate,” according to the World Health Organization. An August 2024 UN News report, citing the WHO, said, “A staggering 175,000 people die from heat-related causes every year in Europe and that figure is set to soar in line with our steadily warming planet.”

Using the Phrase ‘Climate Change’

Trump wrongly claimed that climate scientists have stopped using the term “global warming” because the Earth “started getting cooler” and “now they just call it climate change because that way they can’t miss.”

“You know, it used to be global cooling,” Trump said. “If you look back years ago in the 1920s and the 1930s, they said global cooling will kill the world. We have to do something. Then they said global warming will kill the world, but then it started getting cooler. So now they just call it climate change because that way they can’t miss. Climate change, because if it goes higher or lower, whatever the hell happens, there’s climate change. It’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion. Climate change, no matter what happens, you’re involved in that. No more global warming, no more global cooling.”

For starters, climate scientists have not stopped using the term “global warming.” As we wrote last year, it is still commonly used in academic papers — the term has appeared in more than 100,000 papers over the last two years, according to a Google Scholar search. It specifically refers to the long-term warming of the Earth’s surface.

Climate change includes global warming but is a broader term that can refer to other effects on the planet, including sea level rise, extreme weather and shifts in precipitation. The term is distinct and did not replace global warming.

Contrary to Trump’s suggestion, there was never a broad consensus from scientists that the Earth was cooling the way there is now that the planet is warming. And it hasn’t gotten “cooler.” While temperatures do not necessarily rise each year in each location across the globe, the trend of rising average surface global temperatures over time is unmistakable.

The four hottest years on record, according to NASA were 2024, 2023, 2020 and 2016.

Paris Agreement Funding

Trump also defended withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 Paris Agreement to address climate change, which he misleadingly suggested was requiring the country to spend about $1 trillion.

“America was paying so much more than every country,” Trump said. He added, “For the United States, we’re supposed to pay like a trillion dollars.”

But the agreement didn’t stipulate each participating country pay a certain dollar amount. In part, it said “developed country Parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing country parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation.” Developed countries agreed to collectively contribute a minimum of $100 billion annually to developing nations for initiatives reducing emissions.

We didn’t find a figure for how much the U.S. has spent in total because of the Paris Agreement specifically. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. contributed $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund, which is an element of the pact and helps lower-income countries combat climate change. And under President Joe Biden, according to a November 2024 State Department update, the U.S. gave more than an estimated $27 billion for “international public climate finance” to developing countries.

When we asked for the source of Trump’s $1 trillion figure, the White House pointed to Biden administration policies. “President Trump was right – globalist Joe Biden forced American taxpayers to fund ridiculous climate goals and stifle our economy,” Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, told us in an email.

A July 2024 Politico analysis said that four major bills that Biden signed into law authorized about $1.6 trillion for “climate, energy and infrastructure initiatives” in the U.S. But that level of funding, some of which Trump has halted, wasn’t required by the Paris Agreement, as Trump’s remarks suggested. That funding also included money for non-climate projects, such as highway construction, lead pipe removal and semiconductor manufacturing.

Coal Not So ‘Clean’

While making a claim about energy reserves in the U.S., Trump again called coal “clean,” which it is not.

“I call it clean, beautiful coal,” Trump said. “You can do things today with coal that you couldn’t have done 10 years ago, 15 years. So I have a little standing order in the White House, never use the word coal. Only use the words clean, beautiful coal.”

But as we wrote this year, the Energy Information Administration says that coal production and consumption can negatively affect people’s health and the environment. For example, the EIA explains that burning coal emits toxic pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses and lung disease, including federally regulated pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. The Environmental Protection Agency also notes that more carbon dioxide is emitted from coal combustion than from any other energy-producing fossil fuel.

“At the present time, coal is not cleaner than its alternatives,” Joost de Gouw, a chemistry professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, told us for our April story. That’s despite the majority of coal-fired plants already using systems to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, he noted. “Compared with natural gas power plants that use combined cycle technology (the industry standard), current coal-fired power plants emit roughly 10 times more nitrogen oxides and 100 times more sulfur dioxide per kWh of electricity produced,” he said, referring to kilowatt-hours.",https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/China-Wind-Farm-720-x-307.png,N,,2025-09-26 11:04:36.446536

The United States Power Equipment Market is expected to expand immensely from US$ 8.96 Billion in 2024 to US$ 13.85 Billion by the year 2033. This expansion demonstrates a strong Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.96% over the years between 2025 and 2033. The drivers for the expansion are technology improvements, a higher demand for effective power solutions, and a developing emphasis on sustainability in many industries.

The fact that power equipment is versatile renders it irreplaceable in most industries such as agriculture, where tillers and tractors enable extensive farming activities. Generally, power equipment increases productivity, conserves time, and enhances the quality of work in numerous applications across the USA.

Growth Driver in the United States Power Equipment Market

Infrastructure Expansion and Urbanization

The speed and scale of infrastructure development and urbanization throughout the U.S. is a key driver of the power equipment market. From broad transportation initiatives to residential development projects, construction zones need dependable generators, compressors, and other power equipment. Federal and state-level investment in roads, bridges, and clean energy initiatives are spurring demand for tough, high-performance power equipment.

Urbanization and smart city development also drive the demand further for optimized solutions that are capable of handling high workloads while being energy efficient. As of November 2024, over $568 billion of IIJA funding had been obligated toward 66,000 state-level projects, ranging from bridges to roads, airports, and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.

Shift Toward Renewable Energy Integration

The U.S. power industry is more committed to renewable energy, and this has fueled high demand for solar panels, hydro turbines, and related electrical components. Tax credits, government incentives, and more stringent emission policies promote companies and households to use clean energy solutions. With increasing renewable capacity, power equipment like inverters, smart cables, and grid connection systems are experiencing increased adoption.

This change not only supports sustainability but also enables long-term prospects for solar and hydro equipment manufacturers. Feb 2025, SolAmerica Energy and Radiance Solar have inaugurated the Stephenson S1 Solar Project, 2.86-megawatt in size, located in Freeport, Illinois. This partnership is a demonstration of their commitment to making renewable energy available in the state and Radiance's 26th community solar project in Illinois, which cemented its industry leadership.

Growing Residential and Backup Power Demand

Increased frequency of extreme weather events, as well as the requirement for efficient electricity in suburban and rural communities, are boosting adoption of residential power equipment. Homeowners are increasingly making investments in backup generators, solar panels, and state-of-the-art energy storage solutions to provide uninterrupted supply during power cuts. The growth of remote work and digital lifestyles has also boosted domestic dependence on efficient power solutions.

This constant housing demand creates a strong foundation for the U.S. power equipment industry together with massive industrial uses. As of 2023, the refining operation capacity of the United States totaled 18.24 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Additionally, the United States refining capacity is expected to grow substantially in the next few years, thanks to the imminent projects.

Challenge in the United States Power Equipment Market

High Capital and Maintenance Costs

Power equipment, particularly generators, solar panels, and hydro systems, requires substantial initial investment. Maintenance and operating expenses further contribute to the burden, making adoption challenging for small enterprises and low-cost households. There are available finance options, but high interest rates can deter investment. This financial barrier hinders increased penetration of sophisticated technologies, especially in the renewable energy and domestic markets.

Supply Chain and Regulatory Uncertainty

The U.S. power equipment industry relies considerably on international supply chains for materials and parts like semiconductors, metals, and advanced electronics. Interruptions caused by geopolitical tensions, transportation bottlenecks, or trade barriers tend to cause delays and price fluctuations. Moreover, changing federal and state regulations related to emissions, safety, and energy efficiency compel frequent design changes, increasing costs for producers and lowering production cycle predictability.

To kickstart this new initiative, DOE has issued a request for information (RFI) seeking comments from state energy offices, public utility commissions, electric utilities, regional transmission organizations and independent system operators, transmission and generation developers, large energy users, and other stakeholders. The deadline for comments is 5:00 p.m. ET on November 21, 2025.[1]

DOE’s new initiative and RFI seek to identify novel strategies to implement four Trump administration executive orders[2] aimed at increasing domestic energy supply and grid reliability and removing obstacles to rapid U.S. load growth. This is especially critical in areas where rapid energy demand growth—driven by the explosion of energy-intensive data centers, artificial intelligence (AI) facilities, and emerging advanced manufacturing—is outstripping grid and generation capacity. In July DOE published a resource adequacy report, “Evaluating the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid,” which identified that planned facility retirements, absent adequate replacement capacity to meet rising demand, could increase the risk of blackouts one hundredfold by 2030.

To address these nationwide risks with urgency and focus on regions where need is greatest, DOE hopes to leverage existing programs, including grant programs like the Transmission Facilitation Program[3] and the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program[4] as well as loans and loan guarantees for transmission and generation through DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO). DOE is also interested in providing technical assistance, such as access to advanced modeling and analytical capabilities through DOE’s National Laboratories, to help stakeholders evaluate challenges to infrastructure investment.

In particular, DOE is interested in advancing large-scale projects (or portfolios of smaller projects) that enable and support incremental load enhancement of 3 to 20 gigawatts (GW). This includes new interregional transmission of at least 1,000 megavolt-amperes (MVA) and upgraded existing transmission of at least 500 MVA to support additional load coming onto the grid as well as new generation assets and revived conventional energy projects that have recently retired or otherwise plan to go offline in the coming years. To achieve this, DOE is soliciting feedback from stakeholders regarding specific generation and transmission projects that could help it meet its objectives: high-priority geographic regions in which to focus its investments; novel ideas for use of DOE’s legal, technical, and funding assistance to drive rapid growth; and load growth trends, particularly with respect to emerging demand for AI, data centers, manufacturing, and grid infrastructure challenges and constraints.[5]

Note that this RFI constitutes preliminary fact gathering by DOE and will not result in any immediate project funding or support. After assessing feedback, DOE is likely to issue one or more notices of funding opportunities (NOFOs) further advancing the administration’s energy objectives. Although DOE has requested that commenters identify potential projects and challenge areas with specificity and supporting data, DOE also notes that comments should avoid commercially sensitive or confidential business information.[6]

Takeaways and Potential Opportunities and Challenges

For large-scale transmission projects, the Speed to Power initiative represents an opportunity to explore new and creative ways to secure funding, including potential collaborative partnerships with DOE, as well as potential pathways to accelerated infrastructure buildout. This opportunity may be particularly of interest for interregional transmission developers, as interregional transmission projects face significant challenges in disjointed transmission planning processes despite the significant efficiency and reliability value they can offer. In particular, opportunities to leverage DOE as an anchor-tenant to procure capacity on proposed interregional lines before large loads or resources serving them are prepared to make a capacity commitment may help get such projects financed and off the ground.

Only the largest generation assets will be able to meet DOE’s 3 GW minimum, but portfolios of new and revived generation assets could also be clear beneficiaries, especially where new generation is sited in areas of rapid data center demand growth. Regions where demand is particularly acute can be found using a tool created by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) that shows particular need in Texas, the greater Washington, D.C., area, and other less obvious markets like Reno, Nevada.

DOE’s materials make no reference to renewable energy, consistent with the Trump administration’s position on utility-scale wind and solar energy. Other forms of nonfossil generation are poised to benefit, such as nuclear (both new and previously decommissioned projects specifically called out in the RFI) and geothermal energy, both of which have been prioritized by the administration. Battery storage projects and regional transmission that may provide benefits to renewable and intermittent generation sources could still be beneficiaries, but such projects will need to think carefully about how they present themselves to DOE in order to fit within the department’s current operating mandate. In addition, transmission and grid upgrades emerging out of California’s recent passage of AB 825, which moves toward a region-wide electricity market supporting grid stability and resilience across the western United States, could be good candidates for future Speed to Power opportunities.

[5] The RFI solicits information on whether one of the primary barriers to expanding infrastructure and deploying large-scale generation and transmission projects is siting and permitting. How to solve this challenge remains top of mind for both the administration and Congress. On September 17, 2025, the congressional Problem Solvers Caucus announced its endorsement of a bipartisan permitting reform framework as momentum builds for Congress to act on permitting reform. The recommendations in this framework offer a bipartisan roadmap to streamline the permitting process, boost energy production of all kinds, and give investors clarity and confidence. This framework was developed by the Problem Solvers Caucus Permitting, Energy & Environment Working Group, led by Reps. Scott Peters (CA-50) and Gabe Evans (CO-08), along with Co-Chairs Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) and Tom Suozzi (NY-03).

If the case proceeds, Quinn said, the plaintiffs aim to have climate attribution experts testify about Duke Energy’s specific impacts on climate change and the differences if more committed changes to renewable energy were made.
That means that, as a utility, Duke Energy would’ve provided the exact same energy mix, would’ve contributed the exact same emissions, despite the fact that there’s an alleged deception.
After the proceedings, Nowell said he was not surprised by the angles of Duke Energy’s response to Carrboro’s approach.
“Obviously, [climate change] is a global issue and obviously there’s a certain sense of systemic, complicated causality.","The Town of Carrboro presented its legal rationale for continuing a 2024 lawsuit against Duke Energy on Thursday, laying out its standing for suing over damage suffered to the town’s infrastructure caused by climate change, about which Carrboro contends the utility company deceived the public.

Deliberations over whether to approve Duke Energy’s motion to dismiss the case took place across five hours in the Wake County Courthouse, with the town and energy corporation’s representation running the legal qualifications and validity of their arguments by Judge Mark A. Davis of North Carolina’s Business Court.

The civil lawsuit, which was filed last December, focuses on Duke Energy’s efforts to promote fossil fuel energy options while downplaying the impact on climate change and convincing the public fossil fuels were safer than alternative energy options. Attorney Matt Quinn, who is representing the local government, said such efforts — ranging from funding anti-renewable propaganda to deliberately transitioning from fossil fuels at a slow rate — caused “material changes” in people’s preference of fossil fuels for energy and personal use. The town is seeking financial damages for property damage suffered in extreme weather, which it claims has gotten worse and more frequent as a result of climate change.

The case is one of the first of its kind, where a public entity like a government seeks to use common tort law to receive damages from an energy company or utility — and, concurrently, hold a large-scale polluter publicly accountable for their contributions to global warming through carbon emissions. As such, Thursday’s hearing featured Judge Davis asking detailed questions to understand both parties’ arguments through the lens of legal standing, whether the case could be pre-empted by federal laws and if it should be dismissed over a political nature.

While pressed by both Davis and Duke Energy’s representatives about whether the case was about the company’s emissions or regulations, Quinn conceded it is a chief factor into why the local government believes climate change has worsened. But the town’s representation maintained the stance of focusing on Duke Energy’s deception of the public when it came to knowing the environmental cost of increasing fossil fuel use. Quinn compared it to the 1999 litigation between the federal government against tobacco companies, where the cigarette manufacturers deceived the public regarding nicotine addiction and adverse health effects of smoking — saying because of Duke’s efforts to argue fossil fuels were safe while downplaying renewable energy options, people are now paying the price with physical threats from extreme weather. If the case proceeds, Quinn said, the plaintiffs aim to have climate attribution experts testify about Duke Energy’s specific impacts on climate change and the differences if more committed changes to renewable energy were made.

When asked by Davis whether Carrboro is arguing that Duke Energy should presently be using 100% renewable methods, Quinn was quick to state the goal of the lawsuit is not to directly regulate the energy giant and step on the toes of state or federal law.

“In our complaint, we considered the question Your Honor is asking,” Quinn said. “And what we’ve alleged is: we’d be materially further along [in using renewable energy options] and the climate crisis would be much less acute if Duke had not engaged in this deception. That’s going to be a topic in discovery if, in your mind, that should happen.”

During the hearing, Duke Energy’s argument of pseudo-regulation was one of its interpretations for why the case should be dismissed. Attorney Sterling Marchand contended Carrboro’s representation kept shifting its scope of people deceived by the business — from customers, to the country, to the world — and argued how Carrboro could single out the utility company when specific carbon emissions cannot be traced like other pollutants. The representation also questioned how the level of public perception around fossil fuels could be quantified based on Duke’s messaging and credited the North Carolina Utilities Commission, a state-run body that takes feedback from the public, for directing energy policy.

“They have a ton of allegations about emissions, they have a bunch of deceptions – many of which are not even attributable to Duke – and then they talk about global climate change,” said attorney Hunter Bruton during Duke Energy’s initial rebuttal. “Today, despite talking about regulators in the complaint, they concede no regulator’s decision would have been different but for Duke’s deceptions. That means that, as a utility, Duke Energy would’ve provided the exact same energy mix, would’ve contributed the exact same emissions, despite the fact that there’s an alleged deception. Therefore: [the resulting] climate change would have been the exact same as it was because, in North Carolina [as] a single utility provider, Duke Energy listens to the Utilities Commission.”

Davis wrapped up the courtroom session by having the parties add a supplemental briefing to the calendar in four weeks, after which he will share his ruling on whether to grant Duke Energy’s motion to dismiss or let the lawsuit proceed.

Throughout the hearing, several Town of Carrboro leaders visited the courtroom — including Mayor Barbara Foushee, Mayor Pro Tem Danny Nowell, Council Members Randee Haven-O’Donnell and Cristobal Palmer, and Town Manager Patrice Toney. After the proceedings, Nowell said he was not surprised by the angles of Duke Energy’s response to Carrboro’s approach. He added, though, that he believes the town has “clear” ground to stand on for taking this action on behalf of Carrboro residents.

“We know Duke [Energy] knew about the climate crisis earlier than they indicated, they knew about their contribution to the climate crisis earlier than they indicated, and they pivoted to a greenwashing campaign that obscured their knowledge of their emissions role in the climate crisis,” Nowell said. “Obviously, [climate change] is a global issue and obviously there’s a certain sense of systemic, complicated causality. But in this instance, we’re talking about Duke Energy — which is one of the largest corporate polluters in the world — intentionally deceiving the public and profiting off of a climate crisis earlier than most of the rest of us did.

“It feels gratifying,” he added about seeing the lawsuit through to this point. “We want to see our case go through the process, we wanted to have our moment — and the other moments we expect to have — in court. I think we took a fairly bold step because we are resolved on our commitment to the values that we expressed in this case and I think we’re equally resolved now. And it’s hard to imagine that our resolution will flag any time soon.”

Duke Energy released a statement through a spokesperson after the hearing on Thursday, saying: “We are committed to our customers and communities and will continue working with policymaker, regulators and other state leaders to deliver reliable and increasingly clean energy while keeping rates as low as possible.”

California had discussed offering its own program, but now says it will not

California will not offer its citizens a $7,500 tax rebate on the purchase of a new electric vehicle (EV), after all.

The federal government’s own EV tax incentive expires at midnight on Sept. 30. The IRS has said car shoppers can still apply for the credit if they have signed a binding contract to buy a car and paid a down payment by that time, even if they don’t take delivery until after the month ends.

The end of the credit has triggered a spike in EV sales as buyers rush to claim the credit while they still can. Analysts from Kelley Blue Book parent company Cox Automotive expect EV sales to fall off dramatically when the credit ends, though they will likely grow again slowly from there.

California state officials had discussed creating a matching program of their own. But Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) told reporters last week, “We can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits.”

The state will continue to build charging infrastructure, he said, but not offer direct subsidies to car buyers.

California accounts for more than a quarter of the nation’s EV sales most months. Reuters explains, “That market heft positioned the state as the best alternative for EV incentives.”",https://kbb.com/m/14cad80f0f1b8ec5/OG-Golden-Gate-Bridge-Traffic-Fire-Orange-Sky-jpg.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 05:57:59.211518

The reduction eases a major burden on EU automakers and is a chief selling point for the deal as presented by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The deal is retroactive to Aug. 1 so “what we expect now is that the tariffs will be returned to the automakers as of the first of August, which is something like 500, 600 million euros per month,” Sefcovic said ahead of a meeting with Southeast Asian trade ministers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The 15% tariff is still much higher than tariffs from before Trump took office, which averaged in the single digits, and the trade deal has been criticized by business associations and some members of the European Parliament.

Sefcovic said most member states supported the deal and that after detailed exchanges and presentations on the details he expected lawmakers would support it as well.

If Louisiana doesn’t move decisively, the jobs, investment and future of energy leadership will move without it.","Louisiana has a proud tradition of leading the way in American energy. Our state has powered the country for generations and now stands at the forefront of another energy and sustainability revolution: carbon capture and sequestration. But if we allow fear and misinformation campaigns to shape public policy, we risk turning a winning hand into a lost opportunity.

The good news is that Louisiana was one of the first states in the country to secure what’s called federal “primacy” for carbon capture regulation. That means our state doesn’t have to rely on Washington to greenlight these projects — we can do it locally and responsibly, with our own experts and agencies. The industry responded and our citizens are benefiting. Today, there’s more than $20 billion in proposed CCS investment across the state.

In March, Gov. Jeff Landry and President Donald Trump announced the arrival of Hyundai Steel Company’s first North American steel mill, a $5.8 billion investment in Ascension Parish. Expected to begin construction in 2026, the facility will create approximately 1,300 direct jobs — averaging $95,000 annually — and an estimated 4,100 indirect jobs throughout the region.

Notably, this project is only possible because of our state’s emerging CCS infrastructure, which provides Hyundai with a path to meet global decarbonization goals while operating in one of the world’s most competitive industrial corridors. It’s a shining example of how we can grow our economy and reduce emissions, all while strengthening our workforce and communities.

This kind of momentum doesn’t happen by accident. It’s the result of smart, forward-looking decisions by state leaders. But momentum is fragile. And lately, it’s been at risk.

In the most recent legislative session, a wave of proposals emerged that would add new restrictions, slow permitting and inject confusion into a process that has, so far, positioned Louisiana ahead of its peers.

While some of these proposals stem from genuine concerns, many are fueled by politics and influence from out-of-state activist groups that are opposed to the oil and gas industry. If partisan politics or misinformation are allowed to derail CCS in Louisiana, the only real winner will be Texas.

For years, Louisiana has set the pace across the Gulf Coast region when it comes to attracting energy and industrial investment. But that lead is narrowing.

While misinformation fuels debate and delays in Baton Rouge, neighboring states, especially Texas, are moving quickly to streamline permitting, encourage innovation and attract capital. Mississippi and Alabama are making strides, too. If Louisiana continues to create uncertainty in the process, we risk falling behind and taking the region’s momentum down with it.

Investors and developers have choices. They want to go where the rules are clear and consistent. Texas offers certainty, speed and strong state support, with its final hearing for CCS primacy quickly approaching and full approval expected by the end of the year.

Louisiana still has a chance to lead. We can build on our early decisions, talent and momentum, and become the national hub for safe, responsible carbon storage and utilization. That will bring jobs, investment and a more sustainable future.

Or we can allow partisan noise to mire us in confusion and second-guessing, all the while watching others seize the moment.

LSVs are designed for usage in limited and use in local transportation including airports, tourist attractions, golf courses, hotels and resorts, residential and business complexes, and others. Utility and off-road vehicles are utilized for commercial and personal use in slow-speed areas.

Significant factors impacting the increasing investment in low-speed, owing to the upsurge in demand from the developing nations, technological advancement in the automotive industry coupled with increasing investment and support from the government for the development of low-speed electric vehicles market. However, the high price of batteries used in these vehicle are restricting the market growth.

According to the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highway in 2022 there were approx. 1,037,011 electric vehicles registered within the country, which accounted roughly 6.4% of the overall automobile sales within the country. Moreover, in 2021, the government released a handbook guide to EV infrastructure in India the focuses on the development of infrastructure in the country. In 2021, the publicly accessible charging station accounted for 900 in India, which jumped to nearly 11,000 in 2022. Countries around the globe are fostering the development of EVs, which is expected to provide opportunities for the low speed electric vehicle market share during the forecast period.

Governments and regulatory bodies are implementing strict regulations towards vehicle pollution; this is the major reason driving the demand for low-speed electric vehicles during the study period. The market demand for LSEV in developing countries, particularly in Asia-Pacific, is expected to be more than in developed regions in Europe and North America.

Rapid industrialization and rising disposable income drive regional growth. As rural-to-urban migration increases, customers want cheaper, greener transportation. Government measures are also advancing electric car technology, boosting growth. Over the past few decades, crude oil prices have steadily risen, shifting people’s focus from internal combustion engines to electric automobiles. This spurred manufacturers to create electric and low-emission vehicles.

For instance, in May 2022, Wuling Motors, a China-based automobile company, partnered with SAIC Motor and General Motors and developed the Wuling Mini EV, with a cost price of USD 5,000; the model outperformed the Tesla Model 3 in China. The low speed EV is only available in China, the car can carry 4 people and has some built-in standards features such as air conditioning, power windows, stereo system, storage, and compartments. Moreover, the car is also equipped with safety features such as anti-lock brakes, tire pressure monitoring sensors, and rear parking sensors.

Furthermore, on April 2022, GARIA was acquired by an American company Club Car LLC. The strategic merger between the companies will help GARIA to expand its business on a global level.

However, as electric vehicles utilize electric motors they don not emit any pollution. Major regions globally, such as the U.S., European Union, China, India, Japan, and Australia, have implemented stringent rules and legislation regarding emissions, requiring automakers to implement cutting-edge technology in their products to reduce pollution from automobiles.

For example, the Clean Air Act (CAA), which was implemented in 1963 and underwent several modifications, mandates that automakers comply to emission standards in order to sell their vehicle. Similarly, The California Air Resources Board (CARB) introduced the Zero-Emission Vehicle Regulation. The regulation is designed to achieve long-term emission reduction, which supports the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles in California and aims to achieve 100% zero emission by 2035.

WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper and the entire Democratic Caucus called out the Trump admin’s reckless decision to undermine the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) “endangerment finding,” which determined that greenhouse gas pollution harms Americans and is a serious threat to public health. The rollback would defy decades of science, EPA precedent, and Supreme Court rulings and lead to more pollution across the U.S.

“Scientists, financial experts, international governments, and the American public agree that climate change is a looming crisis,” wrote the senators. “And yet, in this proposal, EPA proposes to abdicate all responsibility to address this dangerous pollution.”

The senators demanded the Trump administration follow science and preserve the “endangerment finding.”

They also called out the admin’s justifications that “are directly at odds with Supreme Court precedent, Congressional directive, and the facts.” In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court deemed that carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons were air pollutants under the Clean Air Act “without a doubt,” calling it “unambiguous.” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin pushed a discredited Energy Department report authored by known climate deniers tied to polluting industries to justify the admin’s decision. Rife with clear errors, cherry-picked data, and misrepresented facts, the report falsely claims that human-caused climate change poses no significant risk.

Hickenlooper has long pushed for real, science-based climate policy. He played a key role in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which was the largest climate investment ever, and is fighting against Washington Republicans’ attempts to undermine the law. As Colorado governor, he worked with environmentalists and oil and gas companies to create the world’s first methane rules, which were later used as a national model by the Obama administration.

Full text of the letter is available here and below:

Dear Administrator Zeldin:

We write in united opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s proposal to rescind its 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations (the “endangerment finding”). This proposed action represents an abdication of EPA’s duty, a violation of Supreme Court precedent and Congressional directive, and a blatant failure to protect the American people.

In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities contribute to a global “greenhouse effect”, driving global warming. One hundred and twenty-nine years later, the reality of human-caused climate change is not up for debate. Scientists, financial experts, international governments, and the American public agree that climate change is a looming crisis. Greenhouse-gas driven climate change is driving extreme weather, flooding, erosion, sea-level rise, heat waves, drought, catastrophic wildfires, famine, smog pollution and other disasters. These effects drive illness, hospital visits, and deaths, as well as displacement, asset loss, infrastructure damage, rising insurance premiums, declining home values, and long-term destabilization of the national economy. The United Nations considers greenhouse gas-driven climate change a “global emergency.” The United States Department of Defense has called greenhouse gas-driven climate change a “threat multiplier” whose destabilizing effects can “enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence.” The United States emits over eleven percent of all greenhouse gas emitted by all 195 countries in the world, and has emitted over 400 billion tons of carbon dioxide since 1750, by far the most of any country. And yet, in this proposal, EPA proposes to abdicate all responsibility to address this dangerous pollution.

Apart from being a dereliction of duty, EPA’s action here is one of breathtaking hubris: the agency presents a series of alternative arguments defending its proposal, all of which are directly at odds with Supreme Court precedent, Congressional directive, and the facts.

First, EPA argues that the Clean Air Act is ambiguous as to whether the EPA may “regulate… GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions in response to global climate change concerns,” and that this issue constitutes a “major question”. The agency further argues that in light of the Supreme Court’s decisions in Loper Bright v. Raimondo, which overturned the doctrine of Chevron deference, and West Virginia v. EPA, which formalized the concept of a major questions doctrine, the agency may not regulate GHGs absent a clear statement authorizing such action. But Massachusetts v. EPA, the controlling Supreme Court case on EPA greenhouse gas regulation, left no room for ambiguity: the Court in that case found that “[c]arbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons are without a doubt” air pollutants under the Clean Air Act’s definition, and that “[t]he statute is unambiguous” on this point.

Willfully blind to this clear legal precedent, EPA argues that the term “air pollutant”, as employed throughout the Clean Air Act, refers to those pollutants that “cause or contribute to air pollution for which the air pollution itself, through local or regional exposure to humans and the environment, endangers public health or welfare.” This argument that EPA may regulate only air pollutants with direct local impacts on human health ignores both Supreme Court directive and the plain text of the statute itself. The Clean Air Act does not exclusively or even primarily address pollution on a local basis: programs like the interstate air pollution program and the national ambient air quality standards program specifically address pollution that transcends local and regional borders. Other programs, including mobile source regulation under section 202, are even broader, directing EPA to address “any air pollution” with deleterious impacts on “public health or welfare.” Notably, “welfare” is defined to include not only economic and ecological wellbeing but also specifically “effects on…weather…and climate”—a point that the Supreme Court highlighted in Massachusetts v. EPA.

The Massachusetts Court agreed that under the clear terms of the Act, climate pollution is subject to EPA regulation. The Court wrote, “[u]nder the clear terms of the Clean Air Act, EPA can avoid [making an endangerment finding] only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do.” Furthermore, the Court declared, “[i]f EPA makes a finding of endangerment, the Clean Air Act requires the Agency to regulate emissions of the deleterious pollutant” under section 202(a). In refusing to make an endangerment finding, the Court held, the EPA then, as now, “refused to comply with [a] clear statutory command.”

Moreover, Congress has contemplated tackling climate change under the Clean Air Act since the 1970s. The Act’s Statement of Purpose, noting the “mounting dangers” that air pollution poses to the “public health and welfare,” declares that the “purpose” of the Act is to protect the same. As noted above, “welfare” includes effects on weather and climate. Since Massachusetts, Congress has confirmed the Court’s interpretation by passing legislation affirming that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Act, and authorizing programs to address this pollution.

Finally, in addition to its legal arguments, EPA suggests that the endangerment finding was based on faulty science, and that “the projections [the finding] relied upon…appear unduly pessimistic in light of empirical observations made after it was finalized in 2009 through 2024.” In making this argument, EPA relies upon a report solicited and published by Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright and written in less than two months by professional climate skeptics with established ties to the fossil-fuel industry. EPA’s arguments, and those of the report’s authors, are unavailing. Climate science developed since 2009 only suggests more dire implications than were reflected in the agency’s 2009 findings. As reported by the World Meteorological Organization in 2023, the rate of climate change “surged alarmingly” between 2011 and 2021. During this decade—the hottest ever recorded—sea level rise accelerated, ocean heat and acidification increased, and extreme weather increased in frequency and intensity. In its Sixth Climate Assessment in 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that the “evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a grave and mounting threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet.” The IPCC further warned that “[a]ny further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.” It is also worth dispensing with EPA’s argument that because the endangerment finding did not consider our capacity to adapt to a rapidly shifting climate—which could include migration and projects such as sea walls and pumps—the finding itself should be discredited. This is tantamount to suggesting that EPA can set weaker standards for air pollution by assuming the public could wear gas masks.

Congress established the Clean Air Act to protect the public health and welfare, and the Supreme Court confirmed that this includes EPA’s obligation to regulate greenhouse gases to the extent they endanger the same. The science is clear that they do so. We ask that you withdraw this proposal and reverse your decision to rescind the 2009 endangerment finding.

Sincerely,

On May 3, 1978, following the installation of 32 solar panels on the White House, President Jimmy Carter launched the first Sun Day.
This celebration was curtailed a few years later by President Ronald Reagan, who did so as he removed the solar panels from the roof.
“We have solar panels, can plug in our EVs, and the house is resilient; we won’t have any outages,” said Manners.
While the current administration doesn’t support renewable power, we’re forging ahead and trying to educate others about the benefits.” “Shifting to renewable power is important because we do have to protect our planet,” said Patience Whitman of Westport.","On Saturday, Sept. 20, a small gathering of EV, Hybrid, Solar panel, and other forms of sun-generated electrical users gathered at Marcy Field in Keene to celebrate energy generated by the sun. The gathering began a week-long celebration of sun and other forms of renewable energy, now the cheapest method of generating energy in the United States.

Sun Day is being re-launched 55 years after the founding of Earth Day. On May 3, 1978, following the installation of 32 solar panels on the White House, President Jimmy Carter launched the first Sun Day. This celebration was curtailed a few years later by President Ronald Reagan, who did so as he removed the solar panels from the roof.

The Keene event is one of 450 taking place in all 50 states across the country. Believing that the growing interest in affordable energy and environmental protection created an opportunity, well-known author and environmental activist and former Adirondack resident Bill McKibben came up with the idea of reestablishing Sun Day a few years ago when he noticed that the cost of renewable energy had dropped significantly, more than ninety percent over the past 15 years. He proposed that Sun Day now be held on or just before the autumn solar equinox.

As it did under Reaganomics, once again the new Sun Day is facing political headwinds on the national level, as the current administration and congressional leadership are working to reduce or eliminate tax credits for electric vehicles, heat pumps, and solar and wind power, and making it harder to establish offshore wind farms. The difference is that now there is widespread growing interest in renewables among the general public and industry because they are cheap, and it’s not possible for carbon-based energy to meet the rapidly expanding demand for electricity.

“Solar power is longer the Whole Foods of energy — nice but pricey,” Mr. McKibben announced. “Instead, it’s become the “Costco of power — cheap, available in bulk, and on the shelf ready to go.”

The Keene Valley Congregational Church’s Environmental Justice Committee organized the Sun Day Festival in Keene as part of a Sun Day Wool Relay organized by the Adirondack Watershed Institute and Third Act Upstate New York. Sun Day activities in the Adirondacks will culminate with a Watts and Wheels Clean Energy Celebration at the Wild Center on Saturday, Sept. 27, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

The Marcy Field participants welcomed a small EV caravan bringing ten-inch circular hand-crafted wool suns en route to Albany, where they will be assembled and displayed to form a large tapestry.

“I’m involved because as a person of faith I believe in equity,” said Katharine Preston, a co-founder of Keene Valley Congregational Church’s Creation Justice initiative. “I support cheap energy for everybody, things that nobody can horde, things that people won’t start wars over. I feel expanding access to affordable renewable energy makes sense. When we heard of this opportunity to be part of a nationwide effort to increase awareness of the benefits of generating energy from the sun, we immediately signed up.”

The Keene Valley Congregational Church is one of the first churches designated as a Creation Justice church by the United Church of Christ, New York Conference.

“This designation means that we have looked at what we do, how we think, pray, and with a mind towards creation justice,” said Preston. “It’s not just in terms of loving creation and working for environmental stewardship and sustainability, but for justice; working to make sure all people can afford and have access to clean air, energy, soil, and water. Today we are working with the Sun Day organizers to increase awareness of the benefits of solar power and renewable energy.”

“For us, switching all our lighting to LED was an amazing energy efficiency move,” said Joe Pete Wilson, Keene Town Supervisor. “It cut our streetlight bill in half, saving us about ten thousand dollars a year. As a result of our work on winterizing, we qualified for a grant that enabled us to install solar panels on the highway garage, generating power and additional savings for five years now.”

The Adirondack Watershed Institute and Third Act Upstate co-organized the Adirondack Sun Day events with such partner agencies as KVCC and the Wild Center.

“We’ve had a program going for the past three years called Wool and Water that combines art and science as a way of promoting environmental education, to help educate people about our waterways, a program that’s become very popular,” said the Institute’s research director, Michale Glennon. “Last year, I was invited to attend an event with Third Act at the Lake Placid Film Festival. I jumped at it because I thought that there would be an overlap between “old and bold” people that they represent, and the fiber, music, and other people we represent.”

Out of that meeting came the idea of inviting people to create wool fiber circles, each representing the sun, that would be combined to create a large tapestry displayed at the Capitol in Albany on Sunday, Sept. 21, and again at the Wild Center on Sept. 27.

“Essentially, the idea behind Sun Day is we want people to recognize solar, wind, and other forms of clean, renewable energy are the way of the future, and now is the right time to start getting involved,” said Liz Evans, co-facilitator of Third Act Upstate New York.

Attending the Marcy Field event was Susan Manners, who lives at Hillside East, a zero-carbon community in South Burlington.

“We have solar panels, can plug in our EVs, and the house is resilient; we won’t have any outages,” said Manners. “We joined because the environmental benefits are important to us, and our panels enable us to give back to the community grid. While the current administration doesn’t support renewable power, we’re forging ahead and trying to educate others about the benefits.”

“Shifting to renewable power is important because we do have to protect our planet,” said Patience Whitman of Westport. “It’s our home and the future home for the next generations, we need to do everything we can to take care of it.

$12 Million in Power Authority Funding to Support NYSDOL Efforts to Connect Workers to Opportunities in Clean Energy Economy

DEC Announces $4 Million in Green Jobs for Youth' Program Grants in Environmental Justice Communities

Today (Sept 25), during Climate Week, Governor Kathy Hochul announced $16 Million in state funds to support the development of New York's clean energy workforce. The New York Power Authority (NYPA) approved $12 million in funding to the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) to support workforce training and retraining, and to prepare workers for employment in clean energy careers. Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) awarded $4 million in grant funding to support skills training for green jobs for young New Yorkers.

""As we transition to a clean energy future, it is essential that we equip New Yorkers with the skills and opportunities necessary to thrive in this evolving industry,""Governor Hochul said.""By investing in education and training programs, we are positioning New York's workforce to lead the way in developing sustainable energy solutions that will spur economic growth and lead us to a cleaner, healthier environment.""

Of the $12 million in funding approved by the NYPA Board of Trustees, $7 million will support the expansion and development of electric vehicle (EV) training programs specializing in maintenance and repair for vehicles and charging stations. The remaining $5 million will be allocated to the NYSDOL Support Services Fund, which strengthens the availability of supportive services for participants enrolled in a clean energy training program, including but not limited to childcare, transportation, student fees and books.

The NYPA funding stems from a commitment in the 2023-24 Enacted State Budget and will largely support the efforts of the New York State Department of Labor through their Office of Just Energy Transition (OJET) to connect workers to opportunities for jobs in the clean energy economy through upskilling and training with a focus on serving those who are traditionally underrepresented, especially within disadvantaged communities.

Last year, the Power Authority allocated $25 million for workforce development funding, demonstrating its strong commitment to building a skilled labor force for New York's clean energy future. NYPA will continue to support workforce training initiatives to support New York's workforce and meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

NYPA actively engages with each community training organization to ensure skills training is matched with needed positions and participant success through supportive wraparound services. NYPA's collaboration with the skills-training organizations include input on the classroom and hands-on technology experiences of the enrollees for promoting the requisite clean energy skills and providing guidance on training locations to ensure statewide reach of the awards.

An additional $4 million in grants are available from DEC for Green Jobs for Youth workforce funding programs developed or funded by community-based organizations in or serving environmental justice and disadvantaged communities. The initiative helps prepare youth between the ages of 17-24 for jobs in the green economy through workforce development, skills training, and certification. This grant was last offered in 2017, with approximately $1 million helping train and educate more than 370 participants and 59 youth placed into jobs to date. For a complete list of guidelines and more information, contact DEC's Office of Environmental Justice at 518-402-2600,ejgrants@dec.ny.gov, or online atDEC's Environmental Justice webpage. Questions regarding this grant opportunity will be accepted until close of business Dec. 31, 2025. Applications are due by 3 p.m. on Jan. 28, 2026.

Funding for DEC's Green Jobs for Youth Grants is provided by the State's Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) as part of New York State's ongoing commitment to environmental justice. The 2025-26 enacted State Budget increases the EPF to a record $425 million, helping support work directly in disadvantaged communities, as well as other critical environmental programs such as land acquisition, farmland protection, invasive species prevention and eradication, enhanced recreational access, and water quality improvement.

New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said,""New York is building the foundation for a greener, more prosperous New York, where anyone can participate in the state's growing clean energy sector. The $12 million in NYPA funding will directly support DOL's efforts to prepare New Yorkers for clean energy careers through thoughtful programming and initiatives that offer vital wraparound services.""

New York State Department of Labor Commissioner Roberta Reardon said,""Developing New York's clean energy workforce is a strategic investment that positions the state at the forefront of the clean energy economy while ensuring skilled workers and jobs remain right here in New York. This funding from NYPA and DEC advances NYSDOL's mission to help current energy workers pivot to green careers and prepare the next generation of clean energy professionals. I thank Governor Hochul for her leadership and continued commitment to initiatives that spur economic growth and make New York an affordable place to live, work, and raise a family.""

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said,""Green jobs are the future, and Governor Hochul recognizes the importance of equipping our future leaders with the skills they need to be successful in New York's clean energy transition and other industries that make up our green economy. The $16 million in workforce development investments, including $4 million from DEC to provide youth in environmental justice and disadvantaged communities with skills training, paving a pathway to green employment and a prosperous future for those most in need of support.""

State Senator Kevin Parker said, ""As Chair of the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee, I have made it my mission to ensure that clean energy funding isn't just an abstract goal, but a lifeline for the people of New York. This $16 million investment will open doors for workers who are ready to seize new opportunities, and for young people eager to build brighter futures. For too long, disadvantaged communities have been shut out of economic growth, but these programs bring skilled training, support services, and real pathways to good paying jobs directly to them. This is about more than clean energy it's about dignity, equity, and making sure every New Yorker has a fair shot at the future we are building together.""",https://globalrenewablenews.com/images_logo/banniere_21150.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 04:59:30.154903

This doesn’t mean non–English speakers are unaware of the climate crisis—they are often the ones most directly impacted by severe weather.

He points out that the complex language used around climate means that very few people actually understand the intensity and consequences of the climate crisis.","Wildfires and floods have dominated world news this year, impacting hundreds of thousands of people as these disasters continue to increase in intensity. Many people use these widespread events to point out that climate change does not discriminate. But the truth is, it does.

While it is correct that everyone will feel the effects of climate change, the extent to which it impacts people differs—people’s access to information and knowledge, for example, is one of the most important differentiating factors. During the wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this year, a UCLA study showed that affected communities with limited English proficiency suffered specific challenges as a result of not being able to understand alerts and information shared.

As the climate crisis worsens, we’re encouraged to talk about it, raise awareness, and take action, but what happens when people are left out at the very first step?

The Barriers of Language

Only about two billion of the world’s population of roughly eight billion people speak English. However, almost 90 percent of scientific publications are in English and a majority of the conversations around climate—particularly anything related to policy, adaptation, or disaster response—are in English as well. This means that a large portion of immigrant communities in English-speaking countries like the United States and United Kingdom, and most of the rural populations in the Global South are left out of the climate conversation.

“What you’re looking at is a situation where English is an elite language so [it] is, paradoxically, a language that unites people but also divides them. A bit like wealth….Those who have wealth accumulate more wealth, so those who [know] English have access to all kinds of information, and those who don’t are cut off,” said Mario Saraceni, associate professor in English Language and Linguistics at the University of Portsmouth, in the United Kingdom.

This doesn’t mean non–English speakers are unaware of the climate crisis—they are often the ones most directly impacted by severe weather. They also have their own unique, diverse knowledge of the land they inhabit, which can lead to Indigenous and local climate solutions that can not only stave off the worsening conditions but also be restorative. And yet, because this knowledge is often not communicated in English, their knowledge remains isolated from the rest of the world.

A large portion of immigrant communities in English-speaking countries…are left out of the climate conversation.

We push for a bigger, global solution to the climate crisis but until we make climate communication truly accessible, we will remain stuck in the same elite circles. With a growing understanding of language barriers, linguistic and climate experts are demanding better from climate scientists and communicators, aiming to ensure all voices can be part of the conversation—but it won’t happen overnight.

The Inaccessibility of Climate Information and Communication

Conversations around who gets access to disaster warnings and preparedness are gaining traction now as more immigrant communities find themselves increasingly vulnerable. For Cesar Espinosa, cofounder of FIEL (Familias Inmigrantes y Estudiantes en la Lucha/Immigrant Families and Students in the Fight)—the largest immigrant-led civil rights organization in Texas—navigating language is perhaps one of the most crucial parts of advocacy.

“Houston is a very diverse city, so we speak English and Spanish but also Vietnamese and Arabic and Farsi, so here we don’t see that disconnect in language as much as other parts of the country,” he told NPQ. “I know in other parts of the country folks are not getting information in their language so they are getting lost.”

Monica Jahan Bose, a Bangladeshi American artist and climate activist, says she finds the language used in climate circles peculiar. “Even in Bangladesh I’ve been invited to, and attended, several climate forums and I attended one about bringing climate conversations to remote farmers and it was all in English,” Bose shared in an interview, pointing out that by holding these forums in English, organizers fail to reach the communities they claim they want to help.

She added that when she reached out to many of the people involved in the forum to get resources for the women of her ancestral village that she was working with, she rarely got a response.

This exclusion is often born from the idea that some people are more worthy to talk about climate because of their background and the language they speak. The phenomenon is widespread. A report from April 2025 showed that Indigenous peoples make up just 6 percent of the global population, they safeguard 80 percent of the planet’s remaining biodiversity, and yet they receive less than 1 percent of international climate funding. There have been demands from as early as 2021 to stop excluding global youth, particularly those most affected in rural areas, from climate conversations—and there have been calls since then to center young leaders in responding to the climate crisis.

For many Indigenous communities…key ancestral concepts about the land may not be translated into English, and therefore are not recognized by the mainstream.

Bose points out that she has also worked with Bangladeshi American communities in the United States and has found that many nonprofits in this sector are dominated by people speaking English who are unable to communicate with immigrant communities.

“These big conferences aren’t the only places we should have climate conversations. I do think a lot of people still don’t have basic knowledge, and there’s a lot of information that can be shared,” Bose said.

Max Boykoff, a professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Boulder, CO, shares similar observations, particularly from his time experiencing a Category 5 hurricane in Honduras in 1998.

“Those who are at the forefront of climate impact are often those with the least heard in mainstream media accounts. That’s something I saw in Honduras in the hurricane where the media coverage was mainly around the capital city which was less affected than other rural areas,” he shared with NPQ.

Climate Cardinals, one of the leading nonprofit organizations in accessible climate communication, was founded to address the barriers that communities across the world experience.

“One thing is that academic language is on purpose a barrier to not include people into spaces, and Climate Cardinals is actively working to break that down,” said Carl Philip Dybwad, chief operating officer at Climate Cardinals, in an interview with NPQ.

These barriers in knowledge also extend the other way. For example, for many Indigenous communities, key ancestral concepts about the land may not be translated into English, and therefore are not recognized by the mainstream—leading to gaps in understanding in English-language academia and media.

“The reason why information doesn’t flow from the periphery is because of a more general situation where the center speaks to the periphery [but] doesn’t listen to the periphery,” Saraceni pointed out.

Espinosa, who has experience working with some of the most vulnerable immigrant communities in Texas at a time when climate migration—to and within the United States—is at an all-time high, also pointed out that “oftentimes we rely on Western ideas to be able to put things out or explain the way things are working but we don’t really take into consideration all the Indigenous knowledge that exists, especially in mainstream US society where it’s considered ‘primitive.’”

“Everyone should understand that climate change is a slow falling airplane—if you look out your window it doesn’t look bad but it’s constantly going down and everyone’s running away from responsibility.”

Making Climate Communication for Everyone

As Espinosa shares, the climate crisis is affecting people regardless of their race, class, or immigration status, so it’s important that everyone has the same tools to fight it—but not being able to understand information puts many communities at a disadvantage.

Bálint Forgács, an experimental psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist who studies figurative language, started working on climate-related issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. He points out that the complex language used around climate means that very few people actually understand the intensity and consequences of the climate crisis.

“I think what could dramatically improve is using an invention of vivid analogies and metaphorical visual images that are close to [people’s] local and everyday way of living, which doesn’t even necessarily involve their cultural heritage,” Forgács told NPQ. “But everyone should understand that climate change is a slow falling airplane—if you look out your window it doesn’t look bad but it’s constantly going down and everyone’s running away from responsibility.”

Forgács added that “science is abstract when it reaches the public as a discussion; what comes out from those conferences should be a message that’s not detached from everyday experience.”

Dybwad points out that this is a big part of Climate Cardinal’s overarching goal, which they are hoping to achieve through empowering their local chapters in countries across the globe.

“Because chapters are already carrying out localized climate action, they are working on adaptation and resiliency,” he said. “We want to give more opportunity to people who are grassroots and are on the ground and we’re trying to ask ourselves, ‘Are we the best person to talk about this, or is there someone local who can better speak about this?’”

He acknowledges that being from Norway and now being based in New York puts him in a position where he cannot speak for the lived experiences of most immigrant communities across the United States or across the world.

“I think it’s important for us to realize that language, and having access to different languages is key to moving any policy or idea forward,” Espinosa shared, “so I think that would be a base point—language accessibility—both spoken and written because at the end of the day we have to realize as communities we have more in common than we don’t.”",https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Climate_Convo_Woman-Tree.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 09:59:08.430458

Officials did not immediately clarify which specific funds would be withdrawn.

In a statement, the department said: “By returning these funds to the American taxpayer, the Trump administration is affirming its commitment to advancing more affordable, reliable and secure American energy and being more responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

The move has prompted fierce criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who accused the government of surrendering leadership on clean energy to China. “President Xi, I don’t know what else he’s got to applaud. I think he’s going to give Donald Trump a bear hug when he arrives,” Newsom remarked at a New York Times climate event.

The announcement came a day after President Trump dismissed climate change as “the greatest con job” during his address to the United Nations General Assembly, doubling down on his scepticism towards global climate initiatives and international institutions. Since returning to office in January, he has sought to maximise oil and gas output—already at record levels—while scaling back renewable and EV subsidies.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright confirmed the cancellation at a press conference in New York, arguing that climate change had been exaggerated into “the world’s greatest threat,” fuelling “massive amounts of spending with very little positive impact.” He added that he had no plans to attend UN climate talks in Brazil this November, though he left the door open, saying “nothing is impossible.”

However, critics warn the decision could hit employment in clean energy.

Since 2020, Unifor says that Canada has positioned itself for growth in the automotive sector by securing investments in vehicle assembly programs, battery production, and critical mineral processing. In a statement, Unifor warns that “recent disruptions, from U.S. tariffs on Canadian-built vehicles, to policy rollbacks on EV supports, to rising Chinese import penetration, threaten to reverse these hard-won gains.”

“As of August 2025, one-third of our members at Detroit Three facilities in Canada are on layoff, with three assembly plants sitting idle,” said Payne. “At a time when auto workers are facing layoffs and uncertainty, lifting the surtax would be nothing short of a self-inflicted wound.”

In its submission, Unifor reportedly recommended that the federal government:

Maintain the existing 100% surtax on imported Chinese EVs for an additional 24 months.

Extend surtaxes to strategic EV and battery-related components.

Reinstate and expand federal EV rebate programs, with conditions to prioritize Canadian- and North American-built vehicles.

Strengthen enforcement against goods produced with forced labour.

Here's what you need to know about the upcoming refrigerant changes and how they may impact you.

What's Changing?

Beginning January 1, 2025, manufacturers can no longer produce new HVAC systems using R-410A refrigerant, the most common cooling agent in residential air conditioners and heat pumps. This phase-out is part of the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning away from high Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants.

R-410A has a GWP of 2,088, meaning it contributes significantly to climate change when released into the atmosphere. The new regulations require all refrigerants in new systems to have a GWP of 700 or less.

The New Refrigerants

Two environmentally friendly alternatives are replacing R-410A:

R-454B (Opteon XL41 or Puron Advance): Provides up to a 78% reduction in global warming potential while maintaining similar cooling performance to R-410A. Most major manufacturers including Carrier, Trane, and Lennox have chosen this as their primary replacement.

R-32: Offers up to 12% better efficiency than R-410A systems and has a GWP of approximately 675. Daikin and some other manufacturers have selected R-32 for certain applications.

Impact on Homeowners

If you have an existing system: You can continue using your current HVAC system without any immediate changes required. Existing equipment is not subject to EPA regulations and can continue to be used through equipment end-of-life. R-410A will remain available for servicing existing systems, though supplies may become more expensive over time.

If you're buying a new system: Systems manufactured before January 1, 2025, can still be installed through December 31, 2025, giving consumers a one-year transition period. However, new EPA-compliant systems are expected to cost at least 20% more than current models due to advanced technology and manufacturing requirements.

Safety Considerations

The new refrigerants are classified as A2L, meaning they have low toxicity but are mildly flammable—much less so than propane or natural gas. New systems include advanced leak detection sensors that automatically shut off the unit and activate ventilation if a leak is detected.

Benefits of the Transition

Beyond environmental protection, the new refrigerants offer several advantages:

Potential utility bill savings of 5-10% due to improved energy efficiency

EPA estimates this transition will result in emissions reductions equivalent to up to 876 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from 2025 through 2050

Long-term cost savings through reduced energy consumption

Planning Ahead

While there's no immediate need to replace functioning systems, homeowners should consider their options carefully. If your current system is aging or inefficient, upgrading before 2025 might offer cost savings, while waiting allows you to invest in the latest environmentally friendly technology.

HVAC contractors are receiving specialized training to safely handle the new refrigerants, ensuring professional installation and service continue without interruption.

For more information about how these changes might affect your specific situation, consult with a qualified HVAC professional who can assess your current system and discuss your options.",https://lirp.cdn-website.com/9b7d9577/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-6471914-1920w.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 03:58:14.305706

High-Resolution Images and B-roll Available

CHILLICOTHE, Ohio, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Centrus Energy (NYSE American: LEU) is joining with Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, U.S. Senator Jon Husted, and U.S. Congressman Dave Taylor, JobsOhio, Ohio Southeast Economic Development (OhioSE), and Pike County Economic Development, today to announce plans for a major expansion of Centrus' uranium enrichment plant in Piketon, Ohio. The expansion is expected to create 1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operations jobs at the Piketon site, while retaining 127 existing jobs, boosting Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) and High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) production. The size and scope of the expansion depend on federal funding decisions from the U.S. Department of Energy for LEU and HALEU, and a large-scale expansion would represent a multi-billion-dollar private and public investment into Ohio.

""The time has come to restore America's ability to enrich uranium at scale,"" said Centrus CEO Amir Vexler. ""We are planning a historic, multi-billion-dollar investment right here in Ohio – supported by a nationwide supply chain to do just that. When it comes to powering our energy future, it's time to stop relying on foreign, state-owned corporations and start investing in American technology, built by American workers.""

The project is also expected to support hundreds of jobs at Centrus' centrifuge manufacturing plant in Tennessee and throughout its manufacturing supply chain – which is entirely domestic – along with thousands of indirect jobs in Ohio, Tennessee, and across the country.

JobsOhio and OhioSE will be long-term partners to Centrus as the company ramps up recruiting and hiring to fill the 300 operations jobs this project is expected to create. The company will discuss the announcement today at the Ross County Employment Expo in Chillicothe, Ohio, where Centrus is meeting with potential job candidates.

""Centrus' commitment to expand and upgrade its Piketon facility underscores Ohio's importance in supporting our nation's economic and national security,"" said Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. ""Uranium enrichment operations in Piketon have played a critical role in U.S. national defense since the earliest days of the Cold War, and Centrus' facility provides the only technology available today capable of building out domestic enrichment at an industrial scale.""

A Multi-Billion-Dollar Expansion

In anticipation of the expansion, Centrus raised more than $1.2 billion in a pair of convertible note transactions over the last 12 months and has secured more than $2 billion in contingent purchase commitments from utility customers in the United States and around the world. Centrus has also announced its collaboration with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and POSCO International to potentially invest in the project.

Centrus recently submitted proposals to the U.S. Department of Energy as part of a competitive selection process for potential awards to expand domestic production of LEU for existing reactors and HALEU for advanced reactors. Subject to being selected for funding by the U.S. Department of Energy, Centrus' expansion plans call for a multi-billion-dollar public and private investment to add thousands of additional centrifuges at its American Centrifuge Plant in Piketon, Ohio, delivering large-scale production of both LEU and HALEU.

""Today's announcement is critical, not just for the people of Southeast Ohio, but for our nation. Expanding our ability to enrich uranium here in Ohio will continue America's legacy as the global leader in nuclear development,"" said U.S. Senator Jon Husted. ""This facility will be a key resource in maintaining America's nuclear fleet and bringing power to millions of homes and businesses through modern modular reactors, and it begins with the hardworking and talented people here in Ohio.""

American Technology, Built by American Workers

Almost 100 percent of the world's enrichment capacity belongs to foreign, state-owned enterprises; those companies use centrifuge technologies exclusively manufactured overseas. Centrus is the only active enricher that uses American technology and manufactures centrifuges and supporting equipment exclusively in the United States. If Centrus is selected for federal funding, that funding will be spent in the United States, not on overseas manufacturing.

""In step with President Trump, Centrus is restoring American energy dominance, bringing back energy independence, and creating good American jobs to put our talented workforce to work,"" said U.S. Rep. Dave Taylor. ""No longer shall our Nation lose jobs and risk energy security through reliance on foreign countries. I am confident that the critical work being done right here at Centrus's Piketon plant will keep Ohio a leader in nuclear energy and usher America into a new Golden Age of energy production.""

The company will manufacture its centrifuges in Oak Ridge, Tenn., with the support of a nationwide manufacturing supply chain that currently spans 14 major suppliers in 13 states. The centrifuges and supporting equipment will then be sent to Piketon for final assembly, installation and operation.

""America is becoming more reliant on nuclear energy, and Centrus is the only American-owned uranium enrichment facility that fuels nuclear power,"" said Lt. Governor Jim Tressel. ""This is great news for America and will create jobs and opportunity in Pike County.""

The JobsOhio Talent Acquisition Services team is working in partnership with Centrus to support the company's overall talent strategy. Tactics could include talent attraction campaigns and pipeline development efforts through marketing, recruitment and training initiatives for operators and technicians. There are no state of Ohio or JobsOhio grants, loans, or tax credits planned at this time.

""Centrus' Piketon uranium enrichment facility is one of a kind in the United States, and it has a critical role to play in reclaiming America's global nuclear leadership and in meeting our enduring national security requirements,"" said JobsOhio President and CEO J.P. Nauseef. ""As the technology to provide this essential service and production advances, JobsOhio and OhioSE look forward to partnering with Centrus to ensure its proven workforce continues to thrive and grow.""

Centrus has already begun hiring in anticipation of the expansion and is partnering with JobsOhio to identify and recruit potential job applicants.

""The investment and job creation that Centrus has announced will provide amazing opportunities in the southern portion of the OhioSE region,"" said Matt Abbott, OhioSE President and CEO. ""We are pleased to be a part of this monumental project.""

What They Are Saying:

""Centrus' major investment in Piketon solidifies Ohio's continued leadership in the energy sector – both today, and into the future. In my capacity as Senate Energy Committee Chairman, I am proud to support policies that will ensure Ohio's energy remains reliable and affordable for decades to come. Centrus and their activities in Piketon will play a major role in this effort. I applaud Centrus and their commitment to supporting the economic future of Southeast Ohio!""

– State Senator Brian Chavez, Senate Energy Committee Chairman

""Thank you to Centrus Energy Corp. for the vital and forward-looking endeavor for Ohio's 17th Senate District. This expansion represents transformative job opportunities that will bring permanent jobs and construction roles to southern Ohio, while reinforcing the region's legacy in energy innovation. This project will strengthen America's energy security by advancing domestic uranium enrichment capacity, which is essential for both today's nuclear fleet and tomorrow's advanced reactors. I am proud to play a role in supporting this critical step toward a more sustainable and secure energy future.""

– State Senator Shane Wilkin

""Congratulations and thank you to Centrus for their investment in southern Ohio. America's nuclear enrichment capability is both a powerful economic driver and a National security imperative. Absolutely looking forward to helping Centrus accomplish its mission in the years ahead!""

– State Representative Adam Holmes, Chairman, Ohio House Energy Committee.

Fermi's Gas Generation Equipment Secured or under LOI to Date Now Totals 2.0 GW of Combined Cycle Power at ISO Conditions, Scheduled for 2026 Delivery

Siemens Energy Displays Strong U.S. Commitment Via Gas Turbine Allocation and Highlights its Broadening Nuclear Capabilities Via AP1000 Steam Turbine Collaboration

AMARILLO, Texas, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America, in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, is announcing two landmark letters of intent with Siemens Energy to secure 1.1 GW (at ISO conditions once in combined cycle mode) of Frame F Class Generation Equipment for 2026 delivery and collaborate on Siemens' flagship nuclear steam turbine technologies, in support of Fermi's 11-Gigawatt AI campus.

These agreements mark a major milestone in the fulfillment of President Donald J. Trump's promise to restore U.S. energy dominance and to ensure America wins the global race to power the future of artificial intelligence.

Under the first letter of intent, Siemens Energy will negotiate to deliver three F-class SGT6-5000F gas turbine units, producing up to 1.1 GW at ISO conditions once in combined cycle mode. These turbines are proven, efficient, industrial-grade machines capable of highly reliable 24/7 base load applications.

""Winning the AI arms race doesn't just take software developers. It takes more electricity,"" said Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum. ""This campus proves that we can integrate natural gas, nuclear energy, and artificial intelligence into a single, powerful ecosystem. Modern energy infrastructure isn't a luxury, it's the foundation of global leadership. By advancing President Trump's Energy Dominance Agenda, we're not just fueling America — we're powering the future of intelligence.""

Fermi's campus was envisioned as a flagship example of the Trump administration's strategy: pairing advanced, reliable, quickly-deployable natural gas generation with nuclear power and modern infrastructure to ensure the U.S. can safely meet America's growing energy demand—particularly from AI and high-performance computing. With the new agreements, Fermi's gas generation equipment secured or under LOI to date now totals 2.0 GW of combined cycle power at ISO conditions, scheduled for 2026 delivery.

""No one understands the global energy race better than Donald Trump,"" said former U.S Secretary of Energy and Fermi Co-Founder Rick Perry. ""The Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and Department of Defense are all working tirelessly to secure America's position in this AI race and to ensure that our private sector, with the strong support of this pro-energy administration, has what we need to lead the way in abundant, reliable, and innovative energy solutions.""

""I want to thank President Trump for his strong leadership and action in clearing the path for companies like ours to help America win this race,"" added Toby Neugebauer, Fermi America CEO and Co-Founder. ""Fermi America is doing what it takes 24/7 to build exactly what the President has asked for, highly reliable, unshakable, base load energy — through our 11 GW gas-bridged nuclear build. We understand the stakes are high and we are playing to win – because that's how America keeps its AI edge.""

The second letter of intent furthers the two companies' collaboration on integrating Siemens' industry-leading steam turbines, generators, and control systems into Fermi's expanding nuclear power portfolio, which include the deployment of an expected four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors.

Siemens Energy brings deep expertise, demonstrated by several modernizations of turbines and generators at multiple nuclear plants. Fermi and Siemens Energy will work closely to deliver nuclear generation with clean, efficient, robust performance.

This framework aligns with the Trump administration's executive orders to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment, streamline nuclear regulation, and ensure that the U.S. infrastructure needed for AI and data centers has the clean, reliable, always-on power that only nuclear and strategic redundancies can provide, without unnecessarily putting a strain on the public grid.

Not only do these agreements reinforce the administration's goal of U.S. energy dominance by expanding domestic, reliable, low-carbon power, they deliver on President Donald J. Trump's pledge to speed up nuclear licensing and regulation, rebuild the nuclear industrial base, and expand natural gas generation to meet the urgency of demand.

Fermi's Gas Generation Equipment Secured or under LOI to Date Now Totals 2.0 GW of Combined Cycle Power at ISO Conditions, Scheduled for 2026 Delivery

Siemens Energy Displays Strong U.S. Commitment Via Gas Turbine Allocation and Highlights its Broadening Nuclear Capabilities Via AP1000 Steam Turbine Collaboration

AMARILLO, Texas, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America, in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, is announcing two landmark letters of intent with Siemens Energy to secure 1.1 GW (at ISO conditions once in combined cycle mode) of Frame F Class Generation Equipment for 2026 delivery and collaborate on Siemens' flagship nuclear steam turbine technologies, in support of Fermi's 11-Gigawatt AI campus.

These agreements mark a major milestone in the fulfillment of President Donald J. Trump's promise to restore U.S. energy dominance and to ensure America wins the global race to power the future of artificial intelligence.

Under the first letter of intent, Siemens Energy will negotiate to deliver three F-class SGT6-5000F gas turbine units, producing up to 1.1 GW at ISO conditions once in combined cycle mode. These turbines are proven, efficient, industrial-grade machines capable of highly reliable 24/7 base load applications.

""Winning the AI arms race doesn't just take software developers. It takes more electricity,"" said Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum. ""This campus proves that we can integrate natural gas, nuclear energy, and artificial intelligence into a single, powerful ecosystem. Modern energy infrastructure isn't a luxury, it's the foundation of global leadership. By advancing President Trump's Energy Dominance Agenda, we're not just fueling America — we're powering the future of intelligence.""

Fermi's campus was envisioned as a flagship example of the Trump administration's strategy: pairing advanced, reliable, quickly-deployable natural gas generation with nuclear power and modern infrastructure to ensure the U.S. can safely meet America's growing energy demand—particularly from AI and high-performance computing. With the new agreements, Fermi's gas generation equipment secured or under LOI to date now totals 2.0 GW of combined cycle power at ISO conditions, scheduled for 2026 delivery.

""No one understands the global energy race better than Donald Trump,"" said former U.S Secretary of Energy and Fermi Co-Founder Rick Perry. ""The Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and Department of Defense are all working tirelessly to secure America's position in this AI race and to ensure that our private sector, with the strong support of this pro-energy administration, has what we need to lead the way in abundant, reliable, and innovative energy solutions.""

""I want to thank President Trump for his strong leadership and action in clearing the path for companies like ours to help America win this race,"" added Toby Neugebauer, Fermi America CEO and Co-Founder. ""Fermi America is doing what it takes 24/7 to build exactly what the President has asked for, highly reliable, unshakable, base load energy — through our 11 GW gas-bridged nuclear build. We understand the stakes are high and we are playing to win – because that's how America keeps its AI edge.""

The second letter of intent furthers the two companies' collaboration on integrating Siemens' industry-leading steam turbines, generators, and control systems into Fermi's expanding nuclear power portfolio, which include the deployment of an expected four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors.

Siemens Energy brings deep expertise, demonstrated by several modernizations of turbines and generators at multiple nuclear plants. Fermi and Siemens Energy will work closely to deliver nuclear generation with clean, efficient, robust performance.

This framework aligns with the Trump administration's executive orders to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment, streamline nuclear regulation, and ensure that the U.S. infrastructure needed for AI and data centers has the clean, reliable, always-on power that only nuclear and strategic redundancies can provide, without unnecessarily putting a strain on the public grid.

Not only do these agreements reinforce the administration's goal of U.S. energy dominance by expanding domestic, reliable, low-carbon power, they deliver on President Donald J. Trump's pledge to speed up nuclear licensing and regulation, rebuild the nuclear industrial base, and expand natural gas generation to meet the urgency of demand.

Every 10% increase in the share of wind and solar raises average power costs by over four cents per kilowatt-hour.
Across developing nations, electricity demand rose almost 5% last year — mostly met by fossil fuels.
We should focus on innovation that can genuinely make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels.","At the Sept. 23, 2025, U.N. General Assembly, President Donald Trump drew global headlines by blasting what he called the “extreme cost” of the green transition, arguing that climate alarmism is impoverishing ordinary people while enriching elites. Whatever one thinks of Trump’s rhetoric, he touched on an inconvenient truth: despite endless assurances from campaigners and institutions like the U.N., World Bank, and World Economic Forum, wind and solar are still not delivering cheap energy. In fact, they are making electricity more expensive.

For years, media and green advocates have insisted that solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity. This claim is central to the idea that a green transition is inevitable and beneficial — even under a second Trump administration. But two decades of evidence shows the opposite. The countries that have added the most solar and wind also have the highest power costs.

The claim of “cheap” solar and wind is built on a sleight of hand. These sources are indeed often competitive when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. But modern societies need power 24/7. When the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing, countries must rely on costly backup — mostly fossil fuels. Factoring in these costs reveals that renewables are far from cheap.

WORLD LEADERS LAUGH, SQUIRM AS TRUMP BLASTS UN ON CLIMATE, UKRAINE, GAZA AT GENERAL ASSEMBLY

A study of China found solar’s real cost was twice that of coal. Research about Germany and Texas showed that once backup costs are included, solar and wind go from appearing slightly cheaper to many times more expensive.

We see this in consumer prices. Germany, Spain, Denmark and the U.K. have some of the world’s highest electricity costs alongside massive investments in renewables. Last year, households and industries in the EU paid more than 26 cents per kilowatt-hour, more than double the U.S. price of 13 cents and triple the price in China. The U.K., with its even greener ambition, paid an eye-watering 36 cents per kilowatt-hour, nearly three times the U.S. price and more than four times the price in China.

Across 70 countries, International Energy Agency data shows a clear pattern: more renewables, higher costs. Every 10% increase in the share of wind and solar raises average power costs by over four cents per kilowatt-hour.

Headlines often tout how Germany and other nations and states generate most of their electricity from renewables. But these stories never mention the dark, windless days when solar and wind provide almost nothing. Last winter, renewables repeatedly delivered less than 4% of Germany’s power for an entire day.

TRUMP’S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS

Advocates say batteries will fix this problem. But all of Germany’s storage would last less than 20 minutes. The reality: fossil fuels remain essential, but because they now run less frequently, costs soar. Last November, when solar and wind provided almost nothing, wholesale German prices spiked to $1 per kilowatt-hour

As conventional plants shut down, the risks rise. A German utility CEO warned the country narrowly avoided blackouts only because the weather wasn’t colder.

If solar and wind were truly cheaper, poor countries would leapfrog to them. Yet the opposite is happening. Across developing nations, electricity demand rose almost 5% last year — mostly met by fossil fuels. China used more additional coal than it used additional solar and wind combined. Bangladesh used 13 times more additional coal than additional renewables.

‘WEB OF DARK MONEY’ TIED TO OBAMA, DEMS FUELS GREEN OPPOSITION TO CRUCIAL TRUMP ENERGY PLAN

India, praised for ambitious solar goals, still added three times more coal than solar and wind. Billionaire Gautam Adani, struggling to find buyers for a $6 billion solar project, allegedly resorted to a $265 million bribery scheme — because most Indian states refuse to rely on unreliable renewables.

Poor nations know reliability matters. Rich nations can indulge the solar-and-wind illusion only because they already have fossil backups and lavish subsidies.

Europe’s high prices at least reflect the true costs of renewables. The U.S. disguises them through subsidies. Federal tax credits for wind and solar alone cost nearly $18 billion in 2024, with states adding billions more. In Texas alone, total subsidies may have reached nearly $20 billion in 2023 — 10 times the federal subsidies.

Across the U.S., hidden subsidies may exceed $60 billion annually, meaning real power costs are about 25% higher than official bills suggest.

GARGANTUAN ‘BIRD CEMETERIES’ IN BURGUM’S CROSSHAIRS AS DOI LOOKS TO CURB GREEN WIND PROJECTS

The myth of cheap renewables is comforting but destructive. It sustains a system of rising bills and endless subsidies, hitting the poorest hardest.

Trump is right to call out the economic damage of today’s climate policies. But the solution is not to ignore climate change — it is to pursue smarter ones. We should focus on innovation that can genuinely make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels. This means dramatically more investment in research and development: from advanced nuclear to more reliable renewables with storage to geothermal breakthroughs.

Such investments would cost far less than today’s climate spending and deliver real benefits. Until then, fossil fuels will remain indispensable. Pretending otherwise only makes energy more costly and less secure.

The world needs honesty: solar and wind are not yet cheap because they need backup, and forcing them onto power grids only raises prices. If rich countries concerned with climate change prioritize innovation over illusion, they could lead a real green revolution — one built not on slogans, but on affordable, reliable energy for all.

Offshore wind brings with it advanced manufacturing jobs, supply chain investments and innovation-driven careers.
Offshore wind is our chance to do that again, and this time with cleaner, smarter tools.","In Brief:

Empire Wind project invests $5B to power 500,000 homes

South Fork Wind already powers 70,000 Long Island homes

Orsted, Equinor projects have created thousands of local jobs

Offshore wind strengthens energy security and U.S. supply chains

Long Island manufacturing and workforce training benefit directly

If you’ve walked along Brooklyn’s Sunset Park waterfront lately, you may have noticed a new barge near the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, with a unique set of equipment onboard. This American-flagged vessel is loaded with American-made cable, manufactured in South Carolina and now being installed with help from union workers into the seabed off the coast of New York. That cable will soon connect the Empire Wind offshore wind project directly to New York City’s electric grid.

In today’s tough economic climate, it may feel like New York’s clean energy ambitions have been put on pause. But that’s far from the truth. This barge is one indicator that projects like Empire Wind 1 are moving forward—creating jobs, strengthening local economies and proving that offshore wind is not some distant hope, but a real and rising industry.

On Long Island, we face real economic headwinds: A shrinking youth population due to high housing costs, sluggish job growth and tariff exposure. But we also have valuable assets: over 2,000 manufacturing companies, a resilient defense sector, and world-renowned research institutions like Cold Spring Harbor and Brookhaven labs.

When population trends are shifting, and job growth is slowing, one of the best responses is to encourage emerging industries that create well-paying, future-ready careers. That’s exactly what we’re seeing now as a handful of major, federally approved offshore wind projects begin to deliver real economic momentum across the region.

For the first time since the exit of Grumman Aerospace from Long Island, we are building an industry that could rival the post-World War II defense boom. Offshore wind brings with it advanced manufacturing jobs, supply chain investments and innovation-driven careers. These are not abstract promises—they’re already taking shape. As Long Islanders know, Orsted’s South Fork Wind project is already operational and powering 70,000 homes. The company’s Sunrise Wind development is next in line, and between the two, Orsted has already supported more than 1,400 workers logging over 3 million hours, with a local economic impact estimated at $58 million.

Building on this momentum, Equinor’s Empire Wind project represents the next major leap in New York’s offshore wind ambitions, with $5 billion in capital investment and the capacity to power half a million homes. Work is underway at the 73-acre South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, which will become the project’s control center and maintenance base. So far, Empire Wind has supported more than 2,000 jobs and activated a broad network of American suppliers, from steel fabricators to underground utility crews.

We see the same momentum elsewhere. In Massachusetts, Vineyard Wind has employed 1,700 local workers and is set to come online soon. In Virginia, Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, first leased in 2013 and fully permitted in 2023, is on track to power 660,000 homes by 2026.

And there’s more to come. Developers like Community Offshore Wind are actively engaged in the bidding process for future New York contracts, and others like Attentive Energy could re-enter the market if conditions improve.

These projects don’t happen overnight. They require years of planning, permitting, technical studies and public engagement. What they truly require, above all, is sustained commitment. Success doesn’t come from short-term thinking—it comes from staying the course.

Offshore wind represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvest in domestic manufacturing, modernize our infrastructure, and expand the workforce training programs that prepare people for tomorrow’s jobs. It’s also a matter of national security. Strengthening our energy independence makes us more resilient in a volatile global economy.

This must be part of a broader strategy that includes solar, hydrogen, thermal, existing fossil fuel production and other emerging technologies. The goal is not to replace one energy source with another. It’s to build a balanced, secure and forward-looking system.

We’re not starting from scratch. Long Islanders have powered this country before—designing complex systems, solving big problems, and helping America lead. Offshore wind is our chance to do that again, and this time with cleaner, smarter tools. The foundation is in place, the progress is real, and the potential is enormous. Now is the time to keep building.",https://libn.com/files/2025/05/AP25125499978507-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 00:58:43.157735

But clean energy leaders are pushing forward.

Executives from across the sustainability spectrum gathered at Newsweek's ""Powering Ahead"" event on Thursday to offer practical solutions that can succeed, even in the face of headwinds.

""Some of the topics that we're taking on today, not exactly upbeat at first glance,"" Newsweek's Environmental and Sustainability Editor Jeffery Young said in his opening remarks from One World Trade.

""We've got energy demand that is surging to power homes, manufacturing, the AI boom of course, data centers. EVs are revolutionizing the auto sector, which presents both risks and opportunities. We have an interconnected set of crises with climate change, with plastic waste and plastic pollution, a loss of nature,"" he said. ""But because all of those things are intertwined, there are the opportunities for elegant solutions.""

Throughout the day, conference attendees heard from panelists representing energy providers, auto manufacturers, tech companies, energy storage innovators and conservation organizations.

""Most of the people that we're going to have on the stage today are real change makers, not only in developing solutions, but in scaling up solutions so that they can meet the size of these considerable challenges that we have,"" Young said.

As the first slate of speakers took the stage, all of them addressed the elephant in the climate room: today's political landscape.

""It is broadly infuriating and exhausting for an industry to become a political football that gets spiked by both parties,"" American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet told Young. ""It's impossible for the country. If every four years, the government splits sides and says, 'We now don't like this part of the American economy,' we just can't build anything.""

Octopus Energy CEO Nick Chaset echoed those remarks during the ""Red, White and Blue Growth Areas for Clean Energy"" panel as he pushed for leaders to adopt practical policies over partisan policies.

""Energy consumers from Texas to San Francisco to New York City are really concerned about the ability to pay their bills and the lights being on,"" Chaset said. ""The other things, whether it's clean or not, are important, but those are the day-to-day concerns.""

""In Texas, where we operate as a business, we offer 100 percent renewables,"" he continued. ""But we market it as, 'This is the lowest cost, most reliable, fastest solution,' and that's what customers want, and it's not politicized.""

Mike Richter, the president of Brightcore Energy and a former Stanley Cup champion, chimed in, calling it a shame that these solutions have become politicized. Richter argued that conservatives and liberals are likely to agree that no one wants to drink dirty water or breathe poor quality air.

""We really work in the commercial industrial space, just trying to optimize the buildings, make them more efficient, use less energy,"" he said of Brightcore. ""That's not political, that's just smart.""

""When you can start selling the promise with cheaper electricity, people are raising their hands. You have off the shelf technologies delivering that now. That's all that matters,"" Richter said.

Later in the morning, battery experts and electricity providers talked about how Virtual Power Plants and data centers offer economically-friendly answers to the issue of selling sustainability.

""We set out to solve the economic problem that is renewable energy. We were able to devise a financial model where we are able to monetize the revenue that we obtain,"" Regan George, the CEO of SOLRITE Energy, told the room.

During the ""Powering Data and Tapping Data's Power"" panel, speakers focused on the recent AI boom, which has led the Energy Department to project that as much as 12 percent of the total U.S. electricity production could be used solely for data centers.

""It is top of mind for everybody,"" Steven Carlini, vice president of innovation and data centers at Schneider Electric, said.

Eileen Falkenberg-Hull, Newsweek's senior autos editor, also welcomed major EV players onto the stage Thursday.

In a conversation with Megan Farrell, the senior director of sustainability at Rivian, Falkenberg-Hull inquired about Rivian's leadership not only as an electric vehicle brand but also as an American manufacturer.

""At Rivian, we are very proud to contribute to America's leadership in this very important sector, and we feel that we do that through our innovation, our technology and our vehicles, as well as the jobs that we create,"" Farrell said.

She added that the brand anticipates its forthcoming plant in Georgia to add 7,500 jobs to the economy and to produce 400,000 vehicles a year.

Mercedes-Benz High-Power Charging President and CEO Andrew Cornelia, Electric Era Chief Revenue Officer Kyler Schmitz and Electrify America Director of Energy Services Jigar Shah also spoke to Falkenberg-Hull about the ways they're making EVs more approachable to prospective buyers.

Those efforts include selecting charging sites where people will feel safe going at all hours of the day, streamlining payment options, building a fast network and bringing down prices.

Nick Sandland, the chief business officer of Algenesis Labs, provided a glimpse of how these climate solutions can work in the consumer goods and products sector during the plastics panel. Algenesis, which creates durable and biodegradable products ranging from footwear to phone cases, is aiming to ""demonstrate to people that we can make high-quality, high-performing products that are bio-based.""

Nick Mallos, the vice president of conservation and ocean plastics for the Ocean Conservancy, took a moment during the plastics panel to remark how far the conversation has come.

""To have that quick evolution of public awareness in just a short period of time, compared to the broader climate debate, which some might say the jury is still out, I think it's fascinating,"" Mallos said.

On the final panel of the day, speakers joining the ""A New Asset Class: Nature as Infrastructure"" discussion emphasized how natural resources remain viable solutions to today's problems. The real task is to get stakeholders to understand that the value of these assets goes beyond just carbon and into factors like biodiversity or soil surface.

""That's one area where the exchanges and the commodity markets have gotten this market wrong,"" Jason Libersky, the founder and CEO of Quotient Markets, Inc., argued.

FRANKFORT, Ky. (KT) –Kentucky and West Virginia are co-leading a 26-state coalition to repeal some of what they consider the Environmental Protection Agency’s worst policies of the last decades, said Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman.

They include the Green New Deal, the EPA’s electric vehicle mandates and the so-called Clean Power Plan. In a comment letter to the Trump Administration’s EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the attorneys general supported the reversal of the EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding under the Clean Air Act.

In 2009, the Obama Administration relied on bad science and untested legal theories to rule that carbon dioxide was a major contributor to climate change and was a danger to public health. That one decision became the justification for the federal government’s assault on Kentuckians through costly and burdensome regulations.

“Finalizing this proposed action is an important step to freeing American industry from burdensome, unlawful regulations and restoring the Clean Air Act’s proper, congressionally intended structure,” they stated in their letter.

The attorneys general argued that the Obama Administration’s finding was both unlawful and scientifically unproven. The Trump Administration’s EPA has formally begun the regulatory process to repeal the Endangerment Finding that they say has burdened Kentucky’s economy and workers for so long.

“The nonsensical green agenda has gone on long enough. For 15 years, this one unlawful decision from the EPA has been the justification for assaults on Kentucky,” Coleman said.“Along with AGs across the country, we’re partnering with President Trump to preserve affordable and reliable energy in Kentucky and to stop the madness that has hiked prices and killed jobs.”

Last year, Kentucky and West Virginia led a 25-state coalition to block President Biden and his EPA from imposing an EV mandate on passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium-duty vehicles. That legal challenge was one of several efforts led by Coleman to oppose EV mandates.

This innovative initiative aims to transform the way sustainable building practices are introduced in K-12 education, with a strong focus on teacher training and community engagement.

Co-led by Dr. Joowon Im and Brad McCorkle, the two-year project is running from August 15, 2025, through August 28, 2027. Funding is provided through the EPA's Environmental Education (EE) Grant Program, which supports projects that increase public awareness and understanding of environmental issues.

At its core, the project aims to equip in-service high school teachers with cutting-edge knowledge and tools in sustainable building design and principles of the circular economy (CE). These include strategies such as energy-efficient design, material reuse, and reduction of greenhouse gases.

""Educating high school teachers on an emerging topic in sustainable building design was my main motivation for pursuing this funding,"" said Dr. Makhmalbaf. ""Participants will learn how to assess circular economy (CE) strategies in buildings through critical thinking, problem-solving, and the adoption of modeling and analysis tools.""

The project sets out two primary goals:

Educational Priority – Career Development: Empower educators with emerging tools and resources to become active participants in the environmental movement.

Environmental Priority – Improve Air Quality: Raise public awareness of circular economy strategies that reduce waste and improve air quality

To achieve these goals, the team will:

Train teachers using EPA's CE educational materials and support them in integrating CE concepts into their courses and curricula.

Guide teachers and students through a hands-on project to design and build an outdoor structure using reused materials, while assessing its environmental impact.

Host exhibits and workshops in underserved Texas communities, where students and teachers will present their work and engage the public in circular economy principles.

The project will involve UTA faculty members as mentors, UTA students as research assistants and volunteers, and high school teachers, each of whom will reach between 20 and 30 students. Beyond the classroom, the team will host traveling workshops aimed at underserved communities. ""These workshops will educate and inform students and their parents about the circular economy and how to reuse materials for different purposes,"" Dr. Makhmalbaf noted.

""K-12 education and research matters to me,"" she said. ""This program allows us to educate teachers about cutting-edge research, giving them the skills to teach critical thinking, problem-solving, and build environmentally focused curriculum through performance-based building design strategies.""

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers.
New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users.
Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

New York, 25 September 2025 - New commitments to boost renewable energy and increase access to electricity and clean cooking technologies by 2030 have brought the finance and investment pledged through the United Nations to US$ 1.6 trillion, with $284 billion already mobilized, according to the fourth edition of the Energy Compacts Annual Progress Report being released today.

The report, which is being launched at the EnergyNow SDG7 Action Forum on the margins of the UN General Assembly, shows expanding action under the Energy Compact voluntary commitments on both energy access and transition. Of the $284 billion mobilized or deployed since 2021 through the Compacts, the majority has been private sector investment in renewable power generation. The report cites figures from the 2025 Tracking SDG7 Report that over $4 trillion total investment is needed annually to reduce the ranks of 660 million people living without electricity and over 2 billion still cooking with polluting fuels, while setting the world on a climate action trajectory towards net-zero emissions by 2050 and averting ever-worsening climate impacts.

""The world is entering a decisive moment for energy,"" noted the leadership of UN-Energy -- Haoliang Xu, Acting Administrator of UNDP and Co-Chair of UN-Energy; Damilola Ogunbiyi, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All and Co-Chair of UN-Energy; and Li Junhua, Under-Secretary-General of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which serves as the Secretariat for UN-Energy.

""Choices made today will determine not only whether we achieve our climate and development goals, but also how future generations experience prosperity, equity, and security,"" the three UN-Energy leaders added. ""The Energy Compacts are proving that transformation is possible [...], that solutions to advance the global energy transition are no longer abstract -- they are investment-ready and being scaled, adapted, and delivered.""

Expanding results on energy transition and access

Progress on achieving affordable and clean energy for all -- Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 -- has been moving forward, but not at the scale and pace needed to meet the deadline of the 2030 Agenda or the climate targets under the Paris Agreement. The Energy Compacts progress report outlines commitments from governments and the private sector, which include planned spending by countries for both domestic and international action to increase energy access, efficiency and renewables, as well as private sector investment slated in these areas. Since the Energy Compacts were launched in 2021-- in connection with the UN High-level Dialogue on Energy -- 209 commitments have been registered and substantial results generated, according to the report.

By providing new and improved electricity connections, Energy Compact proponents have enhanced electricity access for 285 million people, a significant increase of 108 million people in the past year. Progress on enhancing clean cooking access by Energy Compact proponents remains slower, with 33 million people added since 2021, up from 23 million last year. The latest Tracking SDG7 Report showed that population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa continues to outpace access gains, leaving approximately 14 million additional people without clean cooking solutions every year.

Updated figures also show how Energy Compacts have had positive impacts on a wide range of SDG goals, such as improving electricity access at over 10,400 health facilities (SDG3), and by helping to deploy over 2.8 million electric vehicles and over 336,000 charging stations (SDG11).

The report includes guidance on how national governments, regions and cities, private companies, financial institutions, UN agencies and civil society organizations can submit their own Energy Compact commitments through an online process.

The report notes that, as countries roll out their updated national climate commitments under the Paris Agreement, incorporating energy targets through national Energy Compacts can serve as an important tool, citing Indonesia and Nepal as examples. Case studies in the report highlight the diversity of Energy Compacts, ranging from a woman-led, solar-powered digital community centre in Guatemala to a Japanese business that enables customers to track the source of their electricity, as needed to work towards 24/7 carbon-free energy.

The report was prepared by UN-Energy, the coordination mechanism which includes nearly 30 UN and international organizations that work on energy issues, with data compiled and analysed by Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL).

California has long been one of the most expensive states in the nation with its high cost of living and expensive housing. Meanwhile, a recent report revealed that since the rollback of pandemic era policies, California has developed the highest poverty rate in the US, alongside Louisiana.

The state has also had to grapple with increasingly extreme weather fueled by climate change from devastating and deadly wildfires, year after year, that displace entire communities and spread smoke across the region to grueling heatwaves and intense winter storms. In January, wildfires tore through the LA communities of Altadena and the Pacific Palisades, killing 31 people and destroying more than 18,000 structures.

People often perceive climate change as a set of future costs, but the consequences are already impacting people in unexpected ways, including inflation, food prices and availability, and insurance, said Ken Alex, with UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and Environment.

“We really wanted to take a deeper look at the costs to individuals [and] to businesses,” Alex said. “These are immediate costs that are affecting people in their current lives.”

“It’s not a future set of abstract numbers. It’s real and it’s immediate,” he added.

The report highlights the far-reaching impacts of the January wildfires, among others, which resulted in $4.6bn in GDP losses and nearly $300m in lost wages for workers and businesses, eliminating generations of family wealth. Between 2017 and 2021, there were about $60bn in income losses across the state due to wildfires, according to a Moore Foundation report cited in the analysis.

Californians are facing skyrocketing power bills at the same time, and wildfire-related costs account for up to 13% of recent increases, the report states. Extreme heat further increases electricity costs each day, as when temperatures reach 95F, electricity costs rise by 1.6%.

Smoke exposure associated with wildfires in southern California costs an estimated $84.42 a person per day, according to a 2012 study cited in the report. The unhealthy air caused by fires is already affecting outdoor workers and by 2050 they are are expected to see future earnings losses of up to $55.4bn because of the climate. In 2018, wildfire smoke led to an estimated $7.8bn in health costs in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Addressing the climate crisis costs money, Alex said, but there are massive costs for failing to take action.

“Taking action on things like climate change through technology reduces costs rather than increases it, and if we continue to fail to take action, that’s actually more impactful from a cost perspective.”

The report authors hope to conduct further research to uncover additional costs, Alex said, and would like to see the issue become a point of discussion in the next governor’s race and beyond.

“We cannot solve the affordability crisis in California without also solving the climate crisis,” Perry said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cefe5008027a8df5b30bd63dedc889af3c35e21/286_0_3211_2568/master/3211.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d26c1abc105896c98311613209c5fa3b",N,,2025-09-25 20:59:53.367157

Georgia Power said it will consider standalone energy storage with grid-charging capability, as well as storage with new or existing associated renewable resources and grid-charging capability.
Georgia Power is already operating battery energy storage systems and has plans for more.
Bidders may not submit projects that locate the facility on Georgia Power property unless it is a company-owned proposal.","Georgia Power is seeking 500 MW of energy storage with the ability to discharge for at least two hours, either standalone or with associated renewable resources, the utility said Tuesday.

A draft request for proposals specifies the resources should be online in 2028 at the earliest and no later than the end of 2031. Projects online by Nov. 28, 2031, will be given preference. The RFP targets energy storage capacity included in the company’s integrated resource plan approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission in 2022.

The soliciation is part of Georgia Power’s ongoing efforts to add renewables and bolster the reliability of its electric grid. Earlier this month, the PSC approved five new utility-scale solar site power purchase agreements for Georgia Power, consisting of a total of 1,068 MW that will be built by third-party companies. Plans for the renewable generation were also included in Georgia Power’s 2022 IRP.

The storage RFP announced this week will be administered by independent evaluator Ascend Analytics, and a bidders conference will be held Monday for parties seeking more information. The draft RFP schedule anticipates regulator approval of RFP documents in December, proposals due in January 2026 and contracts executed about a year later.

Georgia Power said it will consider standalone energy storage with grid-charging capability, as well as storage with new or existing associated renewable resources and grid-charging capability.

Georgia Power is already operating battery energy storage systems and has plans for more. The utility’s 65-MW Mossy Branch BESS is located in Talbot County and began commercial operation in November 2024. Another 765 MW was authorized by the Georgia PSC and is projected to enter commercial operation in 2026, the utility said.

Battery storage “will continue to play a critical role in the power grid of the future, improving reliability and advancing sustainability,” the utility said in a Sept. 12 statement. “Additionally, the integration of BESS with other technologies like smart grids and electric vehicles creates new opportunities for optimizing energy use and enhancing grid resilience.”

According to the draft RFP, Georgia Power will only accept submissions for facilities that will be interconnected to the Southern Co. transmission system. Southern is Georgia Power’s parent company.

Bidders may not submit projects that locate the facility on Georgia Power property unless it is a company-owned proposal. Any storage paired with a renewable resource submission must interconnect to the same point of interconnection as the renewable resource, according to the draft RFP document.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/YYG0ja45oZ1-oDN_Yh7ECCcb0oa66_QTRNbnQsaOmPg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZW9yZ2lhX1Bvd2VyX01vc3N5X0JyYW5jaF9TdG9yYWdlXy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-09-25 22:58:24.165225

ERCOT has seen a surge in large-load interconnection requests this year, mainly driven by hyperscale data center expansions and emerging AI compute clusters.
According to Enerdatics’ August 2025 U.S. Data Center Overview, data center demand in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has surpassed 20 GW of potential load, representing roughly one-third of the interconnection queue’s 60 GW backlog.
“NRG’s selection of this site for potential development of critical power generation supported by a data center project marks an exciting step forward for both LandBridge and the entire Delaware Basin,” said Jason Long, Chief Executive Officer of LandBridge.
NRG pivoted sharply over the past year to package its generation development and merchant expertise around ERCOT’s fast-growing data center load.","LandBridge Co., a Permian-focused land and infrastructure firm with 277,000 surface acres in the Delaware sub-region in Texas, and NRG Energy, one of the U.S.’s largest independent power producers, have inked a strategic agreement for a potential 1,100 MW natural gas–fired generation facility in Reeves County, Texas, to power a hyperscale data center.

The agreement, announced on Sept. 23, identifies a LandBridge-owned site in the Delaware Basin, adjacent to the Waha natural gas hub, where NRG could construct a large-scale, grid-connected power plant tailored to support a hyperscale data center. While no final investment decision has been made, the filing of air permit applications and interconnection requests signals an early step toward development, contingent on securing a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).

If the project advances, commercial operation could begin by year-end 2029, aligning with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)’s growing demand from data centers and other large loads. ERCOT has seen a surge in large-load interconnection requests this year, mainly driven by hyperscale data center expansions and emerging AI compute clusters.

According to Enerdatics’ August 2025 U.S. Data Center Overview, data center demand in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has surpassed 20 GW of potential load, representing roughly one-third of the interconnection queue’s 60 GW backlog. The analysis notes that concentration around Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio is straining system planning and transmission timelines. Wholesale prices in ERCOT’s West and South zones have averaged $45–$65/MWh year-to-date, with peak spikes topping $200/MWh during summer heat waves, underscoring the value of dispatchable gas generation to firm intermittent renewables.

While Texas’s Public Utility Commission has streamlined generator interconnection under its “connect-and-manage” framework, ERCOT’s queue backlog remains high, with more than 60 GW of projects—including over 20 GW of data center load—awaiting study and upgrade commitments. To address financing hurdles for new dispatchable capacity, the Texas Energy Fund has approved low-interest loans for multiple gas-fired projects since mid-2025, including a $216 million, 20-year loan at 3% for NRG’s 456-MW project at the T.H. Wharton gas plant site in Houston in August. Meanwhile, retail electric providers are innovating offerings for large-load customers—data centers among them—by crafting bespoke rate structures, fixed-price hedges, and bundled services that lock in energy costs, hedge against market volatility, and support credit requirements for lengthy PPAs.

If LandBridge and NRG advance their 1,100-MW project on schedule, commercial operation by 2029 would coincide with projected ERCOT peak demand growth—about 10 GW from data centers and another 5 GW from transport and industrial electrification—helping to alleviate capacity shortages and reduce volatility.

The Delaware Basin spans West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, forming the western sub-region of the prolific Permian Basin and encompassing Reeves, Loving and Pecos counties in Texas alongside Eddy and Lea counties in New Mexico. Its extensive oil-and-gas pipelines, abundant low-cost natural gas at the Waha market hub, and existing high-voltage transmission corridors have attracted hyperscale data center developers seeking sites with ready fuel supply, grid interconnection, and space for large-footprint campuses.

LandBridge, formed by private equity firm Five Point Infrastructure LLC, actively manages its 277,000 acres to support energy and infrastructure development, drawing on its owner’s track record in energy, water management, and sustainable infrastructure in the Permian Basin.

“NRG’s selection of this site for potential development of critical power generation supported by a data center project marks an exciting step forward for both LandBridge and the entire Delaware Basin,” said Jason Long, Chief Executive Officer of LandBridge. He notably added the collaboration further advances LandBridge’s powered land strategy and bolsters the value the company offers to “blue-chip” power generators and digital infrastructure developers.

For NRG, one of the largest competitive power generators and retail suppliers in the U.S., the prospective 1.1-GW plant underscores a broader push to align dispatchable gas capacity with the explosive growth of digital infrastructure in ERCOT. The company brings deep experience balancing merchant generation and long-term contracts, a skillset increasingly vital as hyperscale demand reshapes load patterns and fuels volatility across West Texas.

NRG pivoted sharply over the past year to package its generation development and merchant expertise around ERCOT’s fast-growing data center load. In its Q2 2025 earnings call, management announced long-term retail power agreements totaling 295 MW—expandable to 1 GW over a 10-year initial term, with options to extend to 20 years. Pricing is above the company’s midpoint target and structured with protected margins and hedges designed to secure returns. Beyond that, NRG reports more than 4 GW of joint development agreements and letters of intent with data center customers, supported by 2.4 GW of natural gas turbine capacity reserved for activation once contracts are finalized.

The strategy is reinforced by NRG’s partnership with GE Vernova and Kiewit to deliver 5.4 GW of combined-cycle gas generation across U.S. data center sites—what executives describe as a turnkey proposition that couples advanced turbine technology, balance-sheet strength, and fuel logistics to serve hyperscale and AI compute demand.

NRG has also bolstered its portfolio through acquisitions and state-backed financing designed to expand dispatchable capacity in ERCOT and beyond. In August 2025, the company closed on LS Power’s 13-GW natural gas portfolio and 6-GW Commercial & Industrial Virtual Power Plant platform, extending its reach across both ERCOT and PJM.

“We are pleased to explore bringing reliable energy solutions to West Texas,” said Robert J. Gaudette, executive vice president and president of NRG Business and Wholesale Operations, on Tuesday.“Once anchored by a long-term customer, the site has the potential to foster innovation and support data center growth, economic resilience, and grid stability in the region.”

LandBridge stressed in its release that the agreement remains preliminary. Development is subject to execution of a power purchase agreement, regulatory approvals, financing, and other customary conditions, and the project may not proceed as described.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/datacenternewbuilds-enerdatics-aug2025.png,N,,2025-09-25 20:02:41.227901

David Smith, vice president of EES Coke Battery, testified for the defense in the bench trial of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Air Act lawsuit against EES Coke Battery and DTE Energy.

EES Coke Battery’s net worth is about $135 million to $155 million, Smith said. The facility, which produces coke, a raw material in the steelmaking process, is owned by DTE Energy.

Smith said he reviewed a type of technology called a Claus reactor for potential installation at EES Coke Battery, and said it could reduce sulfur dioxide content by 33%.

The coke battery burns low-sulfur coal, Smith said, and spends about $60 more per ton on the product than regular coal, he said.

If the facility made the “capital venture” of installing the technology, EES would have net zero income and 170 jobs would be lost, Smith said.

‘It’s been a challenging year at EES’

The EES Coke Battery executive said he has not considered seeking a permit for Clean Air Act violations found by the court, as he’s been preparing for trial.

“It’s been a challenging year at EES, and we’re not near max production,” Smith said.

At multiple points during his Thursday testimony, Smith appeared to give responses that contradicted his deposition.

During cross-examination, U.S. attorney Samantha Ricci questioned Smith about whether EES Coke Battery employed New Source Review experts between 2012 and 2014. Smith said he lacks the knowledge and involvement to answer the question during testimony Thursday.

Ricci then presented the transcript of Smith’s deposition, in which he said the Zug Island facility employed New Source Review experts during those years, and provided specific names.

Michigan regulator stands behind 2014 permit for Zug Island facility

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy stands behind the validity of EES Coke’s 2014 permit and decided not to join the lawsuit, said Annette Switzer, director of the air quality division of the state’s environmental regulator.

Prior to 2014, EES Coke never provided a permit for a major modification of which Switzer is aware, she said.

The State Implementation Plan is Michigan’s plan for controlling air pollution and meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

The Michigan regulator can issue SIP-approved permits, meaning it has final call on permits, said Constantine Blathras, a former EPA environmental engineer who appeared at the trial Thursday via a prerecorded video of his deposition.

Blathras’ LinkedIn page states that his position at the EPA ended in June.

Blathras said that unless EGLE asks the EPA to do so, the federal regulator does not “look back and green-light” permits.

The EPA did not find any inconsistencies with the Clean Air Act and did not put forth comments during the draft period for EES Coke Battery’s 2014 permit, Blathras said.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ZugIslandRoad-1-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-25 19:01:29.790800

Are you surprised? Of course not! California is a leader on deploying clean energy, setting new records seemingly every year. Because of that, California’s emissions have been on a steady march downward year after year… Right?

Wrong. I’ve been tracking this carefully, and I’ve been dismayed that, prior to the past few years, California’s electricity sector emissions stayed constant for roughly half a decade.

As California continues to pursue its clean energy and climate goals, it’s important to pause every now and then to take stock of progress. I wanted to understand, why did emissions from California’s electricity sector flatline for so long between 2017 and 2022? And what factors have led to the recent decrease?

I’ll answer those questions and more in this blog.

Emissions ups and downs

First, it’s important to recognize that California has made tremendous strides in reducing electricity sector emissions over the past two decades. California has cut these emissions in half from the peak in 2001. But it’s been a bumpy ride down.

For example, a severe drought in 2007-2009 drastically reduced hydroelectric generation, which led to a spike in emissions when fossil fueled generation filled the gap. Then in 2012, another spike in emissions occurred when the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station suddenly shut down, which once again led to fossil fueled generation filling the gap.

The emissions trajectory of California’s electricity sector has always been bumpy, but the flatline post 2017 was particularly curious to me. So let’s zoom in on the past decade.

Renewable energy on the rise

The first thing I went to examine was recent trends in California’s clean electricity generation, and indeed, the state has made tremendous strides in adding renewable energy to the grid over the past decade.

Unsurprisingly, the star of California’s clean energy transition has been solar. Solar generation has soared, nearly quintupling since 2014. Wind generation started at much higher levels than solar and still increased by nearly 40% over the same period. Nuclear, geothermal, and biomass generation have all remained essentially constant over the past decade.

And then there’s hydropower, the spiky blue line that bounces all over the graph. After starting out at very low levels due to a multi-year drought, hydro generation spiked in 2017, a year that saw record levels of precipitation (along with the Oroville dam failure!). Hydropower then continued to bounce around depending on how wet the year was. And because California gets so much electricity from hydro, this phenomenon is one of the keys to answering my questions.

Clean and emitting generation flatline

Looking at clean electricity generation is only half the picture. The other half is emitting generation, particularly natural gas and unspecified imports, which contribute significantly to California’s heat-trapping emissions. And when you put all the pieces together, it becomes clear why California’s electricity sector emissions stagnated.

The answer: In total, both emitting and clean generation were essentially constant from 2017-2022.

On the clean side, when you add up all the sources of generation, you end up with a relatively flat line. That’s because hydro generation was much higher earlier in the 2017-2022 period and decreased later on, counteracting the rise in solar generation.

On the emitting side, roughly three quarters of emitting generation comes from gas. While there was a slight uptick in gas generation in recent years, that was offset by a sharp decline in unspecified imports. Coal also continued its steady decline, but since coal is already such a small part of California’s energy mix, it barely registers on the graph. So in total, generation from emitting resources was relatively flat from 2017-2022.

Finally, I should mention that, despite all the talk about rapid load growth due to data centers, manufacturing, electric vehicles, etc., energy demand on most of California’s grid has remained quite stable over the past decade. (Though that’s in part because the growth of rooftop solar has offset small increases in demand.) So load growth isn’t a big factor influencing recent trends in electricity sector emissions. However, electricity demand is projected to increase significantly going forward, and those future increases in demand could change the story around future emissions trends. (But to mitigate those impacts, it’s critical to add electric vehicles and data centers to the grid in a way that helps drive down emissions and supports grid reliability!)

And there you have it. Since emitting generation was relatively constant, electricity sector emissions also held steady.

With that mystery solved, let’s move on to the good news.

Emissions now trending down

As I mentioned at the outset, California’s electricity sector emissions have resumed their downward trend in the past couple of years. The state-wide electricity sector emissions data in the first graph came from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), and at the time of writing, CARB has not yet released data for 2023 and 2024; however, we do have data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO).

CAISO serves roughly 80% of California, so CAISO emissions track closely with state-wide emissions. And finally, after years of stagnation, CAISO emissions dropped significantly in 2023 and 2024. And by looking at CAISO emissions from the first six months of each year (the dotted line below), it seems likely that emissions will at least hold steady in 2025.

After a long pause, clean generation is once again pushing fossil-fueled generation out of the energy mix and bringing down emissions.

Reaching California’s clean electricity goals

Looking ahead, California has ambitious clean energy goals, and there’s still a long way to go to achieve them. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) establishes goals for the electricity sector in its Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) process, and the Commission’s most recent IRP decision established emissions targets for specific years.

The near-term goal is to reduce state-wide electricity sector emissions down to 30 MMT by 2030. It’s certainly possible, but to get there, utilities will have to maintain the pace of reductions that we’ve seen over the past few years. That means continuing to build solar, wind, and energy storage at a rapid clip. It also means avoiding overreliance on hydro to deliver emissions reductions since hydro generation has been so volatile, and it may become even more volatile with more extreme weather in a changing climate.

Unfortunately, California’s investor-owned utilities have started to cast doubt on the feasibility of these goals. PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E have raised concerns about the loss of federal clean energy tax credits for wind and solar and data center load growth making these goals unrealistic.

But now is not the time for California to dial back its clean energy ambitions. California has been hard at work to pass new policies that will make the clean energy transition more affordable, such as public financing for large transmission projects and expanding western energy markets through independent governance.

With California’s electricity sector emissions finally trending down again, the state should stay the course to reach its current goals, all while continuing to identify and implement solutions that make the grid more reliable and affordable.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/coal-plant-smoke-stack-pacificorp-utah.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 20:59:36.007749

As of September 9, 2025, President Trump has signed 199 Executive Orders, including those to “reinvigorate” the coal industry, withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, and rescind the Council on Environmental Quality’s regulations implementing NEPA—the National Environmental Policy Act. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced dozens of deregulatory actions to “unleash American energy.”

It’s no exaggeration to say that this flurry of deregulatory action is unprecedented.

However, not all these actions constitute federal regulation. In the wake of all this deregulatory talk and activity, it’s worth examining what exactly a federal regulation is (and what it is not) and how the public can fight back against environmental deregulation.

What is a federal regulation?

In short, a federal regulation is a rule issued by a federal government agency that has the force and effect of law. While there are different types of rules, this blog post focuses on what affects the rights of the public and are legally enforceable (assuming the agency has the authority to adopt them and that it follows the proper procedure for doing so).

How are federal regulations different than Executive Orders?

In comparison to federal regulations, an Executive Order is a written directive to the government (including agencies), signed by the President. These Executive Orders often direct federal agencies on how they should implement statutes or set priorities, but they cannot override federal laws and statutes. Additionally, unlike federal regulations, they are not subject to the notice-and-comment process and do not bind the public.

How do federal agencies make regulations?

The authority of agencies to adopt a regulation typically comes from a statute, which is passed by Congress. The process that the agency must follow is mandated by the Administrative Procedures Act, which requires agencies to hold a public comment period on a proposed rule before it becomes final; This process is referred to as “notice-and-comment rulemaking”—more on this further below.

How does a proposed rule become a federal regulation?

To start, agencies must publish proposed rules in the Federal Register. When they do, they also generally must allow the public to submit comments to the agency on this proposed rule. This public comment period usually lasts between 30 and 60 days (though the agency may use shorter or longer periods).

During this time, anybody can submit information or arguments to the agency, and the agency must consider these comments. After reviewing public comments, the agency will issue a final rule, which is published in the Federal Register and incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations.

What impact does public comment have?

Critically, agencies must base final rules on the rulemaking record, which includes public comments. If they don’t—say, if the agency arbitrarily publishes a final rule in blatant disregard of public comments—then that rule could be subject to judicial review. This all means that the public has a vital role to play in the notice and comment rulemaking process. By commenting on a proposed rule, everyone can meaningfully influence or change federal regulations.

Oracle and OpenAI’s newly operational flagship site, Stargate I, in Abilene is expected to generate more than five gigawatts of capacity, which will run more than two million chips.

“This significantly advances our progress toward the commitment we announced at the White House in January to invest $500 billion into 10 gigawatts of AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. We now expect to exceed our initial commitment thanks to strong momentum with partners including Oracle and SoftBank,” Open AI said.

Its cloud infrastructure is already enabling OpenAI to train models like ChatGPT. One building on the Stargate I site is fully operational; another is nearly complete.

The site has already created thousands of jobs, Open AI says. More are expected as operations expand, including specialized jobs for electricians, equipment operators, and technicians. Stargate I is projected to contribute more than $1 billion in direct and indirect economic benefit to Abilene over 20 years, it says.

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, toured Stargate I in Abilene Wednesday, saying, “Texas is leading the way to make sure the United States beats China in the AI race. This is the beginning of a long-term effort to invest in American jobs, supply the additional power needed for AI, and deliver products and services that will benefit all Americans.”

Cruz recently released a policy framework outlining how Congress and the Trump administration can lead in AI, including streamlining federal permitting for AI infrastructure.

OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank also announced this week that they were building five more Stargate sites nationwide, including in Shackleford County, Texas. Others are slated to be built in New Mexico and the Midwest.

Farther north in Amarillo, Fermi America in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, is developing next-generation electric grids to support AI technology and build “the world’s largest energy-driven Artificial Intelligence complex.”

Fermi was cofounded by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and his son, Griffin Perry, who is co-founder of a private investment firm, Grey Rock Energy Partners. Grey Rock claims it’s developing next-generation electric grids to deliver highly redundant power at gigawatt scale necessary to sustain next-generation AI.

The Amarillo campus is the “first-of-its-kind behind-the-meter HyperGrid™ campus” that will “integrate the largest nuclear power complex in America, the nation’s biggest combined-cycle natural gas project, utility grid power, solar power, and battery energy storage to deliver next-generation artificial intelligence,” Fermi says.

Spanning 5,769 acres, it’s projected to deliver up to 11 gigawatts of power and 18 million square feet of AI capacity, it says. It’s being built in the center of a natural gas powerhouse in Texas at the confluence of several of the largest natural gas pipelines and located on top of one of the largest known natural gas fields.

The site “offers a prolific, firm, clean-burning and redundant gas supply,” Fermi says. It’s also being built near Pantex, a primary nuclear facility, underscoring “Fermi’s strategic position to build clean, safe, new nuclear power for America’s next-generation AI,” it says. The HyperGrid “is expected to deliver clean, highly reliable base-load power at unprecedented scale.”

“The Chinese are building 22 nuclear reactors today to power the future of AI,” Perry Sr. said. “America has none. We’re behind, and it’s all hands-on-deck.” Earlier this year, President Donald Trump issued executive orders to expand energy dominance which “demands that American innovators rise to the occasion,” he said. “No one does energy better than Texas, and Fermi America and the Texas Tech University System are answering the call.”

On Thursday, Fermi and Texas Tech announced a new partnership with Siemens Energy to fulfil Trump’s “promise to restore U.S. energy dominance and to ensure America wins the global race to power the future of artificial intelligence.”

“Winning the AI arms race doesn’t just take software developers. It takes more electricity,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said. The Fermi campus “proves that we can integrate natural gas, nuclear energy, and artificial intelligence into a single, powerful ecosystem. Modern energy infrastructure isn’t a luxury, it’s the foundation of global leadership. By advancing President Trump’s Energy Dominance Agenda, we’re not just fueling America – we’re powering the future of intelligence.”

“No one understands the global energy race better than Donald Trump,” Perry added. The Trump administration’s departments of Energy, Interior and War “are all working tirelessly to secure America’s position in this AI race and to ensure that our private sector, with the strong support of this pro-energy administration, has what we need to lead the way in abundant, reliable, and innovative energy solutions,” he said.

The lawsuits brought by about 4,000 homeowners, insurance companies and local governments like fire districts were set to be tried together.","DENVER — Xcel Energy expects to pay about $640 million to settle lawsuits alleging it was responsible for starting Colorado’s most destructive wildfire that killed two people and destroyed nearly 1,000 homes in 2021, the company said Wednesday.

The announcement came as jury selection was set to begin Thursday in a two-month trial combining lawsuits brought by hundreds of homeowners, insurers and others over the fire in the heavily populated suburbs between Denver and Boulder. Court documents confirmed a settlement has been reached and the trial canceled.

Minneapolis-based Xcel has maintained that its equipment did not cause or contribute to the fire. It said it does not admit any fault under the settlement.

Lawyer James Avery said the settlement provides hope to the hundreds of fire victims he represents. Most of them plan to accept confidential payouts already determined by mediators based on their circumstances.

“There is a sense of relief and hope for an ending to this tragic disaster that they continue to struggle with as they rebuild their homes and lives,” he said.

As global warming makes wildfires worse in the western U.S., utilities in the region have spent billions of dollars in recent years on insurance costs and trying to upgrade old equipment to reduce the chances of accidentally igniting a blaze. They have also faced lawsuits after major fires from people who contended they did not do enough.

In Colorado, investigators found that a sparking power line owned by Xcel was one of the causes of the fire that was fanned by high winds. Embers from a smoldering scrap-wood fire set days before on a nearby property used by a Christian religious communal group were also found to have been another cause.

The smoldering fire at the Twelve Tribes property had been buried by residents a few days before in a way that was approved by firefighters who stopped by to investigate, authorities said.

The two fires combined into an inferno following months of drought amid a winter nearly devoid of snow. It spread rapidly in winds that gusted up to 100 mph in places, causing $2 billion in damage.

Killed in the fire were a 69-year-old man who lived near where the fire started and a 91-year-old woman last seen trying to rescue her dogs from her home in Superior.

Authorities spent 18 months investigating the cause of the Marshall Fire and determined criminal charges were not warranted for either Xcel or the Christian group.

Xcel said in a statement Wednesday that it, Qwest Corp., which leased space on Xcel’s power poles for fiber optic cable, and Teleport Communications America LLC reached agreements in principle to settle all claims involved. But the company said homeowners and others who filed lawsuits against it still had to decide whether to opt into the agreement.

“We recognize that the fire and its aftermath have been difficult and painful for many, and we hope that our and the telecom defendants’ contributions in today’s settlement can bring some closure for the community,” Xcel CEO Bob Frenzel said.

A transcript of a hearing held Wednesday to discuss the deal has been sealed until the end of the day. Lawyers must update the court on the status of the settlement within the next month, Judge Christopher Zenisek said in an order.

Xcel said about $350 million of its settlement payment would be funded by its insurance coverage and that its customers would not pay any of it.

The lawsuits brought by about 4,000 homeowners, insurance companies and local governments like fire districts were set to be tried together. They suffered a variety of losses, from smoke damage to losing their homes and income.

A construction company Avery represents estimates it lost millions of dollars in business and equipment and likely won’t participate in the settlement, opting to pursue its own lawsuit instead, he said.

“The intention is to resolve the case with just a couple of exceptions,” he said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Xcel.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 20:03:06.946546

With Planned Parenthood’s future hanging in the balance, this case will not stay under the radar for much longer.","In an era of unprecedented partisan divide, where seemingly every policy and protest deepens America’s political fault lines, all eyes are on the judiciary as the ultimate battleground. At the same time, the issue of abortion continues to routinely command national headlines.

And so, it is very peculiar that a pivotal case that could serve as the final nail in the coffin for Planned Parenthood in its year of disaster has so far slipped beneath the radar.

U.S. ex rel. Doe v. Planned Parenthood is currently before the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, with en banc oral arguments scheduled for today. This False Claims Act lawsuit represents the latest entry on a quickly accumulating list of regulatory violations, legal gambles and gross medical negligence by Planned Parenthood — missteps that could very soon precipitate the downfall of the nation’s largest abortion provider.

The case stems from a decade-old scandal that exposed Planned Parenthood’s practice of profiting from the sale of organs and tissue from aborted babies. Shortly after the release of the undercover videos at the center of that story, Texas and Louisiana moved to terminate the organization from their Medicaid programs, barring it from billing taxpayers for services.

Planned Parenthood fought back in court, securing a series of temporary injunctions, but all the while continuing to submit Medicaid reimbursement claims. This was a big gamble — the group pocketed millions in Medicaid funds during litigation, despite knowing its eligibility was in question. And that big gamble may soon result in a big loss.

In the meantime, this year has seen even more self-induced damage at Planned Parenthood. The New York Times revealed a disturbing pattern of medical negligence, incompetence and unsanitary conditions at Planned Parenthood facilities — issues that put women’s lives at risk. (This is in addition to the hundreds of thousands of lives ended by abortion at Planned Parenthood facilities each year.) From administering incorrect medications to preparing patients for the wrong procedures, Planned Parenthood repeatedly failed to meet even the most basic standards of care that women deserve.

Shortly after the Times expose, Planned Parenthood of Greater New York shuttered its flagship Manhattan location, citing financial strains. Such closures have now spread to cities across the country — over 40 closures, at last count — as numerous state laws have limited Planned Parenthood’s abortion business, in addition to federal legislation passed in July barring abortion providers from accessing Medicaid funds. Planned Parenthood, which has long relied on taxpayer dollars to fill its coffers, is now suing over Congress’s exercise of its Spending Clause discretion to stop taxpayer funds from going to abortion providers. That litigation is ongoing.

Planned Parenthood’s access to tax dollars has also been limited by the Supreme Court ruling in Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, which upheld states’ authority to decide whether abortion providers qualify for Medicaid reimbursements.

Against this backdrop, the under-the-radar case of U.S. ex rel. Doe v. Planned Parenthood represents an existential threat to Planned Parenthood.

The Fifth Circuit has ruled that Texas and Louisiana were within their rights to drop Planned Parenthood from Medicaid, making clear that the organization was ineligible for these taxpayer funds all along. Under the False Claims Act, money obtained from the government while ineligible — even if collected under a court order that is later overturned — must be repaid in full. Planned Parenthood has not yet returned the money to American taxpayers.

Now, Planned Parenthood could be on the hook for treble damages, civil penalties, interest and legal fees, pushing its total potential liability in the pending case past $1.8 billion — a financial catastrophe for the abortion giant that could hasten its end.

Given its potential impact, U.S. ex rel. Doe v. Planned Parenthood is likely the most important case you’ve never heard of. With Planned Parenthood’s future hanging in the balance, this case will not stay under the radar for much longer.

Second in a series about rising electricity prices in Pennsylvania. Read the first story here.

PHILADELPHIA—In the steep hills above the Schuylkill River, across the street from a famous cheesesteak place and at the end of a quiet block, sits a typical Philadelphia rowhouse: narrow brick, front porch, fig trees growing in the yard. From the sidewalk, there’s nothing to distinguish this house from its neighbors. But there’s a tiny clue that something is a little different: a sticker on the electric meter with a Solarize Philly logo.

The owner, Liz Robinson, is the current executive director at the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association, a volunteer-based nonprofit that works to increase solar adoption in Pennsylvania. She’s been involved in renewable energy policy in the city and on the state level for decades. Almost 10 years ago, Robinson had solar panels installed on the roof of this house, which she bought as a rental property.

Wearing an “electrify your future” T-shirt, Robinson pointed at the digital readout on the meter. “This is telling me how much electricity is being produced, and even on a cloudy day like today, I’m getting a fair amount of electricity,” she said. Her small system covers the electricity bills for this property and 60 percent of the bill at her house down the street.

“I thought it would pay for itself in 10 years, but because electricity prices have been rising, it paid for itself in less than nine years,” she said. “It’s the best defense against a rising electric bill.”

Robinson remembers a time when the dream of widespread renewable energy for Pennsylvania, and not just for scattered individual households, felt within reach. In the early 2000s, the state was a renewable-energy pioneer, passing a law that required a certain percentage of the state’s electricity generation to come from alternative energy sources.

In 2010, then-Gov. Ed Rendell boasted about this Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, calling it “one of the most ambitious of its kind in America” and praising Pennsylvania as “a national leader in the field of alternative energy.” Since 2006, Rendell said, the state had made “remarkable progress,” citing growth in wind and solar generation.

“The Rendell administration did a lot of work to bring manufacturing into the state,” said Laurie Mazer, co-founder of Formation Energy, a Philadelphia-based solar developer. “There really was this moment where Pennsylvania was well ahead of the curve.”

But even as Rendell touted the state’s investment in renewable energy, the landscape was changing. In 2004, the same year the state enacted the AEPS law, drilling began on the first gas well in Pennsylvania to use hydraulic fracturing.

The fracking boom birthed a new way of thinking about energy. By 2013, in a speech about climate change, President Barack Obama was hailing natural gas as a “transition fuel that can power our economy with less carbon pollution,” phrasing that was popular in messaging on natural gas at the time. It was a “bridge” from dirty coal to cleaner renewables, a temporary solution that would lower emissions and secure energy independence.

Fifteen years later, that bridge extends endlessly into Pennsylvania’s future, with no glimpse of the other side in sight.

Natural gas production is still rising in the United States, and 60 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity generation now comes from natural gas. It’s so tied to electricity in some Pennsylvanians’ minds that they can’t imagine how the state could run without it. State Sen. Camera Bartolotta, a Republican who represents a heavily fracked district in the southwest, appears on a billboard on the turnpike with this message: “No fossil fuels, no electricity. Wake up America!”

Only 4 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity comes from renewable energy. Since 2015, that number has only increased by one percentage point, even as states such as Texas, Kansas, Iowa, South Dakota and Maine saw significant gains in renewables.

Pennsylvania now ranks second to last in the country when it comes to the percentage of its electricity generated by renewables, and in 2024, the state ranked 49th for renewable energy growth in the U.S. For utility-level solar, Pennsylvania ranked 41st, supplying just over 1 percent of the state’s electricity. For residential solar systems like Robinson’s, a separate metric from utility-level power generation, Pennsylvania is a middling 26th.

Pennsylvania’s reliance on gas is one of the problems at the root of the state’s soaring electric bills, experts say, because it means local consumers pay more whenever global gas prices go up.

In Texas, the only state that produces more gas than Pennsylvania, renewable energy’s share of the electric market has grown from 12 percent in 2015 to 34 percent in 2024. And residential electricity rates in Texas are about 20 percent lower than Pennsylvania’s, according to June federal figures.

Electricity prices in Pennsylvania continued to rise in 2025, following a sharp increase over the last few years that has hit Pennsylvania households hard. One reason for the most recent surge: data centers and the stress they are likely to put on the grid. New data centers are expected to drive soaring increases in electricity demand over the next five years, according to forecasts from Pennsylvania’s Public Utility Commission. To power them, investors want to build even more natural gas power plants.

“We have become over-reliant on gas as a transitional fuel, and we continue to argue that it’s a transition, yet we are not transitioning,” said Elizabeth Marx, the executive director at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project. “We continue to build out our delivery system for gas, and we are locking ratepayers in to pay for that system for 30 more years.”

“Clean Energy Now”

Robinson traces the origins of Pennsylvania’s failed promise as a leader in renewables to one big shift over the past 15 years.

“The change in the Republican Party is really the story here,” she said.

When she first started working in the field, moderate Republicans in Philadelphia’s collar counties were passionate advocates for conservation initiatives and open-minded about ideas like green energy. As Tea Party candidates and increasing polarization pushed this older generation of Republicans out of office, the legislature became more partisan, more contentious and less willing to compromise.

“It surprises me, in this day and age, how many climate deniers you have in the legislature. There’s this almost visceral disdain for solar and wind.”— Rep. Greg Vitali, D-Delaware County

At the same time, fracking gained ground in Pennsylvania, and natural gas companies poured money into Harrisburg, both through campaign contributions and lobbying. One example: the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, spent more on lobbying in Pennsylvania than in any other state in 2022, according to a Public Accountability Initiative analysis. “There’s a tremendous ownership of politicians that goes on in Pennsylvania by the gas industry,” Robinson said.

The resulting gridlock is particularly acute when it comes to energy issues. Anything that seems to threaten the dominance of natural gas is politically doomed. From the state’s contested membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to updating the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard to legalizing community solar, efforts to make real policy changes at the state level have met with resistance.

“It surprises me, in this day and age, how many climate deniers you have in the legislature. There’s this almost visceral disdain for solar and wind,” said Rep. Greg Vitali, a Democrat from suburban Delaware County who has served in the state legislature for more than 30 years and is considered an environmental leader at the capitol. “It goes beyond an intellectual disagreement.”

Vitali, the chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, said there was effective negotiation and “give and take” when the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard passed in 2004. That isn’t happening now.

One component of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Lightning Plan for energy reform is a bill to allow community solar, where customers can buy shares in a solar project even if they can’t host panels on their own roofs. The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House in May, but it’s now stuck in the Senate, where Republicans maintain a narrow majority. Republicans have controlled the Pennsylvania Senate since 1994.

That could pose problems if all of the gas power plants that PJM thinks it will need to meet growing demand over the next decade are built. Trump’s massive tariffs on steel are likely to further inflate costs, said Christopher Doleman, an LNG and gas specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Elowyn Corby, the mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, an affordable-solar advocacy group, said this state of affairs on renewables doesn’t reflect the feelings of the public. “It’s less about what Pennsylvanians want, because we’ve seen time and time again that when asked, Pennsylvanians like renewable energy. Pennsylvanians love solar,” she said.

The state legislature’s paralysis has effectively ceded leadership of energy policy to other forces, said Mazer, the solar developer. “We haven’t played as much of a role as we could have in deciding what our energy future looks like,” she said.

There’s another kind of energy gridlock at PJM Interconnection, the company that manages the electricity grid in all or parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C. When it comes to Pennsylvania’s emphasis on natural gas generation, PJM is a significant part of the problem, said David Masur, the executive director at PennEnvironment, an environmental organization in Pennsylvania that has closely tracked the state’s lagging investment in renewable energy.

“There’s just hundreds of projects in the queue, and something like 98 percent of them are renewables,” he said.

PennEnvironment estimated that PJM’s backlog of unapproved electricity projects could cost Pennsylvanians $12.5 billion in just one year. In January, after filing a complaint against PJM, Shapiro settled with the operator to stop a rate hike that could have tripled energy prices for Pennsylvanians.

If the system were working the way it’s supposed to, more solar and wind projects would have been coming online as their costs drop compared to gas. Instead, PJM’s delays have created a bottleneck.

“New competition is being blocked by this outmoded, vastly delayed interconnection system,” Corby said. “New energy is not able to come online quickly enough to keep our bills down. PJM needs to move a lot more things through the queue a lot more quickly.”

In a statement to Inside Climate News, a spokesperson for PJM, Jeffrey Shields, said the company has reformed its interconnection process, processing 140 gigawatts of capacity since 2023, with 63 more due to be processed in 2025 and 2026. PJM blames the slowdown on permitting and supply chain backlogs, “none of which are related to PJM,” and nationwide trends that are beyond the company’s control.

“Electricity supply is decreasing while demand is increasing, primarily from data centers, not only in PJM but across the country,” Shields said.

On a rainy day in May, protestors stood in front of PJM’s headquarters outside Philadelphia. Dressed in rain slickers and clutching umbrellas, the protestors held hand-painted signs reading, “Clean Energy Now” and “PJM, lower our electric bills. Connect clean energy.”

As cars zoomed behind him, state Rep. Chris Rabb spoke to the protesters and members of the press about his bill to increase transparency in PJM’s decision-making. Rabb, a Democrat, said he believed his bill could attract bipartisan support, a rare feat in Pennsylvania’s split legislature.

“The reason I think this might have some legs is because so many of our constituents—rural, urban, suburban—are struggling to pay their utility bills. And it’s only going to get worse if PJM continues to operate in this fashion,” he said. “I think it can garner some Republican votes, because they have ratepayers, too, who are not happy about the coming hikes. People are going to be mad as hell, right? They’re going to wonder who to blame.”

Powering the Future

Data centers built to power electricity-hungry artificial intelligence technology are projected to consume enormous quantities of power, and in Pennsylvania, gas producers see an opportunity to keep extending the “bridge.”

At Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick’s Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh in July, $90 billion in data center deals between tech companies and natural gas and pipeline companies were announced. These investments could lock in gas as the state’s primary electricity generator for another generation.

“There’s a slowing of production growth happening here in the United States, and the so-called shale revolution is in the later innings.”— Trey Cowan, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis

EQT, a natural gas company headquartered in Pittsburgh, said it would become a partner in a plan to convert the old coal-fired Homer City Generating Station into a 3,200-acre artificial intelligence campus with the country’s largest gas-fired power plant.

“This agreement ensures long-term energy security for the data center campus, while demonstrating our commitment to powering the future with Pennsylvania gas,” Corey Hessen, one of the leaders of the Homer City project, said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the costs of drilling for gas are going up. “There’s a slowing of production growth happening here in the United States, and the so-called shale revolution is in the later innings,” said Trey Cowan, an oil and gas energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “It’s getting more and more expensive to drill.”

It’s also getting more expensive to build natural gas power plants, said Sean O’Leary, senior researcher in energy and petrochemicals at the Ohio River Valley Institute: “The cost of building a gas-fired power plant has gone up by about two-and-a-half times.”

That could pose problems if all of the gas power plants that PJM thinks it will need to meet growing demand over the next decade are built.Trump’s massive tariffs on steel are likely to further inflate costs, said Christopher Doleman, an LNG and gas specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

And the premise that the bridge was originally built on—that natural gas made sense as a transition to renewables because it emitted fewer greenhouse gases than other fossil fuels—turns out to be far more complicated than the politicians of the 2010s claimed.

Although it’s true that burning natural gas emits fewer greenhouse gases than coal, evidence is growing that its production and transport damages the earth’s atmosphere more than previously thought. Methane is a far more potent driver of global warming than carbon dioxide.

Despite all that, both Corby and Robinson see reasons for hope. One of them is residential solar systems like Robinson’s, which are small enough to bypass the clogged PJM queue.

“It can come online incredibly quickly. It also takes much less time to build,” Corby said. “That’s a really intuitive and easy place to look, where we would see the results quickly.”

“It’s important that we remember Pennsylvania’s ability to do good things on energy has not been exclusively on the side of fossil fuels.”— Elowyn Corby, Vote Solar

More Pennsylvanians are clamoring to install solar panels of their own, especially as electricity prices go up. Residential solar installations increased in Pennsylvania in 2022 and 2023, according to the most recent data from the Solar Energy Industries Association. George Otto, a retiree in State College, said he decided to do so after years of watching Pennsylvania politicians fail to make progress on environmental or climate issues.

“It’s like pushing a rope to get those guys to move on any of this stuff. And so I figured, if we’re not going to be able to do it through them, then each of us can do what we can within our sphere of influence,” he said. “Now I’m happy to provide an example for others to look at and say, ‘Hey, this can work here.’” In addition to reducing his carbon footprint, Otto now pays nothing for electricity.

Pennsylvania has the potential to catch up on renewables, but it needs the political will. Even incremental shifts in power could do that, Robinson said. “Having the House be led by Democrats, even a one-seat majority, has made a world of difference,” she said. “If we can win the Senate, I think that changes everything.”

Corby is heartened by the state’s not-so-distant successes with renewable energy. “It’s important that we remember Pennsylvania’s ability to do good things on energy has not been exclusively on the side of fossil fuels,” she said.

“The question now is, as energy affordability and supply issues become increasingly pressing, will we let ourselves be bogged down by that history or enabled by it to lead again?”

For his part, Vitali has continued to introduce bills that could change the state’s trajectory, even if they have little chance of becoming law.

“There’s a quote I used to have [on] my desk. It said, ‘A leader should be a dealer in hope.’ I don’t feel very hopeful now,” he said. “But we try every day.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250903_robinson_529-2048x1354-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 18:02:45.648663

Discussions centred on the need to accelerate the deployment of offshore wind while continuing to support the UK’s homegrown oil and gas sector. Today, renewables represent just 1% of the port’s revenue - despite handling around 700 vessels annually – with more than 50% generated from oil and gas.

Port of Aberdeen outlined ambitious plans to become an international hub for offshore wind, including:

Deepening South Harbour for offshore wind assembly, integration, and marshalling

Installing a dedicated ring-crane for tow-in tow-out major component exchange

Redeveloping the Regent Centre and investing in warehousing for offshore wind operation and maintenance

These developments build on the port’s £420 million investment in Aberdeen South Harbour, which is already generating significant new business for the port and North East supply chain.

The visit followed the publication of Energy Secretary Ed Miliband’s Statement of Strategic Priorities for GBE. This includes investing in the supply chain projects needed to unlock clean energy deployment and support delivery of the Industrial Strategy, which recognises ports as a ‘foundational industry’.

Bob Sanguinetti DL, chief executive officer, Port of Aberdeen, said: “We welcomed the opportunity to engage with GBE’s Board and stressed the importance of ramping up renewables while continuing to support our homegrown oil and gas industry. This must be a conversation of and, not or.

“Offshore wind is the big opportunity on the horizon and we’re advancing projects that will position Aberdeen to capitalise on this. However, a concerted effort is needed to accelerate deployment if we’re to realise our full potential.”

Juergen Maier, chair, Great British Energy, said: “With the right policy and the right financial backing, we’re seeing how renewable energy jobs can be created. According to the CBI there are now 273,000 jobs directly in the green economy, with 100,000 of these in Scotland. The skills we need to accelerate the rollout of offshore wind all currently sit within O&G. This isn’t about clean and dirty energy, this is about highly skilled workers being deployed onto secure projects, with ports like Aberdeen primed and ready to deliver that growth.”",https://agcc.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/news/membernews/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/PoA-GBE-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 19:01:15.711239

Since July, when President Donald Trump signed the federal tax and spending bill that terminated the credit on Sept. 30, EV sales have been breaking records.

Here’s what you need to know.

As part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, consumers who buy a new plug-in electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicle can claim up to $7,500 as a federal tax credit for the purchase. Consumers who buy a used clean vehicle for $25,000 or less from a licensed dealership are entitled to as much as $4,000 back on their purchase. The credit was intended to spur EV adoption by offsetting the vehicles’ higher price compared with gas-powered models.

To receive the credit, the Internal Revenue Service says drivers who lease an EV must order and take delivery of their cars by the end of the month, while buyers who intend to finance or pay cash for their cars can order an EV by signing a contract or putting money down and taking delivery of the vehicle later.

EV sales began exploding shortly after the bill’s signing, increasing 26.4% in July compared with June — their second highest month on record — according to Cox Automotive. In August, EV sales hit a record high 9.9% of the market, and they are expected to be 10% of the market in September as buyer urgency continues to lift sales, Cox said. In preliminary estimates released Thursday, Cox said it expects 410,000 EVs will be sold in September — 21% more than a year ago.

How much do EVs cost compared with gas-powered vehicles?

The current average transaction price for an electric vehicle is $57,245 — well above the $48,179 average transaction price for a car powered with fossil fuels, according to Cox. The $9,000 price gap is slightly higher than the $7,500 Clean Vehicle Tax Credit.

The companies that make electric vehicles have some of the lowest supplies of cars, including Audi and Toyota, which saw the largest drops in EV inventory last month, Cox analysts said Thursday. While the supply of cars powered with fossil fuels is 78 days, it is 62 days for EVs, according to Cox. Toyota has a 34-day supply of vehicles and Honda has 53 days’ worth.

EV sales are expected to fall to about 300,000 units in the fourth quarter, leading to a total year-over-year EV sales increase of 1.3% in 2025 compared with 2024, according to Cox. Without the federal incentive, the so-called affordability gap between EVs and traditional vehicles poses a challenge for sustained EV adoption, though EVs are still expected to achieve 25% market share by 2030, analysts say.

“Our polling shows that once people start to drive electric, they don’t actually shift back,” said Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club's ""Clean Transportation for All"" campaign. “They’re better, faster cars, so we don’t anticipate people going back to buying a new gas car.”

In the short term, fewer types of electric vehicles will be available, as manufacturers pull their plans to bring new EVs to market. Last week, Stellantis canceled the electric version of its Jeep Gladiator pickup truck. Ford has also canceled plans for a three-row electric SUV, while Nissan, Porsche and Toyota have postponed new EV plans. Other companies are likely to add fewer bells and whistles to their vehicles to hold prices steady and to eliminate trim levels, analysts say.

Prices are also expected to increase. The tariffs Trump enacted this year haven’t yet had a significant impact on vehicle prices, but they are expected to. Cox predicts tariffs will increase prices on all new and used vehicles by 4% to 8% in the coming year, including electrics. According to Cox Automotive Senior Economist Jonathan Smoke, tariffs will increase prices for all cars by an average of $5,500 for imported vehicles, $4,900 for vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico, and $1,000 for vehicles assembled in the United States by September 2026.

Increased EV pricing could create a window of opportunity for Chinese EV makers, who aren’t currently allowed to sell in the United States but have made significant inroads in China, Brazil and Europe with high-tech models at lower prices than mainstream brands.

“It’s inevitable we will have one or more Chinese-based companies, but those vehicles will be produced or at least assembled in the United States,” Smoke said.

Within two years, buyers of used EVs will have more options, as the current spate of EV leases ends. Since 2023, when the Inflation Reduction Act allowed EV lessees to claim the $7,500 federal tax credit, 1.1 million EVs have been leased, according to Cox data. Through the first half of the year, the EV leasing rate was 59.3% — up from 22.5% in 2023 before the IRA change, Cox said.

All those used EVs will eventually enter the used market, expanding access to EVs at more affordable price points. By 2027, EVs will make up 16% of lease returns, while plug-in hybrids will account for 5% and traditional hybrids will be 6%, according to Cox.

What other incentives are available for EVs after the federal tax credit expires?

Several states offer their own incentives to help residents buy EVs, including California, which provides $2,500 off the price of a new EV at the point of sale, and Colorado, which offers a tax credit of $3,500. A full list of state EV incentives can be found at the U.S. Department of Energy Alternative Fuels Data Center.

How will the environment be affected by the end of the EV tax credit?

The exact effects are unknown. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, electric vehicles have no tailpipe emissions and have a smaller carbon footprint than gas-powered cars, even when taking their electricity usage into consideration. Transportation is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the EPA.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/EV_tax_credit,N,,2025-09-25 18:01:52.633151

Tesla Inc. urged U.S. environmental regulators to maintain ambitious tailpipe emissions standards that were put in place to push the industry to sell electric vehicles in larger numbers.

Regulations finalized under President Joe Biden that assumed more than 50% of the U.S. auto market would be composed of fully electric models by 2032 “are a lawful exercise of authority Congress provided to EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles,” Tesla said in a regulatory filing posted online by the Environmental Protection Agency on Sept. 24.

The so-called endangerment finding provided the legal basis for the federal government’s most ambitious efforts to slash planet-warming emissions, including those from automobiles.

It also provided a regulatory framework to support Tesla’s investments in product development and production, the automaker said in its comments.

Tesla said it “respectfully encourages EPA not to rescind the endangerment finding, as that finding is lawful, based on a robust factual and scientific record, and has been an established part of federal law for more than 15 years.”

The National Federalism Commission analysis confirmed that 34 or more active state applications existed in 1979 and continued for 25 years.
In addition, it discovered that at least 34 active state applications existed in 2016 and 2017 as well.
The National Federalism Commission has this model legislation.
W. Bruce Lee is executive director of the National Federalism Commission.","This past Constitution Day, a historic announcement was made regarding the failure of Congress to discharge its express, ministerial, and non-discretionary responsibilities under Article V of the Constitution. All of us participated in this historic event.

The National Federalism Commission — an official inter-state and nonpartisan governmental body — released a comprehensive report for the House Judiciary Committee that confirmed the Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation’s multi-year claim that Congress should have called a Convention for Proposing Amendments focused on fiscal responsibility 46 years ago. But Congress failed to act.

Article V of the Constitution states, “The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress…”

The Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation discovered over three years ago that there were enough active state applications pending in Congress in 1979 for a Convention of the States for proposing amendments to be called. Specifically, there were 39 active applications, of which 30 were for fiscal responsibility and nine were plenary or “any subject,” applications. Importantly, constitutional scholars across the political spectrum have said that plenary applications should be combined with like single subject applications in determining whether the 34-state application requirement has been met.

The number of active applications in 1979 clearly exceeded the 34-state requirement and should have resulted in an immediate call for a convention by the Congress. However, since the Congress had yet to establish a process for receiving, storing and counting applications, evidently no one realized that the trigger for calling a convention had been met.

In 2015, the Judiciary Committee began collecting and storing state applications. However, its records were incomplete. Therefore, in 2025 the Judiciary Committee entered into an agreement with the National Federalism Commission to bring its records up to date. The National Federalism Commission started with fiscal responsibility related applications given the magnitude of the issue and since it is the only subject where independent parties had asserted that the trigger to call a convention had already been met. The National Federalism Commission’s work is now continuing in connection with other subject applications.

The National Federalism Commission analysis confirmed that 34 or more active state applications existed in 1979 and continued for 25 years. In addition, it discovered that at least 34 active state applications existed in 2016 and 2017 as well.

Shockingly, since 1979, total federal debt has risen from less than $1 trillion to more than $37 trillion and rising rapidly. In addition, the dollar has lost almost 80 percent of its value since 1979. These terrible outcomes are a result of the failure of Congress to act in a timely manner.

The sad but simple truth is that Congress has been addicted to spending, deficits and debt for far too long. This has been and remains a bipartisan problem that must be corrected if we want our future generations to be better off than our past. Only a constitutional amendment can force Congress to quit placing unreasonable debt burdens on current and future generations of Americans.

Should Congress fail to act in a reasonably timely manner, states will be forced to take legal action to have their constitutional right upheld. Our nation’s founders recognized that the states needed to have the ability to propose amendments when the Congress fails to act.

Hand-wringers who worry about a “runaway” convention should rest easy. Since a majority of past and present state applications relate to the issue of fiscal responsibility, the convention will be focused solely on that topic. In addition, 16 states and growing have state delegate loyalty legislation that gives the state the right to recall any delegates that try to act beyond the topic outlined in the state’s application. The National Federalism Commission has this model legislation.

Finally, it takes 38 states to ratify the amendment. Given these safeguards, we should be far more concerned with a runaway federal government than with a runaway convention.

Congress should now call a convention — indeed, given the language of Article V, it should be automatic. In addition, Congress should consider requiring that any proposed amendment be ratified by state conventions of pledged delegates which is the closest thing to a referendum under our Constitution. This was the method that was used to ratify the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition.

Finally, the Congress should pass the resolution calling for an Article V Convention to ensure that this wrong is not repeated in the future. In addition, the Senate should recognize the committee’s process for recording applications for economy and efficiency purposes.

Gavin Newsom recently posted that electricity prices have risen 10% since January, squarely placing the blame on President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress. But for the millions of families and small businesses in my home state paying these higher energy prices, this is no laughing matter.

The data are in, and California now ranks 49th out of 50 in the nation for energy affordability. That means nearly every other U.S. state offers its residents lower-cost electricity. The only state with more expensive electricity is Hawaii, which as a chain of islands has unique geographical challenges to energy production that are simply not factors in the lower forty-eight.

California’s residential electricity price was a shocking 35.03 cents per kilowatt hour back in May of this year. Compare that to Idaho (11.88 cents), Louisiana (13.15 cents), or Ohio (17.11 cents). An average home will consume about 10,500 kilowatt hours of electricity per year, so that disparity adds up quickly. For middle-class families already grappling with higher housing, food, and fuel prices, the pain is real.

As a California native, it is tragic to see how Sacramento has so utterly mismanaged our state’s world-renowned natural resources. California is blessed with abundant sun, wind, water, and natural gas reserves in spades, yet our residents and businesses are paying almost triple what consumers in other states are charged.

This is no accident; it is a policy choice decades in the making.

He said typically EVs account for around nine or 10% of car sales, but in the last few months. ""It's jumped to 25-to-30% in the Midwest region, which is where we are.""

The jump is attributable to the elimination of the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as part of June's Republican tax bill. It will be gone for good on Sept. 30.

""If you're watching this and you want to buy an electric vehicle you better do it before September 30th because on October 1st it's going to be a lot more expensive,"" said Senator Bernie Moreno (R-OH), a former car dealer who campaigned on and pushed for the credits elimination in part because of what he said he was seeing at his former luxury car dealerships.

""At some of my former dealerships, if you went and got a Rolls-Royce, a Porsche or a Mercedes and leased an electric version of these cars, the government was giving you $7,500; think about how insane that is,"" he said. ""So that millionaire who is leasing that Rolls-Royce, $7,500 is not something that we should be giving them.""

Despite the uptick in EV sales, it's been at a steady pace, said Lou Vitantonio, president of the Greater Cleveland Auto Dealers Association, which represents 250 new vehicle dealerships in the 21-county region of Northeast Ohio.

""We're not seeing a massive rush because the inventories have kind of fallen off a little bit,"" he said.

The EV tax credit was established more than 15 years ago and helped drive Americans into the electric vehicle market, a trend that ends in just a few days.

But while the credit does expire on Tuesday, and you're local car dealer may not have the car you want in stock, there is still a way for you to get that car and the $7,500.

""Under the guidelines that have been put out by the IRS, you can still order a vehicle, put it under contract and then still get that incentive after it's delivered past the deadline,"" said Viantonio. But you must have the paperwork signed before Tuesday.

At Valley Motor City in Cuyahoga Falls, there are still some EVs in stock, and the dealership has seen that last-minute rush.

As for the future demand?

""With the tax credit going away, I fear that's going to change. I don't think many people will be as inclined to purchase them anymore,"" said Account Manager Mikayla Martin.

The expiration of the tax credit and concern over tariffs led to a spike in car sales in the early part of the year. Up 16% in Northeast Ohio in June, but that jump might come at the expense of future sales.

""I think this last quarter, October, November, December, we won't be at a pace we saw in the beginning of the year,"" said Vitantonio. ""I think it will still be positive, but it will be around that 4-to-5% increase over the previous year.""

Bottom line when it comes to EVs between now and next Tuesday?

""If you are interested, it's time to get moving,"" said Cascade's Pat Primm.

The energy storage can be standalone, or with a new or existing renewable resource. Ascend Analytics is administering the request for proposal (RFP) on behalf of Georgia Power.

Georgia Power said it prefers the procured resources to be online by no later than the end of 2031.

This builds upon Georgia Power’s current plans to add more than 1,500 MW of BESS in the coming years, according to Georgia Power. The Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) approved the RFP as a part of the company’s 2022 integrated resource plan (IRP).

IRPs are long-term planning reports that are considered and approved by state regulators in many states, with some notable exceptions, such as in Texas and its unique grid.

In July Georgia Power requested certification from the PSC for 9.9 GW of new generation resources, 3 GW of which were for energy storage.

Over the next five to six years, the utility projects approximately 8.2 GW of electrical load growth, up more than 2.2 GW overall when compared to projections in its 2023 IRP Update.

Also notable is that Georgia Power is looking at longer duration energy storage, with 3,000 MW per year of 4-hour energy storage is projected to be added starting in 2028, while 3,000 MW per year of 12-hour energy storage is planned from 2033​.

In its IRP, Georgia Power detailed adding storage to solar projects, saying that its adoption of solar+storage versus solar-only generation at sites is currently at 17%.

Georgia Power first examined energy storage in its 2019 IRP, with approval to build, own and operate 80 MW of BESS at the time. Georgia Power had 65,000 kW of battery capacity as of Dec. 31, 2024.

According to Georgia Power, 8% of its energy mix was renewables as of 2024, and more than half is gas/oil (40%) and coal (16%). Georgia Power reports only the null energy output from some renewable generating facilities. Ownership of the associated renewable energy credits (RECs) is specified in each respective power purchase agreement or program tariff. The party that owns the RECs retains the right to use and report them.

Georgia Power has about 2.8 million customers in all but four of Georgia’s 159 counties. The average price residential customers paid during 2024 was 15.48 cents per kWh, and the average annual use per residential customer was 11,871 kWh. The utility’s total gross investment in facilities at the end of 2024 was $59.3 billion.

Set to reach 91% by 2030, the future of the European EV market future is defined by a plateau.
Elsewhere in APAC, Indian oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have also invested heavily in EV charging infrastructure.
Reports for the 2023–24 period detailed 15,797 EV charging stations installed across the three.
European oil companies are reducing investment in EV charging infrastructure but retain that Western markets are central to their strategies around electrification preparedness.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are an established cornerstone of the energy transition, with their increasing global adoption chipping away at a significant share of oil demand.

Fuel demand from cars and vans accounted for more than 25% of the world’s oil use in 2023, according to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which also predicts that EVs will displace more than five million barrels of road fuel per day by 2030. This is good news for the climate and for international carbon emissions targets, but for oil and gas companies, there is a serious call for diversification.

Several major players are already working to stay ahead of the curve and remain relevant in a clean energy future. As the transport sector becomes a diminishing custom base, companies including bp, Indian Oil, PetroChina, Shell, Sinopec and TotalEnergies are among those investing in EV charging infrastructure to meet a new gap in the market.

Not all markets are equal, however, and investors are prioritising the regions supporting the most economic potential. The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is a particularly attractive investment opportunity, offering investors the benefits of growing populations, developing economies, and the need for affordable and reliable energy sources. Elsewhere, Europe is seeing a slowdown in investment as regulatory uncertainty and a recent period of slow sales have knocked investor confidence.

Oil demand will peak, forcing companies to diversify

Cross-sector, global analysis indicates that while demand for oil and gas will eventually begin to fall, it hasn’t reached its peak yet, and portfolio diversification is still in the early stages. According to the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario – which calculates the impact of already-enacted policies – oil and gas demand will peak in the next four years, before facing a steady decline. However, this decline could become more drastic if all currently announced government pledges are successfully enacted.

Ravindra Puranik, oil and gas analyst at GlobalData, explains that oil companies know they must adapt to electrification. “The oil and gas industry is undergoing notable transformation in response to the electrification of the transport sector… One of the most notable strategies is the investment in EV charging stations. This aligns well with existing assets, namely fuel stations, allowing companies to leverage their established infrastructure to support the transition to electric mobility,” he explains.

GlobalData is the parent company of Offshore Technology.

A spokesperson from Shell tells Offshore Technology: “As the EV charging industry is still nascent, we are continuously learning and adapting our EV growth strategy to market conditions. For example, we are focusing on our own retail sites in Europe where we can also leverage our convenience retail strengths.”

EV charging infrastructure appears a logical electrification strategy for oil companies, not only because of leverageable infrastructure but because the market is ripe too. GlobalData forecasts that EVs will account for nearly 50% of all global light vehicle sales by 2035 and that hybrid and electric vehicle sales will experience a compound annual growth rate of 6.7% between 2025 and 2037. With EVs comes a need for EV charging infrastructure and the market was already estimated to be worth $32.26bn in 2024, with this figure projected to grow to $125.39bn by 2030.

Noting that EV demand is already shaping the strategies of oil producers, Puranik says: “Several oil marketing companies have ventured into this market through acquisitions and collaborations with EV mobility providers. Oil majors Shell and TotalEnergies presently have the most diverse networks with more than 70,000 charge points installed around the world.”

The diverging global picture: Why APAC is more appealing than the West

Speaking to Offshore Technology, Frankie Mayo, senior UK analyst at global energy think tank Ember, explains that the needs of each region are different.

“The electrification of the global economy is just around the corner but requires abundant clean power and electricity networks ready for the challenge,” he says. “The transition is place-specific; for example, it will look different in developing countries, which can avoid decades of fossil fuel infrastructure and instead jump ahead to electrified alternatives.”

GlobalData figures identify diverging regional trends in EV sales figures, forecasting that the disparity will increase between APAC and the West. EVs currently make up 42% of auto sales in APAC, but this figure will reach 77% by 2037, with continued growth expected. Meanwhile, in Europe, EVs currently make up around 58% of auto sales, and this will jump to 99% by 2037. Set to reach 91% by 2030, the future of the European EV market future is defined by a plateau.

Of the expected development of the APAC market, GlobalData energy transition analyst Clarice Brambilla explains: “I expect to see continued growth in EV production volume, especially in China, India, South East Asia and possibly Oceania. I also expect to see increasing affordability, including smaller, lower-cost EV models targeting mass market consumers, rather than just premium segments.”

She says of the Western market: “There is evidence of a modest rollback or at least slowing of EV investment in parts of the Western market such as Europe and the US, although it is less a reversal than a cooling from peak expectations. In Europe in particular, battery giga-factory plans have been delayed or scaled back, in part because of high costs, competition (often from lower-cost Asian producers), supply chain constraints and weaker-than-expected consumer uptake in some segments. However, battery-electric vehicle sales are still projected to grow strongly across the EU, driven by ambitious targets and strong policy support.

“On the other hand, in the US, regulatory uncertainty under the Trump administration and changing incentive regimes are dampening investment momentum.”

While the US looks a less reliable investment destination for diversifying oil companies, the APAC market needs EV charging infrastructure and, as a region, offers investors a series of advantages including emerging economies and governments looking to secure affordable and reliable energy sources for growing populations.

Significantly, populations in the APAC region are experiencing some of the most rapidly increasing disposable incomes in the world, with cities in India and South East Asia leading growth in household incomes. Brian Peers, global head of sustainable transport and fuels at HSBC, previously commented on the opportunity this presents, noting that “as incomes rise across Asia-Pacific over the coming decades, car ownership is set to increase, with Asia forecasted to account for over 60% of the 115 million EVs sold worldwide over the next five years”.

“The increased sale and production of EVs may present many opportunities across the value chain, including battery manufacturing, the roll-out of charging infrastructure and financing solutions for consumers.”

Oil companies’ EV infrastructure investments are not linear

APAC-based oil companies are investing in EV infrastructure, with Chinese companies leading the charge. Beijing-based Sinopec reported it had built 3,874 charging stations in 2023 and Chinese media outlet CNR reported that the country had 16.7 million EV charging units at the end of July.

Figures from December 2024 showed that Sinopec, Indian Oil and Shell owned the largest number of EV charging stations globally, with 9,051, 7,863 and 3,063 each, respectively, (based on the number of retail forecourts, rather than charge points). Elsewhere in APAC, Indian oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have also invested heavily in EV charging infrastructure. Reports for the 2023–24 period detailed 15,797 EV charging stations installed across the three.

Oil companies undoubtedly have a strong APAC presence, but the story is not so linear among European players.

European oil companies are reducing investment in EV charging infrastructure but retain that Western markets are central to their strategies around electrification preparedness. For example, London-based Shell transferred its Shell Recharge Solutions’ home and workplace chargers to 50five in December 2024 and discontinued its Shell Sky software a month later. The company also lowered its emissions reduction target for 2030 from 20% to 15–20% and dropped its 2035 emissions goal.

Yet a spokesperson explains: “The majority of Shell’s investment in EV charging is currently prioritised towards seven leading markets for EV adoption – China, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and the US. This is because these seven markets represent the most material opportunities from the context of advanced pace of electrification, existing competitive advantages and mobility value pool.”

Ultimately, Brambilla concludes that, while the picture is complex, EV investment is leaning in favour of APAC. “APAC continues to show strong momentum,” she says. “In many APAC markets subsidies, regulatory backing, and cost advantages make investment more attractive, so there remains a relative shift in attention toward the region.”

Elsewhere, bp has increased its oil and gas investment, while reducing its annual investment in its EV charging arm BP Pulse, cutting 10% of jobs and withdrawing from eight of the 12 countries it was operating in. What survives still retains a Western focus and bp says: “Our aim is to provide high-powered on-the-go charging in markets with the strongest growth in EVs: China, the UK, Germany and the US.”",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/09/GettyImages-1334493178.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 20:01:49.726334

Dive Brief:

Investments in residential heat pumps, batteries and solar arrays could meet 100% of projected electricity demand growth from AI data centers through 2029, according to a report from the pro-electrification nonprofit Rewiring America.

The large tech and infrastructure companies behind the U.S. artificial intelligence boom could unlock more than 93 gigawatts of grid capacity at costs comparable to building a new fleet of gas power plants by paying 50% of the cost of heat pump upgrades and 30% of the cost of onsite solar and storage, Rewiring America said Sept. 18.

“Hyperscalers are already thinking creatively about how to meet their growing power needs, and this report presents a solution that brings households into the conversation,” Rewiring America CEO Ari Matusiak said in an email to ESG Dive sister publication Utility Dive.

Dive Insight:

U.S. utilities requested about $29 billion in rate increases in the first half of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for pro-consumer regulatory reform.

The sharp rise in rate hike requests and in already-approved rate increases show that “the status quo isn’t working for households,” Matusiak said. “There’s a way to rebalance the equation and ensure there’s something in it for Americans.”

Matusiak’s group said rising electricity prices compound the consumer burden of broad-based inflation and the pending expiration of federal tax credits for energy-efficient appliances and distributed energy resources, which experts say could push utility rates higher still.

Right now, hyperscalers and the utilities that support them are looking to “centralized, utility-scale solutions, like building fossil fuel or nuclear power plants” to meet near-term load growth projections, Rewiring America said. Instead, it said, targeted residential energy investments could effectively offset the loss of federal energy tax credits, free more than 100 GW of grid capacity over five years and lay the foundation for a more efficient, resilient power system over the longer term.

Those investments could also help hyperscalers and utilities sidestep five-to-six-year lead times and escalating construction costs for combined-cycle gas turbines while reducing exposure to volatile natural gas prices, Matusiak said.

Reported capital costs of combined-cycle power plants to be deployed around 2030 now exceed $2,000 per kilowatt up nearly 50% from plants with expected 2026 deployments, the clean energy group GridLab said in a report this month.

Hyperscalers’ heat pump investments should focus on households using inefficient electric space heating, water heating and air conditioning, Rewiring America said in last week’s report.

For example, the report said fully transitioning Georgia homes from electric resistance heat to heat pumps could free up about 1.5 GW of capacity, or 22% of the state’s projected data center load growth through 2029. Swapping out traditional air conditioners for heat pumps in Texas could unlock 3.9 GW of capacity, or 23% of expected data center load over the next five years.

Heat pumps are two-way climate control devices that can heat or cool homes, depending on the season. By covering 50% of the upgrade cost, the report said hyperscalers could knock the upfront expense down to about $9,000 for a typical home — less than the combined cost of a new furnace and air conditioner.

To unlock 109 GW of additional grid capacity through distributed solar and storage, Rewiring America said hyperscalers would only need to cover 30% of installation costs — the same subsidy provided by the expiring federal home energy tax credit — to reach cost parity with new gas generation.

But that would require every “single-family household in the U.S. [to install] a home battery, and those with a suitable roof [to install] a 5-kW solar system,” the report said. Rewiring America also based its gas-parity projection on a reduction of at least 40% in installed solar and storage costs, driven by economies of scale, streamlined permitting and lower customer acquisition costs.

Though ambitious, the Department of Energy’s January report on virtual power plants and more recent research by the Smart Electric Power Alliance and Sparkfund suggest Rewiring America’s 109-GW target is plausible.

DOE estimated U.S. VPPs — which aggregate customer-sited batteries, thermostats and other latent energy sources — could reach 80 GW to 160 GW by 2030, offsetting 10% to 20% of peak grid demand. SEPA and Sparkfund said distributed capacity procurement, an emerging utility-led approach to VPP deployment, could supply a significant amount of the necessary capacity.

Distributed capacity procurement is just one of several strategies hyperscalers and utilities could pursue to offset expected AI load growth, Matusiak said.

Other promising strategies include clean transition tariffs supporting distributed capacity rather than new generation and scaled-up, performance-based contracts with third-party VPP aggregators, he said.

1. Who Controls the Federal Purse?

Topline: President Donald Trump recently attempted to cancel $4.9 billion in spending on foreign aid, but not everyone believes the action was legal, writes AEI’s Kevin R. Kosar. The administration’s proposal would cancel $3.2 billion in international development program spending, $900 million in contributions to the United Nations, $326 million in international peacekeeping funds, and hundreds of millions more in grants to foreign nations.

Rescissions Rules: Legislation from 1974 allows the executive to ask Congress not to spend previously appropriated funds. The president must notify Congress, setting the Senate and House up for a 45-day countdown to pass a bill to approve the request. Trump gamed this process by submitting a request less than 45 days before the appropriation would expire—flipping control from the legislature to the executive.

Shutdown Risk: If Congress fails to pass the 12 annual appropriations bills by October 1, the government will shut down. The Senate requires 60 votes to pass these funding bills, and Republicans only hold 53. Kosar warns that Democrats’ frustration with Trump’s use of pocket rescissions may prevent them from joining their colleagues across the aisle to fund the government.

“The price for Democrats to vote for any spending bills or a continuing resolution might be iron-clad provisions forbidding the rescission of the $4.9 billion in foreign aid funds and GOP agreement not to pursue additional rescissions.”—Kevin R. Kosar

2. Defense Budget Diversions

Topline: The Trump administration touts a $1 trillion budget for the Department of Defense in 2026, but AEI’s Elaine McCusker explains that only about 42 percent of this top-line number goes toward building and modernizing the American military.

Additional Spending: $17 billion of the 2026 budget request funds programs and activities that deviate from the Pentagon’s core function. In many cases, these programs are the responsibility of other federal agencies, such as medical research and education programs. McCusker highlights that these programs should be administered by other agencies with the authority and responsibility to execute them rather than being grouped in with defense spending.

Military Readiness: With the United States facing an array of global threats more potent than at any time since 1945, McCusker concludes that more of the Pentagon’s budget should be focused on core military missions. Nondefense spending in the defense budget misleads Americans as to how much is being spent on the military, she warns, and the diversion of resources has real-world consequences that range from deadly accidents to battlefield shortcomings.

“These nondefense programs and activities, combined with must-pay bills, create the illusion of a defense budget that is larger and more flexible than it is and contribute to the lack of transparency and accountability to the taxpayer.”—Elaine McCusker

3. Solutions for SNAP

Topline: In 2022, 5.6 million Americans received SNAP benefits through broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE), AEI’s Angela Rachidi and Erik Randolph find. BBCE allows states to expand SNAP to those making more than 130 percent of the federal poverty level, the statutory income limit set by Congress for eligibility. The number of Americans receiving SNAP benefits through BBCE was 1.2 percent in 2008, but had risen to 13.6 percent by 2022.

BBCE Explained: Congress originally established BBCE as a way to lower administrative burden and increase benefit program efficiency. Forty-one states and the District of Columbia have used it in recent decades to expand SNAP eligibility, some adopting the maximum 200 percent of the federal poverty level.

Advantages of Eliminating BBCE: Rachidi and Randolph contend that eliminating BBCE has several benefits, including increasing SNAP’s integrity, preventing states from inflating caseloads to access federally funded benefits, and reducing government costs. However, eliminating BBCE without other changes risks worsening the benefits cliff and discouraging SNAP recipients from working more hours or for higher pay. To mitigate this, the authors propose ending BBCE while realigning the program’s structure to uniformly reduce benefit cliffs.

“The solution is to eliminate BBCE while adjusting SNAP benefits to align the maximum benefit level, tapering point, benefit reduction rate, and income exit point so the SNAP benefit tapers gradually to zero instead of dropping off a cliff. Getting this right will eliminate the need for BBCE while addressing benefit cliffs and the associated work disincentives.”—Angela Rachidi and Erik Randolph

“Becoming the first new container terminal in the U.S. to register with Envision sends a powerful message about Port NOLA’s values,” said Port NOLA Director of Sustainable Development, Emily Federer. “We are expanding our capacity to serve global trade and doing so in a way that meets our industry’s needs while safeguarding the needs of future generations, our environment, strengthening community trust, setting a precedent for sustainable infrastructure development in the maritime sector.”

The Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure welcomed Port NOLA’s commitment to sustainability. “Port NOLA’s leadership in registering the Louisiana International Terminal with Envision demonstrates its dedication to embedding sustainability at the heart of one of the nation’s most important infrastructure projects,” said ISI President and CEO, Anthony Kane. “This project will serve as an example to ports and terminal operators everywhere of how to use Envision as a pathway toward measurable, responsible, and lasting impact.”

Economic Imperative

The Louisiana International Terminal is one of the most significant infrastructure investments in the Gulf region and for the economy of the United States and will serve as the premier gateway for international trade in the Gulf.

A comprehensive study conducted by economist Dek Terrell with Lewis Terrell and Associates has revealed that the LIT facility will generate 18,500 new direct and indirect well-paying jobs in Louisiana and produce more than $1 billion dollars in new state and local tax revenue by 2050. That study is posted on the Louisiana International Terminal website here.

Registering with Envision ensures that its design and construction will be guided by the highest standards of sustainability, strengthening Port NOLA’s role as a critical connection between global markets and America’s heartland.

Associated Press/Report for America

HOLLY RIDGE, La. (AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users.

Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2025/09/dump-truck-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 16:02:17.414027

Each of these is a threat to future climate action and erodes the new climate common sense.","Climate action in the US has lately suffered a series of disorientating reversals and is under vertiginous assault. Across the 2010s and into the 2020s, climate advocates successfully connected beliefs about the future with coalition building that made climate action an unavoidable priority for the US government. A new common sense had been built around a single premise: that the future is carbon constrained. This premise cohered a vast but fragile ecosystem of sometimes competing interests around the imperative of responding with economy-wide decarbonization.

But since 2023, skepticism has grown about the timeline on which carbon constraints will bind, and doubt has seeped in regarding the ability of climate action to deliver for its constituencies. In all its forms, the Trump assault on climate policy aims to convince Americans that climate action will make them worse off, and, in doing so, to blow up the painstakingly assembled coalitions that made US climate action possible. The undermining of both American confidence in climate action and its coalitional foundations risks locking in self-propelling negative feedback loops.

The following poses the challenges we face starkly, in the hope of sparking grounded debates about the path forward. Finding that path requires clear strategies, which in turn depend on an accurate analysis of the terrain on which advocates now have to fight.

Creating the new climate common sense

Since the 2015 Paris Agreement and the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that predicted disastrous consequences if global warming reached above 1.5 degrees Celcius, advocates of climate action shaped an understanding of the future that would rearrange the self-interest of actors in the present. Among the parameters of that imagined future: Global warming is real, and anthropogenic; as emissions accumulate and temperatures rise, ecological and economic systems will be destabilized, presaging a future that is considerably worse for human civilization; the prospect of that future, and the increasing signs of it in the present, will ultimately force governments to act to restrict carbon emissions, one way or another. In other words, the future is carbon constrained. We can call this the New Climate Common Sense (NCCS).

The strategy and solution that flows from the NCCS is rapid decarbonization. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy is in nearly everyone’s interest because the costs of mitigation and adaptation grow with delay, asset stranding threatens both public and private balance sheets, first-actors in a post-carbon system will have an advantage in a carbon constrained world, and the life prospects of ordinary people would be dramatically improved by a more stable climate system. Whereas prior consensus in the climate community understood the problem primarily as one of collective action, the new common sense advanced a theory of competition among policy makers, companies, and countries to be first to solve for the post-carbon future.

The establishment of this view in elite power centers spread rapidly in the middle of the last decade. At the highest levels of coordination—corporate boards, multilateral organizations, national and subnational governments—the new common sense turned into novel forms of commitment, and in some cases action. Net zero commitments proliferated in the corporate and financial sector, following the Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. Ideas for shifting financial power toward low-carbon activity emerged, like ESG and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Governments undertook policies to propel the energy transition, including subsidies for renewables, carbon markets, and so on. These policies functioned as proof that the future was carbon constrained, as an accelerant on further corporate and government action, and as a wager that leadership would produce followers.

Translating NCCS into concrete climate action required prevailing in a political struggle with all of the interests opposed to decarbonization—whose nucleus is powerful business models organized around carbon intensive energy and production. A new flourishing of strategies emerged to chart a path forward, predicated on the goal of building a coalition powerful enough to overcome the political power of this carbon bloc. Among a range of actors, the emergent strategy was that of “co-benefits”—the production of alignment among many constituencies who could pursue multiple goals through decarbonization. Social movements, corporate leaders, and policy makers acting in the national interest could all find their alignment.

Youth social movements, most prominently Fridays For Future and the Sunrise Movement, garnered enormous media attention by focusing squarely on the question of their own futures. New formations like the BlueGreen Alliance (where I work) pursued policies and organizing that could win union members to the cause of climate change, by protecting workers affected by decarbonizing industry—the just transition—and to attach labor standards to public investment in the new green industries. Green New Deal activism oriented discursive and movement demands toward a vision of social renewal, in which the generational fights against income inequality and racial stratification could merge with the existential battle against climate collapse.

Corporate interest was forged by policy makers and corporate activism. Those with some carbon assets, which could plausibly become green, like electric utilities and the automakers, could be offered “decarbonization bargains” in the form of subsidies, guaranteed markets, and so on. Acting in line with the new common sense, which described an inevitable future of technological development, growing consumer demand, and government regulation, they could take the deal. And the multinational giants of the oil and gas industry began—however dubiously—placing bets on shifting off of fossil fuels and onto transition technologies like carbon capture, hydrogen, and so on. Meanwhile, the falling costs of renewables—the levelized cost of solar fell by half from 2010–2015, and again by half from 2015–2020—encouraged deployment and bolstered the common sense argument that the transition was less about trade-offs than who would reap the benefits of the inevitable era of abundant and affordable energy. Climate action was increasingly seen to mean an impending investment boom.

Meanwhile, Democratic Party foreign policy elites—absorbing the electoral rejection of the liberal establishment with Trump’s victory in 2016—increasingly alighted upon climate as a key part of a strategy of liberal renewal. The world’s technological leader, largest historical emitter, and most powerful country could spur other countries to action and supply the technology and financing needed to make the transition. Arriving at the view that climate change represented the world’s biggest challenge, but also an opportunity for the US to demonstrate constructive leadership on the global stage, and to position the US economy at the forefront of a coming technological revolution, members of this community increasingly linked public investment to fight climate action with an attack on domestic economic inequality designed to undo the economic and political damage of deindustrialization. Notably, in their February 2020 programmatic essay on this subject, Jake Sullivan and Jennifer Harris argued that a transformation in domestic economic policymaking was central to US foreign policy success—with climate action as a key factor linking the two.

The coalitional theory was one of positive feedback loops. By lowering the cost of transitioning from carbon to noncarbon business and economic models, by delivering social benefits that make climate action electorally popular, and by persuading actors that the future will in fact be carbon constrained, all would be further incentivized to get ahead of it. Each step taken in response solidified the belief that the future is low-carbon, and increased the perceived costs of inaction. This theory of change contributed to the unprecedented centrality of climate to the 2020 election. By the start of primary season in 2019, this common sense was hegemonic within the Democratic Party, such that one of the major factors the presidential candidates debated was just how aggressive they would be in combating climate change.

Common sense and consensus

The new common sense asserted the decarbonization imperative, and advanced a theory of transformation that involved co-benefits. But on a more fundamental level, the consent and action of power brokers was based on the recognition of three macro trends: the rise of China as an economic and technological power, the economic and political disturbances in advanced economies since the Great Financial Crisis, and the unavoidability of climate change itself. All of these developments—China, the crises of democratic capitalism, and climate—interacted with and shaped each other. For example, the “China shock” was blamed for deindustrialization and the rise of populism among blue collar workers. And climate action was framed either as a space in which the US and China could cooperate, or, increasingly, the need to compete with China became a reason to prioritize climate policy.

These trends had set the foundations for breaking policy orthodoxy among leading Democrats. The idea that fiscal rectitude had harmed their political prospects—in particular, that the limited fiscal response to 2008 had contributed to Trump’s election—was widespread. Helped along by (of all people) Larry Summers’s resurrection of the liberal Keynesian idea of “secular stagnation” in 2013, and the absence of any inflation in response to the loose fiscal policy of Trump’s first term, Democrats began to wonder if they had overlearned the lessons of the 1970s. The radicalization of the Republican Party—and the rise of Bernie Sanders and a “populist” wing among the Democrats—suggested that tepid bipartisanship and the median voter theorem were no longer politically winning. And China’s extraordinary economic development ignited a competitive panic, and an interest in industrial policy—which, in light of the earlier failure of cap-and-trade, came to be seen as a central vector for climate action.

The Covid-19 crisis generated a new sense of urgency and possibility. Supply chain snarls and the sudden visibility of global production networks affirmed arguments about industrial policy and domestic economic resilience. The reaction to the Covid-19 economic depression made calls for enormous fiscal stimulus commonplace—and enlivened the political possibility of public spending on all manner of social needs. Then, on January 6, 2021, the Capitol riot managed to temporarily convince national Democrats that they could and should act on a partisan basis to address the present crises—Covid, climate, inequality, and racial justice, per Biden’s inaugural.

By the beginning days of the Biden Administration, Democratic Party leaders were persuaded that something like “green industrial policy”—with pro-labor and environmental justice provisions, alongside a set of long-deferred welfare state expansions—would be the skeleton key to addressing a set of crises that went far beyond climate change. Reflecting the desires of the coalition’s constituent parts, it was thought that “big green fiscal” could reinvigorate the American economy, reduce inequality, advance racial equity, and buttress American democracy.

The trajectory from the American Jobs Plan to Build Back Better to the IRA is, by now, well-known. But it bears repeating that the sheer magnitude and number of crises that Democrats believed climate action could address—carried by the dramatic alignment around the new climate common sense—led them to prioritize climate over practically every other priority when their initial ambitions were curtailed by Manchin and Sinema in late 2021.

Governing with the common sense

The policy design of the IRA reflected the theory of the new climate common sense. Interventions were developed to align with Paris goals—most significantly the technology neutral clean electricity tax credits, which were set to last until emissions fell 75 percent from 2022 levels. The federal government was assigned a major role in guiding and financing investments in infrastructure and technologies—through uncapped investment and production tax credits, a wide assortment of grant programs, and the massive expansion of the loan authority given to the Department of Energy—with the aim of steering the transformation of the entire US energy system. Prevailing wage and apprenticeship bonuses were attached to IRA tax credits, for the first time embedding labor standards in the tax code and connecting them to low-carbon investment. Decarbonization bargains were offered to autos and the power sector, but also industry and agriculture—heading off some amount of opposition from those sectors. Domestic manufacturing was promoted, as was the notion of long-term business certainty provided by the assurance that long-term investments were being made to tackle the climate problem.

And these policies were aimed to lock in to a political economy hostile to climate action. The heartlands of the carbon coalition received the majority of new investment flows, on the conviction that future Republican congresses and administrations would be unlikely to reverse policies that were directly supporting investment and jobs in their districts. The initial impacts were considerable: capital did appear to be “crowding in” to clean energy sectors, and subsidy uptake exceeded Congressional Budget Office estimates, suggesting that, despite Manchin’s efforts, “big green fiscal” was indeed getting into gear. Together with state and federal regulatory actions that signalled a further push towards decarbonization on the heels of IRA subsidies, NCCS was being affirmed and strengthened, and positive feedback loops looked poised to kick in.

The Green New Scam

The political right and the hard-core of the carbon bloc took aim at the new common sense. Powerful and purely ideological campaigns proliferated. The push was especially strong in Republican-controlled states, which saw preemption of local climate laws and boycotts of private sector actors, representing the specter of “woke capital,” who they claimed were discriminating against their states, and grassroots misinformation campaigns to discredit the entire agenda. Finding their footing on culture war terrain, the right increasingly framed climate action as an exercise in coercive social engineering by “radical left lunatics” who hate America.

Among Democrats, developments beginning already in 2022 raised questions about whether decarbonization was quite the economic, political, and geopolitical slam dunk it appeared to be in 2021. Awkwardness first emerged in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when lowering energy prices became a domestic political imperative and US LNG looked to many like a source of both power and plenty on the world stage. Full employment, forty-year-high inflation, and the end of the Fed’s Zero Interest Rate Policy cut against some of the economic and political-economic justifications for big green fiscal, especially in the rank ordering of job creation vs. affordability among top concerns in the electorate, while also making the economics of many decarbonization investments more difficult. The eruption onto the scene of generative AI in late 2023 exploded everyone’s sense of what it would take to decarbonize the power grid. In conjunction with heightened anxieties about competition with China, AI increasingly presented a cause for “realism” with respect to the pace of decarbonization. BYD’s success underscored a growing gap with China in clean tech and raised fears of a “second China shock,” this time directly associated with decarbonization.

All the while, doubts grew as to whether the promised co-benefits of climate action were materializing. The administration consistently spoke of “good, union jobs,” but relatively few manufacturing jobs in particular were on course to be union. Commentators and advocates wondered whether procedural issues and efforts to tie direct local benefits to projects were slowing the pace of investment, and therefore slowing the timeline along which a broader set of people would experience the co-benefits (“everything bagel”) of climate action. Had Harris defeated Trump, these questions would have formed the terrain of climate politics during her administration. With Trump’s victory, they became the fissures that the new administration would exploit in its attempt to unravel what climate advocates, the Biden administration, and congressional Democrats had accomplished.

Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign made the “Green New Scam” a central theme. When Trump and the GOP won the White House and the Congress, it was clear there would be fights and reversals. But there were countervailing factors locked in by the IRA: hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and hundreds of thousands of jobs, overwhelmingly located in Republican districts and downstream of IRA tax credits. The AI boom was exploding electricity demand—cutting off clean energy tax credits would raise the price of energy precisely at the time when powerful firms and regular people wanted it abundant and cheap. And the bipartisan commitment to competition with China would demand government support of potential competitor firms in the US.

None of this has so far stopped the Trump administration from unilaterally cancelling hundreds of grant contracts tied to IRA programs, in line with the President’s early executive orders targeting “DEI.” The IRA tax credits—by far the biggest source of big green fiscal firepower—were caught up in the fight over renewing Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and the rest of the President’s domestic legislative agenda that played out over the first half of this year. Upwards of two dozen Republican members of Congress publicly articulated their desire to keep most or all of the tax credits in place. Their opposition to cutting the credits was backed by major business lobbies, unions, local elected officials, and more. But the combination of hard-line fiscal hawkery from the likes of the House Freedom Caucus, Trump’s own personal animus, the inclusion of many other things those same Republicans liked (not least, even bigger tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans than the 2017 bill contained), and Trump’s iron hold over the entire GOP meant that all of those Republicans who would have liked to keep the IRA tax credits in place simply caved and voted for a bill that largely gutted them, even with the knowledge that the loss of the credits would inflict real economic pain on workers and businesses in their districts.

The decimation of the common sense

Starting in the closing weeks of the OBBB Act fight, when hardliners like Chip Roy teamed up with charlatans like Alex Epstein to mount an all-out attack on renewables, the erstwhile “all of the above” GOP energy consensus has been replaced with an all-out assault on everything related to climate, including a policy of active discrimination against solar and wind energy in particular. Backed by DOE Secretary Chris Wright, the Trump administration’s spurious yet official position is now that solar and wind power actively harm the power grid by requiring costly investment in transmission and backup power. Further, deploying clean energy is now argued to play to China’s sectoral dominance, thereby weakening the US position. In a move resembling a black mirror version of anti-pipeline activism, the Trump administration has revoked permits from offshore wind projects that are 80 percent complete.

Few meaningful counterpressures presently exist. The broad coalition of civil society, important sectors of capital, and the Democratic Party that came together to enact a large-scale program of public support for decarbonization has been, to date, unable to mount an effective response to this assault. Part of that failure to mobilize reflects the acute fear that Trump has instilled in all sorts of powerful actors, perhaps especially—and, most shockingly, seeing as this is still the United States of America we’re talking about—the leaders of major US and multinational corporations. Part of it reflects a shift in priorities among some actors that were formerly stalwarts of the coalition. Big tech, to take an important example, would still surely prefer federal support for cheaper clean energy. But Silicon Valley firms’ Net Zero commitments were already creating challenges for them as the AI boom sent their electricity demand into the stratosphere. As these firms face intensifying competition with Chinese companies, they are anxious to remain in the White House’s favor, and see no alternative to increasing their consumption of carbon-based electricity as their total electricity demand rises by a staggering 25 percent every single year. The NCCS is inevitably weakened when even those sections of capital seemingly most amenable to a post-carbon economy demonstrate through their investment and procurement decisions that the pace of decarbonization is unlikely to match their former goals.

At a deeper level, however, the actions taken by Trump and the GOP seem precisely calibrated to obliterate the new climate common sense itself. The US government now states confidently and proudly that the US will not decarbonize. US companies, states and localities, and foreign governments alike face open and economically injurious discrimination if their attitude towards carbon diverges from the White House’s view. How could this fail to convince many actors in the US and beyond that, at the very least, the pace of US decarbonization is going to be much, much slower than many had believed just a few short years ago? Confronted with those transformed views about how soon carbon is likely to be constrained, it is only to be expected that many actors will hedge. In those hedges lie a severe weakening of the climate coalition. Of course, the weaker the coalition, the more the NCCS will erode, as the negative feedback loops kick in.

Climate action whipsaw

In the present situation, we will see slower rates of decarbonization across sectors than we would have in a world where the 2024 policy status quo remained in place. We are already seeing projects cancelled—like Australian company Fortescue’s battery and hydrogen factory that, poignantly, was to be housed in the hulking Detroit ruin of the Fisher Body plant—and there are surely more to come. There will be fewer clean energy jobs, and, most likely, higher electricity prices.

The rollback of IRA tax credits means that everyone has to factor in the likelihood of continued whipsaw, undermining the feedback loops that solidified the new consensus. Shrunken domestic markets for low-carbon technology will make it harder for companies to lead in key sectors. And companies that were pursuing hedged decarbonization bargains will hedge further, especially amid a policy environment of hyperactive discrimination against clean energy. Further, firms in decarbonizable sectors may decide to make an outright bet on a carbon unconstrained future—particularly those not seeking sales outside the US market.

And in the states? The 2010s saw state-level climate action contribute to positive policy feedback loops. But the mid-2020s pullback of federal support for decarbonization will exacerbate existing pressures to retrench on climate goals. Withdrawn tax credits will lead utilities to push for less ambitious integrated resource plans, which will add yet more pressure on states to relax mandates. Catastrophic cuts to Medicaid and SNAP in the OBBB are likely to take precedence over filling in gaps from federal clean energy finance for Democratic state legislators. Just as ambitious state policy helped build the new climate common sense, a retreat, if it happens, will weaken it.

Further negative spirals may wait in the wings. For example, climate policy makers have increasingly looked to use carbon intensity in trade as a way to provide incentives for decarbonization. Europe’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)—which is set to impose a fee on the carbon intensity of imports to match the costs European producers must pay for emissions certificates under their Emissions Trading System—is frequently cited as a reason why it is in the interest of US firms to decarbonize. In the recent US-EU trade “negotiations,” the US side pushed for exemptions from the CBAM for US producers, and appears to have won at least a rhetorical concession. Rather than utilizing trade as a vector for advancing decarbonization, the Trump administration is weaponizing trade against decarbonization. Already, the fortunes of US fossil fuel producers are being enlarged by Trump forcing energy purchases in trade agreements with Japan and the EU.

The IRA was enacted just past the peak of Democrats’ break from fiscal policy orthodoxy. The idea of using the fiscal firepower of the federal government for aggressive climate action was a point of remarkable consensus. Even prior to the enactment of OBBB, higher interest rates were making the fiscal cost of 6 percent of GDP annual budget deficits impossible to ignore. OBBB is almost certain to worsen that fiscal picture, ensuring higher interest rates into the future, and enormous pressure for fiscal consolidation on any future Democratic administration and Congress. Deploying fiscal firepower for decarbonization is likely to be a tougher sell in 2029 than it was in 2021. Those who need to place bets now on the future direction of policy will factor that in.

Even before the OBBB’s passage, parts of the Democratic foreign policy establishment called into question whether US power was actually served by decarbonization. Varun Sivaram, who worked under climate envoy John Kerry and was most recently in government affairs at Danish offshore wind giant Ørsted, authored a striking piece in Foreign Affairs called “Climate Realism,” and was quoted in the NY Times saying “The energy transition is actually very bad for the United States, because we cede geopolitical and economic ground to a rival in China.” The loss of the foreign policy establishment as part of the climate advocacy coalition may mean a weaker commitment to decarbonization in a future Democratic governing moment, and could further erode NCCS.

All of this is taking place as the Trump administration incinerates the credibility of the United States as a counterparty with which firms, countries, or even the US Congress can strike reliable agreements. The damage from the Trump administration’s governing-by-extortion is likely to be lasting, because, having elected Trump not once but twice, there are no actors in America who can credibly promise any counterparties that a future administration won’t do exactly the same thing all over again.

Decarbonizable sectors want the government to pay for as much of their decarbonization as possible. But it’s never cost-free for the firms. Firms want to partner with the US government because the terms are attractive and because of the NCCS—they see it as in their long-term, enlightened self-interest to decarbonize. But what happens when the US government starts not just whipsawing on policy but outright canceling cost-share agreements? Would these companies want to partner with the US government in the future? What level of subsidy and extent of guarantee would they demand for their participation, since, again, America as a whole cannot promise that we won’t elect Trump-like presidents in the future? Would our political system support the terms they might demand? Even if somehow NCCS wasn’t being eroded in all these other ways, Trump’s evisceration of US credibility vis-à-vis our own capitalists will increase the price of future decarbonization bargains, already more expensive due to fiscal constraints, smaller markets, and lost time. More expensive decarbonization bargains mean fewer decarbonization bargains, achieving less decarbonization. This is yet an additional way that NCCS erodes.

Broken terrain

The three years since 2022 have served to weaken beliefs about how carbon constrained the future will be, and thus how quickly decarbonization will proceed. For some firms and policy makers, the risk of being left behind in a carbon constrained world is now weighed against the risks of losing out in a world that decarbonizes much more slowly. The slower they move, the more they retain carbon assets, the less they stand to gain from further decarbonization policy, and the less supportive of climate action they become. These developments will constitute significant headwinds to a renewal of ambitious climate policy even if the present anti-climate common sense breaks in a few years. All of us who wish to see such a renewal need to devise strategies that are resilient to these headwinds.

There are, at the same time, some factors that may constitute tailwinds for a renewal of climate action. A brief stock-stake of these mitigating factors might suggest some paths forward.

First is cost: Clean energy is cheap. Gas is getting more expensive, especially as the US redoubles its commitment to liquified natural gas and turbine makers are reluctant to increase capacity. More expensive gas means wind and especially solar are more attractive to meet marginal energy demand, especially when paired with storage, for which tech neutral tax credits survived. Designing and selling climate policy with a strong focus on how it can address the high cost of living could retain or increase support for climate action. The cost of energy is also likely to be a pain point for the Trump administration, and may create openings for persuading the Trump administration to at least temper their policy of wanton discrimination.

Second is markets. Even as US policy kneecaps the growth of domestic markets for clean technologies, many American firms believe their long-term success depends on their ability to compete in the markets where the vast majority of future growth is expected to come from. In those markets, policy is not turning against clean energy, and Chinese firms look well positioned to run the tables. This reality is likely to limit the extent to which US automakers, for example, retreat from EVs.

Third is supply chains, whose vulnerability was a powerful impetus behind the IRA. To the extent that US actors believe that clean technologies have some role to play in the future energy mix, there is likely to continue to be an an interest in onshoring those supply chains. Any association of clean energy with manufacturing jobs will blunt efforts to penalize clean energy, and will limit the extent to which NCCS erodes. The fact that the 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit (which provides a per unit subsidy for domestically produced solar, wind, and battery components as well as critical minerals) mostly survived the IRA repeal effort is strong evidence for this assertion, and 45X’s survival will provide some succor to clean technology manufacturing for the foreseeable future.

Fourth is “clean firm.” The “tech neutral” clean energy tax credits mostly survived for everything besides solar and wind. If strong power demand and a weakening of solar’s cost advantage helps spur demand for “clean firm”—geothermal, nuclear, gas with CCS—then perhaps we will see emissions decline and some positive feedback loops for further climate action, especially if the US does manage to keep a technological edge in at least some of these power sources. There appears to be continued startup activity and venture backing for new energy technologies. If there is any potential for enlisting the current US government as a partner in carbon-free energy, it lies here.

Fifth is climate change itself, which does not care what common sense guides policy makers. Extreme weather events will happen more frequently and cause more damage. The reality and future likelihood of extreme weather events will only further reverberate through insurance markets, and through them into home prices, property taxes, local government services, and state budgets. (Of course, we can’t ever straightforwardly assume that experiencing the adverse effects of climate change will make people into stronger supporters of climate action. Whether it does or doesn’t is a political assumption—which the political right is fully prepared to contest.)

Sixth is industrial policy, whose return does not appear to be going away, even if the goals toward which it is being put are changing. The MP Materials deal, which made the Department of Defense (War?) the largest shareholder of the rare earths firm, is a strong indication that the US government will continue to utilize industrial policy tools in new and creative ways, some of which, perhaps, could be built on in the future.

Finally there is Trump himself. He is always smashing shibboleths. With his flamboyant jawboning around tariffs and prices, he may well have contributed to some price restraint and margin trimming by US companies. As in the MP Materials deal, and even more strikingly with Intel, he has broken norms surrounding public ownership. The “golden share” shoe will some day be on the other foot, and advocates for aggressive climate action may have tools they did not believe they had before for directing investment towards desired ends.

But these factors will be up against powerful centrifugal forces that threaten to cleave the coalition further. In particular, those of us looking for ways to slow and ultimately reverse the Trump era assault on climate action are likely to encounter trade-offs that big green fiscal mostly allowed us to defer in 2021–2022.

Cleavages in the NCCS

The loss of subsidies is going to significantly increase cost pressures on solar and wind developers and on clean tech manufacturers (since they will all be competing for smaller markets, and they’ll have lost provisions like the assembly and critical minerals requirements in the clean vehicles tax credits and the domestic content bonus in the clean electricity credits, which were designed to level the playing field for US producers). The final shape of a new tariff regime is still completely unknown, as are its effects on domestic prices. Tariffs may provide cushion from cost pressure for some manufacturers of clean technologies, but are likely to squeeze others.

In the face of cost pressures, companies can be expected to look for ways to cut back on job standards and limit unionization, push more aggressively for deregulation, and pull back from commitments to “community benefits.” A more cutthroat green capital sector delivering fewer co-benefits alongside decarbonization investments will heighten the anxiety many workers have that the transition will be bad for job quality, and the concern many communities have that economic development takes place at their expense. It will be a harder bargain to find unity between such a sector and the social and electoral coalition that won its subsidies.

Strains on the grid from data centers and other new sources of energy demand were already creating pressure to relax statutory clean energy goals at the state level. The loss of federal subsidies and federal regulations is likely to exacerbate those tensions, as utilities look to pass on the cost of more expensive solar and wind to ratepayers, and as industries seek relief from state-level cap-and-trade requirements. The previously discussed tightened state budgets will therefore increase the likelihood of “economy vs. environment”-type conflicts even in bastions of climate action, with ratepayers, blue collar workers, Medicaid recipients, and others pitted against climate spending in a struggle for scarce resources.

What is to be done?

Climate action is on track to be slower, less well equipped to deliver co-benefits, and more fraught with trade-offs and distributional conflicts. Each of these is a threat to future climate action and erodes the new climate common sense. It may be impossible for the climate community to prevent any of these developments from transpiring over the next several years; it is almost certainly impossible for the climate community to prevent all of them from transpiring.

We are going to be dealing with scarcity politics. In such an environment, minimizing cleavages within the coalition that forged the NCCS and broadening the base of political support for climate action is imperative. But doing so may mean acquiescing to a slower pace of climate action in some circumstances—which raises the task of ensuring that a slower pace of progress in the short term doesn’t translate into the sorts of hedging behavior that will make more ambitious action harder in the medium term. This may mean searching for focus and efficiency in our policy interventions. What policies deliver the biggest impact for the lowest cost? Are there certain climate-related investments that are especially popular or politically significant, around which rearguard action can be prioritized? Are there opportunities not just to entice capital, but to compel it to invest in certain ways? Can we get more creative about financing? Can we get better at embedding climate action in other areas of policy that are more salient for ordinary people (e.g. housing)? What opportunities exist for leveraging scale, through coordinated actions across climate aligned states? What sorts of transnational coordination can help to avert negative feedback loops from setting in (since many other countries are facing similar pressures)?

It is unlikely that the climate community will align around a single answer to all of these questions. But hopefully a shared analysis of the challenges we face can help to forge greater unity of purpose. Beyond policy design, it seems urgent to recommit to movement building as a precondition for climate action. What corporations and policy elites believe their interests to be is not given, but is rather shaped by movements and politics. The world has changed in many ways, but the need for people in the US and across the world to stand up for a future in which all people can thrive has never been greater.

As of July, the average household price of electricity in the United States has risen by 9.5 percent this year, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s policies are likely to contribute to inflation, including pushing up electricity costs.","Rising electricity rates are hitting consumers just about everywhere as utilities struggle to build enough power plants to meet rising demand from data centers.

But the effects on prices vary a lot by state.

Federal electricity data released on Tuesday helps to identify where the increases in bills have been the most drastic. I found several surprises.

As of July, the average household price of electricity in the United States has risen by 9.5 percent this year, according to the Energy Information Administration. You might guess that the largest increases were in states known for high electricity costs, such as California, or those that are part of the PJM Interconnection, a multistate grid region embroiled in controversy over rising prices.

But the largest percentage increase this year was in Missouri, which rose 38.3 percent. Several of the state’s utilities raised rates, including Ameren, which had a 12 percent rate increase that took effect this summer.

The rest of the top five are North Dakota, with 33.6 percent; New Jersey, with 28.6 percent; Iowa, with 27.5 percent; and Montana, with 25.3 percent.

Of those five, only New Jersey is in PJM, which covers parts of the Mid-Atlantic, South and Midwest.

California, with a 7.8 percent increase, trails the national average.

I’m looking at the changes in prices since January because that’s when President Donald Trump took office vowing to cut energy costs. Democrats are now seeking to tie him to rising bills.

But I should note that seven months of data is not enough to draw firm conclusions. Trump hasn’t had much time for his policy changes to affect what consumers pay for power.

And a 9.5 percent increase is high but has recent precedent. During the COVID-fueled inflation panic of Joe Biden’s administration, households faced some punishing electricity bills, including a 10.1 percent hike in the annual average for 2022 compared to 2021. Biden paid a heavy political price for inflation, so this example should not be a comfort to the Trump administration.

The bigger concern for consumers, in my view, is that the worst may be yet to come. Trump’s policies are likely to contribute to inflation, including pushing up electricity costs. For example, the Trump administration’s attempt to slow the development of renewable energy will likely reduce the supply of electricity at a time when solar is the country’s fastest-growing power source. And tariffs on imported metals are likely to increase the costs for electricity infrastructure.

To better understand the price trend, let’s take a step back and look at how July 2025 costs compare to those five years ago.

The largest increase in that time was in Washington, D.C., up 93.2 percent. The rest of the top five were Maine, up 66.1 percent; California, up 62.7 percent; Maryland, up 54.3 percent; and New Jersey, up 52.7 percent.

Pennsylvania, a state whose affordability crisis was the subject of a recent story by me and my colleague Kiley Bense, ranked sixth, with 46.5 percent. A key point in that story is that price increases in Pennsylvania vary by utility, and many households are paying much more than the state average.

And, while Iowa experienced a high percentage increase since January, it has the lowest percentage increase in the country since five years ago, with 7.6 percent. This helps to demonstrate how short-term changes can be misleading. North Dakota has a similar dynamic, with a high increase this year and a low increase—11.8 percent—over five years.

Why Are Prices Rising?

Prices are increasing mainly because the spike in electricity demand—a significant portion of it from AI data centers and other superusers—is not being met with an adequate amount of new power.

Regulators and lawmakers need to act quickly to respond to the situation, said Rob Kelter, a senior attorney for the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicago-based environmental advocacy group.

“You’re talking about data centers that need as much electricity as a small city, and we’re just not ready to handle that,” he said.

The solution, he said, is to deploy a combination of energy storage systems, wind farms and solar arrays that work in conjunction with policies to help reduce electricity demand at times when it’s highest. The Trump administration and many utility companies are trying to meet demand in large part by delaying the shutdown of old coal-fired power plants and rapidly building new gas-fired power plants.

“I believe we can [meet demand] and still meet our carbon goals, but it certainly is going to be a challenge, and legislatures and regulatory commissions aren’t used to being in a situation where they’ve got to make so many big, important decisions so quickly,” he said.

Some states, such as Indiana and Ohio, have adopted policies designed to protect consumers from being left on the hook for data center projects that fail to materialize. But that’s just the beginning of what consumer advocates would like to see done.

Indiana ranks near the national average in its percentage increase in electricity rates, both for this year and the last five years. The experience there helps to show that an average increase in this inflationary period is still painful.

“We’re hearing, first and foremost, a combination of anxiety, fear and some anger,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer advocacy group. “The affordability crisis is very prevalent, very real.”

His organization launched an advertising campaign this week, called “Stop Mike’s Hikes,” to put pressure on Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, to take action to help people struggling to pay electricity bills.

Olson said Indiana’s leaders have exacerbated the problem by trying to attract data centers to the state and by supporting the use of fossil fuels to produce electricity. He is concerned that Braun and others aren’t fully aware of how difficult it is for low- and middle-income consumers to pay their utility bills.

Braun has expressed concerns about energy costs. On Tuesday, he announced three new appointees to the panel that helps choose new members of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. He said at a news conference that addressing energy affordability is a high priority when deciding who will fill open seats on the regulatory commission.

One reason I reached out to Kelter and Olson for their perspectives on electricity rates is that they’ve worked as consumer and environmental advocates for decades, and I wanted to get a sense of how this moment compares to other times of high anxiety about power costs.

Each said the current situation ranks near the top, but it’s distinct from other events—such as the natural gas price spike of the late 2000s—because of the complexity of the problem.

“People are leery of what the future holds,” Olson said.

A Baffling Coincidence

According to the new data, the country’s average residential price of electricity remained the same, down to a hundredth of a penny for three straight months. That’s a remarkable coincidence.

That price, in May, June and July, was 17.47 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the Energy Information Administration. Looking back at decades of data, I can find examples of the average price remaining the same for two months in a row, but this is the first time I’ve seen it stay the same for three months.

How is this possible, especially when rates in some states went up a lot during that time?

I asked an EIA spokesman, who said the process for calculating the price hasn’t changed and that the result is indeed a coincidence.

I also looked at some of the underlying data that the office uses to determine this average, which includes the amount of electricity produced and the total dollars customers paid for it. No matter how I sliced it, the numbers came out the same: 17.47 cents.

One factor is that California and Texas both had rate decreases since May, which helped to offset the increases in other places.

Some people reading this may wonder if EIA is fiddling with the numbers to avoid negative headlines about rising prices. It isn’t an outlandish thing to suggest, given that the Trump administration fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following a monthly jobs report that the president didn’t like.

But the people at EIA who produce this data are career staff, not political appointees, and I’ve seen no evidence of anything hinky with the numbers. Still, this result is unusual enough that I had to mention it.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

A Federal Judge Allows Revolution Wind to Resume Construction: Revolution Wind, an offshore wind project that would serve Rhode Island and Connecticut, can resume construction following a federal judge’s ruling this week. The project was nearly complete when the Trump administration ordered it to pause on Aug. 22 for what it said were national security concerns, as Jennifer McDermott and Matthew Daly report for The Associated Press. At a hearing on Monday, a U.S. District Court judge said the delay was causing irreparable damage, and the developer could continue work while the federal government conducts its investigation of the potential harm the project may cause. The Trump administration has taken various actions to slow offshore wind development. Clare Fieseler wrote for Canary Media about the ruling and the larger picture of legal challenges facing offshore wind.

Pennsylvania Was Once a Clean Energy Leader. What Happened? Pennsylvania now ranks near the bottom of the country in the share of electricity generated from renewable energy. But in the 2000s, the state had policies that promoted wind and solar. My colleague Kiley Bense and I report for ICN about how the state failed to build on those early efforts.

Trump Brings His Talk of a ‘Green Energy Scam’ to the United Nations: President Donald Trump gave a rambling speech to the U.N. General Assembly in which he praised his administration’s support for fossil fuels and its opposition to renewable energy, and he said that other countries were foolish to want to choose a different course, as I wrote for ICN. The specifics were alarming, including a dismissal of the threat of climate change. Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, said in a statement that Trump’s speech was “a denial of reality.” But the most striking aspect of the speech for me was its meandering delivery and its length, which took much more time than that of any other speaker.

EVs Are Now Cheaper Than Gasoline Vehicles, But Not for Long: The average price of an electric vehicle in the United States fell below that of a new gasoline-powered vehicle in July and August, according to data from J.D. Power. This shift is notable, but it’s not going to last long because a tax credit of up to $7,500 for qualifying new EVs expires at the end of this month. Dealers had added additional incentives this summer as they try to clear out inventory before the tax credit ends, as Tim Levin reports for InsideEVs.

To fund construction, the project secured a $2.26 billion conditional loan from the U.S. Department of Energy and a $250 million strategic investment from Orion Resource Partners. As of mid-2025, major construction is underway, including initial concrete placements.

Thacker Pass has a projected mine life of over 85 years, and the company holds more than 14 million tonnes of proven and probable lithium reserves. The project is central to U.S. efforts to build a domestic EV battery supply chain.

The move would be the latest in a string of negotiations that have given the U.S. government stakes in Intel and MP Materials.

Lithium is a critical mineral essential for manufacturing lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles (EVs), portable electronics, and energy storage systems. Global demand for lithium continues to rise sharply due to the accelerating transition to clean energy and electrification of transportation.

Morrisey, speaking at the West Virginia Energy Educational Forum in Wheeling and acknowledging the increase sets an ambitious goal for the state. “When it comes to energy, West Virginia needs to be out in front. We need sound policy to guide our development and use of our abundant natural resources.”

In his address, the governor detailed the future energy demands of the state and the country in the coming years, noting that PJM, a regional transmission organization (RTO) that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia, will likely need 110 GW of new generation capacity to keep pace with demand growth and aging retirements.

“Currently, very few states within PJM can produce enough power to meet their own needs, much less export power to other states,” said Governor Morrisey. “West Virginia is one of those states. However, while we are a national leader in per-capita electricity exports, we lack the existing generation capacity to meet future needs.”

Gov. Morrisey explained the four components of the energy policy, which includes the “50 by 50” Generation Policy, a Transmission Policy, an Energy Security Policy, and 25-Year Strategic Development policy for each source of energy in West Virginia.

“The foundation of this policy is Power Generation,” he said. “This plan focuses primarily on baseload generation from coal, natural gas and nuclear. It is critical to our way of life and provides a stable backbone to the grid, ensuring there is always a dependable supply of electricity.”

The governor will work with the West Virginia Legislature, state agencies, and federal partners, as well as members of industry, education, and the public, to achieve these goals. His administration has already engaged the U.S. Department of Energy and partnered with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to assist with crafting different components of the overall policies.

Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. (AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option, or if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

LENEXA, KAN. (SEPT. 25, 2025) – Today, at a brownfields site in Topeka, Kansas, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7 Administrator Jim Macy presented a $2 million award to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and a $500,000 award to the city of Topeka in Brownfields Assessment Grants. Macy was joined by Topeka Planning Division Director Dan Warner and KDHE Secretary Janet Stanek.

“We are honored to present funds for Brownfields Assessment Grants to Kansas Department of Health and Environment and the city of Topeka, highlighting their commitment to transforming communities across the Heartland,” Macy said. “This investment underscores the resilience and innovative spirit of the region, where brownfield sites are being revitalized into thriving centers of economic and social activity.”

“I am excited to utilize grant dollars to revitalize areas in Topeka,” said Topeka Mayor Mike Padilla. “It is great to be able to work with different organizations to reinvest in Topeka to create clean new areas for growth.”

“These Community-Wide Grant funds from EPA put Kansas communities in the position to leverage additional funds that will aid in redevelopment, revitalization, and cleanup plans across the state,” Stanek said. “We will be able to support the redevelopment of several Kansas brownfield sites through technical assistance, environmental assessments, and cleanup planning assistance. This not only benefits those individual communities, but it benefits the entire state.”

EPA has selected the City of Topeka for a Brownfields Assessment Grant. In Topeka, Community-Wide Grant funds will be used to conduct eight Phase I and three Phase II environmental site assessments. Grant funds also will be used to inventory brownfields sites and support reuse planning and community engagement activities. The target area for this grant is the City of Topeka, where priority sites include the 36-acre former White Lakes Mall and two former schools.EPA selected KDHE for a Brownfields Community-Wide Assessment Grant for States and Tribes. Grant funds will be used to conduct 116 Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments, and also will support the development of at least three cleanup plans and at least one community meeting annually with each community to provide general updates on the grant. The Kansas target areas for this grant include the Oak Grove neighborhood in Kansas City and the cities of Eureka and El Dorado. Priority sites include Land Bank properties in Oak Grove; a former horse racetrack, former nursing home, Memorial Hall, former Masonic Lodge, and sites adjacent to the existing fire department to accommodate its expansion in Eureka; and the Grizzly Development in El Dorado.

Background

These grants are part of FY 2025 Brownfields Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund (RLF), Cleanup Grants, and RLF Supplemental Funding announced in May 2025. View the list of selected applicants.

EPA’s Brownfields program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfields Grants to assess and cleanup contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, brownfields investments have leveraged over $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage over 220,500 jobs from both public and private sources.

(EAM) has forged a strategic partnership with Phillips 66. The agreement in principle, announced on September 24, secures the supply of critical raw materials for EAM's upcoming 30,000-ton graphite active anode material facility in North Carolina.

The core of the partnership involves Phillips 66 supplying Green and Calcined Needle Coke from its Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery to EAM. As one of the world's leading producers of specialty cokes, Phillips 66 provides a crucial feedstock for manufacturing synthetic graphite anodes, which are a core component of lithium-ion batteries. This consistent and reliable access to high-quality materials will enable EAM to ramp up production at its new facility, which is poised to become a key player in the U.S. battery materials landscape.

""This collaboration is a major step in building a secure and sustainable battery materials supply chain for the US,"" stated Vikram Handa, Managing Director of Epsilon Advanced Materials. ""Phillips 66’s expertise in energy and materials, combined with EAM’s capacity and global presence, will ensure reliable, scalable, and sustainable graphite anode production to power the EV and ESS industries worldwide."" The agreement reinforces efforts to build a competitive and resilient supply chain for clean energy technologies across multiple regions.

The North Carolina facility, located in Brunswick County, has completed all permitting milestones and is on track to begin operations in 2027. It will initially produce 30,000 tons of graphite active anode material annually, with plans to expand to 60,000 tons by 2030. At full operational capacity, the plant is projected to supply enough material for approximately one million electric vehicles each year, directly supporting U.S. battery manufacturers and automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

This partnership arrives at a crucial time as the U.S. government and industry leaders prioritize building a robust domestic supply chain to meet the rapidly accelerating demand for EVs and energy storage. By bringing together Phillips 66's operational expertise and EAM's advanced manufacturing capabilities, the agreement not only addresses supply chain vulnerabilities but also promotes economic growth and job creation in the United States.

Which of these American chipmaker’s shares have performed the best this year: A) Nvidia B) Broadcom C) Intel? The answer is C, and it’s not even close despite concerns about its business outlook.

Much of Intel’s appeal with investors appears to be its sale of a stake to the U.S. government, which preceded billions more in announced strategic investments, potentially including from Apple. We break it all down below.

Will Apple get inside Intel?

Intel’s extraordinary agreement last month to sell a stake to the U.S. government set off all kinds of questions about the future of the embattled chipmaker and American-style capitalism in the Trump era.

It’s not clear whether the plan will bolster the Silicon Valley pioneer’s turnaround efforts. But it may prod more investment in Intel by fellow American tech companies, including those trying to stay in President Trump’s good graces.

The latest: Intel’s shares soared on Wednesday (and were up again in premarket trading on Thursday) on reports by Bloomberg and others that the company had held discussions with Apple about a possible investment. The companies have talked multiple times, according to The Times, including before the government agreed to invest $8.9 billion in Intel.

Since then, Nvidia has said it would invest $5 billion in the chipmaker and SoftBank about $2 billion. Other companies are said to be in talks with Intel, too, according to Bloomberg.

The Trump administration has taken a special interest in Intel. In January, months before the deal for a government stake was struck, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick sounded out TSMC, Intel’s rival, about potentially taking over the American company’s foundry business (which makes chips for other customers) after it was spun off, The Times reports.

Another scenario to help its manufacturing business was to have Apple, Nvidia and other tech companies take stakes in that division.

How would Apple and Intel work together if there’s a deal? The tech giant was once a major Intel customer before it switched MacBooks over to its own line of chips — reportedly over frustration with Intel semiconductor performance — and more broadly has sought to use its own silicon in iPhones, AirPods and more.

Could the two find new ways to collaborate again? One potential way is for Intel to make some of the Apple-designed chips, giving the foundry business a potentially crucial customer. Or Intel could make chips for Apple’s data centers.

Some on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley are wondering about the political angle. Are companies willing to invest in Intel because they’ve bought into the vision of the chipmaker’s C.E.O., Lip-Bu Tan — or is it because they’re seeking favor with the Trump administration?

Recall that Tim Cook of Apple promised last month at a White House event to spend $600 billion domestically to bolster American manufacturing. How would an Intel deal factor into that?

In other Apple news: The tech giant on Thursday asked E.U. antitrust watchdogs to scrap sweeping digital privacy rules, arguing that they could stymie innovation.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING

Jimmy Kimmel’s return scores big ratings. “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” averaged 6.2 million viewers for its Tuesday episode, according to Nielsen, nearly four times as much as its usual audience. (These are preliminary figures, and do not count streaming numbers.) But Kimmel’s show remains off the air on the roughly 70 ABC affiliates owned by Nexstar and Sinclair, which haven’t said when they would resume airing the program; the question is how long their standoff with Disney will last.

The U.S. prepares to offer Argentina significant financial aid. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the Trump administration could take steps including offering the Argentine central bank a $20 billion swap line and buying Argentina’s U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. Such moves would help bolster Argentina’s embattled economy, though President Trump said this week that he didn’t think it needed “a bailout.”

The White House warns of mass firings if the government shuts down. The Trump administration told federal agencies to prepare for more layoffs if lawmakers don’t approve a funding deal by next week’s deadline. An impasse remains between the parties, with Trump refusing to meet with Democrats. Some analysts are worried that a shutdown could result in consequences for the economy.

Starbucks plans to close stores and lay off hundreds. The coffee giant’s C.E.O., Brian Niccol, told workers that the company would shut about 1 percent of its North American stores and cut about 900 nonretail jobs. The effort, which Starbucks said would cost about $1 billion, is part of its latest effort to turn around its fortunes.

Exclusive: Using A.I. to catch A.I. song copyright abuse

Music labels have an increasingly complicated relationship with artificial intelligence. The technology can help promote their artists and inspire new kinds of creativity — but, executives and musicians fear, also rip off their work.

The start-up SoundPatrol, whose founders include Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood superagent and former Disney president, says it has a tool to guard against copyright infringement. And the company has signed up two of the three biggest record labels, Universal Music Group and Sony Music, as partners, Michael de la Merced is first to report.

The backdrop: Artists and labels have argued that A.I.-generated music robs from existing artists, creatively and financially. Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Records have joined lawsuits against two popular A.I. music generators, Suno and Udio.

“We have to protect our I.P. and our copyrights,” Lucian Grainge, Universal Music’s C.E.O., told DealBook. He added that for his business, music and intellectual property and copyrights are “the blood that runs through its veins.”

The rise of A.I. comes as the music industry recovers from a time of widespread piracy in the early 2000s, with global revenues last year topping the CD-era level of 1999.

How SoundPatrol works: The company uses what it calls “neural fingerprinting,” A.I. technology that can identify distinctive elements of a song — voice, lyrics, melody, chords, timbre and other factors, according to Walter De Brouwer, SoundPatrol’s other founder — and catalogs them. That will help SoundPatrol create a dashboard where customers can see where potential infringement is happening and where it’s coming from, he added.

“For the first time, there will be a trackable, reportable system of I.P. breaches, even if they’re minor,” Ovitz told DealBook. “We can pick up bits and pieces of every song.”

Universal Music and Sony Music will help train SoundPatrol’s systems, giving the start-up access to their libraries. “It’s my job and my duty to do everything I can from my vantage point to make sure that music is protected and monetized and respected,” Grainge told DealBook.

“Our collaboration with SoundPatrol is about respecting artists’ rights to build a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for everyone,” Dennis Kooker, the president of Sony Music’s global digital business, added.

A.I.-generated music is growing in popularity. Just look at the summertime phenomenon that was the Velvet Sundown, a band that amassed more than one million streams on Spotify but was eventually revealed to be an A.I. creation.

Deezer, the French streaming service, recently reported that fully A.I.-generated music now accounted for more than 30,000 of the tracks it receives daily (about 28 percent of total daily song volume). The streaming platform identified up to 70 percent of them as fraudulent, meant just to rack up streams and royalties.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/25/multimedia/25db-apple-bfjk/25db-apple-bfjk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 15:00:58.508266

The NRCM report outlines “deep cuts” to programs that help pay for wastewater treatment facilities, drinking water infrastructure, air pollution inspection and enforcement and redeveloping polluted industrial sites.","AUGUSTA — Proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency would strip funds from clean water and air programs, limit clean-up of contaminated sites and eliminate climate research, according to a report released Thursday by the Natural Resources Council of Maine.

NRCM and other environmental groups are speaking out against cuts proposed in the House budget bill released in July. The proposal seeks to reduce spending at EPA by about $2 billion, which is a 23% reduction from current levels.

“The proposed cuts represent the most extreme rollback of environmental funding in decades,” Anya Fetcher, NRCM’s federal policy advocate, said during a Thursday press conference at the State House.

The budget also calls for cutting more than 1,200 jobs, according to NRCM.

The report explains that the Maine Department of Environmental Protection gets nearly $11 million in grants from the EPA, which is 22% of its budget and supports about 100 jobs.

“Without question, these cuts would create widespread damage, undermining DEP’s ability to ensure that our water is clean, our air is healthy, and our communities and Maine people are protected from toxic hazards,” according to the report.

Fetcher said the Trump administration originally proposed a 54% cut to EPA, followed by the House proposal at 23% and a Senate budget proposal with a 5% cut.

She said although NRCM would advocate for no reduction in spending, they are encouraged that the draft budget from the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is chaired by Republican Sen. Susan Collins, “largely retains the EPA’s role of protecting health and the environment.”

In response to the report, an EPA spokesperson sent a statement to Spectrum News saying they “are confident” EPA will have enough money to meet its core mission.

“The Trump EPA is committed to being an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars as we protect human health and the environment, unleash energy dominance, implement permitting reform, make America the AI capital of the world, and bring back the American auto industry,” read the statement from the EPA press office.

In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency would be reconsidering 31 environmental regulations, including those on power plants, the oil and gas industry, emission standards for air pollution and electric vehicle regulations.

“Today, the green new scam ends as the EPA does its part to usher in the golden age of American success,” Zeldin said in a video announcement.

The NRCM report outlines “deep cuts” to programs that help pay for wastewater treatment facilities, drinking water infrastructure, air pollution inspection and enforcement and redeveloping polluted industrial sites.

It says funds would be eliminated for climate change programs that set standards for greenhouse gas pollution and those that work to understand and reduce the risks of climate change.

“Everyone in Maine — and worldwide — will suffer the impacts of this administration’s flagrant disengagement from activities aimed at addressing the threat of climate change,” the report states.

Dr. Sydney Sewall, an Augusta area pediatrician, said during the news conference that he worries about what a reduction in air quality will mean for children.

“Air pollution effects are comparable to the outcomes resulting from maternal smoking where both low birth weight and prematurity become more common,” he said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/NRCM_sign_horizontal_ME_0925,N,,2025-09-25 15:01:41.148710

The cost of these clean energy sources is already low and getting lower, as is the cost of battery storage.
The point here is that if we want cheap energy, we want clean energy.","The media are often slow to catch up with reality. In decades past we could talk about addressing global warming as a trade-off where we would spend more on energy and cars, in order to avoid destroying the planet. This meant that people who didn’t care about the planet we leave to future generations could argue that it was not worth paying the costs associated with slowing global warming.

But that was in the past. The cost of solar and wing energy has plummeted, as has the cost of electric cars. The cheapest and quickest way to get new energy online is now solar and wind, not building new coal or gas fired power plants. Also, contrary to what our energy secretary seems to believe, there is something called a “battery,” that allows wind and solar energy to be stored for use at times when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. And new electric cars can be purchased for less than $10,000.

While most folks may be aware of these facts, Donald Trump does not seem to be, or at least chose to ignore them, in his UN rant on Tuesday. He warned the countries of the world away from wind and solar power and told them to use more oil and natural gas.

Trump has never cared much for reality. He may just be looking to pay back his campaign contributors from the fossil fuel industry. But for those interested in the real world, here’s the relative cost of electricity in the United States and China.

We are currently paying more than twice as much for our electricity as China and the gap is likely to increase in the years ahead. Our electricity costs seem almost certain to go higher as Donald Trump’s campaign contributors use massive amounts of electricity for AI and crypto.

The increased demand for these purposes would pose a problem in any case, but with Trump working hard to shut down wind and solar power, the gap between growing demand and stagnating supply is likely to worsen. Meanwhile, China is building up its wind and solar generating capacity at an incredible pace. They already account for more than a quarter of the country’s electricity production. The cost of these clean energy sources is already low and getting lower, as is the cost of battery storage.

The point here is that if we want cheap energy, we want clean energy. This may all be over Donald Trump’s head, but it should not be over the heads of the ostensibly serious people who tell us that people care about “affordability,” not climate change.

Clean energy is affordability and anyone who doesn’t acknowledge that fact should be assumed to be on the payroll of the fossil fuel industry or looking for a job in the Trump administration.",https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BTP_Climate_Clean_Energy.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 18:01:26.452062

(AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,"" the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Louisiana residents, meanwhile, face higher bills and foregone public revenues to support the data centers.
Some states are trying to lure corporations that own data centers by offering massive tax breaks—what experts call “a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to shareholders,” according to MediaJustice.
“Our fight here in New Orleans against dangerous facial recognition tech is the same fight against data centers,” the spokesperson said.","A new report warns that Big Tech’s rapid buildout of data centers across the South could usher in a new wave of environmental and economic harms for Black and working-class communities, drawing parallels to Louisiana’s infamous Cancer Alley, the infamous span of petrochemical plants belching toxic smoke.

“Today, Big Tech is following in the footsteps of Big Oil, as they deliberately build data centers in the South, banking on disempowered cities and towns with large Black populations to not have the local power to fight back,” writes grassroots coalition MediaJustice.

There are more than $200 billion planned or ongoing data center projects across Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Virginia, and the rest of the South, according to the MediaJustice’s new report, “The People Say No: Resisting Data Centers in the South.”

The buildout of high-tech data centers, framed as “progress” by companies like Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, will leave residents with higher utility bills, water scarcity, and increased pollution in the long haul, advocates warn.

Louisiana at the Epicenter

Louisiana is emerging as a new flashpoint in the South.

Entergy will use three new methane-gas plants to power Meta’s biggest data center yet, the $10 billion Hyperion project in Richland Parish, in northeastern Louisiana, according to the report. State regulators have already approved new Entergy infrastructure to support the facility, which is now under construction.

Still, grave environmental concerns remain.

“This is not just about building warehouses full of computers,” said Davante Lewis, a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission who cast the sole vote against Entergy’s plans to power the Richland Parish data center. “The real health risks come from the utilities rushing to build more gas plants and delaying renewable energy commitments,” he said. “That locks our communities into decades of pollution and higher bills.”

Currently, there are 10 operation data centers in Louisiana, with 4 more under construction and about eight more scheduled for the future, according to Arterio, a data analytics company. It’s estimated that the data center load will increase Entergy’s electrical needs by 30%.

The expansion deepens environmental injustice, critics say, especially in majority-Black and working-class communities already burdened by petrochemical plants. Along Cancer Alley, for instance, cancer risks soar to 50 times the national average in some parishes.

Hidden Costs: Energy, Water, and Transparency

Data centers demand staggering energy and water resources, as described within the report:

In 2023, data centers consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity. They are projected to reach 7–12% by 2028, according to a December 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Energy. About 56% of that will be powered by fossil fuels.

In South Carolina, regulators approved a discounted rate for the Google corporation, which pays less than half the rate of residential customers while accounting for the bulk of new energy demand.

These deals are frequently negotiated under nondisclosure agreements. In Bessemer, Alabama, $14.5 billion in farmland was rezoned without public notice. “These companies are undermining democracy by negotiating in secret and keeping our communities in the dark,” the report contends.

To cool data-center servers, facilities also may require millions of gallons each day. A proposed center in Georgia could consume nine million gallons a day—a third of one county’s entire water supply. Once used, much of the cooling water used in data centers is lost to evaporation with limited volumes returned to the water supply, WABE TV reported.

Few Jobs, Big Subsidies

Despite billion-dollar price tags, most data-center sites employ fewer than 150 workers.. Because of the massive size of the data center currently being built at Hyperion in Richland Parish, Louisiana is projecting roughly 500 new workers will be hired. That creates high hopes.

The data center, said Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, “will be as important to North Louisiana as the Superdome is to New Orleans.”

The reality is that data-center specialists are typically recruited from out of the state, researchers have found. Louisiana residents, meanwhile, face higher bills and foregone public revenues to support the data centers. Some states are trying to lure corporations that own data centers by offering massive tax breaks—what experts call “a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to shareholders,” according to MediaJustice.

“We have to be honest,” said Lewis, the commissioner. “Most of these jobs are not going to local people. And we’re sacrificing long-term community needs for short-term promises that rarely materialize.”

Grassroots Resistance Increasing

Communities across the South are beginning to push back. Between May 2024 and March 2025, activists delayed or blocked $64 billion worth of data center projects in Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, and Alabama, according to the report.

In Louisiana, environmental advocates warn that without strong resistance, new projects could cement the state as a digital “sacrifice zone,” a familiar term to the poor communities in the South that often shoulder pollution and other industry burdens.

“Not all economic development is good economic development,” Lewis said. “We need community benefit agreements.”

The state’s residents could end up paying “hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars” in costs associated with powering the Richland Parish data center, an analysis by Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) concluded.

A Legacy Repeating

From cotton plantations to petrochemicals, Louisiana has long been treated as a resource colony. say critics who characterize data centers as a form of digital colonialism—extracting land, water, and power for Big Tech’s global ambitions while leaving locals behind.

A spokesperson with Eyes on Surveillance, a New Orleans-based advocacy group, made the following statement to MediaJustice in the report:

“We have to realize that at the core of the expansion of data centers and AI facial recognition, we find Big Tech profiting from the suffering and destruction of the livelihoods of people of color.”

The group also sees a connection between the technological buildup and excessive police surveillance.

“Our fight here in New Orleans against dangerous facial recognition tech is the same fight against data centers,” the spokesperson said. “Facial recognition requires data centers to exist, so we have a system of racist technology that destroys our lives through criminalization and over-policing, through the polluting of our water and air, through the depletion of our resources, and ultimately, through the dehumanization of our lives.”

The South knows this story well. The question is whether the region will allow another chapter of exploitation—or whether resistance can turn the page toward something different, data-center critics say.

Though Lewis at the moment stands as the sole critic on this issue on the public-service commission, he still believes that a broader pushback could materialize — if people begin to see it as a way to safeguard the area’s future, in case the AI bubble bursts, as some predict it will.

If that happens, opponents say, it would be easy for Meta to take a $10 million loss and walk away, leaving the data-center project as a burden on local taxpayers.

“We can’t just be blinded by the shiny moment,” Lewis said. “These industries promise tax revenue and jobs, but 15 or 20 years from now, what will the real cost be to our communities? A $10 billion loss might sound huge to us, but to (Meta CEO) Mark Zuckerberg, it’s like buying a round of drinks at the bar.”

The announcement, made by Centrus Energy, along with Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, Ohio Senator Jon Husted and Congressperson Dave Taylor, JobsOhio, and Ohio Southeast Economic Development, said the expansion is expected to create 1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operations jobs at the Piketon site, while retaining 127 existing jobs, boosting Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) and High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) production.

Funding for the project, however, has not yet been determined, which will go a long way in determining the size and scope of the expansion.

Centrus has raised more than $1.2 billion in a pair of convertible note transactions over the last 12 months, JobsOhio said, and has secured more than $2 billion in contingent purchase commitments from utility customers in the United States and around the world.

“We are planning a historic, multi-billion-dollar investment right here in Ohio – supported by a nationwide supply chain to do just that,” Centrus CEO Amir Vexler said in the statement.

The project is also expected to support hundreds of jobs at Centrus’ centrifuge manufacturing plant in Tennessee and throughout its manufacturing supply chain – which is entirely domestic – along with thousands of indirect jobs in Ohio, Tennessee, and across the country.

By Laila Kearney and Timothy Gardner

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump expects most of the nation's coal-fired power plants to delay retirement to help deliver the vast amount of electricity needed to fuel artificial intelligence, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Reuters on Thursday.

Keeping those often half-century-old coal plants running is part of a broader strategy to increase the country's power output that will also include boosting nuclear energy and allowing backup power plants to operate around the clock.

The administration has made expanding energy production a top priority while rejecting concerns about climate change, which Trump told the United Nations this week amounted to a global ""con job.""

""Energy sobriety has returned to Washington, D.C. Our focus is on Americans and the price of utility and avoiding blackouts,"" Wright said at a Reuters Newsmaker event. ""We've got to stop existing firm capacity from retirement.""

The government had been in discussions with many utilities nationwide and expects the majority of the several dozen U.S. coal plants nearing retirement to delay closure, he said.

""I would say the majority of that coal capacity will stay online,"" he added.

The administration is also prepared to use its emergency powers to extend the life of coal-fired plants, he said.

Last month, Wright extended his emergency order to keep a Michigan coal plant running, even though the plant's operator had been planning to shut permanently for economic reasons.

The Energy Department also ordered a gas and oil-fired power plant, slated for retirement in Pennsylvania, to continue operating.

Wright said more plants should expect similar orders, which fall under grid stability provisions in the Federal Power Act.

""Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, that's not the only one,"" Wright said.

Wright said the U.S. would also aim to get more out of the existing grid by running backup generators and standby power plants continuously, rather than just when electricity demand surges.

The White House is also seeking to boost nuclear energy, including through regulatory reforms to speed permitting and by hosting new nuclear technologies through the Department of Energy.

""We need that industry as another source of energy, and so we're going to give temporary nudges to get it started,"" Wright said.

Currently, two shut U.S. nuclear power plants - including one on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania - are in the unprecedented process of being restarted. Three Mile Island, dubbed the Crane Clean Energy Center, would deliver electricity for Microsoft data centers.

Total U.S. electricity demand is projected to hit record highs this year and next, according to the Energy Information Administration. Growth in the country's power consumption will also continue to accelerate through the end of the decade as massive AI data center campuses power up.

The global race by countries, primarily the U.S. and China, to dominate AI will depend largely on connecting new electricity supplies, the Trump administration has said.

China built 100 gigawatts of coal-fired power last year and another 100 gigawatts are under construction, Wright said.

""Right now, it doesn't matter what China says about climate policy,"" Wright said. ""They're growing their electricity, they're building their industrial might, and they're saying: please keep sending us your industry.""

The Department of Energy, this year, also opened federal land for the development of power plants and data centers.

So far, the department has received some 300 inquiries, Wright said.

Driving the news: Tesla is among the many respondents to the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to repeal the 2009 ""endangerment finding"" that greenhouse gases from vehicles threaten human health and welfare.

The formal finding provides the legal basis for regulating CO2 emissions from cars and trucks, and — by extension — some other big sources.

Tesla's comments also oppose EPA's related plan to do away with any emissions rules for cars and trucks.

Threat level: ""The Endangerment Finding — and the vehicle emissions standards which flow from it — have provided a stable regulatory platform for Tesla's extensive investments in product development and production,"" Tesla states.

The 2009 finding is legal and ""based on a robust factual and scientific record,"" Tesla's Monday comments now available in EPA's regulatory docket state.

The other side: EPA in August issued the proposal that Administrator Lee Zeldin called ""basically driving a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion.""

The plan makes a suite of legal and scientific arguments on the finding and tailpipe rules (many that are sharply contested), alleging that EPA ""unreasonably analyzed the scientific record"" in the 2009 decision.

They include claims that Supreme Court decisions in 2022 and 2024, which limited what executive agencies can do without explicit congressional blessing, warrant reconsideration of the policies.

The bottom line: ""While Tesla believes that the current regulation establishing the standards is overly complex and could be streamlined to make it less burdensome, we do, nonetheless, recognize EPA's authority and obligation to establish greenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles,"" Tesla's comments state.",https://images.axios.com/_dp6fKy7h8BdzVMqmcrVbA1sQzo=/0x0:5300x2981/1366x768/2025/09/25/1758819178378.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 14:02:32.420995

Pick any revolutionary advancement you can think of — the Internet, smartphones, air travel, automobiles, the conveyor belt. You can go back as far as fire itself, and experts say AI has a chance to outshine them all.

As a consequence, there’s an international winner-take-all race to supremacy underway that involves the United States, China and Europe, and the victor stands to emerge at the top of the world’s economic pecking order.

Much is at stake as industry and institutions are ramping up microchip production, data center construction and educational programs customized to a new AI economy. But behind the billions of dollars in technology infrastructure investment, policymakers and industry visionaries still don’t know if the United States will have enough electricity available to feed the AI behemoth once it reaches maturity.

No one is quite sure how much more electricity the United States will need, but estimates suggest the nation’s emerging AI machine could demand 60 gigawatts or more within the next couple of years. That volume far exceeds the needs of major U.S. cities, such as New York.

Adding that much power to the grid will be no small undertaking, experts say, especially for a nation that has focused the last quarter century on a clean energy transition that still is looking for traction. Wind and solar energy can play a role, but inconsistent production limits their ability to meet spikes in power demand.

So, what’s left? No one is talking about coal. That leaves natural gas to carry the burden. And then there’s nuclear, an emerging darling of the power industry, winning bipartisan support from policymakers who are now willing to set aside the 1979 Three Mile Island disaster, which practically paralyzed the industry for decades.

The Oklahoma City-based Hamm Institute for American Energy has made the issue one of its core concerns, bringing leaders together from across the United States and from key international trading partners, such as Japan and South Korea.

“The United States has the resources it needs. What it lacks is speed, certainty and alignment,” said Ann Bluntzer Pullin, executive director of the Hamm Institute. “This initiative is about turning urgency into action so that America and its allies can lead in both energy and AI.”

“I feel like you’ve got these two giants, the tech industry and the energy industry at this unbelievable moment in time where they can both rise to the occasion and literally move society forward in a way where everyone’s quality of life goes up,” she told leaders at a recent roundtable event.

There’s a growing number of AI systems housed in an expanding network of data centers, which store, process and manage critical data and their applications. The giant facilities’ large assemblies of servers, storage drives and other hardware are known for their enormous appetite for electricity.

Skyrocketing power needs

More than 50 new data center construction projects are currently being planned across the U.S., said Mark Mills, executive director of the Washington-based National Center for Energy Analytics. And construction permit applications show they will require an additional 60 gigawatts of power generation capacity between now and 2030, with that number expected to double.

To put that into perspective, New York City requires about 40 gigawatts of power, according to the city’s long-term energy plan.

In a recent article in City Journal, Mills cited an IEA study that suggests a single large data center can use as much electricity as two million households.

“Lighting up digital infrastructure soon will entail demand equivalent to reliably powering hundreds of millions of new households,” Mills wrote in June.

So, it is no surprise that Hamm Institute Executive Director Bluntzer Pullin is leading a national call to action through its American Energy + AI Initiative. She hopes to underscore emerging priorities and highlight the speed and scale that will be required to keep U.S. power production capacity on pace with the rapid advance of AI energy demands.

While it may be encouraging to know conversations are underway in the Oil Patch and in Washington, the only certainty experts at the Hamm Institute and elsewhere seem to land on is that a solution to a potential energy shortage is fraught with barriers. Skilled labor shortages, regulatory obstacles, and technological limitations are just a few of the problems.

For example, natural gas seems to be the obvious solution. It is plentiful and easily accessible in the U.S. So, why not just crank up gas production and build more power plants?

It’s not that simple, according to Takajiro Ishikawa, the chief executive officer of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan, one of the few companies that manufacture the giant turbans used in natural gas-fired power plants.

While the U.S. may have the fuel, Ishikawa says a major U.S. buildout of gas power plants could stretch his industry beyond its current capacity. And manufacturers are not likely to invest in additional capacity to meet a demand surge that may not last. Besides, Ishikawa does not believe the U.S. has a large enough skilled labor force to build the number of plants necessary to bridge the gap.

The nuclear option

Policymakers are also looking to nuclear power as a solution, and long-time nuclear scientist Christo Liebenberg is seizing the moment he’s been waiting for his entire career. He is president of LIS Technologies, based near Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Tennessee, and his company is a candidate to win hundreds of millions in research funding to bring his company’s uranium enrichment technology to industrial scale.

Despite projections that global demand for enriched uranium will rise by 500% by 2030, the U.S. still lacks commercial-scale enrichment capabilities, Liebenberg said from his office in Oak Ridge. As a result, the U.S. continues to import around 20% of its nuclear fuel from Russia – even in the midst of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

To address the vulnerability, the U.S. Department of Energy has committed $3.4 billion to rebuild the country’s domestic uranium supply chain by selected six companies for its program, including LIS Technologies.

Liebenberg says he’s confident his company can scale its patented laser-based uranium enrichment technology, and he knows it will help restore America’s nuclear fuel independence. But he’s not so sure the nation can build enough nuclear reactors to meet the government’s target.

The Trump administration wants to quadruple the nation’s nuclear power generation capacity from 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts within 25 years, Liebenberg said.

“That’s a big goal,” he says. “There’s a mixture of technologies that have to come together. That’s the only way to quadruple nuclear power. You’re going to have to dramatically increase the number of light water reactors in this country. There are 94 of them.”

It takes about seven years just to build one, so under the current process, it could take 1,800 years to build 400 light water reactors in the U.S., Liebenberg said.

“We don’t have that much time,” he said. “We only have 25 years, so the only solution is to ramp up production rapidly but also bring online the next generation of reactors to supplement the light water big reactors.”

“We’ll need a mixture of big light water reactors plus all the small modular reactors and then bring online thousands of modular micro reactors. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to quadruple nuclear power by 2050.”

Some people say that’s impossible, Liebenberg said.

“But my mindset is ‘Let’s make it happen.’ It’s been my slogan all my life. We just have to do our humble part in producing as much nuclear fuel as we can so we can fuel all those reactors.”

The Hamm Institute’s Bluntzer Pullin said AI is on a scale that the world has never seen before, and it will require all viable sources of energy.

“This is critical to the future of our nation, and we have to move quickly. Through our American Energy + AI Initiative, we’re pulling industry, government, and technology leaders to the same table to cut through red tape and move projects forward,” she said.

“America isn’t short on energy, pioneers or innovators. We will have the energy, we just need the systems to deliver it,” she said. “If America doubles down on firm energy and builds the infrastructure to match, we can power this wave of innovation and lead the race for AI without sacrificing energy security.”",https://journalrecord.com/files/2025/09/09-26-AIracePage-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 15:01:28.372863

In the absence of federal cleanup standards for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) in groundwater, several states have started the process of regulating PFAS in groundwater themselves. As a result, states have adopted a patchwork of regulations and guidance standards that present significant compliance challenges to impacted industries. This client alert explores the current landscape of state regulations regarding the advisory, notification, and cleanup levels for PFAS – typically perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (“PFOS”) and perfluorooctanoic acid (”PFOA”) – in groundwater.

FEDERAL REGULATIONS

In 2019, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued interim recommendations to address groundwater contaminated with PFOA and PFOS, but that guidance was subsequently rescinded. Although EPA concluded that the interim recommendation “no longer reflects the best, currently available science,” the fact sheet discussing the 2019 interim recommendations is still a helpful resource to understand how EPA was evaluating the issue at that time.

With respect to PFAS substances in drinking water, in May 2025, EPA affirmed Maximum Contaminant Levels (“MCLs”) of 4 parts per trillion (“ppt”) for two PFAS substances, PFOA and PFOS. For additional information regarding the drinking water standards, refer to BCLP’s recent insight. As of the date of publication, it is unclear how the PFAS drinking water standards will influence any federal PFAS groundwater standards.

STATE REGULATIONS

The snapshot provided below is current as of September 12, 2025, but it is important to note that this is a developing regulatory space. Some states, such as Florida, have indicated that they will revise groundwater regulations for various PFAS substances that may take effect soon. Other states, such as Arizona, have proposed bills addressing groundwater remediation; other states, such as Illinois, have enacted bills requiring the creation of MCLs in the future.

Businesses should consider whether they currently use or discharge any PFAS compounds that may reach groundwater and evaluate if any state regulations apply, particularly if they operate in any of the jurisdictions listed below. In addition, owners of property with legacy PFAS use, and prospective purchasers of commercial and industrial properties, should review the most current groundwater quality standards as part of the due diligence process for real property transactions.

The information provided below is solely focused on groundwater regulations and does not discuss drinking water regulations, sampling protocols, or the testing requirements for Public Water Systems in various states.

NOTIFICATION

A corporate representative must inform the appropriate state official that the groundwater is above the stated limit.

ADVISORY

These levels are not binding limits, but they can serve as the basis for regulatory action, and are a useful tool for due diligence and risk assessment.

CLEAN UP

Investigation and remediation is usually required when concentration levels exceed the clean up threshold. This is usually expressed by groundwater quality standards that identify specific clean up criteria.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

One of the most striking features of the regulatory landscape for PFAS in groundwater is the wide range of regulatory concentration levels. For example, for PFAS substances in groundwater, one of the most stringent concentration limits is 0.000014 ppt (Iowa; PFDA only), and one of the most lenient concentration limits is 870,000 ppt (California; PFHpA only). The following chart demonstrates that even for PFOA and PFOS, which have been more extensively studied and regulated than other PFAS compounds, there is still a wide discrepancy in the values that different states have adopted.

CONCLUSION

Businesses operating in the states where groundwater regulations have already been enacted should consider whether they currently use or discharge any of the regulated PFAS compounds. In addition, owners of property with legacy PFAS use, and prospective purchasers of commercial and industrial properties in these jurisdictions will increasingly need to incorporate the groundwater quality standards into their due diligence processes.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15569_1953.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 15:02:17.258041

The Solar Industry’s Continued Growth in the U.S. Current statistics show the solar industry weathering changes fairly well.
Sun, open land, expedited permitting, and rapidly rising load demand from industrial growth and data centers create the combined conditions to push solar projects forward even without relying on government subsidies.
Investment in battery storage production and technology is one of the main reasons solar has continued to grow.
If the solar industry was mostly propped up by federal subsidies, a rapid federal pullback would show up quickly in shrinking annual additions and numerous cancelled projects.","President Trump has repeatedly criticized solar and wind, most recently in at the U.N. General Assembly, calling them “a joke” and the “scam of the century.” Congressional Republicans passed the One Big, Beautiful Bill, which put the brakes on federal clean energy subsidies by terminating investment and production tax credits for wind and solar projects not in service by the end of 2027, with a “beginning of construction” deadline of July 4, 2026.

A lack of federal support, and in some cases, politically motivated hostility, has caused many to declare that renewables as a source of energy in the United States are on the decline, and China’s rise as the driving force in the green energy space.

However, the U.S. situation is not as bleak as some might suggest. One might expect a decline in an industry that has recently lost significant federal support, but so far, the opposite has been happening. The Energy Information Administration reports that about 33 of the roughly 64 gigawatts of new U.S. electric generating capacity planned for 2025 will be solar. Also of interest are U.S.-based firms working on potentially higher-efficiency, lower-cost technologies. While “picking winners” among these could prove disappointing, one or two successful technological disruptions could transform the U.S. position in this competitive arena. Far from a sector on life support, the solar industry is growing, but it will need to adapt to the new political and economic environment if it is to continue making progress. Without extensive subsidization, only the strongest will survive.

The Solar Industry’s Continued Growth in the U.S.

Current statistics show the solar industry weathering changes fairly well. In 2024, developers added about 30 gigawatts of utility-scale solar, making up roughly 61% of total capacity additions. In 2025, that share is expected to drop to around 50 percent, but the total amount will increase to approximately 33 gigawatts.

A recent report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory indicates that the majority of proposed electric power plants in the U.S. in the queue to undergo impact studies prior to construction are solar (1,086 GW out of the 1,480 GW of combined renewable, nuclear, and hydropower generating capacity seeking transmission access). Though it may be out of favor in Washington, this makes solar a primary candidate to address rising electricity demand in the near term.

The Texas energy market explains much of this resilience. Sunny Texas has become the country’s solar leader, having already surpassed California in large-scale capacity in 2024. The Lone Star State is now expected to add about 9.7 gigawatts more in the second half of 2025 alone. Sun, open land, expedited permitting, and rapidly rising load demand from industrial growth and data centers create the combined conditions to push solar projects forward even without relying on government subsidies. That mix makes projects less risky to finance and build, which is part of the reason Texas continues to lead the nation in new solar capacity.

The Solar Industry Must Be Prepared to Meet Challenges

The actual test of solar’s resilience will come in the next year, as OBBB provisions heavily impact the qualifications for solar and wind tax credits, requiring projects to start construction by July 5th, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027. These changes reflect a significant tightening of timelines that may not be able to accommodate all comers. An FTI Consulting report notes that 11% of solar and wind projects expected to go online between 2026 and 2029 will be impacted by these measures, increasing to 43% of projects between 2030 and 2034. Leaders in the industry like Enphase and NextEra are already weathering impacts from these measures but are looking to adapt.

Corporate demand and private investment in solar are also quietly driving its continued growth. Data centers and large commercial buyers are locking in long-duration power purchase agreements that value predictable delivery. The Clean Investment Monitor reported that U.S. clean energy investment reached $67.3 billion in Q1 2025, a nearly 7% increase over the same period in 2024, but also a 3.8% decrease from the previous quarter. It is too early to judge the full impact of reduced federal support. However, one reason momentum is holding is simple: utility-scale solar remains among the cheapest new sources of electricity in the United States.

Investment in battery storage production and technology is one of the main reasons solar has continued to grow. Battery storage is a force multiplier for the industry, enabling solar to make daytime generation more valuable by allowing output to continue into the evening. Developers are increasingly pairing storage with new solar projects so that they can deliver firm blocks of power that fit buyer schedules. That flexibility converts more solar output into higher-value electricity and provides financiers with clearer revenue streams. Although battery storage is expected to increase under the OBBB, this may not be enough to offset reduced investor confidence in solar energy, especially since energy sources like nuclear energy and natural gas can reliably generate power throughout the entire day. While it is impossible to predict the relative per-MW costs of solar plus battery storage projects versus nuclear and gas with 100% accuracy in this rapidly changing landscape, Lazard’s 2025 Levelized Cost of Energy+ report, notes, “Renewables Remain Competitive: on an unsubsidized $/MWh basis, renewable energy remains the most cost-competitive form of generation. As such, renewable energy will continue to play a key role in the buildout of new power generation in the U.S. This is particularly true in the current high power demand environment, where renewables stand out as both the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy generation resource.”

The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s April 2025 report, Levelized Costs of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2025, draws similar conclusions, “Solar PV LCOE is lower than natural gas combined-cycle LCOE on average and, in most regions, even without the tax recredit.”

Caveat – at this stage, it is not possible to completely factor in what may prove to be the chilling effect of withdrawing government subsidization through tax breaks will have to access to capital for solar projects, especially in certain regions of the country that lack the advantage of near-daily extensive solar exposure.

Potential Technological Disruptors in the Works?

All of the above projections are based on the current technologies dominating the renewables. While an exhaustive survey of what tomorrow could potentially bring would be beyond the scope of this brief report, it is worth noting that there are U.S.-based firms working to bring potentially disruptive technologies to the field. A few of these include Form Energy (working on longer-term battery storage with next-gen iron-air battery systems); Ambri (a Massachusetts Institute of Technology spinout that recently emerged from Chapter 11 and is driving forward its long-duration next-gen Liquid Metal™ Battery Cells, for which it just achieved UL 1973 safety certification); Swift Solar (developing perovskite tandem solar tech – perovskite is still only a tiny slice of the solar energy market, but that may change as the field continues to develop and alternatives to the current dominance of silicon-based technology come on line).

If the solar industry was mostly propped up by federal subsidies, a rapid federal pullback would show up quickly in shrinking annual additions and numerous cancelled projects. Instead, the near-term data point to a potential maturing of the industry, where weak links shake out but more efficient and flexible enterprises and projects that can offer what the market really needs at competitive prices, survive and even thrive.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d569c95012726d8fbbafdf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-25 14:02:15.196133

Tesla’s Cost-Per-Mile Dominance Emerges The impending removal of U.S. EV tax credits, anticipated under shifting policy priorities, could exacerbate this divide.
Without subsidies, legacy automakers’ EVs become even less competitive on price, while Tesla’s vertically integrated model allows profitability at lower margins.
A 2025 article in The Autopian even dubbed Tesla the new “legacy” automaker for its established EV dominance, inverting the traditional narrative.
As Mesbahi puts it, “the train is off the tracks”—but for legacy auto, not the EV revolution.","As the automotive industry grapples with a pivotal transition, legacy carmakers are increasingly retreating from ambitious electric vehicle (EV) plans, a move that underscores deep-seated challenges in adapting to a battery-powered future. Recent announcements from companies like Porsche and Bentley, part of the Volkswagen Group, highlight this pullback, with reports indicating a shift toward maintaining internal combustion engine (ICE) lineups amid softening EV demand. According to a post on X by Tesla enthusiast Farzad Mesbahi, known as @farzyness, this retreat is not a sign of EVs’ failure but rather legacy auto’s inability to profitably compete in the space.

This narrative shift comes as no surprise to industry observers. For years, the promise of fierce competition against Tesla Inc. dominated headlines, yet many traditional manufacturers have struggled with high production costs, supply chain disruptions, and consumer hesitancy. A 2023 article in CleanTechnica detailed how legacy automakers face “angst over EVs” due to factors like outdated manufacturing processes and reluctance to fully commit to electrification, leading to delays in model launches and scaled-back investments.

The Mirage of Competition and Its Unraveling

Far from validating skeptics who claim EVs are a bust, this withdrawal hands Tesla a significant edge, particularly in autonomy and operational efficiency. Mesbahi’s analysis points out that by clinging to ICE vehicles, legacy players are effectively forfeiting the race in self-driving technology. Electric drivetrains offer inherent advantages for autonomous systems, such as instant torque for precise maneuvers, lower idling costs, and reduced maintenance—qualities that ICE engines simply can’t match without complex adaptations.

Supporting this view, a Reuters report from June 2025 warns that Chinese EV giants like BYD are surging ahead in self-driving capabilities, threatening Tesla’s lead globally, but in the U.S., Tesla’s focus on software like Full Self-Driving (FSD) remains unmatched. Business Insider echoed this in a 2020 piece, noting Tesla’s software prowess gives it “years ahead” of competitors, a gap that widens as others deprioritize EVs.

Tesla’s Cost-Per-Mile Dominance Emerges

The impending removal of U.S. EV tax credits, anticipated under shifting policy priorities, could exacerbate this divide. Without subsidies, legacy automakers’ EVs become even less competitive on price, while Tesla’s vertically integrated model allows profitability at lower margins. Mesbahi argues that Tesla now boasts the “lowest cost per mile of operation” with superior safety and autonomy, even post-credit era—a claim bolstered by Tesla’s own manufacturing innovations outlined in a 2023 The Driven article, which described plans to halve EV production costs through paradigm-shifting techniques.

Industry data from MDPI’s 2025 study on Tesla’s U.S. market share decline—ironically due to rising competition—still affirms Tesla’s first-mover advantages in battery tech and autonomy. As legacy firms like General Motors pivot to higher-end EVs or delay mass-market models, as noted in a 2024 Autoevolution piece, they leave a vacuum that Tesla and nimble players like Rivian or Hyundai are poised to fill.

Autonomy as the Ultimate Differentiator

At the heart of this dynamic is autonomy’s role in reshaping mobility economics. ICE vehicles, with their mechanical complexities, are ill-suited for the always-on demands of robotaxis or fleet operations. Tesla’s Optimus and Cybercab initiatives, teased in recent earnings calls, leverage EV efficiencies for what could be transformative cost savings. A Teslarati article from 2020 highlighted how Tesla’s battery lead embarrasses legacy auto, a disparity that’s only grown.

Critics may spin this as EVs’ downfall, but insiders see it as legacy auto’s capitulation. Posts on X from users like Mesbahi, including one from July 2024 lamenting legacy’s unwillingness to invest in affordable EVs, reflect a sentiment that Tesla’s path to dominance is clearing. As a 2021 GLG Insights piece pondered whether legacy companies could catch Tesla, the answer increasingly seems no—especially with autonomy tilting the scales.

Implications for the Broader Industry Shift

This retreat risks stranding billions in ICE-related assets, as warned in a 2021 Teslarati analysis of Tesla’s manufacturing edge over “stranded assets” in legacy production. Meanwhile, Tesla’s software updates and data collection from millions of miles driven provide an unassailable moat. A 2025 article in The Autopian even dubbed Tesla the new “legacy” automaker for its established EV dominance, inverting the traditional narrative.

Ultimately, while media may decry EVs’ viability, the reality is a strategic surrender by incumbents unable to innovate profitably. Tesla, unburdened by ICE legacies, stands to capitalize on autonomy’s promise, potentially revolutionizing transportation with unbeatable efficiency and safety. As Mesbahi puts it, “the train is off the tracks”—but for legacy auto, not the EV revolution.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-1a62d60d-5aa8-4f95-8755-edd2a0b49e3d.jpeg,N,,2025-09-25 15:01:14.509277

NYPA will continue to support workforce training initiatives to support New York’s workforce and meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.
This is about more than clean energy it’s about dignity, equity, and making sure every New Yorker has a fair shot at the future we are building together.”","Today, during Climate Week, Governor Kathy Hochul announced $16 million in state funds to support the development of New York’s clean energy workforce. The New York Power Authority (NYPA) approved $12 million in funding to the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) to support workforce training and retraining, and to prepare workers for employment in clean energy careers. Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) awarded $4 million in grant funding to support skills training for green jobs for young New Yorkers.

“As we transition to a clean energy future, it is essential that we equip New Yorkers with the skills and opportunities necessary to thrive in this evolving industry,” Governor Hochul said. “By investing in education and training programs, we are positioning New York’s workforce to lead the way in developing sustainable energy solutions that will spur economic growth and lead us to a cleaner, healthier environment.”

Of the $12 million in funding approved by the NYPA Board of Trustees, $7 million will support the expansion and development of electric vehicle (EV) training programs specializing in maintenance and repair for vehicles and charging stations. The remaining $5 million will be allocated to the NYSDOL Support Services Fund, which strengthens the availability of supportive services for participants enrolled in a clean energy training program, including but not limited to childcare, transportation, student fees and books.

The NYPA funding stems from a commitment in the 2023-24 Enacted State Budget and will largely support the efforts of the New York State Department of Labor through their Office of Just Energy Transition (OJET) to connect workers to opportunities for jobs in the clean energy economy through upskilling and training with a focus on serving those who are traditionally underrepresented, especially within disadvantaged communities.

Last year, the Power Authority allocated $25 million for workforce development funding, demonstrating its strong commitment to building a skilled labor force for New York's clean energy future. NYPA will continue to support workforce training initiatives to support New York’s workforce and meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

NYPA actively engages with each community training organization to ensure skills training is matched with needed positions and participant success through supportive wraparound services. NYPA’s collaboration with the skills-training organizations include input on the classroom and hands-on technology experiences of the enrollees for promoting the requisite clean energy skills and providing guidance on training locations to ensure statewide reach of the awards.

An additional $4 million in grants are available from DEC for Green Jobs for Youth workforce funding programs developed or funded by community-based organizations in or serving environmental justice and disadvantaged communities. The initiative helps prepare youth between the ages of 17-24 for jobs in the green economy through workforce development, skills training, and certification. This grant was last offered in 2017, with approximately $1 million helping train and educate more than 370 participants and 59 youth placed into jobs to date.

Electric vehicle maker Rivian has announced the appointment of Chip Newcom, a multiple IR Impact Award-winner and former head of IR at Equinix, as its new investor relations lead.

The move comes six months after Rivian’s former head of IR Timothy Bei left the company to join battery recycling company Redwood Materials.

Newcom, who served at Equinix for more than 10 years, oversaw an IR team that picked up several IR Impact awards, including the gong for best crisis management at this year’s IR Impact Awards – US and the trophy for best in sector – real estate for four consecutive years.

Announcing his new role on LinkedIn, he writes: ‘After 10 incredible years at Equinix, today is my last day as I leave the company to pursue a new opportunity.

‘As I reflect on the last decade, which included 30+ earnings calls, hundreds of investor meetings, thousands of conversations and 10s of billions of capital raised, there are numerous people to thank. It has been both a privilege and an honor to represent the company’s 13,000+ employees to the capital markets. I am deeply thankful for the personal and professional opportunity to have worked, learned and grown at the company. Now on to the next adventure!’

Rivian’s CFO, Claire McDonough, adds in a post on the same social network: ‘Chip has extensive experience driving IR strategy and communications, building relationships with investors and sell-side analysts and raising significant capital through equity and debt offerings. We are excited to welcome him to Rivian!’

Elsewhere in the US, Todd Friedman has joined NYSE-listed healthcare technology company Claritev as its new head of investor relations.

He joins the company following nearly five years as senior vice president, investor relations at Accolade. Prior to that, Friedman worked in various capacities at Concur Technologies and, following its acquisition by SAP, as chief customer officer for various SAP businesses.

Announcing the move on LinkedIn, Friedman writes: ‘As I enjoyed my summer and considered my next role, two things kept bringing me back to the opportunity I see ahead.

‘First, an engaged and motivated management team. From my first meeting, Travis Dalton, Doug Garis and Jason Wong showed a dedication and palpable energy that motivated me to learn more about what they are building.

‘Second, and most important to my personal mission, is that while our direct buyers are healthcare payors, providers, employers and governments, the ultimate customer and beneficiary remains the healthcare consumer.’

In Durham, North Carolina, organic waste technology and services company 374Water revealed that Jim Siccardi would become its new senior vice president of investor relations.

Prior to joining 374Water, Siccardi was vice president of IR at Nasdaq-listed Energy Recovery and served as director of IR at Occidental Petroleum.

Boston (September 25, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and Co-Chair of the Senate Environmental Justice Caucus, today wrote to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator (EPA) Lee Zeldin in opposition to Zeldin’s decision to allow major polluting facilities—including data centers and associated power generation infrastructure—to start pre-construction activities without securing the air quality permits required under federal law.

The New Source Review (NSR) program was established by Congress as part of the Clean Air Act in 1977, which requires that polluting facilities obtain permits before they are built or expanded. This allows EPA to assess and minimize the harm that these facilities will pose to the health and well-being of the environment and surrounding communities. According to reports, Administrator Zeldin is now deciding whether to follow the permitting requirements on a “case-by-case basis,” despite the lack of public guidance or a notice and comment period, in order to allow more data centers and similar facilities to be built in Americans’ neighborhoods.

Senator Markey writes, “Your decision to undermine key Clean Air Act protections not only flouts the law but openly does so at the expense of public health, especially as communities choke on pollution from the expansion of power generation meant solely to power data centers for AI.”

Senator Markey continues, “Your continued decimation of our environmental laws is a terrible deal for Americans, enabling more pollution and more data centers in our back yards, all so Big Tech can reap bigger profits. Allowing companies to begin construction on facilities that will eventually increase pollution without requiring any permitting intentionally undermines the NSR program and signals to industry that public health and environmental protections are now negotiable in the name of their profits. Facilitating high-emissions infrastructure under the banner of AI development neither relieves the EPA of its legal obligations to enforce environmental safeguards nor justifies the sidelining of public participation, cumulative impact analysis, and pollution control requirements.”

Senator Markey requests answers to the following questions by October 6, 2025:

With respect to the NSR permitting program, what has changed, who approved it, and where is it written? Please produce the guidance and the approval record.

What law or rule lets construction start before air permits are issued? Please produce any legal analysis on which you are relying.

What counts as “pre-construction” under your approach? Please identify what EPA is allowing (and not allowing) before permits are issued.

Which projects have proceeded under this new approach so far? Please identify any projects, including their location, expected emissions, controls, and permit status.

How will the public find out and be heard before ground breaks? Will you post each decision and modeling files and allow a comment period? How does EPA’s adoption of its new approach comply with the Administrative Procedure Act?

If pollution ends up higher than expected—or a project later triggers NSR—what happens? Will you stop operations, require retrofits, and assess penalties?

Senator Markey is an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s “race to the bottom” regulatory approach for AI data centers and a leader in advocating for stronger monitoring and mitigation of environmental and health impacts associated with irresponsible data center buildout.

In July, Senator Markey hosted a roundtable discussion titled The Data Center Next Door: Hidden Costs and Harms of Artificial Intelligence and Cryptomining to highlight the adverse environmental, health, climate, and energy cost impacts of data center proliferation in communities across the United States, and to condemn the deregulatory actions set forth in President Trump’s AI Action Plan.

On the day of his roundtable in July, Senator Markey also released a storybook to spotlight the experiences of American families living with data centers in their backyard.

In February 2024, Senator Markey introduced his Artificial Intelligence (AI) Environmental Impacts Act, legislation that would create standards to measure and report the full range of artificial intelligence’s (AI) environmental impacts.

Griffiths was a featured speaker at the Permian Basin Petroleum Association’s (PBPA) 63rd Annual Meeting in Midland, Texas, held September 17-18.

Meghan joined former Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) Commissioner Lori Cobos (Cobos Strategies, LLC) on a panel titled “Electrifying the Permian Basin.” The discussion focused on the critical transmission and distribution needs shaping the region’s energy future, diving into the challenges—and opportunities—facing the Permian Basin as power demand accelerates alongside continued oil and gas growth.

A central topic was the Permian Basin Reliability Plan, a Texas government‑mandated initiative signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott in 2023 to address surging electricity demand and insufficient transmission infrastructure in the energy‑producing region. Approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), the plan directs ERCOT to develop and implement new and upgraded local transmission lines, as well as extra‑high voltage (EHV) import paths, to support economic growth and ensure reliable power for decades to come.

PBPA’s advocacy played an important role in securing approval of a $15 billion transmission buildout that includes the first 765 kV lines in the state of Texas—among the first in the United States. Former PUC Commissioner Cobos led development of the plan.

The plan’s purpose is clear: meet growing demand, ensure reliability, and support economic growth.

“The Clean Water Act is the most important piece of legislation to protect our lakes.","September 25, 2025 (Augusta, ME) – A new report issued today details how the U.S. House Appropriations Committee’s FY26 budget proposal would put Maine’s clean air and water at risk, limit clean-up of old industrial sites, and halt important scientific research that is essential for safeguarding public health.

The dramatic cuts being proposed to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would also severely scale back funding for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), which relies heavily on federal funding for nearly every aspect of its work, including compliance with the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and hazardous waste laws. In 2024, DEP received $10.69 million in dedicated grants from EPA, amounting to more than 21.5% of its budget and 102 personnel.

The report, entitled “Damaging Maine: The Impacts of Proposed Cuts in the EPA Budget” was released by the Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM), Maine’s leading nonprofit, nonpartisan environmental advocacy organization.

“These proposed cuts represent the most extreme rollback of environmental funding in decades. If enacted, the House’s FY26 budget risks undoing decades of progress and could leave a legacy of environmental harm that would negatively impact Maine’s environment and communities for generations to come,” said Anya Fetcher, NRCM’s Federal Policy Advocate. “The draconian budget proposals have made it abundantly clear that the Trump Administration and its allies in Congress care more about protecting polluters than protecting public health.”

On July 14, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee released its proposed FY26 budget, targeting the EPA for some of the deepest cuts of any domestic agency, cutting its budget by $2.1 billion (23%) from the current levels, and its workforce by 1,274 (23%). In contrast, the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, chaired by Senator Susan Collins, released a draft budget that largely retains the EPA’s role of protecting health and the environment.

“Maine’s lakes – which provide more than $14.3 billion in annual economic value to the state – are at a tipping point,” said Susan Gallo, Executive Director of Maine Lakes. “Invasive species, warming waters, erosion, and algal blooms are all increasingly threatening the quality of our waters and the abundance of wildlife habitat. State spending for lake protection in Maine is already stretched, making EPA funding essential to supporting the work of state agencies and lake associations to keep our waters clean, clear, and blue.”

The Damaging Maine report analyzed the House’s proposed cuts and found that they would put Maine’s clean water at risk, increase air pollution and threaten public health for vulnerable populations, limit the clean-up of contaminated brownfield and superfund sites, stop the EPA’s efforts to protect communities from climate change, and halt important scientific research.

“As a pediatrician, I am most concerned about the long-term consequences of air pollutants on children, who are uniquely vulnerable to their effects,” said Dr. Sydney Sewall, a Board-Certified Pediatrician with a Masters in Public Health. “It takes money to collect and analyze environmental data so that good science can help the agency meet the challenge of balancing public health with industry needs. The proposed cuts, as described in the report being released today, will destroy the EPA’s ability to do its job.”

Among the cuts being proposed:

59% cuts to the EPA’s Superfund program that helps clean up hazardous industrial sites in local communities. Of the 16 hazardous waste sites in Maine, only 6 have been cleaned up.

43% cuts to Clean Air programs that help reduce air pollution, including compliance monitoring and enforcement.

26% cuts to funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund that provides local communities with funds to upgrade wastewater treatment plants and stormwater infrastructure improvements.

Eliminates most of the EPA’s climate programs, including research and monitoring that are widely used by local and state governments.

Deep cuts across EPA’s scientific research on air, water, and chemical risks, including PFAS.

“The Clean Water Act is the most important piece of legislation to protect our lakes. Not only does it provide regulations and guidance, but it provides the means to undo the damage already done to our lakes,” said Lynn Geiger, the Erosion Control Policy Manager at 7 Lakes Alliance. “At 7 Lakes, we use Congressionally directed funding to help real Mainers address erosion or upgrade dying infrastructure to handle the changing climate. This funding has an enormous impact on our community, and we need to protect it.”

If the House’s proposed cuts are adopted, Maine DEP would be forced to scale back work across many key program areas. But the effects will be felt far beyond government agencies. Maine’s lakes and other surface waters will be more polluted; communities with brownfield and Superfund sites may never see them cleaned up; and communities could see higher rates of illness linked to poor air and water quality. Businesses that rely on a clean environment and the latest research – including fisheries, tourism, forestry, and outdoor recreation – would face growing uncertainty and economic risk.

“As the budget debate progresses, we encourage Senator Collins to continue protecting the essential role that the EPA plays in protecting the health and safety of Maine’s people, communities, and environment,” said Fetcher.",https://www.nrcm.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jordan-Pond-Bubbles-Gerard-Monteux.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:02:09.843448

“Our organization’s goal is to accelerate new business growth in the community,” Executive Director Diane Walter said. “We help shorten the time between having a great business idea to actually hanging the ‘We’re Open’ sign on your front door. Navigating that entire process can be daunting and we’re here to help.”

Facade grants are available to qualifying businesses for up to $5,000.

“We have several more facade improvements in the works for various businesses, and it’s exciting to see how each one elevates the overall look and feel of the entire business district,” Walter said.

Homestead native Gregory Harris and his girlfriend, Hannah Kemp, both avid coffee drinkers, opened Arabica Robusta Coffee House last week in the former Steel Valley Roaster’s space located at 207 E. Eighth Ave.

The Homestead Blend is the star there, featuring a curated Arabica custom blend.

“We worked with a local roaster, Commonplace Coffee, to perfect our blend and create something that represented us. This blend provides a smoothness with fruity and citrus undertones and is truly one of a kind. We’re very proud of it,” Kemp said.

The full-service coffee cafe serves desserts, breakfast and lunch sandwiches, pastries, croissants, wraps and all the usual specialty coffee favorites.

Other evolving or new businesses along Eighth Avenue include the Bank on 8th, which houses an axe-throwing experience; Co-Sign Speakeasy; The Brooke (event space and bar); and Secretos de mis Abuelos, which serves authentic Puerto Rican fare.

Other establishments include Los Gallitos Taqueria, Rogue BBQ, Golden Age Beer, Mexican grocer La Veracruzana, Hops Brews & Sunshine and The Glitterbox Theater, housed in an old automotive repair space.

“No other community in the area boasts our unique combination of access, amenities and affordability,” Walter said.

Creative uses of space in the Steel Valley include Bowtie High luxury apartments inside a former high school and transforming the historic Schwab Industrial building into high-end apartments.

“Like the buildings themselves, Eighth Avenue and the Steel Valley are being reimagined into vibrant, creative spaces. There’s an entrepreneurial spirit and a very strong sense of community and history. Things are happening here,” Walter said.

Co-working space offers parenting work perks

Busy mom, professional wedding planner and entrepreneur Jade Granda of Overbrook is used to working with her toddler in tow.

“For the first two years of my son’s life, I was a stay-at-home working mom and he was my sidekick. I had very minimal help and it was hard,” Granda said.

Granda, formerly of Freeport, opened Joyful Commons on Sept. 2.

It’s a family-friendly co-working space for parents looking to work alongside their children.

Memberships include access to the supervised play space, a co-working area during the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays.

Work perks include Wi-Fi, a kitchenette, free coffee, a private nursing area, bassinets and private restrooms.

Monthly membership prices for infants under 1 year old range from a day pass ($30), monthly partial passes ($149) or an unlimited monthly passes ($299).

Rates are a bit higher for parents of children over the age of 12 months.

Joyful Commons isn’t a day care as parents must remain on-site.

“We’re here to support your workday, not replace you,” Granda said. “So you can focus knowing your little one is close and cared for.”

Youngsters are able to play nearby in the same area under the watchful eye of a licensed staff member on-site.

The parents are responsible for tending to any of the children’s personal needs such as trips to the bathroom, eating or diaper changes.

“It’s classified as supervised play because the parents are co-working in the same room,” Granda said. “I knew there were more people like me so it’s what I can do to help and I felt called to do.”

The maximum number of children permitted is eight.

Granda chose an Eighth Avenue location for several reasons.

“I think the building is just beautiful. It was an old hotel, and Joyful Commons is located in what was once the lobby,” said Granda, who signed a two-year lease.

She compared the uptick in new businesses coming to Homestead to how Lawrenceville went from a once floundering area to thriving.

“I think it has a lot of potential and charm,” said Granda of Eighth Avenue. “The locals talk about how there’s hope that this street will turn into the next Lawrenceville.”

Joyful Commons serves another business purpose: It converts to a venue space during the weekends, offering sit-down event space for 40 guests or ceremony-only options for up to 55 people.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/09/8887647_web1_ptr-homestead-092425-5.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 14:02:51.352693

At its core, National Public Lands Day is centered around enjoying our unspoiled outdoor spaces.

Public lands are vast playgrounds for countless recreational activities. Whereas adventurers may prefer to hike, rock climb or mountain bike along winding trails, water enthusiasts will likely find their fun by kayaking or fishing on serene lakes and rivers. Those who prefer a more relaxed pace can capture the beauty of America’s diverse ecosystems by bird watching, wildlife viewing or engaging in nature photography.

Public lands are meant to be enjoyed, so enjoy them all year long! Whether it’s a quiet walk in a local park or a multi-day backpacking trip in a national forest, public lands uniquely cater to every interest.

2. Volunteer

National Public Lands Day connects volunteers to service projects that restore and protect our parks. In the last decade, one million volunteers have contributed five million volunteer-hours and performed $133 million worth of work on this annual day of service.

If you’re unable to volunteer on Sept. 27, know that volunteer opportunities at our parks abound all year long. From cleaning up beaches to planting pollinator-friendly gardens, the ways to get involved are limitless. Just head to volunteer.gov for a list of volunteer opportunities at parks and public lands near you.

3. Learn

On National Public Lands Day, planned events teach participants about the plants, animals, ecosystems and history that make our public lands special.

But the learning doesn’t start and end on Sept. 27, as our parks are great classrooms year-round. Join a bird walk at Big South Fork National River & Recreation Area in Tennessee or take part in a guided hike around Taggert Lake in the Grand Tetons.

Wherever your interests lie, the National Parks Service has educational programs for everyone … for now. While staffing cuts and potential funding changes may put future programs in jeopardy, you can find already-scheduled events near you via the National Parks Service website.

4. Be a good steward.

Whenever you go, remember to be a good steward.

The National Parks Service recommends that you familiarize yourself with the seven principles of the “Leave No Trace” philosophy, which aims to protect the natural world from human interference. Remember to dispose of your waste properly and refrain from taking home any feathers, rocks, or other treasures you find. Always respect any wildlife you encounter and, if you’re making a campfire, do so with proper safety precautions.

It’s just as important to minimize our impacts on local neighborhood trails as it is on our favorite national parks. When we leave nature as unchanged as possible, we do our part to preserve our outdoor spaces for future generations.

5. Add your voice to protect our public lands.

America’s public lands are places where people are free to hunt, climb and hike. They are also places where animals can flourish. But our public lands are facing challenges.

We have seen proposals to sell off millions of acres of public lands and to open up protected areas for logging, mining and drilling. Thousands of federal public lands staff have left or been fired; worse, there isn’t adequate funding to maintain our lands for the future.",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/national-public-lands-day-2013-9473639412-b1a82d-1024.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:02:14.258081

Recent EPA actions might signal how the agency plans to apply the Trump administration’s guidelines for scientific evidence.
Under the new proposal, the EPA would revert to the 2017 approach of making separate risk evaluations for each use of a chemical.
This method allows the “EPA to exercise reasonable discretion in scoping a risk evaluation to ensure timely and efficient completion of risk evaluations,” the proposal says.
Industry and environmental advocates alike have criticized the agency for years for taking too long to do chemical risk evaluations.","The US Environmental Protection Agency released a proposal Monday to undo three major changes to the country’s primary chemical law, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), that were made under the Joe Biden administration. The EPA wants to define what the “weight of scientific evidence” means, shift to a faster but less thorough review of new chemicals, and assume that workers handling chemicals will use personal protective equipment.

EPA head Lee Zeldin announced in March that the agency will revisit how it conducts risk evaluations under TSCA, a set of regulations that authorizes the EPA to screen and govern the use of chemicals produced in or imported into the US.

The act was passed by the US Congress in 1976 to identify and mitigate chemical risks to human health and the environment before substances enter commerce. It applies to a range of manufacturers and importers of chemical substances, including petroleum refiners, chemical manufacturers, plastic pipe and pipe-fitting producers, and tire manufacturers.

The changes outlined in the EPA’s proposal would apply to future chemical evaluations as well as those that are in progress. The agency finalized rules last year for 5 of the first 10 high-priority commercial chemicals subject to risk evaluation under amendments made to TSCA in 2016. All five rules are now tied up in various federal appeals courts.

As has often been the case with changes to TSCA, reactions to the EPA’s proposal have been mixed.

The chemical industry should be pleased, says Lynn Bergeson, managing partner at the law firm Bergeson and Campbell. “There are no big surprises,” she says. “Many of us expected the new administration to revise the three big issues that many took umbrage with under the [Biden-era] 2024 rules.”

But environmental advocacy groups are raising objections. “This proposal is part of a broader effort to strip away the safeguards that keep cancer-causing and brain-harming chemicals out of our homes, schools, and workplaces,” Betsy Southerland, former director of the Office of Science and Technology in the EPA’s Office of Water, says in a statement for the Environmental Protection Network, an advocacy group. “Families deserve an EPA that protects their health—not one that bends to industry pressure and leaves communities unprotected.”

One Biden-era change to TSCA was to remove the definitions of “best available science” and “weight of scientific evidence.” In the 2023 proposal for those changes (PDF), the EPA says that specifically defining these concepts is unnecessary and “inhibits the Agency’s flexibility to quickly adapt to and implement changing science.” The EPA incorporated what “best available science” meant into other parts of the regulations, and added that the “EPA intends to ensure that its risk evaluations are consistent with Agency guidance and methodologies in applying these terms.”

The current EPA proposal seeks to reinstate the definition of “weight of scientific evidence,” but with language from President Donald J. Trump’s executive order on “Restoring Gold Standard Science.” When it was released, the order was widely criticized by scientists, who said that it gives the administration a way to discount scientific evidence it doesn’t like or agree with.

According to the order, “the weight of scientific evidence” means “an approach to scientific evaluation in which each piece of relevant information is considered based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated with other relevant information to inform the scientific evaluation prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation.” The order also put political appointees in charge of upholding scientific-research standards that critics called theoretically ideal but impossible to meet in practice.

Recent EPA actions might signal how the agency plans to apply the Trump administration’s guidelines for scientific evidence. As justification for its proposal to rescind the endangerment finding, the legal and scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the EPA heavily leaned on a US Department of Energy (DOE) report written by known climate change denialists. Largely panned by the scientific community, the DOE report said evidence that GHG emissions cause harm to human health and the environment was weak. Yet the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine looked at the same data and found that evidence to support the endangerment finding was irrefutable.

Whether the EPA would seek to use a similar approach to undercut TSCA is unclear, Bergeson says. If under this new definition of “weight of scientific evidence,” the agency were to rely on data or evidence that most scientists disagree with, that would be subject to legal challenge, she says. “It might ultimately be an issue the courts would have to sort out.”

One of the most contentious Biden-era changes to TSCA is the implementation of what’s known as whole chemical evaluation, a way of looking at all the possible ways a chemical could cause harm, rather than just harm during its intended use. Under the new proposal, the EPA would revert to the 2017 approach of making separate risk evaluations for each use of a chemical. This method allows the “EPA to exercise reasonable discretion in scoping a risk evaluation to ensure timely and efficient completion of risk evaluations,” the proposal says. Industry and environmental advocates alike have criticized the agency for years for taking too long to do chemical risk evaluations.

Reverting to the 2017 approach would be a significant change, Bergeson says. Under Biden-era rules, one discrete unsafe use condemned a chemical in all its applications, she says. “It was hard to rationalize and explain to stakeholders why they couldn’t use a chemical for a different use” from the one the EPA had deemed unsafe.

But the whole chemical approach has its advocates. “Rather than looking at the full picture of a chemical’s toxic risk, EPA wants to downplay the links these chemicals have to cancer and chronic disease and give the chemical industry a handout at the expense of our health and safety,” Maria Doa, senior director of chemicals policy at the Environmental Defense Fund, says in a statement.

The EPA also aims to undo a Biden administration amendment about personal protective equipment. Older versions of TSCA assumed that workers handling chemicals were using correct protective equipment, and the EPA took this into consideration when evaluating risk. The 2024 amendments removed this assumption, and the current proposal adds it back. Bergeson says the reversal reflects a fair interpretation of Congress’s intent when it wrote the law.

The proposal is open for public comments, which must be submitted by Nov. 7.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/EPA-proposes-chemical-risk-evaluation-changes---182891:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2025-09-25 13:02:24.085856

It requires collaboration across borders, supply chains and industries.

At a time when the world feels fractured and divided, Fortescue is advancing cross- border partnerships to accelerate industrial decarbonisation and build the lowest-cost 24/7 energy system – one that outcompetes and outprices fossil fuels.

Fortescue is building global alliances – linking the Pilbara’s world-leading operational expertise, America’s and Australia’s research and development strength, the UK’s and Europe’s innovation and engineering excellence and anchoring it all with scale and cost-efficient manufacturing capability in China and the US. Together, this creates a powerful multilateral network of commercial cooperation to accelerate decarbonisation and defeat mankind's greatest threat – global warming.

These partnerships – announced in New York during the United Nations General Assembly – will not only enable Fortescue to electrify its Pilbara operations and deliver on its target of Real Zero by 2030, but also catalyse decarbonisation globally.

As part of this partnership-led plan, Fortescue has signed agreements with some of the world’s most advanced green energy innovators: global leader in electric vehicles and in battery manufacturing and development, BYD; solar technology and manufacturing giant, LONGi; construction and mining equipment manufacturer, XCMG; and wind and energy storage leader, Envision Energy.

Fortescue has also finalised the acquisition of Spanish renewable technology company Nabrawind.

These agreements build on Fortescue’s global innovation ecosystem – where European powerhouse Liebherr already plays a pivotal role in decarbonising Fortescue’s mining fleet with the production of T 264 trucks in Virginia in the United States.

They are underpinned by world-leading research and development through Fortescue Zero, which utilises the Colorado Technology Hub in the United States, advanced technology collaborations with CSIRO in Australia, and its R&D centre at Oxford in the United Kingdom, to drive the innovations behind Fortescue’s decarbonisation and future green technologies.

Together, these partnerships and hubs of innovation ensure Fortescue integrates the world’s best technology into its operations and delivers its green energy operations at unmatched scale and cost.

The urgency of Fortescue’s action has been sharpened by new research in Nature which quantifies, for the first time, the contributions of individual companies to increases in the intensity and probability of hundreds of heatwaves across the world between 2000 and 2023.

These findings highlight the growing legal, regulatory, financial and reputational risks that fossil fuel reliant companies face. They reinforce the importance of industry taking action and progressing practical decarbonisation solutions at speed.

“The world once benefited from open trade and cooperation – now it is divided. Fortescue is showing that industry can help glue back that multilateral spirit, not through rhetoric but through practical alliances that prove heavy industry can follow a new path – one where profits rise as emissions fall,” Fortescue Executive Chairman and Founder, Dr Andrew Forrest AO, said.

“China is scaling and manufacturing green technologies at unprecedented speed and our partnerships give Fortescue access to that capability.

“Meanwhile, through Nabrawind in Spain, Liebherr in Germany and the United States, Fortescue Zero in the United Kingdom, and Fortescue operations in the Pilbara in Western Australia, we are building a global R&D and production network.

“This is a truly multilateral collaboration that draws on the best ideas and manufacturing capacity to deliver the lowest cost energy and tackle climate change.

“By joining forces across continents, we are seizing the full extent of the decarbonisation opportunity and rebuilding the cooperation the world needs to address the climate crisis.”

Additional information Fortescue Zero

Fortescue Zero is Fortescue’s engine room of innovation, delivering technology solutions that have underpinned the Company’s progress towards Real Zero.

As Fortescue enters the next phase of decarbonising its operations, Fortescue Zero will develop and integrate new technologies and inventions from around the world, as well as drive smart partnerships.

Green energy solutions

Fortescue is partnering with global leaders to deliver the world’s most efficient and cost-effective solutions for decarbonising energy grids. Individual Heads of Agreements have been signed with three global renewable energy leaders:

BYD – the world’s largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, batteries and energy storage systems, with almost one million employees and having sold more than 4 million new energy vehicles in 2024 – will supply its leading energy storage solutions.

LONGi – one of the world’s largest solar technology companies and a global leader in high-efficiency photovoltaic products – will supply its photovoltaic modules and solar technology, itself the lowest cost form of green energy generation.

Envision – a global leader in wind power and smart energy solutions – will supply its advanced wind turbine and integrated energy solution technologies that combine diverse renewable sources and optimise power availability.

Battery electric trucks

Fortescue will leverage a dual supplier approach to accelerate the decarbonisation of its mining fleet, adding a new partnership with XCMG and building on its existing agreement with Liebherr to deliver the world’s first large-scale deployment of battery electric haul trucks.

XCMG

Fortescue and XCMG have signed an agreement in which XCMG is expected to supply up to half of Fortescue’s future fleet of 300 to 400 zero-emissions 240-tonne haul trucks, with phased deliveries planned from 2028 to 2030.

The deal will strengthen and diversify Fortescue’s supply chain for battery electric trucks. It expands on the contract signed in November 2024 for battery electric ancillary mining equipment – then XCMG’s largest green mining equipment order outside China.

Liebherr

Liebherr, with its manufacturing facilities in the US, is expected to provide at a minimum the other half of the haul truck fleet and electric excavators under an amendment to the partnership announced in September 2024.

While XCMG and Liebherr will make Fortescue’s battery electric trucks and other heavy mining equipment, Fortescue Zero will continue to focus on developing and integrating advanced power systems for Fortescue’s fleet – including optimisation of battery electric truck performance in Pilbara conditions.

“Technology is driving Fortescue to a more profitable Real Zero future,” Dr Forrest said. “We will prove that profits go up when emissions go down.”

Acquisition unlocks next-generation wind technology

Fortescue is accelerating the deployment of renewable energy across its operations by combining full ownership of Spanish wind technology company Nabrawind with the purchase of wind turbines from Envision Energy.

Together, these advances will underpin the first stage of Fortescue’s inaugural wind project, unlocking greater generation capacity and efficiency to help deliver Real Zero by 2030.

Nabrawind

Fortescue has acquired 100 per cent of Nabrawind, consolidating its previous minority stake to take full ownership.

The acquisition positions Fortescue to deliver large-scale wind projects in the Pilbara, leveraging Nabrawind’s innovative self-lifting tower design that allows turbines to be installed at greater heights, capturing stronger winds and generating more power.

Envision

Envision Energy will supply its state-of-the-art EN182-7.8MW turbines for the first stage of Fortescue’s Pilbara wind project.

These turbines are engineered to perform in low-wind conditions and withstand extreme weather, including cyclones. They will be integrated with Nabrawind’s 188- metre tower technology and provide improved generation and cost efficiency.",https://vault.fortescue.com/api/public/content/da653f72745e4a86aa70bb52705b9779?v=9c7e7a57,N,,2025-09-25 17:02:25.395358

This article is part of a series highlighting the impact of CDFIs and how the sector is adapting to the current environment.

Walk down any main street in Michigan and you’ll find businesses — like Terri’s Cakes in Detroit or Four Leaf Brewing in Clare — that might not exist without the support of community development financial institutions (CDFIs). Created through bipartisan legislation 30 years ago, CDFIs were designed to serve communities overlooked by traditional banks. Today, more than 1,400 CDFIs nationwide — and 55 here in Michigan — provide affordable financing to small businesses, first-time homebuyers and community projects that keep neighborhoods vibrant.

CDFIs have long relied on federal partners such as the U.S. Treasury’s CDFI Fund, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), alongside philanthropic, bank and corporate investors. These federal investments remain critical, but with federal funding facing uncertainty, we can’t depend on Washington alone to meet the growing needs of the communities we serve. The survival and success of CDFIs depends on expanding support at the state and local levels.

Michigan’s model shows what’s possible

In Michigan, we’ve begun to chart this path. Two CDFI coalitions — the Michigan CDFI Coalition and the Detroit CDFI Coalition — have worked with legislators to establish the Michigan CDFI Fund, which has already awarded $89 million in grants to strengthen lending capacity, operations and technical assistance. That fund is just the beginning. Together with state and local partners, we are exploring creative ways to close capital gaps and respond to urgent needs, such as:

A statewide CDFI loan fund combining public, philanthropic and private capital.

A Community Redevelopment Tax Credit to revitalize business corridors.

A small business interest buydown and collateral fund to expand entrepreneurship.

Detroit offers additional proof that local collaboration works. Partnerships between the city, philanthropy and CDFIs have fueled programs like the Strategic Neighborhood Fund, Motor City Contractor Fund and the 0% Interest Home Repair Program — initiatives that blend resources and expertise help stabilize housing and support small contractor businesses.

As CDFIs continue to play an important role in our communities and their economic success, it’s vital that we work together to not only sustain our organizations but grow our capacity. Michigan’s experience shows what’s possible when CDFIs work hand-in-hand with state and local leaders, and partners in our sector can adapt similar approaches by:

Partnering with local and state governments to seed new capital programs

Adjusting policy so existing programs are accessible to CDFIs

Engaging non-traditional partners — such as hospitals and anchor institutions — whose missions align with community development

Leveraging limited public and foundation dollars to unlock larger, blended finance programs

National networks of state coalitions have begun forming to share strategies, provide advocacy training and exchange policy insights. Our partners in Michigan are already learning from peers in Pennsylvania, Virginia, California, New York and beyond. Together, we hope to scale local innovations into a more resilient national CDFI system.

Building resilience for the future

In this moment of dramatically shifting policy landscapes and volatile financial markets, CDFIs must diversify funding sources and innovate beyond “business as usual.” By building stronger partnerships at every level and cultivating a broader set of funding streams — from municipal programs to statewide coalitions — we can reduce our vulnerability to federal funding uncertainty and build more durable institutions.

Small businesses are the engine of our economy, and CDFIs help keep that engine running. By acting locally and creatively, we can ensure these institutions remain strong for our neighborhoods and cities to thrive.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/SipNRead-800.png,N,,2025-09-25 13:02:32.242774

Several utilities are exploring partnerships with nuclear fusion startups that promise to deploy the cutting edge technology at commercial scale – a feat that has eluded scientists for decades.

Recent technical breakthroughs at government labs around the world have moved this milestone closer, but industry and experts are divided over how close.

“We’re seeing these companies get a little more serious about their siting and deployment plans, no longer just making vague promises about getting fusion onto the grid ‘in a few years,’” said Patrick White, group lead for fusion safety and regulation with Clean Air Task Force.

Inside a nuclear fusion reactor, lightweight atoms smash together under incredible heat. The energy they release drives a power conversion system similar to those found in existing thermal power plants’ generator rooms. Electricity comes out the other side. The process is energy-dense: A ton of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, one possible fusion fuel, contains the energy equivalent of 29 billion tons of coal.

Commercial fusion power still exists only in theory because sustaining an earthbound atom-smashing reaction at temperatures hotter than the sun’s core is a formidable technical challenge. For years, scientists warnedthat commercial fusion power was always 50 years off.

Utilities strike fusion partnerships following breakthroughs

Now, they’re not so sure.

In late 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said it had achieved a vital breakthrough. For the first time, scientists there had created and briefly sustained a fusion reaction that generated more energy than it consumed – a threshold called “net energy gain” or “Q>1.”

The lasers that sparked the reaction consumed about 90 kW of electricity over a span measured in nanoseconds, said Patrick Poole, an LLNL research physicist involved in the breakthrough.

Earlier this year, fusion facilities in China and France sustained reactions for longer than 15 minutes, far longer than the LLNL experiment. CEA, the French fusion facility, said in February that durations of several hours were within its reach.

But it also said that fusion technology is “unlikely” to make a significant contribution to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, citing massive infrastructure requirements and “several technological sticking points [that] need to be overcome.”

The 500-MW International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the Western Hemisphere’s flagship government-led fusion project under construction in the south of France, is nearly a decade behind schedule and billions of euros over budget.

Most U.S. utilities and private fusion companies agree that significant technical challenges remain to be solved for commercial fusion power to become reality. But they believe that could happen within 10 to 15 years — and maybe sooner.

With backing from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, fusion startup Helion began work in July on a 50-MW Washington State fusion plant it says will power up in 2028.

“Our confidence lies in the fact that we have built seven prototypes that have done fusion,” said Anthony Pancotti, Helion’s co-founder and head of R&D, in an email. “With construction having begun on the site of our first fusion power plant in Malaga [Washington], we’re on track to meet our commitment to Microsoft to put electrons from fusion on the grid by 2028.”

Another startup, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, aims to activate its Massachusetts test reactor a year earlier, in 2027, then partner with Dominion Energy to deploy a 400-MW commercial plant in Virginia in the early 2030s, it says. The company is building a donut-shaped tokamak reactor, similar to the design under development at ITER.

“It is easy to overpromise in that space ... We kind of worry that laypeople or the venture capital world will get kind of disheartened if things don’t come up perfect after five years.”

Patrick Poole

research physicist at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

The 400-MW power plant would likely be “a standard building block that’ll allow for even more modular manufacturing and economies of scale,” Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ Chief Commercial Officer Rick Needham said in an email.

Though smaller than most of the conventional fission reactors operating in the U.S. nuclear fleet today, a 400-MW power plant would be on par with individual units at modern coal or combined-cycle gas power plants. Future utility customers or direct end-users could host multiple plants at a single site as needed, Needham said.

“With respect to eventual prices for power, we feel confident that our future ARC plants can be the lowest cost form of clean, firm power that can be deployed essentially anywhere,” Needham said.

A spokesperson for Dominion Energy declined to elaborate “beyond what we’ve said publicly” on plans for the Virginia plant. It is unclear what if any direct investment the utility has made in the project so far.

Further south, the Tennessee Valley Authority is beefing up its partnership with Type One Energy with the aim of bringing a 350-MW fusion facility online “as early as the mid-2030s.”

A cooperative agreement announced in February builds on an earlier partnership focused on deploying a fusion prototype at TVA’s retired Bull Run coal plant.

The project now “encompasses a deeper, broader engagement toward commercialization of fusion energy,” Type One said in a statement. It includes access to TVA’s Power Service Shops in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, which the companies say will enable supply chain development and modular component manufacturing, as well as “talent and resources” for workforce development from the states of Tennessee and Alabama.

“We are strategically partnering with innovative companies like Type One Energy to advance the development of nuclear technologies,” TVA CEO Bob Moul said in a statement. “I am excited about the possibility of the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion power plant being built in the Tennessee Valley,”

Progress may not be fast enough for investors

White, of the Clean Air Task Force, cautioned that lots of technical work remains to be done before the first commercial fusion plants can come online.

As in the advanced fission industry, every fusion startup puts its own spin on the technology and balances key factors like reactor capacity, efficiency and output flexibility. The divergent approaches suggest successful fusion companies will try to carve out niches for themselves.

“Some technologies are going to scale down easier at lower power outputs, while others will have an economic optimum at a higher output,” White said. “There’s no ‘one size fits all’ fusion machine.”

LLNL’s Poole said in an interview that a viable fusion power plant could still be 15 to 30 years away, depending on manpower, funding and luck. That might not be fast enough for venture capital firms seeking faster returns.

“It is easy to overpromise in that space,” Poole said. “We kind of worry that laypeople or the venture capital world will get kind of disheartened if things don’t come up perfect after five years.”

Even some private-sector fusion leaders think a 10-year timeline is optimistic, let alone Helion’s three-year sprint. They also say competitively priced fusion power will prove elusive even after Q>1 is in the rearview.

“This happens periodically in fusion [power], where there’s a lot of excitement, a feeling like we’re close,” said Greg Piefer, CEO of SHINE Technologies, which uses fusion to produce medical radioisotopes.

“My view is not only do we not know how to handicap success, but we also don’t know how much capital needs to be invested for this to be cost-effective,” Piefer said.

Trouble is already brewing in some corners of the industry.

In May, the CEO of Vancouver-based General Fusion put out an unusual public appeal for fresh funding, hinting that the company might not survive without it. Investors responded to the tune of $22 million, the company said this month — without indicating how much time the infusion would buy.

A new nuclear race

For now, however, the money is still flowing.

Though still a small slice of the $1.2 trillion the wider clean energy industry attracted between 2020 and 2023, the Fusion Industry Association says fusion investment is up fivefold since 2021. Cumulative funding for the 53 fusion startups the FIA tracks neared $10 billion earlier this year.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems is among the best-funded of the bunch, according to publicly available announcements and fundraising data. It has raised more than $2 billion since spinning out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018, giving it capital to finance construction of its SPARC test reactor near its headquarters in Devens, Massachusetts. It expects SPARC to achieve Q>1 in 2027.

That would be a first for commercial fusion power technology, Needham said. It’s a critical milestone as CFS develops the full-size commercial reactor design it calls ARC, he added.

“SPARC is … designed to prove out most of the subsystems necessary for our ARC power plants, develop operational expertise and fine-tune ARC’s design,” Needham said.

When SPARC powers up, it will produce a superheated plasma that fuses hydrogen isotopes into helium and releases energy-rich neutrons. It’s the same basic process that occurs in the sun’s core, albeit at far lower pressure, and a mirror image of the atom-splitting fission reaction powering commercial nuclear reactors today.

Like stars, fusion reactors produce little long-lived radioactive waste, a key advantage over fission and the basis for lighter-touch federal regulation. However, unlike celestial fusion machines, earthbound tokamaks and stellarators can’t rely on gravity to sustain their reactions. Without powerful magnets to contain it, the plasma rapidly dissipates.

This “containment” problem vexed fusion scientists for decades. Now, it appears surmountable thanks to superconducting magnet technology that Needham said will make commercial fusion plants more compact, bankable and cost-effective.

SPARC will validate that magnet technology as CFS continues work on other key subsystems. Those include the molten-salt “blanket” that captures energy from the tokamak and “newer materials and designs to further improve aspects of our power plants like output and capacity factor,” Needham said.

If all goes well, those subsystems will make their commercial debut in ARC, the 400-MW Virginia plant CFS and Dominion plan to codevelop after 2030. Two early investors in CFS, Google and the Italian oil company Eni, will purchase the majority of its output.

Needham characterized the first ARC plant as a blueprint for future fusion facilities. He said it will ramp up operations over time and help CFS validate its operations in a grid-connected environment, paving the way for future 400-MW units to run at capacity factors on par with other firm power sources. The molten salt heat transfer system could eventually support cogeneration or energy storage applications, adding further value, he added.

CFS isn’t the only company that believes it has a clear path to grid-connected fusion power.

Washington-based Helion hopes to beat its East Coast competitor by several years. It’s banking on a novel design, a smaller reactor, an offtake agreement with Microsoft and surplus interconnection capacity at a hydroelectric dam to get its first commercial plant’s power on the grid by 2028.

Helion’s “pulsed, non-ignition fusion system” combines elements of the relatively well-studied tokamak design and other approaches to fusion in a way that “helps us overcome the hardest physics challenges [and] build highly energy-efficient devices,” the company says. Like CFS, Helion’s machine uses magnets to confine plasma.

Pancotti said Helion will generate electricity from the fusion reaction itself, avoiding the need for the steam cycle infrastructure found in traditional nuclear power plants and “[lowering] our overall capital cost requirements.”

The company plans to manufacture much of its equipment and systems at its facility in Everett, Washington, he added.

“We’re at a turning point where we’re going from burning chemical energy as a society to being a nuclear-powered society.”

Greg Piefer

CEO of SHINE Technologies

“Our strategy is to essentially build an assembly line that will allow us to achieve economies of scale for future plants and manufacture critical components in house,” he said.

Helion also plans to operate a closed-loop system that produces the fuel the plant needs, he said. Pool said that’s a fairly common goal of fusion startups.

But Pancotti admitted that Helion “continues to refine our plasma-facing materials … and our magnetic coils, with the goal to extend the lifetime for commercial power output.”

Regardless of their technology or design, hardening reactor materials to withstand intense temperatures and radiation for years on end is a problem that every commercial fusion company will have to address sooner or later, Poole said.

SHINE Technologies stands out among fusion startups for what it calls a “revenue-first approach.” It’s producing and selling commercial radioisotopes in a Wisconsin particle accelerator it opened in 2023. Because it’s concerned only with producing neutrons and not net energy, Piefer said SHINE’s machine is much simpler than power-producing machines designed to confine plasma for long periods of time.

SHINE’s radioisotope business line earns significant revenue, Piefer said, though he declined to say exactly how much. The cash flow could eventually fund a push into nuclear waste recycling and then fusion power, according to a timeline on SHINE’s website.

“We won’t be first to Q>1, but we will be first to economics greater than one,” Piefer quipped — meaning SHINE expects to be profitable long before its competitors. “The worst-case outcome is we’ll be the most experienced builders of fusion facilities in the world and let others commercialize fusion power.”

Piefer, who has a PhD in nuclear engineering, agreed with LLNL’s Poole that it could take up to 30 years for that to happen. But despite his skepticism toward the current batch of startups and their aggressive timelines, even he believes commercial fusion-powered electricity generation is inevitable.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IV08l7pwGQYMDSGSNhS9XMPyKdDoMhbfVnf4WTLJYNI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Db21tb253ZWFsdGhfRnVzaW9uX1N5c3RlbXMuSlBH.webp,N,,2025-09-25 16:01:48.564200

The organization also developed Cleantech Innovation Pathways, a program for entrepreneurs that includes workshops, training, networking, and coaching.
“Our measure of success is how much innovation we can draw to Minnesota and how much we can support a homegrown innovation ecosystem,” says Axelson.
“That science foundation has been so critical not just for Grid Catalyst, but for all the jobs I’ve held since my time at the University.
“That’s going to continue through the type of work done by our partners, our cohorts, and research institutions like the University of Minnesota.”","Although Nina Axelson ’04 hasn’t been in a University of Minnesota Twin Cities classroom for a couple of decades, she’s still doing her homework, using what she learned as an environmental science major to support clean energy efforts that will have a ripple effect across the state and beyond.

Axelson launched clean energy accelerator Grid Catalyst in 2021. The company works with startups and innovators to clear a path to commercialization for their ideas. The organization also developed Cleantech Innovation Pathways, a program for entrepreneurs that includes workshops, training, networking, and coaching.

“Because of the science background I gained in my degree program, I have the type of systems-based thinking needed for these major projects,” says Axelson. “It’s not just the basics of the scientific method, it’s having the language and understanding about how that science can be applied that’s crucial. And that’s what I build on for supporting startups as they move through different stages of development.”

A bright future for clean energy

Earlier this year, Grid Catalyst announced its fifth cohort, a group of nine energy startups that pitched pilot projects to key partners like the University of Minnesota, CenterPoint Energy, 3M, Xcel Energy, Great River Energy, Mortenson, and others.

Three of the startups are based in Minnesota, and include technology that optimizes energy usage, provides environmentally responsible heating and cooling technologies, and develops liquid-immersion cooling systems for high-performance IT equipment. In the 2024 cohort, two of the startups were spinouts from the University of Minnesota.

“Our measure of success is how much innovation we can draw to Minnesota and how much we can support a homegrown innovation ecosystem,” says Axelson. “That means making sure Minnesota-based startups have strong opportunities that draw on the strength of higher education and corporations in the state.”

As she grows Grid Catalyst, Axelson relies on the University of Minnesota as a partner, as well as a source of potential startups: For example, a new summer program will work with about 25 students to train the next generation of STEM innovators, supported by the Carlson School of Management and the Institute on the Environment.

Nature as inspiration

For Axelson, interest in these efforts actually didn’t begin in a classroom. It started with wolves.

After initially studying business and communications at St. Cloud State, she left school to help her father recover from a stroke, then moved to Colorado. While there, she became aware of a conflict over the use of public land, particularly in regards to wolf management issues and ecosystem stability.

“That was when I realized I could take my love for the wilderness and apply it in a more formal degree program,” she says. As a transfer student to the University of Minnesota’s College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, she appreciated being able to blend her interest in environmental science with her interest in policy and advocacy.

“I wanted to know how the science worked before I started to figure out how that could apply to working with people and advancing environmental action,” says Axelson. “The [degree] program was so interesting. It covered a wide variety of science-based fields, and then added insight into politics and business, with a look at how all of that intersected.”

The main advantage of her degree program, though, was the foundational knowledge she still uses daily. “Even 20 years later, I’m referencing quotes from my advisor and utilizing lessons from classes like forest ecology and botany,” Axelson says. “That science foundation has been so critical not just for Grid Catalyst, but for all the jobs I’ve held since my time at the University.

Axelson sees a bright future for a state that has a long history of people coming together to solve big problems, especially science-based challenges.

“That’s going to continue through the type of work done by our partners, our cohorts, and research institutions like the University of Minnesota.”",https://twin-cities.umn.edu/sites/twin-cities.umn.edu/files/nina-axelson.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 18:01:30.712352

“Until this happens, it will be difficult to build a fully vertically integrated sodium-ion manufacturing base in Europe,” he says.
Scrap rates in battery production can be high and they can quickly destroy your business.” Despite these challenges, Phenogy is committed to becoming a fully integrated manufacturer.
In the short term, sodium-ion systems remain more expensive than LFP, but Phenogy sees strategic buyers emerging.","Coming out of stealth, Switzerland’s Phenogy unveiled its first commercial-scale deployment on Wednesday – marking the largest sodium-ion battery installation in Europe to date.

The single-container system, installed at a commercial site near Bremen Airport in northern Germany, delivers 400 kW of power and offers nearly 1 MWh of storage capacity. It is paired with an existing 50 kW solar array and is currently operating in island mode, optimizing on-site energy consumption while powering electric vehicle chargers.

One of the primary challenges in deploying sodium-ion batteries at scale has been inverter compatibility, due to the broader voltage range compared to conventional lithium-ion systems. This made the choice of inverter technology critically important.

Phenogy integrated eight Sunny Island X 50 inverters from SMA into the 20-foot container. These inverters were designed to support applications beyond the widely used lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry. They have an integrated DC-DC converter, allowing greater flexibility in voltage matching. SMA provided pre-production units of the Sunny Island X 50 to the Bremen site, marking one of the first installations of this new product.

Phenogy says its PHENOGY 1.0 system is designed for a broad range of applications – including industrial, commercial, grid, critical infrastructure, and EV charging – though detailed technical specifications have not been released.

Strategic alternative

In recent years, sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a strong contender to lithium-ion technology. While often described as a cheaper and more sustainable alternative, thanks to the abundance of sodium and relatively low extraction costs, the technology still faces several hurdles before reaching mass-market viability.

China is currently leading the way — both in technology development, driven by companies like CATL, BYD, and Huawei, and in deployment, with 100 MW-scale projects and multiple hybrid systems combining sodium-ion with lithium-ion and even grid-forming inverters.

“It would be a strategic mistake to invest in large-scale LFP production in Europe today and still remain dependent on China due to the import of precursors,” says Max Kory, CTO of Phenogy, in an interview with ESS News. “Lithium prices will rise again – with mine closures in China, the market is nearing a breaking point. As prices climb, alternative chemistries become more attractive, and sodium-ion is the prime candidate for building a localized supply chains in Europe and North America.”

While sodium and other key materials are widely available, Kory emphasizes that the critical step is establishing local production of cathode and anode materials, particularly hard carbon – which can be synthesized from agricultural waste like nut shells, cellulose, and banana peels.

“Until this happens, it will be difficult to build a fully vertically integrated sodium-ion manufacturing base in Europe,” he says. “The experiences of Northvolt in Europe and Natron Energy in the US show that it’s hard to do this alone. Scrap rates in battery production can be high and they can quickly destroy your business.”

Despite these challenges, Phenogy is committed to becoming a fully integrated manufacturer.

“For real strategic impact, we need vertical integration,” Kory says. “In the US, we see a much stronger push for supply chain independence. They also experience more frequent blackouts and face growing electricity demand from expanding data center fleets. That’s why we’ve also established operations in South Carolina.”

While mass-market demand for sodium-ion may not there yet, Phenogy is betting on the technology’s intrinsic advantages to gain traction. These include: broader temperature tolerance and decent energy density – “currently still slightly below LFP”, according to Kory.

In the short term, sodium-ion systems remain more expensive than LFP, but Phenogy sees strategic buyers emerging.

“For a growing number of customers, technology choices are strategic decisions, not purely economic,” says Kory. “The product doesn’t need to be cheaper. In a world of volatile raw material prices and rising geopolitical risks, supply chain independence is critical.”

Founded in 2019, Phenogy employs approximately 60 people across Europe and the US. Its partner network include the University of South Carolina in Columbia, the Exentis Group AG, a specialist in industrial additive manufacturing, and several Fraunhofer Institutes.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PHENOGY-BESS-1Punkt0.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 12:08:15.038000

However, there is some debate surrounding the overall environmental footprint of electric vehicles, from the mining of various metallic inputs to end-of-life recycling. In addition, the heavier weight of EVs has raised concerns regarding particle emissions from tires outweighing or partially cancelling out the benefits of zero tailpipe emissions. Finally, market watchers and drivers alike are right to question the environmental credentials of EVs on the road in countries such as India and China, which continue to construct dozens of coal-fired power plants annually.

Materialistically speaking

Rather than debate the merits and demerits of EVs versus their internal combustion engine (ICE) powered brethren, in this article we take a look at how plastics are reducing the environmental burden of road-going vehicles.

One recent announcement highlighted how corn might be a key contributor in the onroad sustainability drive beyond its role as a key input for environmentally friendly bio-ethanol fuel. The boost is coming from US-based polypropylene (PP) newcomer Citroniq, with its biogenic PP facility in Nebraska scheduled to become operational in 2029, bringing onstream 600,000 tonnes/year of low-carbon-footprint capacity and capturing three million metric tons of CO₂ annually and permanently storing it as solid pellets in the process. Two additional plants of similar scale are planned at Falls City, NE.

Durable biopolymers

While bio-based polymers are commonly associated with disposable applications such as packaging and serviceware, the European Commission has expressed a preference for these plastics to function as a means of carbon capture, hence the linking of durable uses such as construction materials and, indeed, automotive. A recent study by consultant IDTechEx forecast 25.4% compound annual growth for bio-based polymers overall, reaching more than 500,000 tonnes in automotive applications by 2035.

Further, Singapore-based consultancy MLT Analytics predicted even before the mega-announcement of Citroniq that bio-based polypropylene would become the dominant bio-based polyolefin, in part, because of its use in durable applications such as automotive. MLT Analytics predicted in 2024 that this application would grow to 360,000 tonnes by 2032.

Sustainability challenges

Besides PP, bio-based polyamides and even biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) compounds are expected to find use in automotive applications. James Kennedy, technology analyst at IDTechEx, cautions that key challenges in adoption include material availability and cost in the case of bio-based polymers and compounds incorporating recycled content and, in some cases, variable material properties for recycled content grades. “The situation varies significantly by polymer and application. For certain components, such as mono-material polypropylene interior components, the challenges of introducing recycled content are more straightforward to overcome,” notes Kennedy. “These are currently the major target for automotive manufacturers and will remain so for the short and medium term.

“However, more specialized components from less widely utilized polymers present greater challenges,” adds Kennedy. “Sustainable alternatives to virgin specialized polymers are harder to source and, in the case of composite materials, present further challenges to end-of-life. These highlight just some of the key challenges the automotive industry faces to integrate sustainable materials.”

Fibers in the scope

Another sustainable option is natural fiber reinforcement. A pioneer in this nascent market is Swiss company BComp, whose natural flax-reinforced ampliTex and powerRibs composites offer a sustainable alternative to carbon-fiber-reinforced components and other composite alternatives. Proven on the racetrack and in concept cars, Bcomp composites have more recently found their way into production vehicles such as the seatbacks of the e Cupra Born VZ electric vehicle and trim for the dashboard and doors of the Volvo EX30. Back in 2018, Volvo was one of the first OEMs to announce a sustainable plastics target for its vehicles.

Sustainability on two wheels

Back on the track, Bcomp’s latest initiaitive is a joint project with leading Japanese composite specialist Tras to bring natural fiber composite solutions to the world of motorcycle racing. Tras has been making the bodywork of Suzuki’s MotoGP bikes for over 20 years, including manufacturing the full body of Suzuki’s winning GSX-RR. Its latest demo machine featured a natural fiber cowl made using Bcomp’s cutting-edge materials.

Now, why limit adoption of sustainable materials to those making their way around on two or four wheels? While largely absent from Western roads, three wheelers are a major mode of transportation in Asia, headed by India. Perhaps this market, which is already starting to transition to electric propulsion, might be the next to get the sustainable plastics treatment.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt08823f5db61ded5d/bltb593141ce6072501/68d412b494c047108c86c218/Sustainable-resins.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-25 12:08:28.968884

Then, way back in 2019, CATL introduced a cell-to-pack architecture, which, by dispensing with modules, allowed a battery pack to be made lighter and smaller.
Now, EV battery manufacturer 24M Technologies has taken the next logical step, apparently dispensing with cells.
Or, designers could replace NMC chemistry with less expensive LFP technology, resulting in a less costly pack with the same range.
“It truly is the closest version of an ideal battery—it is essentially all active material in a sophisticated wrapper.”","We EV veterans remember the old days, when a battery pack was designed according to a strict hierarchy: cell, module, pack. Then, way back in 2019, CATL introduced a cell-to-pack architecture, which, by dispensing with modules, allowed a battery pack to be made lighter and smaller. This technology has since reached its third generation, and we don’t hear much about modules anymore.

Now, EV battery manufacturer 24M Technologies has taken the next logical step, apparently dispensing with cells. 24M’s Electrode-to-Pack (ETOP) technology “seals electrodes in thin polymer films that are then integrated directly into the pack to vastly improve packaging efficiencies.”

“Lithium-ion batteries feature a large proportion of inactive, non-energy-carrying materials—such as supporting metals and plastics—within a cell’s casing, adding cost and wasting space,” 24M explains. “The ETOP architecture replaces this approach by creating a sealed cathode/anode pair that eliminates the cell and module and unnecessary materials. This allows manufacturers to achieve the highest energy density for any chemistry (NMC, LFP, NCA, sodium-ion, LTO, LiS, etc) at the pack level, because a higher percentage of the battery is electrodes, the energy-storing components.”

24M claims that its ETOP tech makes it possible for electrodes to comprise 80% of a pack’s volume, compared to the 30% to 60% of traditional battery packs. EV designers can choose to take advantage of the additional energy density either to increase range by packing more energy into the same size pack, or to reduce vehicle costs by using less expensive chemistries to deliver the same range with a smaller pack.

For example, according to 24M, a 75 kWh NMC battery pack could be increased in capacity to over 100 kWh, increasing range by 33% with no increase in size. Or, designers could replace NMC chemistry with less expensive LFP technology, resulting in a less costly pack with the same range.

24M also describes manufacturing benefits: “Because electrodes are sealed individually, electrode safety tolerances do not have to be as tight as in a traditional battery, improving yield and safety while reducing investment costs by eliminating the need for traditional high-tolerance and precision equipment. Because the sealed electrodes can be flipped, they can be connected in series and parallel arrangements, enabling anything from a compact 48 V battery all the way up to a mixed series/parallel 400-800 V pack, giving battery designers further freedom.”

“24M ETOP makes it easier to build compact, flexible and safe high-voltage batteries, presenting a revolutionary opportunity for EV manufacturers—longer ranges with the same chemistry or the same range with lower cost, safer chemistries, both in the same space,” said Naoki Ota, President and CEO at 24M Technologies. “It truly is the closest version of an ideal battery—it is essentially all active material in a sophisticated wrapper.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETOP-Still_micedSeriesParallel_3840x2160-002.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:01:38.893387

Identifies Intentions for Job Growth to meet New Jersey’s Green Economy Goals

TRENTON – The Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy is continuing to mark Climate Week with the release of the 2025 Green Jobs Report – “Growing Green Jobs: The Opportunities for New Jersey's Workforce.”

Since 2021, New Jersey’s green workforce has increased by 12%, or 6,000 jobs, with over 100 new clean energy projects built. By 2035, New Jersey’s green workforce is expected to grow by over 14,000 net jobs. As the State continues expanding clean energy resources and navigates a dramatically changed federal policy environment, the report assesses the State’s green economy workforce and explores what the future may look like for New Jersey workers.

The report identifies 12 priority occupations necessary to meet New Jersey’s green economy goals, all of which have higher wages than the national average. Electricians are projected to see the largest growth in new jobs, followed by Plumbers, HVAC Mechanics and Installers and Solar Installers.

“As the growth of our green economy adds thousands of family-sustaining jobs in New Jersey, this report will help guide our continued commitment to meeting the demand for workforce development and coordination across our educational institutions, unions, and training providers,” said Governor Phil Murphy.

Training providers and programs exist for all top green occupations in New Jersey, specifically those that require more specialized skill sets. Most priority occupations are also accessible, with 10 out of 12 only requiring a high school diploma or equivalent. The report finds stronger coordination and connections to be beneficial between employers in green industries and the many entities in the New Jersey workforce ecosystem, such as educators, unions, training providers, and community groups.

State agencies have more of a leadership role in this capacity than is seen in other states, particularly the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DOL) and the Economic Development Authority (EDA). According to the report, New Jersey has the opportunity improve access to training opportunities in southern parts of the State. Appendices in the Green Jobs Report provide a comprehensive list of training opportunities, wrapround services, and an inventory of related policies and programs in New Jersey.

“Cultivating a skilled workforce has long been a cornerstone of New Jersey's vision for sustainability, and the Department of Labor is proud of our ongoing success in developing clear pathways to employment in this area through strategic investments in education, training, and apprenticeship programs,” said Robert Asaro-Angelo, Commissioner of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development and Co-Chair on the New Jersey Council on the Green Economy. “Our goal is to continue ensuring every New Jerseyan has the opportunity to thrive in this emerging industry, transforming not just careers but entire communities as we transition to a more environmentally responsible future.”

EDA’s Apprenticeship Training Centers Construction Grant Program makes $9.7 million available to support the development of training centers for Registered Apprenticeship programs in the building and construction trades, with a particular focus on overburdened communities. The program is accepting applications until Monday, September 29th.

“The NJEDA’s Apprenticeship Training Centers Construction Grant Program will help expand workforce development programs across the state, particularly in Overburdened Communities, helping prepare residents for good-paying careers in the building and construction trades,” said NJEDA Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. “Under Governor Murphy’s leadership, New Jersey has continued to invest in innovative apprenticeship programs aimed to promote equitable economic opportunities and strengthen communities.”

In addition, in April 2025, EDA announced over $4.3 million awarded in four Green Workforce Training Grants, which will develop training programs to prepare New Jersey residents for green economy careers.

Many stakeholders highlighted the groundbreaking work implemented in New Jersey’s public schools to reach kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) student populations with a curriculum focused on sustainability, as well as an expansion of summer and pre-college programs and workshops focused on clean energy.

“In New Jersey, we have made empowering our children to lead the jobs of the future green economy our priority. Through our first-in-the-nation K-12 climate change education standards, we are preparing students for exciting, new opportunities in the State’s growing green workforce,"" said First Lady Tammy Murphy. “Equipping our students with the tools necessary to build a stronger and cleaner New Jersey is one of the most powerful and important things we can do for the future.”

This summer marked the fifth year of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)’s highly successful Youth Inclusion Initiative, an innovative summer workforce development program. Partnerships between DEP and community-based organizations provide young people, particularly from communities with limited access to natural lands, with opportunities to learn about a wide variety of environmental careers. From 2021 to 2025, NJDEP invested nearly $2.5 million, hosting around 275 youth from across New Jersey.

“Cultivating the next generation of New Jersey’s environmental stewards is a gift that not only protects our lands and natural resources for others but grows and sustains a robust green economy benefiting our state and nation,” said Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette. “We are proud of the Youth Inclusion Initiative’s success in providing young people from diverse communities with invaluable exposure to environmental careers.”

Our Higher Education institutions also play an important role. For ten years, Montclair State University’s PSEG Institute for Sustainability Studies annual Green Teams program has empowered students to create real-world sustainability solutions in communities across New Jersey and beyond. This year’s cohort reflects the program’s growing impact, with 50 interns from 16 states.

Workforce considerations in New Jersey’s green economy include green infrastructure technologies such as water, waste, and wastewater treatment and management, as well as stormwater and resiliency infrastructure. Clean energy technologies include grid infrastructure and storage, renewable energy generation and fuels, energy efficiency and alternative vehicles.

“New Jersey's clean energy transition is powering more than just our grid – it’s powering thousands of career opportunities. As we accelerate our transformation through grid modernization, renewable energy deployment, and energy efficiency programs, we’re not just building a cleaner future, we're building high-wage careers that will sustain New Jersey families for generations,” said NJBPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy. “The NJBPU is committed to ensuring our clean energy investments translate into real opportunities for New Jersey workers at every skill level.”

Modeling for the report calculated the employment impacts associated with in-state capital and operational expenditures on clean electricity and fuel resources, building efficiency and electrification measures, alternative transportation adoption, and green infrastructure development.

As DEP, EDA, and BPU work to release the 2026-2028 Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Strategic Funding Plan, the Scoping Document provides an optimistic outlook for the green workforce in New Jersey, noting that “with a continued commitment to addressing climate change and expanding clean energy, New Jersey will add tens of thousands of jobs to its green economy.”

To drive this growth, EDA has proposed dedicating a portion of 26-28 RGGI Auction proceeds for incentives and other funding investments in clean energy supply chain related manufacturing development; clean energy technology development, innovation hubs, and accelerators; and complementary workforce development, training, and education.

Public stakeholder meetings were held in August and September on the 2026-2028 RGGI Strategic Funding Plan, which will be published in Fall of 2025.

The New Jersey 2025 Green Jobs Report was developed through State agency collaboration by the Economic Development Authority, the Board of Public Utilities, the Department of Labor, the Governor’s Office, and BW Research Partnership (BW). In addition to extensive research, BW conducted executive interviews with over three dozen stakeholders involved in New Jersey’s workforce and energy ecosystem to uncover existing challenges, needs, and opportunities in the state’s green industries.

From 2022 to 2024, funding and programming for workforce development expanded dramatically at both state and federal levels. The Biden White House reported funding 130 projects in New Jersey through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).",https://nj.gov/governor/library/facebook_card.png,N,,2025-09-25 13:01:50.545247

A final investment decision on the first phase of the project is expected by November, a few months behind the original schedule, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the financing talks are private. The terminal is expected to cost about $4.3 billion, the people said. Citigroup Inc. and Moelis & Co. are working with the closely held US company on the financing, which is expected to come from a mix of debt and equity, Bloomberg News previously reported.

LNG project developers in the US are racing to tie up financing before global supplies exceed demand, creating a glut that BloombergNEF expects to emerge by 2027. While the heating and power-plant fuel has been touted by President Donald Trump as key to achieving US energy dominance, Qatar is progressing with its own years-long LNG build-out and a massive pipeline expansion by Gazprom PJSC could begin funneling more Russian gas to China by 2031.

United States.

Winning a climate case on constitutional grounds will likely be challenging, Gerrard said.
He could grant the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, or allow the executive orders to stand while letting the case proceed to trial.","MISSOULA, Mont.—During a short recess in their first hearing, the young plaintiffs in the Lighthiser v. Trump lawsuit gathered outside the courtroom to dance along to a TikTok video.

They’d been listening to nearly two days’ worth of testimony and legal arguments that began Sept. 16, sitting attentively in their button-down shirts, khakis and one thrift-store purple suit. Five of them had taken the stand themselves, describing how climate change was threatening their futures, then facing cross-examination from U.S. Department of Justice lawyers. It was time to just be kids for a moment.

The 22 youth plaintiffs had their first day in court at a hearing before the U.S. District Court of Montana in Missoula, where they, supported by a slate of expert witnesses, asked Judge Dana L. Christensen to issue a preliminary injunction against three of President Trump’s executive orders designed to “unleash” fossil fuels. The Department of Justice, along with “intervenors” from 18 state governments and Guam, all asked for the case to be dismissed.

The three executive orders—“Unleashing American Energy,” “Declaring a National Energy Emergency” and “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry”—direct the executive branch to remove burdens to domestic energy production, especially coal, but exclude wind and solar power from those actions. The plaintiffs argued that this acceleration of fossil fuel development harms their physical, mental and economic health. And they spent a good deal of time emphatically asserting that their case was not the same as Juliana v. United States.

Their success hinges on whether or not the courts agree on that last point.

The two cases have undeniable similarities. Both feature young plaintiffs—Lighthiser’s range from 7 to 25—who allege the federal government is violating their Constitutional rights by promoting fossil fuels. (Some of the Juliana plaintiffs are now part of the Lighthiser case.) Both were filed by Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit law firm dedicated to climate work. But where Juliana wound its way through the legal system for 10 years before finally being dismissed for lack of standing (the right to bring a case to court) last March, the Lighthiser team hopes this case will hit the mark.

“Outlining the differences between Juliana and Lighthiser is super-important,” said Miko Vergun, 24, of Oregon, a plaintiff in both cases. “In Juliana, we were trying to ask for a climate recovery plan. And we were also arguing that we had the constitutional right to a stable climate that the federal government was continuously infringing upon. In this case, we’re arguing that the three executive orders that Trump had implemented are infringing on those constitutional rights to life and liberty.”

The hopes of climate activists following the Lighthiser proceedings have been buoyed by the success of another climate suit brought to a Montana courtroom by Our Children’s Trust, Held v. Montana in 2023, which included 15 of the current plaintiffs. But that case was against the state of Montana, whose constitution guarantees the right to “a clean and healthful environment,” which the U.S. Constitution does not do.

The plaintiffs this time around crafted their request to the court to sidestep the questions about standing that sunk Juliana. To have the legal standing to bring a case in federal court, plaintiffs must prove three things: that they have been harmed; that their harm was caused by the action they’re challenging, which is known as “traceability”; and that the court has the power to address that harm—“redressability.” In Juliana, the courts ultimately ruled that the judicial branch doesn’t have the power to compel the federal government to adopt a specific energy policy. Lighthiser asks the court for a narrower ruling: a declaration that the three executive orders are unconstitutional.

The plaintiffs who testified at the hearing spoke about how climate change personally affected them. Joseph Lee, 19, of California, described being hospitalized for heatstroke. Avery McRae, 20, who attends college in Florida, testified that hurricanes forced her to evacuate from her campus three times in two years. Californian Jeffrey K. (lawyers withheld his last name because he’s a minor), 11, told the court that worsening wildfire smoke poses a significant risk to him and his younger brother, both of whom have lung conditions. “Unleashing fossil fuels will definitely make the entire environment, heat-wise, air quality-wise, worse,” he said. All five mentioned mental health impacts like fear, anxiety, sadness and uncertainty about their futures.

“[The defendants] really aren’t questioning that the young people are being injured in this case,” said Andrea Rodgers, deputy director of U.S. Strategy for Our Children’s Trust.

But the traceability and redressability standards pose a larger hurdle for the plaintiffs, dragging in thorny questions about the separation of powers between branches of the U.S. government.

The plaintiffs allege that a slew of recent government actions can be linked to the three executive orders, including the canceling of wind power permits, the extension of the length of time that some coal plants will operate, the dismissing of federal climate scientists and proposals to shut down climate research satellites and rescind the Environmental Protection Agency’s critical endangerment finding that is the basis of its regulation of greenhouse gases. Many of those decisions didn’t explicitly mention the three executive orders, but the plaintiffs argue that the orders could be reasonably inferred to have caused those actions.

John Podesta, a former climate advisor to Presidents Biden and Obama, testified at the hearing, “These decisions predictably and directly flow from these orders…These kids are being harmed by this action, and this court can do something about that.”

The hearing broached the question of exactly what a preliminary injunction would change about the Trump administration’s actions.

“I’m troubled by the practical effects of what you’re asking me to do,” Christensen told Julia Olson, the plaintiffs’ chief legal counsel, last week. He wondered aloud if issuing the preliminary injunction meant he’d be required to review every fossil fuel-related action the government took in the future. For example, he asked, if the administration issued a permit for a coal mine expansion in Montana, would that be a violation of his order? And how could the order also make the administration give out more permits for wind and solar projects?

The defense has seized on that concern. Michael Sawyer, the lead Department of Justice lawyer, argued that the plaintiffs would claim the injunction they’re asking Christensen to issue was violated “every time the agencies did something they don’t like.”

“We have hundreds, maybe thousands, of lawsuits packed into one,” he added

Another core issue—and the one that most bedeviled the Juliana case—is who bears responsibility for the country’s energy decisions.

“The question is, is it the role of the courts to be making major decisions about national energy policy, or does that need to be left to Congress and the president?” said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. “[The Lighthiser plaintiffs] are asking for less than the plaintiffs requested in Juliana, but they’re still asking a lot.”

The Department of Justice argues that decisions about energy permits and regulations belong squarely to the executive branch, not the courts. In the hearing, Sawyer went so far as to call the case “at its core, an undemocratic lawsuit,” because voters had elected Trump knowing his preference for fossil fuels.

Plaintiffs counter that the courts have a right to challenge energy policy if it affects their fundamental rights.

“If policymakers could decide to threaten children’s lives, then the Bill of Rights would mean nothing,” Olson told Christensen.

Both sides agree that the court stepping in on a climate matter like this would be unprecedented. But the plaintiffs expressly ask for a groundbreaking ruling. Olson even compared a ruling in their favor to Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court decision that declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional.

Winning a climate case on constitutional grounds will likely be challenging, Gerrard said.

The success of Our Children’s Trust in Held v. Montana in 2023 meant the state would have to consider greenhouse gas emissions in its permitting processes. But Montana’s guarantee of a healthy and clean environment in its state constitution “made an enormous difference,” Gerrard said.

Without any environmental rights spelled out in the U.S. Constitution, plaintiffs now rely on a court interpreting the right to a stable climate as falling under the rights to life and liberty.

Department of Justice lawyers put forth a number of other arguments: that the executive orders don’t pose an imminent threat to the youth plaintiffs; that the additional carbon emissions associated with the orders are negligible on a global scale; that many of the challenged government actions—like the rescinding of the endangerment finding—are still only proposals that might not actually be enacted; and that a clean-energy grid would be unreliable, more expensive and damaging to U.S. trade relations.

The defendants didn’t call any witnesses for their case. And they struck the loudest note by repeatedly comparing Lighthiser to Juliana. “This is the same case,” Sawyer argued in court.

Both sides now await Christensen’s ruling. He could grant the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, or allow the executive orders to stand while letting the case proceed to trial. Or he could dismiss it. If that happens, Our Children’s Trust can appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

After the Sept. 17 hearing wrapped, the plaintiffs posed for photos outside the courthouse, fists raised. “Getting to hear my co-plaintiffs testify was incredibly inspiring,” said Eva Lighthiser, 19, of Montana, the lead plaintiff and part of the Held case two years ago. “It’s so incredible to not only have the opportunities we did during Held, but also have our voices heard just now.”

But one expert leaving the courtroom expressed uncertainty about the case’s prospects, even though he believes the scientific underpinnings of the case are irrefutable. Steven Running, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning climate scientist who testified for the plaintiffs, unlocked his bike from a rack in front of the courthouse and clicked on his helmet. He said he appreciated the chance to present climate science to the court, but that the legal wrangling to come was “way beyond my pay grade.”

The first phase of the Salcos Green Steel Project is well underway, and once operational, the site will reduce CO₂ emissions from steelmaking by around 30%, or approximately 2 million tonnes of steel.
However, the planned delay of the Salcos Green Steel Project has cast a shadow over the hydrogen sector in Germany.","Germany’s second-largest steel producer has announced a three-year delay to a substantial project that is already in the first stage. The planned project will halt as it enters the second phase due to worsening economic conditions and regulatory uncertainty. Hydrogen plays a crucial role in the production of green steel; however, worsening markets and regulatory problems have led the company in question to halt its final phase for the flagship Salcos Green Steel Project in Salzgitter, Germany.

The billion-dollar project aims to reduce carbon emissions in the steel industry

Salzgitter AG plays an integral role in the German steel sector. The company is Germany’s second largest steel producer and, as such, has developed several key measures to reduce the amount of carbon produced by the steel industry in Germany. The Salcos Green Steel Project is already far along in the first phase, but the company stated it would implement a three-year delay for the final stages.

The project is reportedly going to cost roughly €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion), approximately €1 billion of that amount comes in the form of invaluable government grants. The project aims to make use of hydrogen to produce green steel, which has a much lower carbon emission level than that of traditional steel production methods.

“The economic environment is not ready. Hydrogen markets are developing more slowly than expected, and promised regulatory changes are still missing,” – Gunnar Groebler, CEO of Salzgitter AG

The delay raises concerns over Germany’s ability to meet its ambitious climate goals

Germany, along with the rest of the world, is hard at work implementing measures across several sectors that aim to alleviate the pressure on the climate. Several countries have made significant carbon reduction commitments in recent years. The first phase of the Salcos Green Steel Project is well underway, and once operational, the site will reduce CO₂ emissions from steelmaking by around 30%, or approximately 2 million tonnes of steel.

The company has now stated that it plans to revisit investment decisions for the second expansion stage in 2028 or 2029, instead of the initial 2026 timeline. The challenges encapsulate the problems that the German steel industry is facing at the moment. Earlier this year, another major steel producer in Germany rolled back plans to convert two German plants to carbon-neutral production.

Germany is doing everything in its power to accelerate the transition to green energy, thanks to government subsidies and renewable energy expansion. However, the planned delay of the Salcos Green Steel Project has cast a shadow over the hydrogen sector in Germany. The European nation has made significant moves to ensure hydrogen is a part of the future, despite the planned delay of the new site.

Steel production in Germany has seen significant drops in production numbers in recent years

The company reported that in the first half of 2025, it reduced steel production by 12.1% compared to the same period in 2024, which amounts to roughly 2.93 million tons. It also reported that total external sales fell by 11% year-on-year to €4.66 billion. The steel sector in Germany is facing an uphill battle to remain relevant in the modern-day energy sector.

NEPA has been weakened by Congress, the White House, and the Supreme Court.
Focusing narrowly on NEPA, we should resist efforts to eliminate public participation, something that the Trump Administration is now doing.
NEPA aimed to push agencies into better planning, but that hasn’t worked very well, partly due to adverse court decisions.
NEPA has made the environment part of every agency’s agenda, but courts don’t always seem to understand that.","What do we really want NEPA to do? And what’s the best way to do it?

NEPA has been weakened by Congress, the White House, and the Supreme Court. It’s attacked by both the oil renewables industry. Imagining reform legislation from Congress is difficult, but it’s worth imagining, if only as a thought experiment, how we could do better. I would suggest we start by asking what we can expect NEPA to accomplish after fifty years of judicial decisions and agency practice – and whether there are better ways of accomplishing those things.

Basically, my recommendations come down to doing more in the way of larger-scale planning, with more data collection, public participation, and environmental analysis before specific proposals are on the table. We should also push monitoring and mitigation commitments if problems arise during or after construction. The payoff in efficiency terms would be a quicker project for approving individual projects with less less litigation at that stage.

Goal #1: Better informed decisions. Environmental impact statements (and often their shorter siblings, environmental assessments) do give agencies a lot of information. But often this is after the agency has basically made up its mind. What we really need is to have much better information before proposals are even made. Here are two ways of accomplishing this: First, create a National Ecological Survey to provide detailed information about ecosystems across the nation. Among other things, this would allow project planners to pick sites with lower environmental impacts. Programmatic environmental impact statements could be used for these zoning decisions.

Second, require project proponents to conduct environmental surveys of sites before applying so that the agency and the public would have specific information about the site, and provide early opportunities for outsiders to provide additional site-specific information.

Goal #2. Public participation. This should be an independent requirement for permitting. That should include posting of project materials online; the opportunity for public comment; and the public hearings for significant projects. There should be enough lead-time to allow communities time to become informed. Focusing narrowly on NEPA, we should resist efforts to eliminate public participation, something that the Trump Administration is now doing. However, we should structure input in a way that will provide useful information rather than encouraging NIMBYism.

Goal #3: Better planning. NEPA aimed to push agencies into better planning, but that hasn’t worked very well, partly due to adverse court decisions. If we want better plans, we need to be more explicit in imposing planning mandates. I’d suggest that Congress require regional planning efforts by public lands agencies on a regular timetable, building in opportunities for public comment and peer review. Agencies should be required to consider the interconnected nature of environmental issues and the long-term consequences of their programs. Again, programmatic impact statements would offer a good mechanism for this planning projetct.

Goal #4: Project mitigation. We want to give project proponents an incentive to find ways to mitigate impacts. We should just make this a legal requirement for projects and require posting a bond to cover the costs for mitigating any remaining impacts after a project is in operation. Short of that, when project sponsors voluntarily take this step, courts should cut them more slack in reviewing the impact statement.

Goal #5: Making agencies consider the environment. NEPA has made the environment part of every agency’s agenda, but courts don’t always seem to understand that. We need a clearer mandate for all agencies to provide a reasoned explanation of how environmental factored into their decisions, just as they do for non-environmental policy goals set by Congress. For major projects, we should encourage peer review by independent experts rather than relying entirely on after-the-fact judicial review to improve decisions.

I’m not saying these are the ideal set of recommendations. But I do think the process —focus on your goals and figure out the best way to achieve them — is the right approach to take.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/NEPA-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 12:06:24.807057

The companies—including through their subsidiaries, PACs, executives, and executives' spouses—donated a collective $2.9 million to Abbott in 96 contributions between 2014-25.

""The timing of the contributions is suspect,” said Andrew Cates, an attorney and government ethics expert. “The groups were awarded the contracts after they made large contributions to the governor or his [super PAC]. If it were the other way around, it could be viewed as a thank-you contribution, but this way feels much more pay-to-play when procurement money flows quickly after large contributions.""

Cates said one particular donor, Doggett Equipment Services Group, drew the scrutiny of Public Citizen due to $1.6 million it was awarded in no-bid state contracts that were simply labeled ""fees.""

The company provides services to the heavy equipment industry across Texas and it CEO, William ""Leslie"" Doggett, has contributed more than $1.7 million to Texans for Greg Abbott since 2014, either personally or through his corporation.

One of Doggett's companies, Doggett Freightliners of South Texas, received two noncompetitive contracts—identified only as ""fees"" on paperwork—worth $1.6 million in 2022 and 2023. One of the contracts was finalized eight days after Doggett donated $500,000 to the PAC.

Cates said the Doggett contracts were ""especially egregious.""

Doggett's apparent transaction with Abbott's PAC did not make his company the largest recipient of no-bid contracts detailed in the report; that distinction goes to Gothams LLC, an emergency management company that received nearly $640 million in contracts in 2021 and 2022.

After pandemic contracts began to slow in 2022, Gothams received just one contract worth $43 million—but after its founder, Matthew Michelsen, started sending donations to Texans for Greg Abbott that totaled $600,000, the firm received 10 contracts worth $66 million.

""People lose faith in their government when they see a system that appears to benefit those who can buy access to elected officials,” said Adrian Shelley, the Texas director of Public Citizen. “Even when no laws are broken, insider dealing undermines confidence in state government. People conclude that the government works for wealthy people first and everyday Texans second.""

In another example from the report, infrastructure development firm HNTB Holdings received an emergency contract worth $2.6 million in 2021 to provide software updates. Since 2015, the company, its PAC, and its senior officials have contributed $193,750 to Texans for Greg Abbott

“All of the companies identified in this report, either through corporate PACs or individuals affiliated with the company, contributed significant amounts to Texans for Greg Abbott,"" said Cassidy Levin, a research fellow at Public Citizen. ""Lawmakers should adopt stronger restrictions on pay-to-play practices in government contracting and implement reporting requirements for the governor’s office in the aftermath of an emergency.”

The group called on Texas officials to make changes to the state's contract procurement rules, including by:

Banning no-bid contract awards to companies whose PACs, officers, or families of officers have made political donations above a given threshold within the last election cycle;

Barring recipients of no-bid contracts from making contributions above a given threshold for a given period of time;

Establishing a more thorough and transparent reporting process of the awarding of no-bid contracts after disaster and emergency declarations; and

Imposing penalties for noncompliance, including contract forfeiture.

The report acknowledges that ""disaster response includes the rapid deployment of resources to areas of need"" and that ""the speed involved may make normal contract bid and award procedures impossible.""

However, reads the conclusion, ""ethics laws should be sufficient to eliminate conflict and the appearance of conflict in government decision-making.""

Shelley added that ""there are simple safeguards that lawmakers could implement to avoid apparent conflicts of interest while still allowing the state to respond quickly to emergencies.”",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61189983&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-09-25 12:07:54.994971

The partners note that LIBs power a wide array of devices, including phones, cars, kitchen appliances, toothbrushes, laptops and more, with each containing resources that can be recycled and reused in the U.S. Redwood, headquartered in Carson City, Nevada, claims it recovers more than 95 percent of the critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, copper and nickel and returns them to the supply chain.

RELATED: Redwood Materials, GM aim to repurpose EV batteries for energy storage systems

“Through this campaign, we want to show that collective action on lithium-ion battery recycling directly supports American energy independence,” says Morgan Crapps, director of public affairs and government relations for Redwood. “Each battery and device we recycle keeps our nation’s valuable, finite natural resources in circulation and creates jobs right here in our community.”

As part of the campaign, ESFI and Redwood say they also will partner with the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SCDES) as part of its “Be Battery Smart” campaign to expand battery collection and education.

“Collaborating on public education campaigns is critical to addressing the lack of consumer awareness about the proper disposal and recycling of lithium-ion batteries,” says SCDES Director Myra Reece says. “With these types of batteries becoming so commonplace in our daily lives, it’s important for everyone to understand how safe recycling of these batteries protects both people and the environment.”

ESFI says one of its key priorities in recent years has been LIB safety, where it has filled in gaps for safety messaging about all parts of the battery life cycle, from responsible shopping to safe use to proper repurposing. Through conducting consumer surveys and working with manufacturers, distributors, regulators and product safety testing laboratories, ESFI says it has “become a leading voice in the space, reaching millions of people nationwide.”

“This partnership comes at the perfect time, as ESFI begins preparing for the National Fire Protection Association’s Fire Prevention Week campaign,” says Jennifer LeFevre, executive director of Arlington, Virginia-based ESFI. “This year’s theme, ‘Charge into Fire Safety: Lithium-ion Batteries in Your Home,’ aligns perfectly with the messaging that ESFI has been using for years to educate the public about how to safely charge, use and repurpose their rechargeable devices.”",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/09/25/adobestock_110768217-web.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 14:02:41.170522

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation represents almost all major automakers and suppliers operating in America—From the manufacturers producing vehicles, to autonomous vehicle innovators, equipment suppliers, battery producers, and semiconductor makers.

The rules require automakers to cut fleetwide emissions nearly 50 percent by 2032, a target that, byt the EPA's own estimates, would require between 35 and 56 percent of new vehicle sales to be fully electric.

Automakers argue that, with consumer demand cooling, charging infrastructure still limited, and supply chains strained, the standards are “divorced from current market realities.”

On September 30, the federal $7,500 consumer EV tax credit will go away. At the same time, automakers could lose a separate production credit worth roughly $3,000 per vehicle if the batteries are domestically built — subsidies the automakers had counted on when committing billions to new U.S. battery plants.

The Alliance said the loss would “harm not only the automotive manufacturers that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars investing in electric vehicle technology, but also the entire supply chain that has supported these initiatives.”

Democrats and environmental groups want the EPA to keep Biden’s framework intact, arguing that walking back now will jeopardize climate targets.

Last month, the EPA formally proposed to scrap the 2009 Endangerment Finding that declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health—a landmark decision that provided the legal foundation for every vehicle-related greenhouse gas regulation in the last 15 years. If finalized, the proposal would effectively eliminate all requirements for automakers to measure and comply with greenhouse gas emission standards in new cars, trucks, SUVs, and commercial vehicles.

Manufacturers would still be required to limit pollutants like carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates, but carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons would no longer be regulated under the Clean Air Act.

The play is in line with President Donald Trump’s January executive order directing all government agencies to “unleash American energy” by cutting emissions-related regulations.

There are several other large buildings used for processing and recycling batteries.
If you live elsewhere, Google “battery recycling” to find local recycling facilities.","As you may know from my past columns, I’m a big fan of electric vehicles, but I also recognize that many people have concerns. These include the environmental impact of making the batteries and dealing with them at the end of their service life. There are also geopolitical and humanitarian concerns about where the raw materials come from (usually not the U.S.), the sometimes-dangerous conditions under which they’re mined, and the challenges of recycling them responsibly. EV batteries typically contain toxic substances such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, which must be handled carefully throughout their life cycle.

And it’s not just EVs. Rechargeable batteries are in many household devices ranging from watches and hearing aids to home battery storage systems. My toothbrush, my smart ring, my TV remote control and some of my flashlights are among my many devices with rechargeable batteries.

And, thanks to the global growth of EVs, phones, energy storage systems and rechargeable gadgets, the demand for batteries is growing rapidly.

Repurposing and recycling

One business addressing these issues is Redwood Materials, a Nevada-based privately held company that repurposes and recycles rechargeable batteries from things as small as hearing aids and cell phones to heavy equipment like Caterpillar’s 108,000-pound electric underground mining loader.

The company has a massive recycling program, but it also launched a division focused on repurposing, rather than immediately recycling, rechargeable batteries. For example, an old EV battery can be combined with others to create an array powerful enough to run a data center. On its website, Redwood notes that many batteries still retain more than 50% of their usable capacity when they reach a recycling facility, enough to be put back to work before recycling. With this strategy, a single battery can have three lives: its initial use, a second life in repurposed applications, and finally, having its valuable materials recovered to make new batteries. Redwood calls this a “circular supply chain.”

Redwood says that its process uses about 80% less energy, 70% fewer CO₂ emissions, 80% less water than traditional ore refining and at least 40% fewer emissions than other recyclers. In mining, extraction and transport make up over 30% of the footprint; Redwood cuts that to under 5%, highlighting the efficiency of its circular supply chain.

My visit

I visited their 900-acre facility, roughly the size of 680 football fields, in Sparks, Nevada, about 29 miles from Reno. It’s also about four miles from the even larger Tesla Gigafactory, which, in partnership with Panasonic, produces batteries used in Tesla EVs and Powerwall home energy storage systems.

Tesla’s battery factory and Redwood Materials aren’t just neighbors, they also share a founder. J.B. Straubel, who started Redwood in 2017, was a Tesla co-founder and its longtime chief technology officer before leaving in 2019 to focus on his new venture.

Driving to Redwood Materials is an adventure in itself. After leaving Reno, you head into Nevada’s high desert, where the landscape is mostly tumbleweeds, sagebrush and rocky hillsides until you reach the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. That complex has expanded dramatically since I last visited in 2019. Back then, the Tesla Gigafactory was the lone giant. Now, companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple operate massive data centers there.

As you approach Redwood’s facility, the first thing you notice is a vast field filled with thousands of old batteries draped in white cloth. Just beyond that is an enormous low-rise building that houses the company’s offices and part of its processing operations. There are several other large buildings used for processing and recycling batteries.

“Turning pancakes into batter”

After I arrived and parked my Tesla in one of their many EV spots, a colleague and I boarded an electric Ford van for a tour of the facility. We saw large machines being used to crunch batteries of all sizes followed by other machines that separated and extracted the raw materials. The process, explained our guide, was “like turning pancakes into pancake batter,” to produce end products that battery makers use to create new batteries. He said that these extracted and recycled raw materials are as good or slightly better than new materials. At one point, I saw a worker unpack boxes of old electric bicycle batteries and insert each into a machine to start breaking them down into reusable compounds that would be used to help make new batteries.

The van also took us up a hill to a data center with a lot of solar panels and a large array of repurposed batteries that provide power when the sun isn’t shining or when additional energy is needed. The Nevada sun makes solar a great source of energy, but these repurposed batteries can also be connected to the grid to reduce peaks and charge at lower rate hours. Eventually, even these batteries will be recycled, but not until they’ve reached the end of their useful life. Squeezing more life out of old batteries is both an economic and environmental win.

Redwood Materials, which has 1,300 employees, also operates a battery processing facility in Charleston, South Carolina, and a research & development center in San Francisco,

Doing your part

As I was leaving the facility, I noticed a recycling receptacle in the lobby. The company invites visitors to drop off their phones and other devices with rechargeable batteries and, on its website, says that “less than 5% of lithium-ion containing devices are recycled” and that Americans throw out over 150 million phones every year. They also point out that “Recycling batteries and rechargeable devices keeps critical minerals in circulation and reduces the environmental impact of our products.” You don’t have to drive to Nevada to recycle your devices. The California Department of Toxic Substance Control has resources to find recycling programs on its website. If you live elsewhere, Google “battery recycling” to find local recycling facilities.

Reincarnation

I’m not all that spiritual, but I do understand the Buddhist concept of karma and reincarnation The battery in my toothbrush has served me well. With a little help from companies such as Redwood Materials, maybe someday it will come back to help power a vehicle or maybe even a spaceship to Mars.

Dive Brief:

A coalition of mayors groups, attorneys general and seven cities and counties submitted extensive letters regarding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to rescind the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which concluded that emissions of six greenhouse gases endanger human health and is the underpinning for greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act.

The EPA “fails to seriously consider the impacts of these regulatory actions in cities,” stated a 14-page letter signed by the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Climate Mayors, C40 Cities and the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.

Attorneys general from Kentucky and West Virginia, meanwhile, are co-leading a 26-state coalition that submitted an 82-page letter in support of repealing the endangerment finding, stating it “was built on shaky ground — legally and scientifically.”

Dive Insight:

The EPA on July 29 proposed rescinding federal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, kicking off a formal rulemaking process with a period for stakeholders to comment before the agency finalizes and publishes the proposed rule. Virtual public hearings were held Aug. 19-22, and written comments were due Monday. More than 300,000 comments were filed.

The EPA said rescinding the finding would “save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards” and “give power back to the states to make their own decisions” about greenhouse gas regulations.

In its 225-page letter opposing the repeal, the coalition of attorneys general and cities and counties “describes the harms that the States and Local Governments are daily experiencing and that will be exacerbated if EPA finalizes the Proposal.”The letter argues that rescinding the endangerment finding would violate Supreme Court precedent and “disproportionately affect certain vulnerable groups and communities with environmental justice concerns.”

“We will continue to take action against dangerous federal actions that disregard scientific evidence,” said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, one of the letter’s signatories, in an emailed statement. “The importance of upholding this long-held commitment is underscored by the plain truth that the effects of climate change are felt most acutely by working people and Black and Brown communities.”

“New York City is no stranger to the devastating effects of natural disasters,” New York Mayor Eric Adams, who also signed the letter, said in a statement. “With more extreme weather events hitting the five boroughs more often, for our safety and to protect our economy, we must be prepared for the effects of climate change, including by putting in place stronger federal regulations of greenhouse gases.”

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement Aug. 1 that the endangerment finding “represents quintessential federal overreach and was never borne out by the law.” President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin are “reining in this overreach so states such as West Virginia can unleash American energy and compete successfully against China,” Morrisey said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/YBKwsv9prlTkZB2t9UEkiizKRBxvZ5W0CPcSiE1BifI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI5OTgyODkyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-25 13:03:06.352354

(AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

The survey, conducted among representative samples of 1,200 likely 2026 voters from across Alabama, Kansas and North Carolina, asked participants about a hypothetical proposal to cut all federal funding for weather and climate research. The study looks to shed light on public opinion related to the Trump administration’s continued efforts to gut critical agencies including the National Weather Service, NWS; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA; and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA.

In general, respondents from all three states indicated support for scientific research into weather and climate, noting its importance for maintaining America’s global leadership, national security and economic prosperity. Eighty-one percent of Alabama’s respondents indicated that they believe it is important for the government to fund scientific research that helps better predict extreme weather, while 85 percent agreed that America’s position as a global leader depends on continued scientific research and innovation.

Respondents also indicated overwhelming disapproval of any proposal to cut all federal funding for scientific research into the earth’s weather and climate, with 63 percent of Alabama’s respondents opposing the proposal compared to only 29 percent who said they would support such a policy. After being primed with arguments both for and against the proposal, Alabamians remained in net opposition to any such cuts.

Additionally, 48 percent of Alabamian respondents indicated that they would view their U.S. senators–Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt–less favorably if they voted for such a proposal. Thirty-four percent said their favorability of Tuberville and Britt would not change in such a scenario, while only 17 percent stated that their opinions of the senators would improve if they voted for such cuts.

Since scaling up manufacturing facilities typically takes two to three years, there is only a narrow window left to create the necessary conditions for investors to commit to manufacturing in the EU until 2030”.

Walburga Hemetsberger, SPE CEO, said: “This new report underlines that, with the right policies, Europe can competitively deliver 30GW of solar manufacturing by 2030, creating thousands of local jobs, and building a resilient, innovative solar supply chain that keeps economic value here at home. To meet 2030 goal, the EU and member states must act swiftly. Without interventions, Europe risks losing remaining industrial and technological capabilities in solar.”

The study mentions that currently, European annual manufacturing capacity is below 10GW across wafers, cells and modules, while China supplies between 81-93% of the PV components across the value chain to Europe.

However, the number would be much higher when factoring in the announced or planned capacity by 2030, as shown in the chart below. This would still put the EU behind other regions, particularly the US, India and Southeast Asia for modules.

Moreover, the analysis conducted in the study was based on three scenarios that are each compliant with the EU’s NZIA – which came into force last year and aims to boost domestic renewables manufacturing – resilience criterion.

The first one would be a fully vertically integrated supply chain (polysilicon to modules, including solar glass and inverters) made in the EU; the second would procure the more upstream elements – polysilicon, ingots and wafers – from China, while the rest be produced in the EU; and the last scenario is similar to the previous one but production would be centred in Southeast Asia, rather than the EU.

SPE estimates that production costs for the fully EU-based system, compared to the one that is a mix between China and Southeast Asia, would be around €0.128/Wp higher; the cost for a European system for a utility-scale solar installation would result in nearly €0.608/Wp versus €0.5/Wp for a Chinese system. This results in a levelised cost of electricity 14.5% higher for a European-made module, compared to a Chinese one.

The gap is due to several factors, of which labour has the highest difference (+240%), followed by building and facility (+110%), material costs (+50%) and equipment (+40%).

“This gives a hopeful indication that already, EU-made products fall within the 15% limit of additional costs under Net-Zero Industry Act auction rules,” said SPE.

Moreover, the report highlights that the cost gap could be further reduced to less than 10% with a mix of policies that combine capital expenditure (capex) and operational expenditure (opex) schemes. This would be both for solar manufacturers and project developers, with an output-based support. This outcome would be based on an annual nameplate capacity of 5GW.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EU-solar-manufacturing-supply-chain-outlook-by-2030.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:01:54.677336

President Biden’s enhanced COVID subsidies were sold as temporary relief but have morphed into regressive, fraud-ridden handouts for the well-off.","In the land of Reagan, California families already face some of the steepest health care costs in the nation, with premiums and deductibles eating up bigger chunks of household budgets every year. The state’s Obamacare insurance marketplace has warned of more price hikes ahead, putting even greater pressure on working families. Instead of confronting the underlying reasons why health care is so expensive, lawmakers often prefer the political expediency of masking rising costs with more handouts.

In Washington D.C., nothing is more permanent than a temporary government program. Case in point: President Biden’s short-term COVID-era enhanced subsidies for Obamacare that Congress now wants to extend permanently. For the sake of taxpayers, fiscal responsibility, and sound health care policy, Congress should let these expensive and wasteful COVID-era tax credits expire at the end of this year.

First enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act and then extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, these enhanced premium tax credits funnel taxpayer dollars directly to health insurance companies. While Obamacare’s original subsidies were tightly targeted to help lower-income families afford coverage, President Biden’s enhanced premium tax credits flipped that logic on its head and extended government largesse to upper-income households who need it least.

Biden’s COVID subsidies effectively scrapped the income cap, so now even high-earning families making six figures—or more than half a million dollars in some cases—can get taxpayer help with their health insurance. Even individuals pulling in over $250,000 qualify. Obamacare was meant to help the poor afford coverage, not hand out benefits to the wealthy.

Instead of allowing these credits to expire as intended, Democrats are demanding its extension be included in a deal to keep the government from shutting down at the end of this month. The COVID public health emergency has ended, and so should these COVID-era credits.

Continuing these credits comes at a huge cost to taxpayers. Extending them permanently would cost nearly $40 billion per year, more than the Department of Justice’s total budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office. With deficits near $2 trillion and interest payments rising fast, the government cannot continue to spend as if the debt doesn’t matter.

Beyond the cost, these expanded subsidies are rife with fraud and abuse. By sending billions to households with little financial need, the program encourages misreporting income and gaming the system. The IRS Inspector General reports a 26% improper payment rate—the highest of any federal health program.

To make matters worse, government data show millions of exchange enrollees never filed a single claim in 2024. Among fully subsidized enrollees, 40% had zero claims. In addition to wasting taxpayer funds, this gargantuan amount of fraud and improper enrollment erodes public trust in government.

Eager to keep their government handouts, insurance lobbyists have resorted to a dishonest campaign of fearmongering in an attempt to strong-arm Congress into extending these enhanced subsidies.

The end of Biden’s COVID sweeteners won’t leave people stranded since Obamacare’s original subsidies still pick up most of the tab for lower-income families.

To be clear, the entire Obamacare subsidy is not on the chopping block—only what was expanded in 2021. For almost all enrollees under 250% of the federal poverty line, taxpayers will continue to cover the vast majority of premiums after the enhanced subsidies expire.

Notwithstanding the spin, nearly three-quarters of all current Obamacare enrollees fall under this category. If lawmakers truly cared about patients, they’d fight the underlying causes of runaway health care costs instead of clinging to taxpayer handouts.

These bigger subsidies don’t control costs—they just mask them. By shielding people from the true price of insurance, the government lets insurers keep raising premiums. After falling from 2019 to 2022, benchmark premiums jumped 3.4% in 2023, showing that subsidies don’t stop costs from rising. Rather than sticking taxpayers with the bill, Washington should pursue real fixes: more competition, less red tape, and accountability for insurers and providers.

President Biden’s enhanced COVID subsidies were sold as temporary relief but have morphed into regressive, fraud-ridden handouts for the well-off. Letting them expire isn’t radical—it’s common sense. Congress should end this costly experiment and return Obamacare to its original purpose: helping the poor afford coverage, not padding the profits of insurance companies or subsidizing the upper-middle class.

A steel-framing pioneer in the 9th Ward Belanger's team isn't the first to build steel-framed houses in the region.
Builders here and there have opted for metal framing for decades, and many high-end houses include steel framing for special features, like long uninterrupted spans in spacious rooms.
“There’s no human error in these homes,” Neville said.","American homebuilders love lumber. Can they learn to love steel?

Last year, 94% of all single-family homes built in the United States were ""stick built,"" according to industry data. Most of the remainder were constructed using concrete. Less than half a percent — about 4,000 homes total nationwide — were made with steel framing, a stronger but more expensive alternative.

Notably, nearly all of these ""metal houses"" were in the South, where building codes have gotten stricter as worsening extreme weather events cause billions of dollars in damage, drive up insurance premiums and force builders to look for new solutions.

In Louisiana, one unlikely new home builder has plans to push the numbers higher.

The South Central Planning and Development Commission, a sprawling quasi-governmental nonprofit headquartered in Houma and serving seven parishes, is best known, if known at all, for providing building code inspections, coordinating regional roadway improvements, giving small business loans and assisting local governments.

With a staff of 185 people, it is the largest of eight regional planning commissions statewide.

Now, a new $4.5 million steel-frame construction program represents an entirely new direction for the commission, which aims to fill vacant lots with hardy homes throughout the parishes it serves.

The initiative, first conceived seven years ago, took on urgency after Hurricane Ida ripped through south Louisiana in 2021.

In 2023, the commission bought an industrial warehouse, which it converted into a manufacturing facility that can bend, fold and cut rolls of steel into the studs, joists, beams and rafters needed to construct homes.

And it has since assembled and trained a 16-person team of designers, fabricators and builders, who are using the new custom steel materials to create what the commission's longtime CEO Kevin Belanger hopes are the first of many houses: a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom French traditional-style home elevated on a 10-foot concrete foundation.

As it moves forward, the commission is joining a handful of Louisiana developers and builders betting on steel-framed houses in the hopes of creating stronger structures that are more resistant to extreme weather, fire, termites and the state's humid climate.

Advancements in the capabilities and accessibility of the machines that shape the steel may entice more people to join the cause.

“We went out and studied different building methods and procedures used around country to see what fit our need — to withstand salt water, salty air, high winds, fire and termites,"" said Belanger. ""We decided to invest in our own device to turn cold rolled steel into 2x4s.”

Building high and strong

Steel is stronger than lumber and impervious to insects and rot, but wood is less expensive and more flexible, and there's a large workforce with the tools and knowledge to build with it.

Dan Mills, head of the Home Builders Association of Greater New Orleans, said that ""wood is far and away the most accessible and best product available,"" and current building processes protect against ""the vast majority of storms.""

But Belanger said that the potential benefits of steel were enough to convince him to successfully lobby his commission's board to fund a different approach.

Construction of the South Central Planning and Development Commission's first house — at 600 West View Drive in Houma's Lisa Park subdivision — began in January and is now about 70% complete.

""This one took longer and cost more to build than the next one and the one after that will,"" Belanger said, because of the training required to use the unfamiliar material.

The home is designed to be more resistant to wind and fire than its wood-framed counterparts, which should make it less expensive to insure.

“Where we live, the typical home costs $225,000 to $250,000 and you can expect to pay $8,500 to $10,000 annually on insurance,” Belanger said. “The first estimate we got for this new house is about $1,200 a year.”

The commission's construction team is getting ready to lay the foundation for its second house on an adjacent lot. Soon, it hopes to produce more than 10 houses a year using its steel ""extrusion"" machine and the software that controls it.

""Once you load in all the engineered drawings and hit the button, it’ll print out the whole house for you,” Belanger said.

A steel-framing pioneer in the 9th Ward

Belanger's team isn't the first to build steel-framed houses in the region.

Builders here and there have opted for metal framing for decades, and many high-end houses include steel framing for special features, like long uninterrupted spans in spacious rooms.

Real estate developer Jamie Neville may have been the first in New Orleans to develop multiple steel-frame homes at once when he opted to use the material for his 45-unit Blueberry Hill project in the Lower 9th Ward, completed in late 2019. He's waiting to find out if he qualifies for federal tax credits that would help finance a second phase.

Neville was persuaded by a contractor to try the more-expensive framing as a way to keep his construction timetable on schedule.

“I remembered worrying about so many projects when rain and bad weather were holding everything up,"" Neville said. ""Meanwhile, the clock was still running and the interest on my loan was still accumulating.”

Neville was swayed by a contractor’s promise that walls would be built under the shelter of a warehouse, rain or shine. Another factor in his favor: his plan used multiple versions of a half-dozen home designs, which kept costs down. He estimates he ultimately spent 20% more than he would have on traditional framing, but he said there was less waste of materials, and the steel framing, designed by software and shaped by machines, is straighter and more precise than wood lumber.

“There’s no human error in these homes,” Neville said. “They are all built with 90-degree angles, so the cabinets, door and windows all fit perfectly.”

Neville said he hasn’t received any major discounts for the steel framing to date but he’s hopeful that will change. If it goes forward, phase two of Blueberry Hill, another 47 units, would likely be built the same way.

“Obviously, the concrete foundations have to be poured like a traditional home, but then one day an 18-wheeler shows up and the house goes up like an Erector Set,"" Neville said. ""They have wall panels A, B, C and D and the house is framed by the end of the day.”

Offsite construction could save time, money

Steel has been a staple of commercial construction for a century and a half. So, like most commercial construction companies, Jefferson Parish-based RNGD is more than familiar with the material.

“If we’re trying to solve the housing affordability crisis one house at a time, we’re going to get to the end of the world before we fix it,"" Dupre said. ""The key is to do this at scale.”

For Belanger in Houma, that affordability is inextricably linked to durability.

His team plans to build its new steel-framed homes for about $225,000 and sell them for about the same amount, putting any profits back into the program.

""For years, we have not seen any investment in residential developments in impacted areas,"" Belanger said. ""The risk of building in flood-prone areas along with high insurance rates has been a killer, so challenging times require bold efforts.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/77/3777dcdc-a3a0-4c27-95b8-f361e0dd328d/68d4318f23b15.image.jpg?crop=640%2C336%2C0%2C45,N,,2025-09-25 13:03:18.633510

(AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Residents in Gary are already paying to host U.S. Steel with their health — some local officials say they shouldn't have to pay twice.

The cost of sharing Gary with U.S. Steel

Wanda Royal Torres brushes her hand across the roof of her husband's car to show the fine, black soot that settles on her neighborhood from U.S. Steel Gary Works across the street.

""We wash these cars, we rinse them off almost every day — especially this one cause this is like his little sports car — but it gets right back on it,"" she said.

When she grew up in Gary, the steel industry was the glue that held the community together.

Torres's dad worked at a mill. She remembers going to picnics and Christmas programs with other steelworkers and their families.

When thousands of workers got laid off, everything changed. Families moved, businesses closed — the benefits of living near a steel mill went away.

But the heart and lung problems, the cancer risks from the plant's pollution are still there. Torres said her daughter has asthma, but she only needs her inhaler when she comes to visit.

""Every time she hits Gary — she stays a whole day, she has to use that pump,"" Torres said.

Dirtier air isn't the only cost of hosting U.S. Steel. An investigation by Lake County Assessor LaTonya Spearman shows the company might not be paying its fair share of taxes. She said the steel mill's property value has stayed about the same for the past two decades. Generally speaking, the higher your property value is, the more you pay in taxes.

""It hasn't changed where we've seen appreciation for residential properties and for homeowners around 30 percent over the last few years,"" Spearman said.

Four years ago, steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs sold some of its Indiana Harbor property for more than $200,000 per acre. Based on those numbers, Spearman estimates the real land value of Gary Works should be about seven times higher.

""Well I feel kind of angry,"" said Wanda Royal Torres. ""I mean, they tell me if I don't pay my taxes, they taking my house.""

Lawmakers let steel mills estimate costs, set high bar for tax appeals

How did this happen? In the early 2000s, Indiana lawmakers argued local assessors didn't know the steel industry and couldn't determine the value of something like a decades-old blast furnace.

So they allowed steel plants and oil refineries in northern Indiana to estimate the cost of their own equipment and give it a value based on its age.

Instead of local governments checking that math, lawmakers gave the job to the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance. Spearman said if you want to appeal an assessment by the agency:

""The bar is pretty high — it's almost impossible to clear actually for assessing officials,"" she said.

Before she can even petition for an appeal, Spearman said she has to estimate how much that appeal would cost and get it approved by the county council. She also has to present evidence that the appeal is likely to succeed.

""If you've not had an opportunity to actually visit the property, you have no personal knowledge of the facility because you're not charged with assessing it — how would one be expected to have this information?"" Spearman said.

Lake County managed to clear that high bar last year, but ended up withdrawing the appeal. This year, Lake County discussed U.S. Steel's property tax value with the DLGF before it was finalized to see if there was an opportunity to change it, but Spearman said that effort wasn't successful either.

Spearman said the county will continue to weigh its options to ensure U.S. Steel is assessed fairly.

How higher taxes for U.S. Steel could help the city of Gary

Cities that host steel plants like Gary could be missing out on that extra revenue. Gary Common Council President Lori Latham said there's a lot the city could do with that money.

""Road improvements, improved city services, drive by one of our parks, more code enforcement officers, police, fire improvements, technology improvements — the list goes on and on,"" she said.

Even if U.S. Steel's assessed value goes up, it's not clear how much money would actually flow to cities like Gary.

Scott Schmal is the finance director for the Lake County Council. He said if U.S. Steel already pays close to its property tax cap, that higher value won't end up adding that much to city budgets.

Still, U.S. Steel would make up a bigger slice of the taxable pie.

""It wouldn't necessarily mean U.S. Steel would end up paying more. It would mean that the rates would be lower, and potentially homes would pay less. Residents would pay less,"" Schmal said.

Residents, local officials look to the future under U.S. Steel sale

Wanda Royal Torres said U.S. Steel should offset the cost of its pollution by setting up centers for kids who have autism or learning difficulties.

Torres said people are starting to buy property in Gary, but if the city doesn't have a strong foundation — with more businesses than U.S. Steel alone — she worries the community will fracture again.

""That's what I won't want us to do anymore. I don't want to depend on the steel mill anymore. I want to depend on us,"" she said.

Japanese steelmaker Nippon recently acquired U.S. Steel for more than $14 billion.

State Rep. Ragen Hatcher (D-Gary) said Indiana has become welcoming for businesses — and that brings in jobs and tax revenue. But, she said it also has to take the health and financial risks of these businesses into account.

Hatcher pointed to recent layoffs at a steel operation owned by Cleveland-Cliffs in Illinois, close to the Indiana border.

""I just think we have to take all of these things into consideration, especially in the state, when we decide who to support,"" Hatcher said. ""Should we be supporting the people or should we be supporting these businesses? And I think we have to take into account for Cleveland-Cliffs, for U.S. Steel, BP in Whiting. I mean, they're all along our coast line on Lake Michigan. We have to start taking greener production more seriously and the health of the people who live in this area more seriously.""

Hatcher said Gary needs a corporate partner that will ""help the city stabilize and grow.""

Whatever Gary's future holds, city and county officials agree U.S. Steel should pay its fair share. County Assessor LaTonya Spearman said it may be time for Indiana lawmakers to reconsider the way it assesses property like Gary Works.

U.S. Steel said it has ""fully cooperated"" with the Department of Local Government Finance on the property valuation for Gary Works and will continue to do so. The DLGF declined an interview.",https://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/original/file_IvLm2dwm.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 11:02:51.013730

CENTREVILLE, Va., Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Car shoppers are racing to buy electric vehicles before time runs out. With the federal tax credit for new and used EVs and some plug-in hybrids set to expire at the end of September, CARFAX data shows EVs and hybrids are selling much faster than usual, even as their prices hold steady.

Now, EVs and hybrids are selling about 30% faster than they were at the start of the summer, according to CARFAX data. Over the same period, overall vehicle sales have remained mostly steady, despite analysis showing that overall vehicle sales trends typically align with EV and hybrid sales. This gap marks a major shift in consumer buying behavior, as EV and hybrid demand break from traditional sales patterns seen over the last few years.

""EV and hybrid sales are spiking, yet prices remain stable,"" said Patrick Olsen, Editor-in-Chief at CARFAX. ""For shoppers considering a purchase, experts say now is the time to act.""

The Inflation Reduction Act included EV and some plug-in hybrid incentives with a $7,500 tax credit for new models and $4,000 for used ones. This summer, Congress voted to eliminate the credits, setting Sept. 30 as the final day for eligible purchases to qualify.

Here are CARFAX's Top Tips to Help Navigate the Used EV & Hybrid Car Market:

Do Your Research: Always check the CARFAX Vehicle History Report for accident history, service records, and past ownership.

Know Your Budget: Explore financing options early and stay open to different makes and models that fit your price range.

Take a Test Drive: Experience the performance, comfort, and features before buying.

Ask Questions: Inquire about the car's history, pricing, recent repairs, upgrades, battery health, charging options, warranties, and accessories.

Get an Inspection: Have a trusted mechanic do a pre-purchase inspection.

It's very conducive to electric vehicles because you get a lot more predictability over the range of the vehicle,"" he said.

And sales are expected to remain strong even after a federal tax incentive ends next week.

Total sales for electric vehicles have grown 42% in Florida since last year. More than one out of every 10 new cars sold in the state is electric, which is above the national average.

On a recent webinar, the founder of the data and research firm Atlas Public Policy, Nick Nigro, said Florida is an ""attractive"" place for EVs.

""It's very flat. It's very warm. It's very conducive to electric vehicles because you get a lot more predictability over the range of the vehicle,"" he said.

""If you look at the top vehicles in Florida ... It's the Tesla Model Y, it's the Chevy Equinox EV. These are the same vehicles that are most popular nationally,"" he continued.

Even though EVs are really popular in the state, Nigro said, Florida hasn't taken enough advantage of federal funding to increase the number of fast-charging stations.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which was funded by the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021, was the largest investment in EV charging in U.S. history at $5 billion.

Nigro said Florida is slacking on these funds.

""Florida, where are you? You've got to get off the dime. Florida, of all the states in the country, is falling the farthest behind and taking advantage of these federal dollars,"" he said.

ALSO READ: Trump plugged back into bankrolling EV chargers. When will Florida see more?

He encouraged the state to use it while it's available, saying Florida has a ""really great EV market.""

""And I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate having more fast chargers available for them to use,"" he continued.

In January 2025, Florida was awarded $37 million in Round 2 Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grants, which is more than any other state in the Southeast.

According to the SACE transportation report, Florida came second per capita for charging stations in the region and 21st in the nation, with 3,502 fast-charging ports and 8,665 level 2 ports.

Separately, consumers are fast approaching a deadline: They have until Tuesday to utilize a federal tax incentive of up to $7,500 to purchase or lease a new or used electric or hybrid vehicle from former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The breaks were supposed to last until 2032, but were phased out sooner by President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Nigro said the country is heading toward full vehicle electrification, even without the federal tax credit.

""Probably about less than half of the vehicles that were being sold in the last year even qualified for the credit. So, a lot of vehicles are being purchased by Americans without the credit in place,"" he said.

Although, Nigro added, the timeline for electrification is going to be stretched out a bit.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/038416b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+643/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2Fa1%2F34ea68ac41e2afb8ea16437614e2%2Felectric-vehicle-tesla-near-water.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 10:01:23.239644

The commission also reports that it is working on the regulations for deep Class V geothermal reinjection wells, and that it expects these to be ready by the first quarter of 2026.

As mandated by the Texas Natural Resources Code, “the exploration, development, and production of geothermal energy and associated resources on public and private land for the purpose of conservation and the protection of correlative rights” falls under the powers and duties of the Texas RCC. This gives them the authority to adopt rules as necessary to regulate, as well as issue permits for geothermal injection wells.

The published Class V geothermal reinjection well regulation, under Subchapter A of Chapter 6 of the State Regulations for the Texas RCC, allows for a “permit by rule” for shallow closed-loop geothermal injection wells. This greatly simplifies and streamlines the permitting process, giving developers greater confidence to move forward with planned projects.

The new regulation also provides an updated definition of a shallow closed-loop geothermal system as follows:

A closed-loop geothermal injection well, including all heat pumps and tubing, heat transfer fluids, and connections from the injection well to the infrastructure and the geothermal heat exchange system, that operates as a heat source or heat sink in concert with a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system designed to heat or cool infrastructure. These systems are also called “ground source heat pump systems.” All energy used from this type of system is consumed by the onsite infrastructure and is not provided to an energy market.

We led on tailpipe standards, pioneered cap-and-invest and showed the world that advancing on clean energy and building the world’s fourth-largest economy can go hand in hand.

But there’s one sector we’ve kept on the backburner: the factories across the state that use old technologies to make the goods we love and depend on, from tortilla chips to toilet paper. California’s industrial sector is the second-largest source of climate pollution in the state, and it severely lacks the resources needed to help businesses modernize facilities to cut climate and air pollution.

The good news is that solutions are ready to go: Industrial heat pumps and thermal batteries can clean up manufacturing today, and we can seize this opportunity with Assembly Bill 1280. Introduced by Assemblymember Robert Garcia, D-Rancho Cucamonga, this bill would expand the California Energy Commission’s Industrial Decarbonization and Improvement of Grid Operations grant program.

A Merced County cheese processor and a large industrial laundry in Stanislaus County have already used this program to make the switch to cleaner technologies, proving these upgrades can simultaneously reduce local pollution, create jobs, cut climate emissions, reduce operating costs and help stabilize our electric grid.

The bill would also make it easier for manufacturers to afford upgrades by providing low-cost loans through the state’s Green Bank — an initiative of the state treasurer’s office that finances projects aimed at sustainability — and ensure projects meet strong labor standards and prioritize communities that have borne the brunt of industrial pollution.

Modernizing this antiquated machinery is also critical for Californians’ health. The industrial sector’s outdated equipment is a huge source of pollution. According to a recent report from the American Lung Association, upgrading industrial heating equipment from gas combustion to zero-emissions equipment could protect 3,220 Californians from an early death and prevent nearly 2 million asthma attacks in California by 2050 — delivering an estimated $47.5 billion in public health benefits statewide.

Beyond its health benefits, modernizing our manufacturing sector is a smart economic strategy. More than 35,000 manufacturers across the state employ over 1.3 million people and contribute 12% of California’s gross domestic product.

Supporting the installation of clean, efficient heating technologies is an opportunity to keep consumer goods affordable and ensure manufacturers continue to operate here and employ workers across California for decades to come.

AB 1280 has the united support of labor unions, manufacturers, environmental justice groups, Republicans and Democrats because it demonstrates a commitment to California’s workers, communities and global competitiveness.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/ofo2wt/picture312249063/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Imagn-21943491.JPG,N,,2025-09-25 10:01:14.429891

US equities’ capitalisation is approximately 64% of the FTSE Global All Cap Index. As such, US equities cannot be considered a monolithic investment, and important geographic (regional and state) differences may become important to investors once they have access to convenient geographic investment vehicles.

The Russell approach to providing US equity indices has been to give investors more choice over granular subsets of the very large US equity market. FTSE Russell recently launched a new series of US state indices (based on company headquarters location) adding a geographic dimension, with the Russell Texas Equity Index being the first.

Texas is a large and growing part of the US economy that seems to have macro tailwinds—a large and growing population, a correspondingly large and growing GDP, and a relatively high GDP per capita. Investment based on the Texas index could help investors focus on participating in its economic growth potential.

The Texas economy has historically been driven by the energy industry, but more recently it has become a hotbed of technological innovation. This changing economy is reflected in the evolution of the Texas index’s industry composition. This balance between old and new industries could be attractive for some investors, either for strategic long-term allocations, or more tactical allocations if investors have a particular view on the direction of markets.

A state’s business environment is key when companies are able to move headquarters. Several innovative, fast-growing companies, both in technology and beyond, have moved their locus of operations to Texas in recent years. This reflects advantages the state offers for businesses to thrive in terms of a business-friendly operational environment and the availability of or ability to attract a talented workforce. Capitalising on this trend, the Texas index may present investors with another investment theme to consider.

ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- [[Page 46068]] SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Delaware. The SIP revision addresses Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements for the enactment of a Basic vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for the Delaware portion (i.e., New Castle County) of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE Nonattainment Area (Philadelphia NAA) for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).

Kennedy Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. The telephone number is (215) 814-2026. Mr. Adam Lewis can also be reached via electronic mail at Lewis.Adam@epa.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On June 11, 2025 (90 FR 24554), the EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the State of Delaware. In the NPRM, the EPA proposed approval of a formal SIP revision, ``Basic Performance Standard Certification for New Castle County Inspection and Maintenance Program'' (Basic I/M Certification SIP), that was submitted by Delaware on February 14, 2024. The Basic I/M Certification SIP was submitted to satisfy the applicable CAA requirements for the New Castle County portion of the Philadelphia NAA for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This Basic I/M certification SIP revision was submitted prior to the reclassification of the Philadelphia NAA from Moderate to Serious nonattainment for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS (89 FR 61025, July 30, 2024). CAA section 182(c)(3) requires states with areas designated as Serious or above to submit SIP revisions that provide for the implementation of an Enhanced I/M program in certain urbanized areas of the NAA. As noted in the NPRM, that requirement will be addressed at a later date. On October 7, 2022, the EPA determined that the Philadelphia NAA failed to attain the 2015 ozone NAAQS by its August 3, 2021 attainment date and reclassified the area from Marginal to Moderate nonattainment.\1\ The requirements for a Moderate ozone nonattainment area include a Basic vehicle I/M program. CAA section 182(b)(4). The Basic I/M requirements are further articulated in the EPA's I/M Rule at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 51, subpart S.\2\ The Federal performance standards \3\ for a Basic I/M program are outlined in 40 CFR 51.352. Consistent with the I/M Rule, areas with existing I/M programs need to conduct and submit a performance standard modeling analysis as well as make any necessary program revisions as part of their Moderate area SIP submissions to ensure that I/M programs are operating at or above the Basic I/M performance standard level for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS. These areas may determine through the performance standard modeling analysis that an existing SIP-approved program would meet the performance standard for purposes of the 2015 ozone NAAQS without modification. In this case, the state could submit a SIP revision with the associated performance modeling and a written statement certifying their determination in lieu of submitting revised regulations.\4\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ 87 FR 60897 (October 7, 2022). \2\ See 40 CFR 51.350(a) for nonattainment area population I/M criteria applicability. \3\ An I/M performance standard is a collection of program design elements which defines a benchmark program to which a state's proposed I/M program is compared in terms of its potential to reduce emissions of the ozone precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). \4\ See section II.E of the October 7, 2022 final rule (87 FR 60897, 60906) and the April 13, 2022 proposal (87 FR 21842). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- II. Summary of SIP Revision and EPA's Analysis Delaware submitted the February 14, 2024, SIP revision to address this Basic I/M program requirement for the Delaware portion of the 2015 ozone Philadelphia NAA as required for the Moderate classification. Due to more stringent nonattainment classifications under previous ozone NAAQS and Delaware's inclusion as part of the Ozone Transport Region (OTR),\5\ Delaware previously established and continues to implement an Alternate Low Enhanced I/M program in New Castle County and Kent County.\6\ The EPA recently approved (via a final rule published November 4, 2024, 89 FR 87500) updates to Delaware's prior approved I/M SIP that were submitted in March 2023.\7\ This previous I/M program revision included regulatory updates made between the inception of Delaware's current Alternate Low Enhanced I/M program and March 2023. In approving this March 2023 SIP revision, the EPA's November 2024 action determined that the current I/M program in New Castle County (and Kent County) met the applicable CAA requirements for an Alternate Low Enhanced I/M program, a more stringent standard than a Basic program for which Delaware now seeks certification. Delaware's Alternate Low Enhanced I/M program (applicable to the Kent and New Castle Counties) was originally codified at Delaware Code Title 7, Regulation 31.\8\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ The Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton NAA was previously classified as severe nonattainment under the now revoked 1979 ozone NAAQS. CAA Section 184(b)(1)(A) provides that an area within a state in an ozone transport region and with a metropolitan statistical area population of 100,000 or more must implement an enhanced I/M program. \6\ See 40 CFR 51.351(g) for the Alternate Low Enhanced Performance Standard. \7\ See 89 FR 87500 (November 4, 2024) and 89 FR 66295 (August 15, 2024) for these actions and a summary of the Delaware specific CAA requirements for I/M Programs, additional background on the Ozone NAAQS, and resulting Delaware Area Ozone Nonattainment Designation. \8\ Recodified by the State as 7 DE Admin. Code 1131 in 2012. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pursuant to the February 14, 2024, SIP submittal, the EPA concurs with the State's determination that the Delaware I/M program for New Castle County (within the 2015 Ozone Philadelphia NAA) meets the applicable performance standard and requirements for a Basic I/M program. Further details of Delaware's Alternate Low Enhanced I/M program, the February 14, 2024 SIP submittal, and the rationale for the EPA's proposed (and now final) action are explained in the NPRM and will not be restated here. III. EPA's Response to Comments Received The EPA's June 11, 2025 NPRM (90 FR 24554) opened a 30-day public comment period, which closed on July 11, 2025. The EPA received one anonymous comment that is generally supportive of enforcement and strengthening of the NAAQS. The comment provides no further [[Page 46069]] explanation or context as to the relevancy to this action. Therefore, the EPA is not responding to this comment. IV. Final Action The EPA is approving the Basic I/M Certification SIP submitted by Delaware on February 14, 2024 for the New Castle County Portion of the Philadelphia NAA for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS as satisfying the applicable CAA requirements. V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Clean Air Act and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, this action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. For that reason, this action: Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993); Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866; Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.); Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4); Does not have federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999); Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it approves a state program; Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act. In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian Tribe has demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This action is subject to the Congressional Review Act, and the EPA will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 24, 2025. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Jeep announced last year that it would introduce a plug-in hybrid version of its Gladiator pickup truck by the end of 2025.

However, in September, the Jeep Gladiator 4xe became the latest EV model on the chopping block.

A spokesperson for the brand, which is owned by European conglomerate Stellantis, told TechCrunch that Jeep no longer planned to include an electrified Gladiator in its product lineup after ""reassessing its product strategy."" Jeep cited changing customer preferences as the reason for the shift.

Another Stellantis brand, US-based truck maker Ram, announced its own EV shift earlier in September.

The company said it would discontinue production of the REV 1500, a full-sized electric pickup truck that Ram had positioned as a challenger to Ford's F-150 Lightning. Ram said the decision was in response to slowing demand for EV trucks in North America.

Porsche had bet heavily on luxury EVs, but the German carmaker announced it would shelve plans to build an electrified SUV and pivot back to gasoline-powered and hybrid models.

The German carmaker, which has faced falling sales in EV-friendly China, said it would take a €1.8 billion ($2.2 billion) hit over the strategy shift, sparking a record share price plunge.

British brand Bentley, known for its ultra-classy luxury motors, has also walked back plans to stop selling combustion-engine vehicles completely by 2035,

CEO Frank-Steffen Walliser told Autocar on September 22 that Bentley was now planning to build new gasoline versions of its most popular models, rather than just offering them as hybrids or EVs.

(NYSE American: HUSA) (“HUSA” or the “Company”) and Abundia Global Impact Group (“AGIG”), today announced that production from the State Finkle Unit wells has commenced, with first revenue received.

On June 17, 2024, HUSA announced plans to participate in the drilling of six wells, each with approximately three-mile laterals, on the State Finkle Unit in the Wolfcamp formation in Reeves County, Texas.

In September 2025, the Company received its first royalties from production at the initial wells.

“It is great to see that the funds invested in these wells have started delivering a return for the shareholders,” stated Ed Gillespie, Chief Executive Officer of HUSA. “The revenues will serve to help fund the Company’s transformation from an oil and gas exploration company into a global leader in the renewable energy space, demonstrating how our traditional operations can help fund and support that transition.”

EOG Resources acts as operator and is the principal working interest owner. The unit includes acreage subject to our existing O’Brien lease. HUSA holds approximately 0.0078 working interest in the unit. The State Finkle Unit is expected to provide ongoing royalty income over the life of the wells, reinforcing HUSA’s strategy of leveraging legacy oil and gas interests to help fund its transition into renewables.

“Canada’s auto industry is facing an existential crisis, with U.S. tariffs threatening current and future product investments, including electric vehicles,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne.
Mexico recently raised its tariffs to 50% in response to surging imports that now represent 70% of its EV market.
“We need to work constructively to protect North American auto jobs and supply chains.” In its submission, Unifor recommended that the federal government: Maintain the existing 100% surtax on imported Chinese EVs for an additional 24 months.

“Canada’s auto industry is facing an existential crisis, with U.S. tariffs threatening current and future product investments, including electric vehicles,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne. “Lifting tariffs on China, will make a bad situation far worse, if Canada becomes a dumping ground for cheap, unfairly subsidized imports.”

Unifor’s submission to the government’s Section 53 China Electric Vehicle Surtax Review underscores that unfair competition from Chinese automakers – backed by massive state subsidies, labour rights abuses, and coal-powered production – poses an immediate threat to Canadian jobs and the country’s automotive supply chain, including the steel and aluminum sectors.

Since 2020, Canada has positioned itself for growth in the automotive sector by securing investments in vehicle assembly programs, battery production, and critical mineral processing. Unifor warns that recent disruptions, from U.S. tariffs on Canadian-built vehicles, to policy rollbacks on EV supports, to rising Chinese import penetration, threaten to reverse these hard-won gains.

“As of August 2025, one-third of our members at Detroit Three facilities in Canada are on layoff, with three assembly plants sitting idle,” said Payne. “At a time when auto workers are facing layoffs and uncertainty, lifting the surtax would be nothing short of a self-inflicted wound.”

Unifor emphasized that, along with efforts to secure a zero-tariff resolution to the U.S. tariff dispute, Canada must remain aligned with its CUSMA partners regarding Chinese vehicle and parts imports. The United States maintains combined tariffs of 127.5% on Chinese EVs and is preparing restrictions on Chinese “connected car” technology by 2027. Mexico recently raised its tariffs to 50% in response to surging imports that now represent 70% of its EV market.

“There is no strategic advantage for Canada to go it alone,” Payne said. “We need to work constructively to protect North American auto jobs and supply chains.”

In its submission, Unifor recommended that the federal government:

Maintain the existing 100% surtax on imported Chinese EVs for an additional 24 months.

Extend surtaxes to strategic EV and battery-related components.

Reinstate and expand federal EV rebate programs, with conditions to prioritize Canadian- and North American-built vehicles.

Strengthen enforcement against goods produced with forced labour.

“Workers have done everything asked of them to build Canada’s auto industry for the future,” added Payne. “Now it’s time for government to stand firm, defend our industry, and ensure our net-zero future is made in Canada with good, union jobs at its core.”

Fermi's Gas Generation Equipment Secured or under LOI to Date Now Totals 2.0 GW of Combined Cycle Power at ISO Conditions, Scheduled for 2026 Delivery

Siemens Energy Displays Strong U.S. Commitment Via Gas Turbine Allocation and Highlights its Broadening Nuclear Capabilities Via AP1000 Steam Turbine Collaboration

AMARILLO, Texas, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America, in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, is announcing two landmark letters of intent with Siemens Energy to secure 1.1 GW (at ISO conditions once in combined cycle mode) of Frame F Class Generation Equipment for 2026 delivery and collaborate on Siemens' flagship nuclear steam turbine technologies, in support of Fermi's 11-Gigawatt AI campus.

These agreements mark a major milestone in the fulfillment of President Donald J. Trump's promise to restore U.S. energy dominance and to ensure America wins the global race to power the future of artificial intelligence.

Under the first letter of intent, Siemens Energy will negotiate to deliver three F-class SGT6-5000F gas turbine units, producing up to 1.1 GW at ISO conditions once in combined cycle mode. These turbines are proven, efficient, industrial-grade machines capable of highly reliable 24/7 base load applications.

""Winning the AI arms race doesn't just take software developers. It takes more electricity,"" said Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum. ""This campus proves that we can integrate natural gas, nuclear energy, and artificial intelligence into a single, powerful ecosystem. Modern energy infrastructure isn't a luxury, it's the foundation of global leadership. By advancing President Trump's Energy Dominance Agenda, we're not just fueling America — we're powering the future of intelligence.""

Fermi's campus was envisioned as a flagship example of the Trump administration's strategy: pairing advanced, reliable, quickly-deployable natural gas generation with nuclear power and modern infrastructure to ensure the U.S. can safely meet America's growing energy demand—particularly from AI and high-performance computing. With the new agreements, Fermi's gas generation equipment secured or under LOI to date now totals 2.0 GW of combined cycle power at ISO conditions, scheduled for 2026 delivery.

""No one understands the global energy race better than Donald Trump,"" said former U.S Secretary of Energy and Fermi Co-Founder Rick Perry. ""The Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and Department of Defense are all working tirelessly to secure America's position in this AI race and to ensure that our private sector, with the strong support of this pro-energy administration, has what we need to lead the way in abundant, reliable, and innovative energy solutions.""

""I want to thank President Trump for his strong leadership and action in clearing the path for companies like ours to help America win this race,"" added Toby Neugebauer, Fermi America CEO and Co-Founder. ""Fermi America is doing what it takes 24/7 to build exactly what the President has asked for, highly reliable, unshakable, base load energy — through our 11 GW gas-bridged nuclear build. We understand the stakes are high and we are playing to win – because that's how America keeps its AI edge.""

The second letter of intent furthers the two companies' collaboration on integrating Siemens' industry-leading steam turbines, generators, and control systems into Fermi's expanding nuclear power portfolio, which include the deployment of an expected four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors.

Siemens Energy brings deep expertise, demonstrated by several modernizations of turbines and generators at multiple nuclear plants. Fermi and Siemens Energy will work closely to deliver nuclear generation with clean, efficient, robust performance.

This framework aligns with the Trump administration's executive orders to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment, streamline nuclear regulation, and ensure that the U.S. infrastructure needed for AI and data centers has the clean, reliable, always-on power that only nuclear and strategic redundancies can provide, without unnecessarily putting a strain on the public grid.

Not only do these agreements reinforce the administration's goal of U.S. energy dominance by expanding domestic, reliable, low-carbon power, they deliver on President Donald J. Trump's pledge to speed up nuclear licensing and regulation, rebuild the nuclear industrial base, and expand natural gas generation to meet the urgency of demand.

Costly challenges to build nuclear generation Building nuclear power reactors in Oklahoma would require a financial investment that outweighs other forms of generation.
Brandy Wreath, executive director of the OCC, said companies could one day build nuclear energy infrastructure using the new law.
Oklahoma's past with nuclear energy fuel Although the state has never generated nuclear energy, it was home to several processing plants for nuclear fuel owned by the Kerr-McGee Corporation.
""When you move from support for nuclear energy broadly to, 'Should I have one sited nearby,' the conversation becomes different,"" he said.","If energy analysts are correct, a tidal wave of electricity demand is on Oklahoma's horizon. Data centers are being welcomed into the state and framed as economic boons for communities like Pryor and, soon, Stillwater.

In three years, data centers could account for up to 12% of the country's energy consumption, according to the U.S. Department of Energy and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

To satisfy that projected demand, utility companies like Public Service Company of Oklahoma are asking the state to encourage new energy generation.

A new state law requiring utility regulators to investigate a future with advanced nuclear energy generation could fit the bill. A working group of researchers, utilities and experts is being assembled for a feasibility study on the low-carbon energy that will wrap up in March.

In an energy landscape primarily comprised of natural gas and wind generation, the regulating agency sought outside help to decide the state's nuclear future.

""We don't regulate nuclear energy here at the commission. We don't have nuclear experts,"" said Mark Argenbright, director of the OCC's public utility division. ""So, to create this report, we went to the Hamm Institute and partnered with them, and we're identifying nuclear experts that we have access to that can speak to these nuclear issues.""

The Southwest Power Pool, of which Oklahoma is a part, reports the nuclear energy footprint across the transmission organization is small. Wind is the largest contributor, followed by natural gas and coal, according to a spokesperson with the corporation.

Researchers with the University of Oklahoma's Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis will also be part of the group. They've collected data on the public perception of nuclear energy going back to the 1990s.

Argenbright said he has seen a shift in the way people view nuclear power as energy demands climb.

""Growing up in the 60s and 70s, public perception was completely different,"" he said. ""Those things seem to be changing, and I think those are driven by the need – the hyperscalers with AI and data centers – there's a need for massive amounts of energy.""

Public perception of renewable energy could also be changing in Oklahoma, even as experts warn of the incoming energy demand.

Lawmakers this year targeted renewable energy in multiple bills, including Senate Bill 2, which opponents said would have restricted the wind industry in certain parts of the state. Some of those same legislators voted to pass the nuclear energy feasibility study bill, including Rep. Brad Boles (R-Marlow), who co-authored the measure.

The lawmaker, who is also campaigning for a seat on the Corporation Commission next year, said nuclear energy could provide dependable generation for the state. Although batteries can store extra energy from wind and solar to be called upon during high demand, they're still not seen as continuous sources.

""There's no doubt that nuclear is considered a more reliable baseload energy source than wind/solar, which are considered intermittent sources, but nuclear is also more costly than any of our current energy sources due to the initial [capital expenditure] cost,"" he said in an email.

Boles said the study should determine if advanced nuclear energy is safe, practical, cost-effective and beneficial for long-term generation.

Costly challenges to build nuclear generation

Building nuclear power reactors in Oklahoma would require a financial investment that outweighs other forms of generation. Traditional nuclear technology can cost tens of billions of dollars, like Georgia's Plant Vogtle, which finished last year.

Newer tech, such as advanced small modular reactors, would also come with a steep price. The technology is designed to be safer, but has yet to come on the market.

Should a utility company receive approval to build a reactor in Oklahoma, the cost would likely be passed down to customers the same way as other power plants.

""So, the need has to be pretty significant to justify the investment,"" Argenbright said. ""Now, I've seen where some of the hyperscalers, be it Google or Microsoft, they're entering into some agreements to have these kinds of facilities built, and they're taking on a very significant piece of the financial picture to overcome that initial investment that's required.""

""I think it's going to cause some creative looks at financing and, of course, in our traditional role here at the commission, impact on ratepayer is something we're very concerned about,"" he said.

A new option for large companies building data centers in Oklahoma is to generate energy on-site. House Bill 1374, authored by Boles, gives entities a ""behind-the-meter"" alternative, allowing them to generate power while unplugged from the grid.

Brandy Wreath, executive director of the OCC, said companies could one day build nuclear energy infrastructure using the new law.

""As long as they follow all the appropriate state and federal laws, they can build a power plant,"" he said. ""And as long as they're using the power, they can do whatever they want.""

Utility companies in Oklahoma have submitted public comments to the OCC with general information on the potential for nuclear energy.

Western Farmers Electric Cooperative said its energy mix is heavily reliant on renewables and encourages an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to generation. It said it supports the OCC's feasibility study. According to OG&E, the company sought proposals in 2024 for energy generation but did not receive any for nuclear power. It also said it wants to maintain a diverse mix of sources.

PSO stressed in its public comment that nuclear energy is safe and dispatchable. The Corporation Commission can minimize the risk of financial burden on customers by allowing utilities to recover costs early in the process, it said, rather than carry costs forward.

PSO's parent company, American Electric Power, currently operates a nuclear power plant in Michigan.

Once a nuclear energy site is running, the cost to generate power is relatively low, according to Hank Jenkins-Smith, director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis. He and Kuhika Gupta, associate director, are part of the OCC's working group.

Gupta said communities with nuclear energy generation could see collateral financial benefits.

"" Places that have these types of low-cost energy availability, they might get, indirectly, an economic boon from industry that wants to come there,"" she said. ""Because, from a grid perspective, there's easy availability of low-cost, reliable energy.""

Oklahoma's past with nuclear energy fuel

Although the state has never generated nuclear energy, it was home to several processing plants for nuclear fuel owned by the Kerr-McGee Corporation. Workplace accidents, and later the death of laboratory technician Karen Silkwood, shaped national conversations about nuclear energy. The company closed its fuel operations in Oklahoma years later.

Matthew Pearce, state historian for the Oklahoma Historical Society, said most residents likely associate nuclear energy with large silos and notable accidents.

""But in the case of Oklahoma, it's much more subtle,"" he said. ""The Cimarron facility near Crescent, for instance, many people would likely drive by that every day, not knowing the amount of uranium and plutonium that was processed there.""

In the 1970s, PSO proposed a nuclear energy plant near downtown Inola. But safety concerns and community protests brought the plans to a halt. According to The Oklahoman, more than 600 activists were arrested while protesting over the course of two years.

The state should consider past events and consult communities that might host future reactors before deciding whether to welcome the nuclear energy industry, Pearce said. Uranium left from the Crescent facility still contaminates the surrounding groundwater, according to documents obtained by KOCO.

""As a historian, I would advise thinking holistically, thinking historically, thinking about what's happened in the past, what's worked and what hasn't,"" he said. ""Thinking about who's at the table and who's not, and why that might be the case, and how, potentially, to resolve those issues.""

The study will consider the potential siting of nuclear energy technology, Argenbright said. Since the generated power needs transmission, he said coal plants could potentially be appropriate for future reactors.

Researcher Jenkins-Smith said finding the right locations and understanding residents' safety concerns will be key.

""When you move from support for nuclear energy broadly to, 'Should I have one sited nearby,' the conversation becomes different,"" he said. ""And so the challenge, particularly in a state like Oklahoma that doesn't have much of a nuclear history, is going to be how those narratives get managed and negotiated.""

Protecting Property Rights, Powering Rural Economies includes case studies of farmers, township officials, and county leaders with firsthand experience navigating these issues.
This economic opportunity requires a siting and permitting system that supports, rather than hinders, that right.
Local leaders support landowner rights, see solar as an economic and national security benefit, and support clear, transparent zoning standards.
To support responsible energy siting in rural communities while respecting local values, landowner rights, and economic opportunity, we recommend the following actions by state leaders, local governments, and developers:","Rural landowners want the same things as most Americans: the freedom to make decisions about their own property, the ability to support their families, and the opportunity to pass on their way of life to future generations.

But as economic uncertainty, rising input costs, and generational turnover continue to reshape agriculture and land use, many rural landowners are looking for ways to keep their land and keep generating income. Many are turning to clean energy leasing. It’s a way to add another “crop” to their field and keep their farms family-owned and operated.

Evergreen Action and the Private Property Rights Institute (PPRI)—two organizations with different ideological roots but shared goals around energy independence, individual freedoms, and rural economic development—partnered to interview rural stakeholders in Michigan and Pennsylvania about their experiences with energy siting on their land and in their communities. Protecting Property Rights, Powering Rural Economies includes case studies of farmers, township officials, and county leaders with firsthand experience navigating these issues.

The takeaways were clear: Rural landowners want the freedom to decide what’s best for their property, and many are voluntarily choosing to lease their land for energy infrastructure as a way to generate revenue, continue to own their operations, and make ends meet for their families. But too often, that opportunity is blocked by misinformation, permitting delays, and politically motivated restrictions that undermine landowners’ right to make decisions about their own property.

This economic opportunity requires a siting and permitting system that supports, rather than hinders, that right. These resources are intended to guide local decision-makers, legislators, and energy developers as they work to improve permitting processes.

Farmers in Michigan and Pennsylvania want the freedom to lease clean energy on their property to support their businesses and the local economy. Local leaders support landowner rights, see solar as an economic and national security benefit, and support clear, transparent zoning standards.

Protecting landowner freedom and streamlining energy development are not mutually exclusive goals; in fact, they are in the same vein.

Here's what landowners and decisionmakers are saying in their own words, and the policies that make their needs possible.

The facility is X-ELIO’s maiden combined solar and storage project in the US. The American arm of the German chemicals group BASF will source 48 MW of electricity from the Liberty project to power its Freeport site under a 12-year PPA announced in 2022. “Thanks to our partnership with X-ELIO, we are able to supply 100% of our expected purchased power at our Freeport site from renewable sources,” said BASF Freeport Senior Vice President and General Manager, Brad Morrison.

Turning EVs into power plants: Residential solar and storage company Sunrun has activated the US’s 1st residential vehicle-to-grid distributed power plant with Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), using Ford F-150 Lightning trucks to send stored energy to the grid during peak demand. The pilot program, which began with vehicle-to-home capability last year, now dispatches power from 3 participating customers’ trucks to both their homes and the grid. Starting in July, the enrolled F-150 Lightning trucks dispatched energy to the grid between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. on weekdays, earning participating customers a payment based on the amount of energy shared – up to a maximum of $1,000 for the dispatching season that runs through the end of September. Sunrun says that the initiative showcases how electric vehicles can support grid reliability, lower costs, and offer new income streams while advancing clean energy goals.

“We’ve long been interested in safer, more flexible battery materials,” said Lutkenhaus.
Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, which rely on metals and petrochemicals, this new material is derived entirely from renewable biological sources.
“As a chemist, my most exciting moment was when Professor Lutkenhaus’ laboratory demonstrated that our materials could be fabricated into working battery systems,” Wooley said.
“It was a confirmation that the strategy has promise to move forward.” Lutkenhaus added, “Seeing the materials come together in a functioning battery was a major milestone.","A team of researchers at Texas A&M University, including Distinguished Professor of Chemistry Dr. Karen Wooley and Professor of Chemical Engineering Dr. Jodie Lutkenhaus, has developed a biodegradable battery using natural polymers. Its findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Wooley’s research group in the College of Arts and Sciences has spent the past 15 years shifting toward natural products for the construction of sustainable and degradable plastics materials. Lutkenhaus, associate dean for research in the College of Engineering, has been using organic materials to design a better battery. She suggested collaboration to combine Wooley’s naturally sourced polymers with her battery expertise.

“We’ve long been interested in safer, more flexible battery materials,” said Lutkenhaus. “When Dr. Wooley’s lab began developing these naturally sourced polymers, it opened the door to something entirely new — a battery that could perform well and also disappear safely when it’s no longer needed.”

A battery made from vitamin B2 and amino acids

The new material is made from two key ingredients found in nature: riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, and L-glutamic acid, an amino acid that helps build proteins in the body.

“Those components were identified by a talented recent Ph.D. graduate, Dr. Shih-Guo Li, who began his dissertation research five years ago with the intention of enhancing the content of bio-renewable building blocks for organic polymer battery construction,” Wooley said. “He then developed synthetic methods to connect the molecular building blocks into chain-like structures called polypeptides.”

What makes this material special is that it’s redox-active, which means it can gain and lose electrons. This is how batteries store and release energy. In this case, the riboflavin handles the energy, while the polypeptide provides structure and helps the material break down naturally.

Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, which rely on metals and petrochemicals, this new material is derived entirely from renewable biological sources. It’s designed to degrade safely when exposed to water or enzymes, making it a promising solution for reducing battery waste, especially in cases where batteries aren’t properly recycled.

“Although there are significant efforts to recycle batteries, in cases where batteries are not actively collected and processed for recycling, they should be capable of undergoing breakdown naturally and with release of non-toxic degradation products,” Wooley said.

Safer for the environment and living cells

In lab tests, the material showed its suitability as an anode, the part of a battery that stores electrons. Importantly, the material was also shown to be non-toxic to fibroblast cells, a type of cell found in connective tissue.

“At this point, we’ve merely confirmed that our materials are cytocompatible, meaning they are non-harmful to cells,” said Wooley. “This may matter if the materials were to be used in implantable or wearable devices.”

Lutkenhaus said the performance results were especially promising given the material’s natural origins.

“We were excited to see that the electrochemical behavior was on par with synthetic non-sustainable polymeric materials,” she said. “It shows that you don’t have to sacrifice performance to gain sustainability.”

Toward a circular future for battery design

The researchers say this kind of design — starting with the end in mind — is key to building a more sustainable future. Instead of creating materials that last forever and become waste, they’re designing them to be part of a circular economy, where materials are reused, recycled or safely returned to nature.

“I like to consider every synthetic material that my laboratory produces as being a point along its journey toward function and purpose,” Wooley said, “with an ability to perform physical and chemical transformations that allow reuse of the molecular components in several other directions.

“Most extreme in this case, the batteries could become edible to provide a different kind of ‘energy’ supply.”

For now, the team is focused on improving the material’s performance and finding ways to make it more affordable. Currently, the chemical process used to make the material is too expensive for commercial use.

“We need to improve performance and then develop processes that would be profitable,” Wooley said. “That could require 5-10 years.”

The excitement of interdisciplinary collaboration

One of the most exciting parts of the project, the researchers say, was the collaboration across Texas A&M colleges.

“As a chemist, my most exciting moment was when Professor Lutkenhaus’ laboratory demonstrated that our materials could be fabricated into working battery systems,” Wooley said. “It was a confirmation that the strategy has promise to move forward.”

Lutkenhaus added, “Seeing the materials come together in a functioning battery was a major milestone. It validated the concept and gave us a clear direction for future development.”

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivered its advisory opinion on climate change on 23 July 2025, holding that States are obligated to limit climate change and are responsible for climate damages. This ICJ advisory opinion offered crucial interpretations of human rights obligations in the climate crisis. How can States now leverage the ICJ’s guidance to meet their obligations regarding climate change mitigation, adaptation, and loss & damage?

With a Climate Summit on the agenda for the UN General Assembly (UNGA) session in September 2025, this blog post argues that States should draw from the ICJ advisory opinion to call for a UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on Climate Change. This UNGASS could provide an opportunity to debate and adopt a ‘Declaration of Commitment to Climate Action’ – with human rights-based commitments that complement, not duplicate, obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement (‘the climate treaties’). Facilitating accountability for State action, the Declaration should also request the UN Secretary-General to report periodically to the UNGA on States’ progress in achieving the commitments in the Declaration.

Climate Change Before International Courts and Tribunals

In March 2023, the UN General Assembly requested that the ICJ issue an advisory opinion on international legal obligations, including human rights obligations, to protect vulnerable populations and future generations from the adverse effects of climate change. Drawing from wide-ranging testimony by national governments and intergovernmental organizations, the ICJ advisory opinion (para. 172) held that States’ obligations to address climate change are governed by a wide range of applicable laws, including certain environmental treaties, core human rights treaties, and customary international law.

This ICJ advisory opinion is in line with the evolving consensus of the UN General Assembly and the UN human rights system. Other international courts and tribunals and adjudicating bodies such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as the UN Human Rights Council, Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the UN Special Rapporteurs on the human right to a healthy environment and on human rights and climate change have all provided extensive guidance on human rights-based approaches to climate change.

Applying these rights in April 2024, the European Court of Human Rights, recognizing the right to health of older women, held in KlimaSeniorinnen and Others v Switzerland [para 573] that the Swiss authorities had not acted in a timely and appropriate way to devise, develop, and implement relevant legislation and measures to address climate change. In May 2024, an advisory opinion [para 66] issued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) similarly noted that climate change represents an existential threat and raises human rights concerns. Drawing from these previous decisions in July 2025, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights delivered an advisory opinion [part VII (1)] declaring that the climate crisis is a human rights emergency.

A UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on Climate Change

The ICJ advisory opinion, affirming international legal guidance across the global governance system, must now be supported by political commitments in the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly has already begun to engage with the human rights implications of climate change, recognizing in 2022 the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and affirming the importance of the environment to the enjoyment of all human rights. Building from this engagement at its 80th session in September 2025, the General Assembly will have a unique opportunity to request that the UN Secretary-General convene an UNGASS to debate the climate crisis, the advisory opinion from the ICJ and decisions of other global and regional courts and tribunals, the human rights implications of climate injustice, and the inadequate progress in achieving the Paris Agreement goals.

In this context, the UN General Assembly is authorized to hold high-level Special Sessions to address urgent, wide-ranging concerns, as seen in previous special sessions on corruption, COVID-19, drugs, children, and the HIV pandemic. An UNGASS may be convened by the UN Secretary-General at the request of the UN Security Council or a majority of UN Member States (UN Charter: art. 20). Voting at the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement Conferences of Parties (CoPs) requires a consensus, and motions can be blocked by a single country. This limitation has long stalled progress at the CoPs. However, the General Assembly only requires a simple majority to adopt a decision to convene a Special Session. Given that the General Assembly request for an ICJ advisory opinion in 2023 was sponsored by more than 130 States and adopted without a vote, it is likely that the simple majority needed to request an UNGASS on Climate Change could easily be obtained.

Commitments to Human Rights-based Climate Action to Complement the Climate Treaties

This proposed UNGASS on Climate Change should reflect the ICJ’s guidance, address the human rights implications of climate injustice, and aim to complement, not duplicate, obligations and processes under the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. The climate treaties focus on inter-state processes: the Paris Agreement goals, national political commitments expressed in States’ Nationally Determined Contributions, and periodic reporting of progress and replanning. By contrast, the international human rights treaties and related customary international law also set out States’ obligations to respect, protect, and fulfil the human rights of their citizens and other persons within their jurisdictions. The ICJ advisory opinion has clarified that States have obligations to respond to the climate crisis under both the climate and human rights legal regimes [paras 369-404].

The UNFCCC Secretariat has already published guidance that reflects, to a limited extent, States’ human rights obligations. These include the Enhanced Transparency Framework, which requests Member Parties to report on institutional arrangements and governance, including for ‘consultation and participation.’ In preparation for States’ updated nationally determined commitments, due in 2025, the UNFCCC Secretariat has also developed guidance on ‘inclusive engagement’ for specific groups, including people in vulnerable situations, children and youth, women and girls, persons with disabilities, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities. Yet, while the Paris Agreement references human rights, including the right to health, in its Preamble, the UNFCCC Secretariat guidance does not reference applicable international human rights law, and there is no periodic monitoring of States’ application of this UNFCCC Secretariat guidance.

With the ICJ advisory opinion looking beyond the UNFCCC to address obligations under international human rights law, the UNGASS should also look to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which has provided explicit human rights-based guidance on integrating human rights at the core of the UNFCCC and on integrating human rights into NDCs. As noted, there is as yet no periodic monitoring process to assess how States have implemented this guidance in, for example, participatory planning, mainstreaming gender, and the perspectives of Indigenous Peoples. Such monitoring mechanisms will be crucial to facilitate accountability for the realization of human rights in the climate change response.

An Accountability Framework for Human Rights-based Climate Action

An UNGASS on climate change could develop a policy framework to implement the procedural and substantive obligations identified by the ICJ and other entities noted above, concluding with a Political Declaration that reaffirms human rights obligations for a healthy environment and establishes an accountability framework to periodically monitor States’ actions to meet their obligations.

In facilitating this accountability, there is a useful precedent in the global HIV/AIDS response for rigorous reporting and monitoring of UNGASS commitments, which could be adopted at the UNGASS on climate change. In this earlier context in 2001, the UNGASS on HIV/AIDS adopted the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. This Declaration reflected States’ human rights obligations to address the HIV pandemic and, critically, called for periodic reports from the UN Secretary-General on States’ progress in achieving their commitments in the Declaration.

To establish this monitoring mechanism following the UNGASS on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS developed a comprehensive monitoring tool to assess States’ progress, which includes the formal participation of civil society in the monitoring process. The monitoring tool incorporates the ‘National Commitments and Policy Instrument’ (NCPI), with questions on related policies, strategies, and laws. UNAIDS publishes the Global AIDS Update annually, reflecting States’ progress in implementing their commitments on HIV/AIDS. This monitoring of State implementation of their HIV/AIDS commitments, which continues today, has been critical to maintaining policy momentum and facilitating State accountability following the UNGASS.

Conclusion

The ICJ advisory opinion provides a springboard for States and civil society to galvanize the UNGA in September 2025 to call for a UNGASS on climate change. By focusing on the human rights dimensions of the climate crisis, including States’ obligations to their citizens, other people within their jurisdictions, and international responsibility for transboundary harm, this UNGASS would be crucial to advancing human rights in the climate response. Critically, the ensuing Declaration of Commitment to Climate Action should request the UN Secretary-General to report periodically to the UNGA on States’ progress in achieving the commitments in the Declaration.

This UNGASS on Climate Change will require urgent UNGA action to maintain the momentum coming out of the ICJ. In 2017, environmentalist Bill McKibben noted that:

Winning slowly is the same as losing. If we don’t win very quickly on climate change, then we will never win. That’s the core truth about global warming. It’s what makes it different from every other problem our political systems have faced.

The ICJ has seized the imperative to advance State obligations in the climate crisis. The UNGA must now carry these obligations forward to ensure that States meet their commitments to urgent, effective, human rights-based climate action as soon as possible.",https://i0.wp.com/opiniojuris.org/wp-content/uploads/abstract-green-watercolour-3.jpg?fit=1200%2C818,N,,2025-09-25 08:59:58.408576

Additional considerations include establishing performance incentives for utilities to accomplish certain goals, such as reliability.

Nicholas Crowley, the vice president of consulting firm Christensen Associates, said he and his colleagues specialized in performance-based rate making and analyzing regulations across North America.

Indiana’s current investor-owned utility climate follows a “cost of service” regulation model, Crowley said, meaning that utilities file their total service costs annually and submit that information to commissioners alongside rate requests. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission then decides whether or not to approve the rates requested that utilities say they need to recoup costs from the previous year.

“Economists have long criticized this approach as something that doesn’t provide great cost efficiency incentives,” Crowley said. “It doesn’t provide the utility with an incentive to really cut its costs as much as possible.”

Rather, when costs for utilities go down, so do their rates.

“It’s a situation where no good deed goes unpunished,” he summarized.

But while Crowley had recommendations for improvement, it’s not clear when — or if — the state will adopt them.

Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, said that while he anticipated legislation may be filed, it wasn’t quite “fleshed out” and might be “premature” to consider such a move in the 2026 legislative session.

“I’m not going to carry the bill,” confirmed Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso. “Somebody is, but we’re going to crawl before we walk.”

The two lawmakers lead the Interim Study Committee on Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications.

More on recommendations

Performance-incentive mechanisms and forecasted multiyear rate plans differ in their focus, with the former seeking to improve output efficiency — such as capacity or reliability — while the latter looks at input efficiency — such as capital, labor or materials.

A multiyear plan sets either prices or revenues for three or more years without rate cases.

“The longer the amount of time the utility has to manage outside of that rate case, the higher the incentive it has to keep its costs low because they want to earn a rate of return. And you can see why there’s risk involved,” Crowley said.

Indiana kicks off hunt for new utility regulators as affordability outrage grows

Though this can take several forms, the one his firm recommended to Indiana was known as forecasted revenue, under which the utility would project its future costs and revenue needs. Though the utility runs the risk of potentially underselling their need, it can provide stable rates for them and for their customers while reducing administrative costs.

Utilities in Indiana can already do this to a more limited extent, known as “forward testing.” Under a multiyear proposal, a “reopener” can be scheduled to renegotiate a rate should a utility’s performance falter.

Performance-incentive mechanisms, on the other hand, allow commissioners to “ding” or reward utilities based on their results. For example, Crowley shared, utilities could be tasked with reducing their average service interruption times and could be fined if they fall below the benchmark.

“Especially in the state of Indiana, where you have all these service quality metrics, you don’t need to overhaul the current regulatory framework — just add a little bit of incentive power to the current framework,” Crowley said.

But some standards could be “unrealistic,” he warned, such as saying utilities need to average zero minutes of service interruption time.

Seventeen states and Washington, D.C. have some sort of formalized performance-based regulation, Crowley said, with another dozen exploring such methods, including Indiana.

The above options allow for more “incremental change, as opposed to a complete overhaul of the system,” he said.

Crowley explicitly opted not to include potential tools like price or revenue caps in the options for Indiana, due to the state’s vertically integrated system — which could make such choices expensive. Other places, such as parts of Canada or Massachusetts, have “distribution-only” systems that make such options available.

“We do have caps, but they are not hard caps and they are set by the IURC,” said Soliday. “If you break the cap, then you get additional scrutiny and the IURC can order you to bring them back. Putting a hard cap when you live in an inflationary and changing environment, the issue is: What are you trying to achieve?”

Soliday noted that the state’s aging utility structure makes it difficult for such corporations to adhere to such standards. He also suggested looking at recovery time for utilities after severe weather.

“We’re taking a hard look at the performance-based regulation that we’ve got,” Soliday said. “… And we have to look at it in the long term, not in the short term.”

Spanish brake components manufacturer ICER Brakes is making significant strides in environmental responsibility through its comprehensive sustainability program, “ICER Goes Green.” The initiative focuses on making the entire manufacturing process more sustainable by reducing consumption, waste, and emissions, all while maintaining the high quality of its products. The program has already demonstrated measurable success in decreasing the company’s environmental impact.

Key Highlights

The “ICER Goes Green” program, established in 2020, integrates sustainability across the company under an Environmental Management System certified by ISO 14001:2015.

More than 78% of the energy consumed by ICER comes from renewable sources, with its manufacturing plant in Navarra, Spain, self-generating 35% of its electricity via an expanded photovoltaic installation.

The company has achieved a 35.7% reduction in CO2​ emissions since 2021 and is implementing a plan for further reductions through 2030.

All ICER brake pads are free from copper and heavy metals, and their formulations for passenger cars incorporate over 13% recycled materials, including rubber from used tires.

Waste management policies have led to a 27% reduction in waste generated per brake pad since 2020 and a 19% decrease in hazardous waste since 2021.

The “ICER Goes Green” Initiative

Launched in 2020, the “ICER Goes Green” program is a company-wide initiative designed to embed sustainability into every facet of the business. A key component of this strategy is its Environmental Management System, which is certified under ISO 14001:2015 standards. This system ensures that environmental risks associated with its industrial activities are consistently identified and controlled. 11ICER prioritizes offering environmentally friendly products without compromising its position as a market leader in quality and innovation.

Circular Economy and Material Formulation

ICER Brakes actively promotes a circular economy by using recycled materials in its products. The friction material in its brake pads for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles contains over 13% recycled content, such as rubber from recycled tires. This practice results in an annual saving of nearly 500 tonnes of rubber and other recovered materials that would otherwise be extracted or discarded as waste. Furthermore, all brake pads produced by ICER are free of copper and other heavy metals.

Commitment to Clean Energy

The company shows a strong commitment to clean energy. A significant 78% of the energy ICER uses is sourced from renewables. An on-site photovoltaic installation, which was expanded in 2024, allows its Navarra plant to generate 35% of its own electricity. This focus on clean energy prevents the emission of 1,100 tonnes of CO2​ annually, an impact equivalent to the air quality improvement provided by 83,000 new trees.

Reducing Emissions and Waste

Through its sustainability efforts, ICER achieved an 11.2% reduction in CO2​ emissions in 2024 compared to the previous year. Since 2021, total emissions have fallen by 35.7%. The company has also implemented effective waste management policies, reducing waste per brake pad by 27% between 2020 and 2024. In that same period, the volume of hazardous waste generated at its facilities was cut by over 19%.",https://thebrakereport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICER-Goes-Green.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 12:06:06.894375

Isolation amongst ourselves has never served us well when it comes to nuclear power.","The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act recently passed by the US Congress accelerated the phasing out of many federal incentives like Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit for renewable energy like wind and solar. At the same time, it retained incentives for nuclear energy (Sections 45U, 45Y and 48E) and expanded the loan guarantees and support programs under the Department of Energy. This is perhaps the biggest investment push toward nuclear after the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While this is a much-needed policy move, incentives and subsidies aren't enough to truly build our nuclear energy ecosystem. The US needs to rethink its regulatory framework to build necessary infrastructure as well as invest into cutting-edge technologies if it is ever to become energy independent.

In our modern society, energy is like oxygen — invisible in its abundance and catastrophically obvious in its absence. A lot depends on it from day-to-day household workings, functioning of public infrastructure, prices of goods and supplies, national security and more. Hence, the goal of every country in the 21st century is to become “energy independent.” This has been an American dream, too, and nuclear power can be a catalyst.

In 1973, President Richard Nixon pledged allegiance to the goal of energy independence, following the Arab oil embargo with the goal to build 1000 nuclear power plants by the year 2000. The next administration continued on this path and reorganized the Energy Research and Development Administration intended specifically to accelerate nuclear energy development while addressing safety concerns through the creation of the separate Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

But the dream remained unfulfilled because of systemic regulatory obstacles. The NRC’s changing requirements during licensing and construction period, along with additional regulations under National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), resulted in multiyear delays. The same happened during George W. Bush’s Nuclear Power 2010 program under which only two new reactors were built at Vogtle, seven years behind schedule and double the initial budget.

Reframing Policy, Regulation and Innovation

Today, there is a renewed interest in nuclear energy because of a steady rise in electricity demand to keep up our digital infrastructure. When you throw into the mix expansion of artificial intelligence data centers, smart manufacturing and electrification of industries, our power demand is projected to double or triple by 2028. Whether the goal for the future is “net zero” or “energy independence,” increasing the nuclear mix in our power portfolio is the only way toward a stable energy future. But we cannot begin to address the solutions of the future without addressing the failures of the past.

The OBBB Act of 2025 has established a comprehensive nuclear energy policy by modifying existing tax incentives, providing substantial funding for modernization and implementing Foreign Entity of Concern Restrictions to preserve national interest. It has maintained the nuclear power production credit for operational facilities as well as investment tax credits for any reactor design approved by NRC through construction permits and combined licenses. The Act also introduced a 10% energy community bonus credit for advanced nuclear facilities, further incentivizing deployment in nuclear experienced region. It has allocated substantial funding for military nuclear programs and infrastructure. However, since the OBBB was a budget bill passed through reconciliation, the policy tracks have remained budgetary. It did not have the scope to address the complex regulations and outdated standards of NRC that still stand in the way of our goal.

My co-author and I firmly believe that the future of energy is nuclear. However, between planning, land acquisition, meeting regulatory compliance and construction, it takes more than 20 years and tens of billions of dollars to build a legacy nuclear reactor, more so to place it in service.

The primary challenge with NRC regulations is that the majority of the standards were developed for legacy light-water reactors that create an unnecessary burden for next-gen reactor technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors. For example, SMRs are smaller, flexible and can be constructed on the factory floor and assembled elsewhere near power grids and by design safer. It doesn’t make sense for them to follow the same prolonged review processes as a legacy reactor.

The Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act of 2019 agency mandated NRC to complete its new regulatory framework for next-gen reactors by December of 2027. However, the attempt has not been very successful and has instead revealed the depth of institutional resistance to reform. The initial draft submitted by the agency in March 2023 was rejected by commissioners and sent back for extensive revision. The second draft still hasn’t reached consensus and is unlikely to meet its deadline.

Similarly, for NEPA reviews, the current framework requires extensive documentation, with environmental impact statements often exceeding 1,500 pages even for smaller projects. These reviews consume one-third of overall licensing resources at the NRC and can take anywhere between two to three years. Not all reactors pose the same risk profiles and shouldn’t require the same cookie-cutter, full-length review treatments.

Executive orders signed by US President Donald Trump have been the most aggressive NRC reform attempts in recent history, specifically in reducing licensing timelines and environmental safety reviews like linear no-threshold standards. However, many of these orders overlap with the Advance Act of 2024, passed with bipartisan support, creating more uncertainty within the agency.

Strategic and Visionary Policy Needed

Despite these incredibly chaotic scenarios, there is still scope for reform and advancement, but we need a comprehensive effort involving Congress, the NRC and businesses developing advanced reactor technologies.

First, our energy policy needs to be strategic and visionary, and it needs long-term investments whose return on investment cannot be fully realized in the short term. It is clear that we have bipartisan support in Congress for advancing nuclear technology. What we need, more than ever, is consensus and consistency is advancing these policies without creating unnecessary overlaps or overhauls. Beyond legislation, we also need considerable Congressional oversight on how NRC is translating policy framework into regulation that prioritizes safety without stifling progress. Congress must focus on management accountability, not just rule-making timelines.

Second, we need regulatory reforms in the near term (till mid 2030s) to support initial deployment of reactors and for the long term (after mid 2030s) for wide-scale deployment and advancing nuclear energy. To make it happen, we need a more practical two-tiered reform approach at the agency level.

Tier 1: Immediate Regulatory Triage. This should focus on establishing separate licensing tracks for different reactor classes. Manufacturing licenses for factory-built microreactors should operate under expedited six-month timelines with standardized safety cases. SMRs referencing certified designs should follow 12-month licensing processes. Only first-of-a-kind large, advanced reactors should require the full current review process.

Tier 2: Systematic Institutional Reform. This should focus on addressing the NRC’s organizational culture and workforce challenges that prevent efficient implementation of any regulatory framework. The agency suffers from chronic understaffing in advanced reactor expertise, over-reliance on contractors and risk-averse decision-making that defaults to extensive review processes. We need to fill these roles with experts who understand next-gen reactors. Many low-risk, repetitive processes should be automated to reduce timelines and paperwork. At the same time, we need a shift in attitude within the agency itself where efficiency is a goal, change is met with adaptability and forward-thinking, innovative initiatives are encouraged.

Nuclear Future: A Shared Dream

In the end, the nuclear dream is a dream of shared humanity. This is not a challenge any one person, or one company, or the government can tackle alone. Isolation amongst ourselves has never served us well when it comes to nuclear power. By bringing together researchers, scientists and engineers as well as policy experts from both private sector and government, we can share the burden and accelerate progress.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bfab01/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1651x867+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2Fa6%2F943602ec47cead00841f4d916c33%2Fss-1422000914-nuclear-concept.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 07:58:17.740487

How are you thinking about other institutions’ approaches and the applicable lessons for North Carolina?","Ever since President Donald Trump returned to office and deluged colleges with federal policy changes, many faculty across North Carolina have felt uneasy about the state of affairs in higher education.

Belle Boggs, an English professor at North Carolina State University and the president of the statewide chapter of the American Association of University Professors, wants faculty to know that her group will stick up for them.

“Our role is to stand up for academic freedom, to fight for shared governance, and to insist on the importance of our role as champions for the public good,” Boggs told The Assembly.

Other faculty in North Carolina appear to agree: Boggs said the number of national dues-paying members in the statewide AAUP conference has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, to 570. Many of them joined after Trump’s inauguration. “And I hope we’ll double again by the end of the year,” she said.

Boggs spoke with The Assembly about how the North Carolina AAUP conference is navigating the second Trump presidency and planning to support faculty members this academic year.

How did you get involved with the AAUP and become president of the statewide group?

I got involved with what became the AAUP chapter at N.C. State during the initial wave of the COVID crisis…we were very concerned that coming back into those public spaces was not going to be safe. So there was a big effort outside of AAUP…coming together and speaking to our chancellors across the UNC System.

This was a group within the UNC System that allowed us to see that we could work together and have a voice and that that was going to be very necessary. We were moving into a different time—and I think we had already moved into a different time—and it was very clear that this was life or death, not only for vulnerable people, but also for the university.

From there, I have just been mostly a rank-and-file member at my N.C. State chapter. When our wonderful president of the state conference of AAUP, Jay Smith, who teaches at UNC-Chapel Hill, decided that he needed to step down after a long-term stint as president, the group of state-level executive leaders asked me if I would be willing to be considered for leadership. And I said OK, knowing that it would be challenging, because this was after the election, but not knowing exactly what that challenge would look like.

What has the statewide AAUP chapter seen in response to President Trump’s higher education agenda?

The AAUP and AFT [American Federation of Teachers] together are the largest higher education union in the country. And as an AAUP conference that also offers its members AFT membership, we are growing daily. We have added new chapters. We are in the process of adding still more chapters.

We are being contacted by faculty who have concerns, and we are responding. That is part of what we do is we try to provide resources and help. … So we are there for higher education, and so we hope that whatever happens this fall and beyond, people will see us and know that we’re there to offer the help that we have to give.

This summer, you attended the national conference for the AAUP. What was the environment there and how are others thinking about this moment?

I was excited going in, but I was worried that there would be a feeling of fear, and a sense of doom and negativity. But there is none of that. The people who came together were reminded that we are all knowledge workers and that our work is very important. And in fact, when you look at what the administration is doing and who they’re putting in place to accomplish some of the things that they’re trying to accomplish, we actually have better-than-even odds of coming out ahead.

We have law professors; we have doctors; we have epidemiologists; we have journalists; we have historians; we have teachers; we have healthcare workers; we have nurses. Every field you can think of, we have the best of that field within our group. We’re also a very old group, so we’ve been through some very bad times. The AAUP as an institution has been through McCarthyism.

There was some talk of the fact that this is actually the worst challenge that higher education has ever faced in the United States. And that is scary, but the energy within our sessions and within our plenary conversations was extremely energetic—sometimes angry, but always determined. The work that people are doing in different, very challenging spaces all across the United States is really inspiring.

Many people have been following the Trump administration’s battles with specific schools, like Harvard and Columbia. How are you thinking about other institutions’ approaches and the applicable lessons for North Carolina?

I think that all AAUP members and most faculty in higher education are looking at Columbia and noticing that the bullying never stops, the demands do not stop. There is no way to bend the knee and ever stand up straight again.

So we very closely are watching the different lawsuits, AAUP v. Rubio, and also the suit with Harvard that is in court right now. [Editor’s note: A judge ruled in Harvard’s favor in September, but the Trump administration says it will appeal.] I think a lot of people were very inspired by how Harvard stood up, and by the chancellor of UVA [University of Virginia] and his principled decision [to step down]. But we want Harvard to continue to stand strong. Everyone wants that.

We’ve seen Big 10 schools and others push for coalitions to defend their institutions. Are there talks about doing something like that in the South?

Absolutely. A mutual academic defense compact is a really great strategy that has happened…saying that we will stand together. We’re going to pool our resources. We are going to make sure that we’re not picked off, university by university, or program by program, or college by college.…But you also have to have the resources in place.

So what we have been working on this summer very hard at AAUP, with a team of almost entirely volunteers in North Carolina…We are working on setting up, establishing resources so that universities, but also individual faculty members and academic professionals, understand that there is some muscle behind this group, and there is some meaning behind the promises that we make.

We do have folks who work on rapid research. We do have folks who reach out to media and organize those conversations. You’ve probably seen AAUP in the media more lately, and that is because we are actively doing that work. But we are also setting up a legal hotline that will be dedicated to protecting the First Amendment rights of faculty members within the state of North Carolina who face challenges this fall and beyond. So we want to say that we have resources before we have a compact.",https://i0.wp.com/www.theassemblync.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Belle_Boggs_Portraits-023.jpg?fit=1000%2C1504&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-25 09:00:03.101144

The Sierra Club was an active part of a large coalition—and hundreds of thousands of people across the country–that spoke out against the proposal and in favor of protecting our current standards for cars and trucks.

We showed up with dozens of testifiers for a four-day hearing (that was originally scheduled for just one day but had to be extended due to sign-ups!)

We took over E&E’s Climatewire newsletter with a weeklong ad campaign that told the EPA to do its job

And we showed up in person in Motor City, a city particularly threatened by the Trump administration’s anti-EV actions, to protest the EPA’s proposal. On Sept. 19, the Friday before the Sept. 22 comment deadline, we attended a press conference in Detroit where local elected officials, advocates, and business owners gathered to demand that the EPA protect the clean vehicle pollution standards.

Stephanie Chang, Senate District 03; Alan Hejl, Founder and lead Accessibility Consultant at Spark Access; Sarah Hoogterp, Project Manager at Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision

Speakers highlighted how Detroit stands to lose significant momentum for resolving some of the worst in the nation particle pollution in the air. Attendees heard about how the rollback would threaten children's and residents’ health and well-being through both toxic air pollution and from the impacts of the worsening climate crisis. One speaker spoke about having to cancel camping trips due to summer wildfire smoke, once a rarity in the Midwest, threatening their toddler’s lung development.

Each community leader touched on the importance of preserving the standards to protect the long-term validity of the city's economic comeback, as the standards help protect long-term investments in domestic electric vehicle manufacturing. That means good-paying jobs and community revitalization for Detroit.

And it’s clear that the community, and not just the event speakers, know what the EPA’s proposed rollbacks mean for their communities. Shortly after the event, Eric overheard a conversation between two old friends over lunch at the table next to me. Fittingly enough, they were talking about Stellantis’ recent investments in the city, and what they meant for the community at large. One friend even highlighted what Stellantis’s announcement last year to open new plants for EV battery production meant for the long-term comeback of the Motor City’s residents, community, and their wealth and wellbeing. And he expressed concern about what the Trump administration meant for this momentum and progress. Their conversation could have been the press conference.

The battery gigafactory project will transform the North African kingdom into a major supplier of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy storage. This facility will cement Morocco’s role as a bridge between Africa, Europe, and Asia in the fast-growing green economy.

Asian companies are currently trying to tap into African market through Morocco. Recently joining the list of companies is Tata. Tata has set up the Tata Advanced Systems Maroc Facility in Morocco that will produce armored vehicles. With these projects, Morocco will emerge as a leading industrial hub in Africa in years to come.

May 22, 2025

Gotion Power Morocco which is a subsidiary of Sino-Europe electric vehicle battery maker Gotion High Tech, is expected to kick off Morocco’s Gotion Gigafactory Construction Project in the north African country “within days.” This was revealed by the company’s Morrocan head Khalid Qalam on Wednesday.

Gotion High Tech had already signed an investment deal with the Moroccan government in June 2024. The company will set up the first gigafactory in Africa near Kenitra, northwestern Morocco. Additionally, the project is expected to cost a total investment of $6.5 billion.

The investment of the company is spurred by government incentives. Additionally, it is in line with Morocco’s aim that foresees the country to expand and adapt its automotive sector.

Furthermore, Qalam told an industry conference in Rabat the groundwork for the factory project had been completed. The first production of the factory is expected in the third quarter of 2026.

First Phase of the Project

The first phase of the project is expected to cost of $1.3 billion. Also, as for the capacity, the plant would have 20 gigawatt capacity. He also added that the company had agreed with the Moroccan government to increase the capacity of the factory to 40GW in the second phase. However, he did not give a timeline.

Other than batteries, the plant will also produce cathodes and anodes. According to Qalam, these will be exported in bulk to Europe.

“In fact, we have already gotten orders from several European car manufacturers,” Qalam stated.

Lastly, the geographic location of Morocco is close to Europe. This therefore and its makes it an attractive destination to Chinese EV battery makers.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/images-59.webp,N,,2025-09-25 12:08:43.506545

Not surprisingly, the report downplays the threat of climate change and fossil fuels, in keeping with the administration’s other anti-climate-action measures. (See, for instance, this recent piece about Energy Secretary Chris Wright from the New York Times.)

The backlash from the American scientific community began immediately and will certainly continue. The public comment period ended on September 2, at which point 59,563 comments had been received by the government. So this collection of news reports and scientists’ responses is an early snapshot.

One thing to note: The Environmental Protection Agency’s “endangerment finding” is the ruling that greenhouse gases count as harmful pollutants and are therefore subject to government regulation. Several of the news stories mention the efforts of President Donald Trump and his administration to get rid of this finding — and the fear of scientists and climate-aware policy makers that the new Department of Energy report might be designed to bolster those efforts in litigation.

“Those are both really important consumer incentives to encourage folks to take a closer look at an electric vehicle, and those will be going away at the end of the month,” Aaron Viles, senior director of campaigns for the Electrification Coalition, said.

According to the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, the state has made more than $16 billion in capital investments in the EV industry since 2017. Additionally, more than 191,000 EVs have been produced in TN since 2013 by the four major EV manufacturers located in the state.

Viles told News 2 the exact impact of the federal tax credit cuts on Tennessee’s EV industry is unclear, but any impact will likely be short-lived.

“Obviously, if you take away a $7,500 or $4,000 tax credit, there will be fewer people who make that decision [to buy EVs],” Viles said. “It will be interesting to see how many fewer, but I think overall because manufacturers are still very committed to this transition [toward EVs], that ultimately EVs — there will be more and more on the roads.”

Some experts have also predicted potential manufacturing job loss due to the elimination of the tax credits. According to a recent report by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Tennessee has already lost nearly 150 EV manufacturing jobs within the past 12 months due to cancellations or downscaled investments.

However, the state remains among the top in the country for the most anticipated EV manufacturing jobs, the report said.

Despite that, multiple EV manufacturers in the Volunteer State have slowed or delayed EV production in recent months due to slower sales, including Ford’s EV plant — known as BlueOval City — located just outside of Memphis.

“In Tennessee, there’s a lot of skin in the game because it’s one of the bigger states in terms of those EV investments, so we’ll all need to watch pretty closely and carefully and see what the companies decide to do,” Viles said.",https://www.wjhl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/98/2025/09/VOSOT.00_00_22_00.Still001.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-25 13:01:47.320472

“The most durable way to help farmers through these troubling times is by creating more demand for corn and corn products,” the letter said. “The most immediate path to begin to address this issue is by increasing consumer access to higher blends of corn ethanol.”

To make matters worse for growers, a recent report released by the Department of Agriculture suggests that farmers are on course to produce a massive corn yield that is expected to be the largest on record, an outgrowth of exceptionally efficient and continually improving management practices. But additional corn on the market will only drive prices even lower.

Corn grower leaders have said one of the quickest ways to create demand for corn is by passing the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025, which would remove an outdated regulation under the Clean Air Act that bans the sale of fuel with 15% ethanol blends during the summer months.

Heat pumps are much more efficient than boilers, because they transfer heat rather than generate it.
By extracting latent heat from the outside air, modern heat pumps can operate efficiently at temperatures well below freezing.
The data from Denmark in the chart above demonstrates that heat pumps in the best-insulated homes use 30% less electricity than those with poor insulation.
Making buildings more energy-efficient also means households can use lower-capacity heat pumps, which are cheaper to install.","This article has been updated.

Heat pumps are a key way to make heating more sustainable, affordable and secure, say experts.

They could reduce global CO2 emissions by 500 million tonnes by 2030 – vital when environmental issues dominate the Forum's Global Risks Report 2025.

But countries will need to subsidize heat pumps if they are to achieve their climate targets, as high installation costs are a barrier for many households.

Heat pumps could make our homes, workplaces and public buildings more sustainable.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates they could reduce CO2 emissions by 500 million tonnes by 2030. With environmental issues featuring in four of the top five risks to the world over the next 10 years, a global switch to heat pumps could be a step in the right direction.

Heat pumps are already cheaper to run than conventional boilers, and research shows they are three to four times more efficient than traditional gas boilers, but their high initial cost is still a considerable deterrent. Countries will need to subsidize installations if they are to achieve their climate targets, the IEA says.

Some people are also concerned they lack the efficiency of conventional boilers when the temperature outside is particularly low. However, research suggests that even at temperatures well below freezing heat pump efficiency is still significantly higher than fossil fuel systems.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

So what is the potential of heat pumps? Here are four charts that show how they work and what they can do to warm our indoor spaces, while helping to stop the climate warming even further.

1. How do heat pumps work?

Heat pumps use similar technology to that of a refrigerator or air conditioner. They extract heat from a source – the surrounding air – and amplify this heat.

Heat pumps are much more efficient than boilers, because they transfer heat rather than generate it. Almost all of this heat reaches the space intended to be warmed.

The technology is effective even in cold climates. By extracting latent heat from the outside air, modern heat pumps can operate efficiently at temperatures well below freezing. For added resilience in the coldest conditions, they can be installed as part of a hybrid system, working alongside a conventional gas boiler that provides supplementary heat only when needed.

2. Which region is installing heat pumps fastest?

In 2024, heat pump sales outpaced gas boilers by 30%, the largest gap ever recorded, reports the IEA's Global Energy Review 2025.

The chart above shows that China leads the way in heat pump installations, with the country responsible for 30% of the global total, according to the IEA. The US comes next, followed by the EU – largely led by Norway, which has 632 heat pumps installed for every 1,000 households.

China's dominance is partly due to the fact that it's a leader in heat pump manufacturing; the country's net-zero plans are also helping to increase demand.

3. How much of global heating demand can they cover?

Over one-sixth of global natural gas demand is for heating buildings – so heat pumps could make a significant dent in emissions if widely installed. Currently, they cover about 10% of global space heating demand, but the potential is there for a much greater reach.

The extent to which heat pumps can be rolled out depends on whether nations deliver what they’ve written into their existing policies or climate pledges. In the chart above, STEPS refers to countries’ Stated Policies Scenarios on heat pumps, with demand for them expected to double by 2035.

The IEA reports that trade in heat pumps has grown less rapidly than other clean energy technologies, but that installations are set to increase in the coming decades. Government support for heat pumps – as originally laid out in the US Inflation Reduction Act, for example – is needed for nations to achieve their climate and energy security goals, says the IEA. Bans on new fossil fuel boilers across Europe will also help.

4. Which homes will benefit most?

Insulating buildings is a key component of improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. The data from Denmark in the chart above demonstrates that heat pumps in the best-insulated homes use 30% less electricity than those with poor insulation.

Improving a home’s energy rating by just two grades (from D to B) can halve energy demand, the IEA says. Making buildings more energy-efficient also means households can use lower-capacity heat pumps, which are cheaper to install.

A recent study in the UK found that heat pumps could cut heating bills for British people by around half – but only if the government takes steps to make electricity cheaper and reins in gas companies' profits.",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/MAZkPh7ev33vX44i8cDS4F7MqS--jXARGvrhqkLhjsA.JPG,N,,2025-09-25 08:59:10.445068

(WKRN) — Buying an electric vehicle may not be as beneficial for your bank account starting at the end of the month, and some believe the change could impact the Tennessee’s electric vehicle industry.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing a new EV, and the $4,000 tax credit for purchasing a used one, will disappear Sept. 30. The cuts were included in the “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress in July. Some believe it may put the breaks on the EV industry’s momentum in Tennessee.

“Those are both really important consumer incentives to encourage folks to take a closer look at an electric vehicle, and those will be going away at the end of the month,” Aaron Viles, senior director of campaigns for the Electrification Coalition, said.

According to the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, the state has made more than $16 billion in capital investments in the EV industry since 2017. Additionally, more than 191,000 EVs have been produced in Tennessee since 2013 by the four major EV manufacturers located in the state.

Viles told News 2 the exact impact of the federal tax credit cuts on Tennessee’s EV industry is unclear, but any impact will likely be short-lived.

“Obviously, if you take away a $7,500 or $4,000 tax credit, there will be fewer people who make that decision [to buy EVs],” Viles said. “It will be interesting to see how many fewer, but I think overall because manufacturers are still very committed to this transition [toward EVs], that ultimately EVs — there will be more and more on the roads.”

Some experts have also predicted potential manufacturing job loss due to the elimination of the tax credits. According to a recent report by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Tennessee has already lost nearly 150 EV manufacturing jobs within the past 12 months due to cancellations or down-scaled investments.

However, the state remains among the top in the country for the most anticipated EV manufacturing jobs, the report said.

Despite that, multiple EV manufacturers in the Volunteer State have slowed or delayed EV production in recent months due to slower sales, including Ford’s EV plant — known as BlueOval City — located just outside of Memphis.

“In Tennessee, there’s a lot of skin in the game because it’s one of the bigger states in terms of those EV investments, so we’ll all need to watch pretty closely and carefully and see what the companies decide to do,” Viles said.",https://www.wate.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2025/09/VOSOT.00_00_22_00.Still001.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-25 14:02:03.432034

Experts warn that undoing it could weaken national climate policy, with ripple effects felt in California.
In July, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Endangerment Finding and the emissions standards that followed “the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods,” blaming them on costly federal regulations.
Experts agree that the state’s broad authority to regulate pollution from power plants, refineries and other stationary sources under its own climate laws would remain intact, even if the Endangerment Finding were rescinded.
The comment letter argues that the proposal undermines climate protections, which are critical as climate change harms “every region of our country, and especially California,” through extreme summer heat and the resulting increase in heat-related illness and deaths.","California officials this week lined up in opposition to the Trump administration’s proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who called the plan a “moral abdication” in a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin while accusing the agency of betraying its mission to protect Americans.

“By siding with polluters over science, EPA is telling wildfire victims to ignore the flames, flood victims to ignore the rising water, and parents of asthmatic children to ignore the dirty air that chokes their respiratory systems and takes their breath away,” Newsom wrote on Monday as thepublic comment period ended.

In an email to The Sacramento Bee, the EPA said the agency “welcomes all public comments on the proposal through September 22, 2025,” and that it “looks forward to reviewing a diverse array of perspectives on this issue.”

The Trump administration’s latest attempt to roll back environmental protections targets what is widely considered the legal foundation for regulating carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Experts warn that undoing it could weaken national climate policy, with ripple effects felt in California.

The 2009 Endangerment Finding, issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Obama administration, determined that six greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane “endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations” under the Clean Air Act.

In July, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Endangerment Finding and the emissions standards that followed “the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods,” blaming them on costly federal regulations.

“In our work so far, many stakeholders have told me that the Obama and Biden EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year,” Zeldin said.

“If finalized, rescinding the Endangerment Finding and resulting regulations would end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.”

The goal, according to the EPA, is “reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family,” while lowering the cost of living on goods delivered by trucks.

California’s stricter auto emissions

For California, the consequences of the repeal are complicated. Experts agree that the state’s broad authority to regulate pollution from power plants, refineries and other stationary sources under its own climate laws would remain intact, even if the Endangerment Finding were rescinded.

Where the impact is less clear is on vehicle standards, which have been central to California’s climate policy, because under the Clean Air Act, California can apply for a waiver to set stricter vehicle emissions rules than the federal government.

“There are two possibilities. One is, if the federal government is no longer regulating greenhouse gasses, there might be some argument that California no longer even needs a waiver outside of the Clean Air Act,” Dan Farber, professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, said.

The other possibility, Farber added, is that if California still needs a waiver, the legal rules for obtaining one would remain unchanged.

“I don’t really see that California is harmed anyway in terms of regulating vehicles,” Farber continued.

Albert Lin, co-director of the California Environmental Law and Policy Center at the UC Davis, agreed that California will still be able to regulate stationary sources like power plants and refineries, while noting the situation is more uncertain for vehicles.

If EPA claims it has no authority to regulate greenhouse gases from cars, that could weaken the federal rules that normally block states from setting their own standards. In that case, California might be able to step in. But Lin cautioned that the final word would rest with the courts.

Attorneys general: Rescinding climate finding would be unlawful

Lin also pointed to a comment letter filed on Monday from a coalition of 23 attorneys general, led by California Attorney General Bob Bonta, which argued that rescinding the Endangerment Finding would be unlawful and ignore established scientific evidence on climate change. The comment letter argues that the proposal undermines climate protections, which are critical as climate change harms “every region of our country, and especially California,” through extreme summer heat and the resulting increase in heat-related illness and deaths.

“We could expect to see the kind of climate change impact we’ve already seen in California and in the Sacramento region, intensifying some of those effects that are already familiar to many residents,” said Frances Moore, an associate professor of environmental science and policy at the University of California, Davis, pointing to the destruction of property and lives, as well as the “serious health implications of wildfire smoke” from wildfires, as examples.

“Sacramento is really vulnerable to flooding…that’s the other major immediate climate impact in addition to just extreme temperatures.”

Meanwhile, Newsom denounced President Donald Trump on Wednesday at a climate event while speaking to the New York Times a day after the president dismissed climate change as “the greatest con-job ever perpetrated on the world.” Newsom called Trump’s remarks an “abomination,” an “embarrassment,” and a “fraud.”

“And I say that as a guy that lives in one of the most crisis-prone states in America ... a state that’s seen lifestyles, places, traditions completely destroyed because of the reality of climate change,” Newsom said.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/oy4z9a/picture311641869/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SAC_1572_DRH_250808_TexasInCAPresser.JPG,N,,2025-09-25 13:02:28.117525

U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.-17) toured the installation to highlight how renewables can save energy and money, even as Republicans in Washington have ended clean energy incentives through the federal spending plan signed by President Trump in July.

CCAC President Quintin Bullock said the 543 kilowatt solar array at the North Campus was turned on in January 2022. It generates about 30% of the building’s electricity needs, saving the college up to $16,000 each year. Bullock said that’s money that can go back into programs that benefit students.

Deluzio said the end of federal tax credits will make it harder for others to make a switch to cheaper renewables. He said people in Western Pennsylvania are getting sticker shock from their electricity bills and other rising costs.

“ Life is very expensive. People expect our government — our federal government, where I serve — to do something to make life less of a ripoff for people,” Deluzio said. “ They also expect our government to deal with pollution, to protect our air quality, to combat climate change.”

The phase-out of clean energy tax credits is also a job killer, Deluzio said. The Clean Economy Tracker estimates the move will result in 16,000 lost energy jobs, and prevent 19 gigawatts of new energy generation across Pennsylvania over the next decade.

“I think a Democratic majority in the Congress will take as a priority restoring these tax credits to keep costs down, to protect our clean air and more,” Deluzio said. “I think we need to have a different control of the Congress and the House and the Senate to force the President back to the negotiating table to restore these tax credits.”

Gavin Lynch, a student volunteer with Moms Clean Air Force who attended Deluzio’s tour, said the federal government is going in the wrong direction on climate change.

“ I really wish they would be doing a lot more to help with the environment. In times of crisis, we look to the government to help regulate things more and help actually provide for the people,” Lynch said. “This is a time of crisis.

Investors are pouring billions into the field to build power plants, and some companies are even signing huge agreements to purchase power from those still-nonexistent plants. All this comes before companies have actually completed a working reactor that can produce electricity. It takes money to develop a new technology, but all this funding could lead to some twisted expectations.

Nearly three years ago, the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hit a major milestone for fusion power. With the help of the world’s most powerful lasers, scientists heated a pellet of fuel to 100 million °C. Hydrogen atoms in that fuel fused together, releasing more energy than the lasers put in.

It was a game changer for the vibes in fusion. The NIF experiment finally showed that a fusion reactor could yield net energy. Plasma physicists’ models had certainly suggested that it should be true, but it was another thing to see it demonstrated in real life.

But in some ways, the NIF results didn’t really change much for commercial fusion. That site’s lasers used a bonkers amount of energy, the setup was wildly complicated, and the whole thing lasted a fraction of a second. To operate a fusion power plant, not only do you have to achieve net energy, but you also need to do that on a somewhat constant basis and—crucially—do it economically.

So in the wake of the NIF news, all eyes went to companies like Commonwealth, Helion, and Zap Energy. Who would be the first to demonstrate this milestone in a more commercially feasible reactor? Or better yet, who would be the first to get a power plant up and running?

So far, the answer is none of them.

And yet, the money pours in. Commonwealth raised over $800 million in funding earlier this year. And now it’s got two big customers signed on to buy electricity from this future power plant.

Why buy electricity from a reactor that’s currently little more than ideas on paper? From the perspective of these particular potential buyers, such agreements can be something of a win-win, says Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute.

By putting a vote of confidence behind Commonwealth, Eni could help the fusion startup get the capital it needs to actually build its plant. The company also directly invests in Commonwealth, so it stands to benefit from success. Getting a good rate on the capital needed to build the plant could also mean the electricity is ultimately cheaper for Eni, Stein says.

Ultimately, fusion needs a lot of money. If fossil-fuel companies and tech giants want to provide it, all the better. One concern I have, though, is how outside observers are interpreting these big commitments.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright has been loud about his support for fusion and his expectations of the technology. Earlier this month, he told the BBC that it will soon power the world.

He’s certainly not the first to have big dreams for fusion, and it is an exciting technology. But despite the jaw-dropping financial milestones, this industry is still very much in development.

And while Wright praises fusion, the Trump administration is slashing support for other energy technologies, including wind and solar power, and spreading disinformation about their safety, cost, and effectiveness.

To meet the growing electricity demand and cut emissions from the power sector, we’ll need a whole range of technologies. It’s a risk and a distraction to put all our hopes on an unproven energy tech when there are plenty of options that actually exist.

The occasion was the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike against General Motors. Biden addressed the UAW members outside the Willow Run parts center near Detroit, Michigan.

What You Need to Know About the UAW Strike, a report from CRC’s research director, Michael Watson, was posted earlier in the month.

Here’s a sample:

What Has This Got to Do with Electric Cars?

Thanks to the general metropolitan-progressive war on cars, government subsidies for electric vehicles, the Biden administration’s anti-energy agenda, and regulations from states like California that target combustion engines for elimination, the Detroit Three have increasingly focused on electric vehicles. This changeover has led the companies to commit to a combined $120 billion infrastructure investment related to electric cars—cars on which at present, they are losing scads of money.

The automakers argue that conceding to the union’s demands amid this electric vehicle changeover expense could send them under. Job losses that the union hopes to avoid are also likely from the shift from combustion to charging. The right-of-center America First Policy Institute estimated that adopting the Biden administration’s directives to increase the proportion of electric vehicles on the roads from 6 percent to 67 percent would eliminate 117,000 jobs in the industry.

Watson’s full report is linked here.

InfluenceWatch has a profile of the UAW that begins with this overview:

The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America International Union—also known as the United Automobile Workers (UAW)–is a labor union mainly comprised of American automobile manufacturing employees but that also includes unionized casino and higher education workers.

The UAW was at the forefront of the American labor movement and used militant strikes and sit-downs to force American car manufacturers to enter into their first labor agreements during the 1930s and 1940s. Over the years, the UAW has lobbied for excessive labor handouts—at one point including a “jobs bank” that paid laid off autoworkers 95 percent of their salary. The UAW also fought for an $80 billion government-funded auto industry bailout that critics claimed was merely a thinly veiled bailout for the UAW.

Since 2010, the UAW has spent over $87 million on politics and lobbying.4 The union uses this money to push a left-of-center agenda that includes traditional labor union prerogatives, such as replacing secret-ballot unionization elections with public “card check” and other liberal items including environmentalist manufacturing mandates, tax increases, legal status for millions of illegal immigrants, and laws to ease prison sentencing.

In 2017, a U.S. Justice Department corruption investigation revealed the corporate executives at Fiat Chrysler had illegally paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to UAW executives in exchange for union concessions.

In Puerto Rico, Vermont, California, Texas, and other states, virtual power plants have helped the grid survive spikes in demand, avoiding outages or the need to fire up gas-fueled peaker plants, and saving consumers money.

Illinois is among the areas expecting electricity demand to grow rapidly because of new data centers; meanwhile, the state is mandated to phase out fossil-fuel generation by 2045, and residential and commercial solar have boomed thanks to state incentive programs. If those solar arrays were paired with batteries, they could provide crucial clean power to the grid during high demand.

HB 4120, an ambitious bill that Illinois lawmakers may consider during an October veto session, would create a basic virtual power plant (VPP) program while mandating that the state’s two largest utilities — ComEd and Ameren — propose their own VPP programs by 2027.

The bill’s plan would offer a rebate to customers who purchase a battery, if they agree to let the battery be tapped for several hours a day during the summer months, when air conditioners drive up electricity use.

The Illinois proposal is less nuanced and comprehensive than VPP programs in other states. For example, in Vermont, Green Mountain Power subsidizes the purchase of batteries, which the utility can then tap while also controlling customers’ smart thermostats, EV chargers, and water heaters whenever the grid is stressed.

But stakeholders in the solar and energy storage industry say Illinois’ proposal is an important first step, opening the door for more ambitious VPP services.

“A utility may want a program to address ​‘emergency calls’ to reduce peak load, or deal with a winter peaking issue, or address locational capacity constraints,” said Amy Heart, senior vice president of public policy at Sunrun, a national company that has invested heavily in Illinois solar and that runs VPPs in Puerto Rico, California, and other places. ​“There is an official pathway and timeline for all of this.”

Building momentum

Energy players in Illinois have been talking seriously about VPPs for several years, during negotiations over what has now become the HB 4120. The legislation would incentivize the construction of large-scale energy storage in Illinois, through procurement by the state power agency. VPPs, meanwhile, would provide a decentralized form of storage.

Under the bill’s VPP program, residential customers would get a rebate of $300 per kilowatt-hour on the capacity of the battery they purchase, and then receive at least $10 per kilowatt during scheduled dispatches from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays in June, July, August, and September for a five-year period. ​“It’s sort of a ​‘set-it and forget-it’ program,” said Heart.

Illinois residents already receive a rebate for the same amount when they purchase a battery, but with the new rules, consumers would need to participate in the VPP program to qualify.

All community solar projects with storage would be required to participate in the VPP program, dispatching from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.

ComEd, which serves northern Illinois, and Ameren, which serves most of the rest of the state, could petition the Illinois Commerce Commission for permission to tap the batteries on a different schedule, for no more than two or three hours a day over 80 days each year.

The basic program would not help with peak demand during unscheduled times — like unexpectedly hot fall weather. But at least utilities would be guaranteed power during the scheduled peaks, said Heart.

“People wanted to move quickly,” on getting a VPP program in the legislation, she added. ​“You avoid delays [caused by] trying to make this perfect. Industry is talking about how we need stability; nonprofits, ratepayer advocates, utilities, [and] labor are all talking about why we need these investments.”

Illinois, like many states, has demand-response programs that are often considered part of virtual power plants, helping people reduce their energy use during peak demand. And ComEd has already proposed a VPP program to state regulators.

But legislation is crucial for VPPs to really take off, to ensure that programs ​“feature robust participation, innovation by aggregators, and a wide range of benefits,” said Samarth Medakkar, policy principal for Advanced Energy United, a national trade association of power, transportation, and software companies focused on clean energy.

Illinois’ bill would permit third-party aggregators to manage VPP deployment, a common setup in other states wherein a company, like Virtual Peaker in Vermont, coordinates battery deployment and demand response for the customer and utility.

ComEd and Ameren would be required to file reports by the end of 2028 detailing how many people have enrolled in the VPP program and its effects on energy supply.

By the end of 2027, the companies would have to file proposals for their own VPP programs, which the state regulatory commission must approve by the close of 2028. Those programs would need to include higher incentives for low- to moderate-income customers, ​“community-driven” community solar projects, and areas targeted for equity investments in Illinois’ existing energy laws.

“VPPs have a huge potential in a state like Illinois, where there are already many capable devices — like smart thermostats and solar systems which can pair with storage — increasing in number at a rate we can accelerate,” said Medakkar.

Saving customers money with VPPs

An analysis conducted by clean-energy think tank RMI found that VPPs could meet most of the expected new demand in Illinois, providing a crucial bridge while more clean-power generation and transmission lines are built.

The report notes that the state will need around 3.9 gigawatts of new generation or energy savings by 2029, as demand grows and old fossil-fueled plants retire.

VPPs could satisfy about three-quarters of that need, the analysis says, if they account for 10% of electricity used during peak demand times by tapping batteries and dialing down customers’ energy consumption.

Plus, it takes much less time to set up a VPP than to build a new traditional power plant. ​“VPPs can be deployed in as little as six months, nearly three years quicker than the median deployment timelines for utility-scale batteries and natural gas plants,” notes the RMI report, which was produced for Advanced Energy United to inform the legislative process.

The analysis determined that VPPs would save the average Illinois customer $34 a year by reducing the amount of expensive capacity that utilities would have to purchase in the auctions run by regional grid operators. ComEd’s customers especially are seeing their bills skyrocket due to record-high capacity costs in the PJM regional market.

“There’s great untapped potential in demand-response and VPP-type products,” said Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, which advocates for Illinois’ electric and gas customers. ​“It’s disappointing we haven’t seen more opportunities of this sort take root here. But maybe now, with the spiraling energy prices, policymakers will finally see that these are programs that can bring real benefit not just to those who directly participate but to everybody.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1329792444.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0f25b25f90f3b3593043db8e7714e9bb,N,,2025-09-25 07:00:05.644272

President Trump, at the UN General Assembly, criticized renewable energy as ineffective and costly, challenging climate change consensus. Despite his claims, renewables drove 80% of global electricity generation growth in 2024. While the US clean energy sector employs over 3.5 million, job growth has slowed, potentially worsened by Trump's policies, including project cancellations and regulatory hurdles.

President Donald Trump delivered a sharply critical speech on renewable energy at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, September 23 dismissing clean energy sources as ineffective and costly. His remarks directly challenge the scientific consensus on climate change and come at a time when the US clean energy sector employs more than 3.5 million people, as more Americans working in the sector than as servers or cashiers.

During his address, President Trump made unsubstantiated claims about renewable energy and climate change. He said that clean energy sources such as solar and wind “don’t work” and are “too expensive.” Trump warned that the economics of renewable energy are harming the economy and resulting in higher energy costs. He described renewable energy as “a joke” and said they are not powerful enough to meet modern infrastructure needs.

Reality check: Renewables drive energy growth

ABC News fact-checked this claim and said in 2024, 80 per cent of the growth in global electricity generation came from renewable and nuclear sources, which together contributed 40 per cent of the world’s total electricity generation for the first time. Solar and wind alone accounted for 16 per cent of the United States’ electricity, surpassing coal. Renewable energy sources are forecast to meet approximately 95 per cent of global electricity demand growth through 2027.

The outlet cited the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) report and said that more than 90 per cent of new renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. In 2024, solar photovoltaics were, on average, 41 per cent cheaper than the lowest-cost fossil fuel options, while onshore wind projects were 53 per cent cheaper.

Clean energy job scenario

Clean energy job growth has been one of the sector’s major successes. According to E2, a clean energy advocacy group, the US added close to 100,000 jobs in solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, grid upgrades, biofuels, and electric vehicles in 2024. Wind turbine technician and solar installer are currently the fastest-growing jobs in America.

Live Events

The report says that over 3.5 million Americans now hold clean energy sector jobs, more than are employed as nurses, cashiers, servers, or elementary school teachers, as claimed by a Yale Environment 360 report.

But growth is slowing and Trump’s policies may worsen it

Despite the strong job numbers, clean energy job growth slowed in 2024, with the US adding 50,000 fewer clean energy jobs compared to 2023. Analysts attribute this slowdown to a weakening economy and uncertainty about energy policy.

Since President Trump took office, the administration has taken steps that critics say threaten the clean energy industry’s growth. These include blocking renewable energy projects on federal lands and waters, slashing tax credits for clean technology, and introducing new regulatory hurdles for solar, wind, and electric vehicles, according to a previous analysis from E2.

That analysis found that in the first half of 2025, businesses canceled $22 billion worth of clean energy projects projects that would have created more than 16,500 jobs, most of them in Republican strongholds.

And sales are expected to remain strong even after a federal tax incentive ends next week.
Total sales for electric vehicles have grown 42% in Florida since last year.
It's very conducive to electric vehicles because you get a lot more predictability over the range of the vehicle,"" he said.
Nigro said the country is heading toward full vehicle electrification, even without the federal tax credit.","More electric vehicles are sold in Florida than anywhere in the southeastern United States, an analysis by Southern Alliance for Clean Energy shows.

And sales are expected to remain strong even after a federal tax incentive ends next week.

Total sales for electric vehicles have grown 42% in Florida since last year. More than one out of every 10 new cars sold in the state is electric, which is above the national average.

On a recent webinar, the founder of the data and research firm Atlas Public Policy, Nick Nigro, said Florida is an ""attractive"" place for EVs.

""It's very flat. It's very warm. It's very conducive to electric vehicles because you get a lot more predictability over the range of the vehicle,"" he said.

""If you look at the top vehicles in Florida ... It's the Tesla Model Y, it's the Chevy Equinox EV. These are the same vehicles that are most popular nationally,"" he continued.

Even though EVs are really popular in the state, Nigro said, Florida hasn't taken enough advantage of federal funding to increase the number of fast-charging stations.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which was funded by the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021, was the largest investment in EV charging in U.S. history at $5 billion.

Nigro said Florida is slacking on these funds.

""Florida, where are you? You've got to get off the dime. Florida, of all the states in the country, is falling the farthest behind and taking advantage of these federal dollars,” he said.

ALSO READ: Trump plugged back into bankrolling EV chargers. When will Florida see more?

He encouraged the state to use it while it's available, saying Florida has a ""really great EV market.""

""And I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate having more fast chargers available for them to use,"" he continued.

In January 2025, Florida was awarded $37 million in Round 2 Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grants, which is more than any other state in the Southeast.

According to the SACE transportation report, Florida came second per capita for charging stations in the region and 21st in the nation, with 3,502 fast-charging ports and 8,665 level 2 ports.

Separately, consumers are fast approaching a deadline: They have until Tuesday to utilize a federal tax incentive of up to $7,500 to purchase or lease a new or used electric or hybrid vehicle from former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The breaks were supposed to last until 2032, but were phased out sooner by President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Nigro said the country is heading toward full vehicle electrification, even without the federal tax credit.

""Probably about less than half of the vehicles that were being sold in the last year even qualified for the credit. So, a lot of vehicles are being purchased by Americans without the credit in place,"" he said.

Although, Nigro added, the timeline for electrification is going to be stretched out a bit.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/622710a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+216/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2Fa1%2F34ea68ac41e2afb8ea16437614e2%2Felectric-vehicle-tesla-near-water.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 07:58:28.168312

Private deals for public power supply Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts—equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana.
Pennsylvania's utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers.
New Jersey's utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause ""unreasonable"" cost increases for other users.
Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world's largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

""You can't follow the facts, you can't follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,"" DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts—equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta's infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta's contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP's questions about transparency, while Louisiana's economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis—the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan—said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

""There's certain information we should know and need to know but don't have,"" Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to ""tens of millions of dollars or more each year"" in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be ""very little"" impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta's facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University's Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay ""every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.""

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania's utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey's utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause ""unreasonable"" cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a 'kill switch' law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

""We don't come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,"" said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

""We have a lot of concerned people—they've put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,"" the mayor said. ""I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.""

Dubbed the Voltpost Air, the new Level 2 charger is much smaller than the company’s previous model.

It can be installed on almost any type of lamppost at a fraction of the cost of a traditional public Level 2 EV charger, which could supercharge the charging infrastructure in urban areas.

The little lamppost-installed box you see in the photos below might be the key to unlocking a more stress-free EV ownership experience in dense cities where parking and overnight charging is an issue.

It’s called the Voltpost Air, and it’s the brainchild of a New York-based startup that was founded just four years ago with a big idea: turn boring street lights into electric car chargers. They’re pretty much everywhere, so why not take advantage of their ubiquity to make life easier for EV owners everywhere?

The Air is Voltpost’s second model, and compared to its first generation of lamppost-mounted chargers, it’s a lot smaller. According to the company, up to two chargers can be installed on a single post, providing up to 9.6 kilowatts of power to each connected EV. A smartphone app can be used to find chargers and pay for charging sessions.

Compared to the first version of Voltpost’s Level 2 charger, which is installed at the base of a street light, the Air is mounted at roughly 10 feet (3 meters) above the ground to protect against vandalism and weather. A retractable charging cable ensures no wires are dangling over the sidewalk, reducing the risk of pedestrians tripping.

Gallery: Voltpost Air lamppost charger

According to Jeffrey Prosserman, cofounder and CEO of Voltpost, installation takes just a couple of hours and costs a few thousand dollars because there’s no need to need to dig up sidewalks or wait for utility upgrades. Prosserman told Axios that it’s merely a case of pulling a cable bundle through the post’s existing conduit.

“With millions of streetlights in the United States, the opportunity to convert even a fraction into chargers will make a significant positive impact,” the startup’s CEO added. “Born in America and built coast to coast, Voltpost is empowering communities with accessible, affordable charging.”

The first Votpost Air charger was installed in Brooklyn at the MADE Bush Terminal with funding from the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and Con Edison. The charger will be available to the public by the end of the year, the company said.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana's economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,"" the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Allen Jones EFS Media Technology Inc. Allen (at) efsonline.net","Denver, Colorado, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Against the backdrop of rapid global urbanization and the growing challenges of climate change, the sustainable transformation of the transportation sector has become a focal point for governments and society alike. Today, EFS Media Technology Inc. announced that it will further advance the implementation of low-carbon transportation solutions by strengthening its global partner network and leveraging technological innovation, helping major cities achieve goals in green mobility and carbon reduction.

Founded in 2019 and headquartered in the United States, EFS Media Technology Inc. has always adhered to its core strategy of “low-carbon, intelligent, and sustainable.” The company is dedicated to reshaping urban transportation systems through shared bicycles and smart technologies. Over the years, it has expanded operations to more than 30 countries, working with governments, urban planners, and local partners to turn sustainable mobility from vision into reality.

“Urban transportation not only affects residents’ daily commuting efficiency but also has a direct impact on air quality and global climate change,” said the CEO of EFS at the press conference. “Our goal is to expand low-carbon mobility models from pilot demonstrations to broad adoption. Through our global partner network and technological innovation, we aim to help more cities move faster and more steadily along the path of green transformation.”

The company’s newly announced strategic priorities include three areas:

Promoting the adoption of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, thereby increasing the share of renewable energy in transportation systems;

Leveraging artificial intelligence and big data for real-time traffic monitoring and smart scheduling, reducing energy waste and road congestion;

Expanding shared mobility solutions in emerging markets, easing urban traffic pressure while creating new employment opportunities.

Industry analysts note that carbon emissions from the transportation sector remain a significant share of global greenhouse gas output. Therefore, scalable low-carbon transportation solutions will play a profound role in shaping urban development and energy structures over the next decade. By establishing long-term partnerships with governments and leading enterprises worldwide, EFS Media Technology Inc. is well-positioned to gain a competitive edge in the global race for green transportation transformation.

A notable initiative is the company’s plan to launch a “Zero-Carbon Transportation Corridor” pilot project by 2026, selecting several international transport hub cities as demonstration sites. The project will integrate electric vehicles, smart mobility platforms, and renewable energy systems to achieve a fully low-carbon operational chain. EFS expects this model to be replicated and scaled across more cities, creating a sustainable industry benchmark.

“The future of low-carbon transportation is not a distant vision but a reality being realized step by step through collaboration and innovation,” added EFS’s Head of Strategy. “We believe that as our partner network continues to grow, EFS will play an even greater role in advancing the global low-carbon future.”

As nations accelerate the implementation of climate policies, EFS Media Technology Inc.’s strategic initiatives align closely with industry trends and policy directions. The company announced that it will continue to increase investment in R&D, market expansion, and international cooperation over the next three years, further strengthening its leadership position in the global low-carbon transportation transition.

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-09-25 07:32:48+00:00,Canary Media,North Carolina funds repairs so Helene-hit homes can get energy upgrades,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-efficiency/north-carolina-funding-repair-hurricane-damage-weatherization,"Now, North Carolina plans to solve that problem by allocating $10 million to urgent home repair in the region.
The program’s services — including sealing leaks around doors and windows, adding insulation, and improving appliance efficiency — benefit hundreds of North Carolina households each year, lowering their utility bills by up to $300.
That’s why the newly announced money for western North Carolina households is so vital, said Claire Williamson, energy policy advocate at the North Carolina Justice Center: It will unlock assistance for households that have previously been unable to access weatherization aid.
Some municipalities have their own fix-it programs, Williamson said, as does the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency.
​“When homes are more efficient, it helps benefit the rest of North Carolina,” she added.","A year after Hurricane Helene hit western North Carolina — dumping as much as 30 inches of rain and felling thousands of trees — countless homes still suffer from leaky roofs, mold and mildew, and rotting floors.

All that damage doesn’t just threaten residents’ comfort, health, and safety. Unless it’s resolved, low-income households can’t access free energy-efficiency retrofits that could save them hundreds of dollars each year on their utility bills.

Now, North Carolina plans to solve that problem by allocating $10 million to urgent home repair in the region. Officials in the administration of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, hope the funds will aid more than 575 households in the counties most devastated by Helene.

“This effort is going to increase western North Carolina’s sound and efficient housing stock, reduce energy costs for the most vulnerable families and individuals, and make homes safer and more comfortable,” Julie Woosley, director of the State Energy Office, said in a statement.

Drawing on a disaster-relief package passed by lawmakers in the early aftermath of Helene, the home-repair monies will be distributed to a regional government entity and nine community action agencies that implement the federal Weatherization Assistance Program.

Established nearly a half century ago, the weatherization initiative is aimed at families below certain annual income thresholds; for example, a family of four must earn about $60,000 or less to qualify. The program’s services — including sealing leaks around doors and windows, adding insulation, and improving appliance efficiency — benefit hundreds of North Carolina households each year, lowering their utility bills by up to $300.

But the Weatherization Assistance Program only scratches the surface of need for the energy burdened. Because its funds are restricted to minor repairs and mostly can’t be used for major ones such as roof replacement, about one in five families nationwide are deferred from receiving benefits, according to a survey by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Of those, 40% never get weatherized at all.

That’s why the newly announced money for western North Carolina households is so vital, said Claire Williamson, energy policy advocate at the North Carolina Justice Center: It will unlock assistance for households that have previously been unable to access weatherization aid.

“It’s not only helping families recovering from Hurricane Helene,” Williamson said, ​“but also helping these families not be burdened by rising energy costs.”

To be sure, there are several existing efforts to bridge the gap for households that need energy-efficiency retrofits as well as major repairs. Some municipalities have their own fix-it programs, Williamson said, as does the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency.

For Duke Energy customers, Williamson’s group helped win $16 million for urgent home fixes financed by shareholders. But the predominant utility doesn’t serve the state’s farthest-flung counties, including some heavily hit by Helene.

“It’s fantastic that pre-weatherization dollars can be used for people who are members of electric cooperatives,” she said. ​“Otherwise, these households are getting left behind.”

The $10 million announcement from the State Energy Office comes at a crucial time for weatherization efforts statewide. In 2021, the program got a $90 million boost from the federal bipartisan infrastructure law — funding not yet swept up in the Trump administration’s assault on clean energy and energy efficiency.

After months of planning, the Stein administration says those funds will be deployed starting in January and spent by the end of the decade, with hopes of serving around 2,000 households annually. The plan includes up to $12.6 million for major health and safety repairs.

“It’s such a great sign that the state is dedicating funds to this issue,” Williamson said. ​“When homes are more efficient, it helps benefit the rest of North Carolina,” she added. ​“They’re lowering energy use and lowering their impact on the grid.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Helene-Tree-Asheville.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=56abe94bac1b6bc557d73624b69eb499,N,,2025-09-25 03:58:41.934150

The program will also spotlight growing investment in hydrogen vehicles and fueling infrastructure, along with natural gas and propane fleets—longstanding clean fuel options that are now rapidly transitioning to renewable, ultra-low-carbon forms of these fuels.

Fleets attending ACT Expo 2026 will explore:

How connected technologies, AI and advanced analytics, and fleet intelligence are boosting uptime and lowering costs.

How advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are increasing fleet safety performance and accelerating the commercialization of autonomous vehicles.

Where autonomous vehicles are now running in commercial applications and how, when and where this technology will be ready for adoption in their own operations.

What physical and corporate infrastructure is required to truly unlock the value of digital vehicle platforms.

The latest developments in bringing lower-cost, zero-emission commercial vehicles to market and how fueling infrastructure expansion is happening in parallel.

Real-world success stories in battery-electric and hydrogen vehicles, where investment remains strong and scaling is beginning to occur.

The renaissance taking place in the natural gas and propane vehicle industries, and where and how increasingly carbon-negative renewable fuels are playing a role.

Real-world deployment and funding strategies from leading fleet executives.

“The pace of change and acceleration of advanced technologies in commercial transportation is phenomenal; it’s unlike anything we have seen before,” said Erik Neandross, President of Clean Transportation Solutions at TRC, producers of ACT Expo. “From the boardroom to the show floor, ACT Expo is the one place where C-suite representatives from fleets, OEMs, and infrastructure partners engage directly to shape real-world progress and the future of their businesses.

Chris Wright's remarks are the latest in the series of US officials talking about US President Donald Trump's punishing 50 per cent tariffs on India, half of which are a penalty for buying oil from Russia.

‘Huge fan of India’

Wright also said that he is a “huge fan” of India and that the US wants to expand energy trade with India, however, the latter is “caught up in the middle of another issue”, seemingly referring to the Russian war in Ukraine.

Echoing President Trump's reasoning of punishing India with steep tariffs for doing business with Russia, Wright said that Trump's “greatest passion is peace"" and that India's purchase of Russia's sanctioned oil, along with China and Turkey, helps fund the war in Ukraine.

“I am a huge fan of India. We love India. We look forward to more energy trade, more interactions back and forth with India and then India is caught up in the middle of another issue. President Trump's greatest passion is peace in the world...The Russian war in Ukraine, of course, is brutal. We all want to see it come to an end. But where does the sanctioned Russian oil go? It goes to China, India, and Turkiye and that helps Russia fund that war,” Wright said.

His remarks come after Trump accused India and China of being the ""primary funders"" of the Ukraine war on Tuesday during his address at the United Nations General Assembly.

New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users.
Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. (AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world's largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana's economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,"" the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

The growth of clean energy jobs was more than three times that of overall job growth in 2024, according to the 2025 Clean Jobs America report.
There were nearly 100,000 new clean energy jobs by year’s end.
Only two blue states are among the 10 that have seen the fastest growth in clean energy jobs since 2020.
Nearly a third of the 3.6 million clean energy jobs are in the South.","In Brief:

Clean energy jobs grew much faster than jobs in other sectors last year, a new report finds.

Southern states were among those with the biggest rates of increase. They now account for almost a third of these jobs.

Federal policy changes could slow continued growth, opening the door for states and business to lead.

The growth of clean energy jobs was more than three times that of overall job growth in 2024, according to the 2025 Clean Jobs America report.

There were nearly 100,000 new clean energy jobs by year’s end. Almost 3.6 million Americans now work in sectors including clean vehicles, renewable energy generation and energy efficiency.

These numbers are drawn from Bureau of Labor Statistics data, supplemented by a survey of more than 40,000 companies. The jobs report comes from E2, a nonprofit that works with investors and business leaders.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director.

The South Is Leading

The highest rates of job increase in 2024 weren’t in Western states, with the exception of Idaho (see map). West Virginia, Louisiana, Florida and Oklahoma were all in the top 10.

Longer-term trends are similar. Only two blue states are among the 10 that have seen the fastest growth in clean energy jobs since 2020. Kentucky, Alabama and Tennessee are all on this list.

This concentration is reflected in the overall size of the workforce. Nearly a third of the 3.6 million clean energy jobs are in the South.

Renewable jobs have increased dramatically since 2020. A continuous upward trend accelerated after 2022.

Growth Is Slowing

Changing federal policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill’s rollback of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits and an executive order freezing disbursement of IRA funds to support clean energy programs, are expected to slow growth.

E2 has identified more than $22 billion in clean investments that have been canceled since the beginning of 2025. This means the loss of nearly 17,000 jobs.

States are realizing that they need to step up, Keefe says. Ninety percent of the new power capacity added in 2024 came from renewables.

Data centers and AI are driving intense demand, and solar and wind are the fastest and cheapest ways to get more electricity. The wait for a new turbine for a natural gas power plant is currently seven years, Keefe says.

He points to recent bipartisan bills enacted in California that extend its cap-and-trade program and call for establishment of a regional electricity market that would increase grid stability as an example of how states can lead.

The tech industry is also moving toward clean energy, Keefe says. States aren’t happy with their huge electricity demands. A workforce that can foster ongoing energy innovation, and build and maintain systems, is part of the AI support system.

(AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world's largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana's economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,"" the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Now, the 50 or so remaining residents must plant portable gardens in canoes and small boats.
We’re part of the land, the air, the water.” Philippe explained.
“Instead of fixing it, I broke it.” Chris Brunet took the offer and left the island for the new community.","Third and final in a series on a recent visit to Louisiana’s bayous, a trip sponsored by the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, to start a conversation between people there who are being flooded out and those in the Down East communities of Carteret County who face similar threats.

GRAND BAYOU VILLAGE, La. – Home is where we feel we belong. Its mystic cords connect us to everything we know and cherish – our family, our friends, our culture, our past. Its hold on us is so complete that we must fight to save it, even as the water rises around our ankles.

Maybe, in the end, that’s the simple, but profound, lesson in all this.

A group of North Carolinians had gone to the battered bayous of southern Louisiana to connect with those at the edge of the climate crisis. We found resilient people who have withstood numerous storms and the constant flooding that comes with living at ground zero for rising seas. We found a natural world that is changing so rapidly and so dramatically that those who live there barely recognize it anymore. We had hoped to return better prepared for what’s coming because our state’s uniformly flat coastal plain will be one of most-threatened landscapes in America.

The scientists, as they did there in Louisiana, will almost certainly advise us to surrender to the impending flood. But it’s never that simple. Like the survivors of the bayous, we will try to adapt, pick up the pieces and soldier on, many to the bitter end. This is home, after all, and retreat isn’t an option.

“Leaving would be almost like death,” said Rosina Philippe, before we boarded the small skiffs for the short trip to her village in the bayou. We can reach it only by boat. “For us, home is more than the building you live in.”

Philippe is an elder in the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha Tribe, one of the several small Native American groups we visited. They fled from Andrew Jackson in the 1830s and sought refuge along the remote, watery fringes of the continent. Her people settled here in south Plaquemines Parish, close to where the Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico. Here, they fished; they farmed; they survived.

But, then, the water started rising. Slowly, at first. Then, more rapidly. Now, acres of marsh disappear in what seems like a blink of an eye. (See a previous story for the reasons.)

The small squadron of skiffs glided through Grandpa Bayou to what remains of Grand Bayou Village. Fourteen houses, perched on wooden stilts pounded into small plots of squishy land, dotted the water. No road connects them. “When I was a girl, there were forests as far as you can see,” Philippe said, as she scanned the open waters of the Gulf. “You could walk for miles without boots on your feet.”

Her grandparents told of a time, back in the 1940s, when almost 1,000 tribal members lived in hundreds of houses that lined the high ground of the bayou for more than five miles. Each had a proper yard with enough land to raise goats and plant peach orchards. The surrounding waters provided their bounty of fish, shrimp, crabs and oysters. Now, the 50 or so remaining residents must plant portable gardens in canoes and small boats. They try to protect their burial grounds and other sacred sites with reefs made from oyster shells recycled from New Orleans restaurants, 40 miles away.

Most of the tribe’s 800 members have left, but those who remained, including Philippe and her brother Maurice, intend to stay. She already has a solution for when dry land completely disappears. She’ll live on a houseboat moored to her sunken home.

“Everything you see around us is in our DNA. We’re part of the land, the air, the water.” Philippe explained. “If you leave, you become someone else. You are no longer the same person. No longer the same people.”

A Homecoming

In Ironton, 20 miles to the north on Louisiana Highway 23, the Rev. Haywood Johnson Jr. is trying to bring his flock home after a series of devastating hurricanes scattered it to the wind. Most are descendants of the slaves who founded the settlement soon after emancipation, making Ironton one of the oldest Black communities in the state.

Being Black and poor in the Deep South during the reign of Jim Crow meant nothing was ever easy. Life was particularly onerous in Plaquemines Parish, where Leander Perez ruled with an iron fist for more than 40 years during the mid-20th century. The Democratic Party boss, district attorney and head of the parish commission was a racist and an avowed segregationist in the old Dixiecrat mold. He cared nothing for the Black residents of the parish and made sure they were last in line for everything – voting rights, equal schooling, sewerage, even running water. The parish didn’t lay water lines to Ironton until 1980 and then only after “60 Minutes” made a big deal of it.

The same was true of flood protection. Ironton was excluded from the massive federal levee that Congress authorized after Hurricane Katrina inundated much of southern Louisiana in 2005. Had the wall been extended 10 miles south, hurricanes Issac in 2012 and Ida nine years later would likely have been less destructive. “Ida was the worst,” Johnson said. “It devastated our community. I had never seen anything like it.”

The eye of the Category 4 storm passed over the Ironton on Aug. 29, 2121, just months after Johnson and his congregation celebrated the 143rd anniversary of their St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church. The hurricane damaged or destroyed every building in the community. Even caskets floated out of their graves.

For the third time in 16 years, Johnson’s church was wrecked. “We weren’t going anywhere,” he said. “We were going to come back and rebuild because this is our heritage. This is our identity. If you lose that, you cease to exist.”

It took four years, but Johnson was notified just before our visit in June that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had finally approved money to raise and rebuild the church. He hopes the reopening will reunite his congregation. “Many left after Ida,” he said. “Their hearts had been broken.”

He promised to invite us to the first Homecoming.

Staying Home

The bright orange globe of the setting sun was dipping into Terrebonne Bay when we came upon brothers Dominic and Levis Dardar sitting on a dilapidated dock sipping beers and admiring the sunset. They are the last members of their tribe living on their ancestral island.

The Isle de Jean Charles Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians have lived on a narrow ridge of high ground in the marsh in Terrebonne Parish for more than 170 years. Until the asphalt road was built in 1953, boats were the only reliable way to get home. Island Road today is often impassable because of high winds and tides. But few people use it now.

The amount of land that has been lost here is staggering, from 22,000 acres in 1955 to about 300 acres today. With the land went the people. Several hundred tribal members once lived in 60 or so homes. By the early 2000s, only 25 families remained on the island.

Chief Albert Naquin then began his tireless efforts to relocate the entire community to save the tribe’s culture and traditions. It took almost two decades, but the federal government In 2016 gave Louisiana $48 million to voluntarily move island residents to higher ground. It was the first federally funded climate migration program in the US.

The country’s relationship with its native peoples has been marked by disappointment and betrayal, and this deal was no different. Naquin had hoped that all his people would be reunited in one place, but only tribal members who left Isle de Jean Charles after 2012 were offered money to move. They could choose to live in a new, planned community, The New Isle, 40 miles to the north, or anywhere else in the state that was safe from flooding. Homes in the new community would eventually be available to anyone. “The plan was to reunite the tribe, and now it’s going to be destroyed,” a heart-broken Naquin told the Los Angeles Times in 2019. “Instead of fixing it, I broke it.”

Chris Brunet took the offer and left the island for the new community. “I can’t smell the water,” he told the BBC last year. “I can’t smell it, I can’t see it, I can’t sense it. And I miss it.”

As it dipped below the horizon that night, the sun cast its orange glow on the water, and the breeze carried a faint scent of the sea. “This is home,” Dominic told us. “I was born here, and this is where I will die.”",https://coastalreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Grand-Bayou-Village.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 01:59:06.465418

The United States appears to be an outlier when it comes to electric truck prices.
Several factors may drive up electric truck costs, with stakeholders pointing fingers at each other.
The study notes that, unlike electric passenger vehicles, electric truck prices are not publicly available.
One way to do this is to require state incentive applicants to report electric commercial vehicle prices.","Vehicle cost is a major barrier to electric truck adoption. That barrier has been getting higher, not lower, over the past five years.

A new study from the International Council on Clean Transportation shows that the price of Class 6-8 electric trucks has increased since model year 2020. This is despite a 20% drop in battery pack costs.

Comparatively, prices are falling for Class 5 and smaller electric commercial vehicles. Electric cargo van and full-size pickup truck prices are down 42%. Larger walk-in electric vans and electric utility trucks model year 2025 are 46% cheaper than they were with model year 2020.

When it comes to heavy-duty commercial vehicles, it costs more to buy an electric version today than it did five years ago.

Median prices for Class 8 electric trucks are up 27% since model year 2020. They now cost over $411,000, which is $87,000 more than before.

Diesel truck prices have also risen, but not as much. A new diesel truck costs about $172,500, up $18,000 (12%) since model year 2020.

Fleets may face even higher costs soon. The federal Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit offers up to a $40,000 tax credit for electric truck purchases. However, that ends on Tuesday, Sept. 30.

Any sticker shock relief will have to come from the states. Nearly 80% of the price data points in the study come from electric trucks bought with state incentives. Some states offer vouchers or rebates for electric trucks. Many of those states had adopted California’s Advanced Clean Trucks rules, which were eliminated in June.

The United States appears to be an outlier when it comes to electric truck prices. In the European Union, prices for Class 7-8 equivalent electric tractor trucks and straight trucks have fallen by 32% and 23% respectively.

What’s driving up electric truck costs?

Several factors may drive up electric truck costs, with stakeholders pointing fingers at each other.

Manufacturers told researchers changes in raw materials costs and higher demand for vehicle warranties have raised the price tag. One manufacturer said it has no control over the final price, suggesting dealerships may be at least partially responsible. However, one trucking fleet rep pushed back, saying dealerships work in slim margins and are vulnerable to pricing that manufacturers give them.

New players have also entered the market. Initially, new manufacturers were offering electric trucks while legacy manufacturers stuck with diesel. Newer companies offered lower prices to capture a larger market share.

Now, legacy manufacturers have entered the arena. With market dominance and customer loyalty, it is possible big companies like Daimler and Volvo drove up prices.

Differences between U.S. and European Union prices may be more easily explained. To start, there are significant supply chain differences between the two. Also, U.S. trucks will likely always be more expensive because of longer driving ranges that require larger batteries.

What can drive down costs?

Researchers have suggested that higher price tags may come from consumers not knowing the price in the first place.

The study notes that, unlike electric passenger vehicles, electric truck prices are not publicly available. Making these prices public could lower costs and boost electric vehicle adoption. One way to do this is to require state incentive applicants to report electric commercial vehicle prices.

“Cheaper upfront prices will make zero-emission products more accessible to fleet customers,” the study states. “Importantly, lower purchase costs amplify the total cost of ownership advantages of zero-emission commercial vehicles compared with internal combustion engine options.”

While lower upfront costs can ease one barrier to electric truck adoption, many others remain. Limited mileage ranges mean electric commercial vehicles cannot travel as far as diesel trucks before needing to recharge. The current heavy-duty charging infrastructure is sparse, causing logistical challenges for electric truck fleets.",https://landline.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09-24-25-EV-prices-pic.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 01:59:21.276643

The Town of Carrboro filed suit last year, accusing Duke Energy of deceiving the public about the dangers of fossil fuels, a strategy town leaders say delayed the clean-energy transition and left taxpayers on the hook for millions of dollars in damages.

“We need to protect our community from future harms, and this is why we find ourselves here as a plaintiff in this lawsuit,” Carrboro Mayor Barbara Foushee said.

Carrboro estimates it could face up to $60 million in future costs from road repairs, flooding and higher electricity use in public buildings as hotter temperatures and heavier rain batter the town. The complaint also cites industry ads from the 1990s questioning whether climate change was real, which attorneys say created confusion and stalled action.

Duke Energy, in its motion to dismiss, says Carrboro’s claims are misplaced and preempted by federal law. The company argues the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency authority over greenhouse gas emissions, not local governments. It also says climate change is a global phenomenon that cannot be traced back to a single utility.

“Artful pleading cannot transform the City’s complaint into anything other than a suit over global greenhouse gas emissions,” Duke lawyers wrote in a brief, citing similar cases dismissed in other states.

Carrboro counters that the case is not about regulating emissions but about deception. In its opposition filing, the town said Duke ran “widespread deception campaigns about its fossil-fuel products and climate change” and that courts have a duty to hear such claims.

The lawsuit is unusual because most climate cases in the United States have targeted oil and gas producers. Legal experts say bringing utilities into the fold could raise new questions for courts, since power companies are heavily regulated and also responsible for keeping the lights on.

The hearing comes as Duke Energy is expanding its natural gas infrastructure after state lawmakers this summer repealed a requirement that the company cut carbon emissions 70% by 2030. The General Assembly overrode Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, eliminating the interim deadline while keeping a 2050 net-zero goal in place. Analysts warn the shift could drive up customer costs, while supporters say it ensures reliable electricity as data centers and new factories move to North Carolina.

Duke has pledged to retire its coal plants by 2035 and reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. In a recent filing, the company said it is “executing an ambitious clean energy transition” that balances affordability and reliability.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act1 (OBBBA) makes major changes to the Internal Revenue Code’s (Tax Code) clean energy tax provisions, particularly to the provisions that were extended, expanded, and established as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). In some cases, the OBBBA terminates or limits the duration of energy tax incentives. In other cases, it imposes new requirements that must be met in order to claim the remaining incentives. In particular, the OBBBA imposes a series of restrictions that apply when a “prohibited foreign entity” (PFE) participates in the production supply chain for a facility or product for which a taxpayer seeks to claim an energy tax credit.

This alert describes the new PFE rules based on the statutory language of the OBBBA. Pursuant to Executive Order 14315 of 7 July 2025 and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Notice 2025-42, forthcoming guidance from the US Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is expected that will shed additional light on the implementation of these rules. The discussion starts with some brief background. Then it describes the operation of the rules, including their scope; the key definitions of PFE, specified foreign entity (SFE), and foreign-influenced entity (FIE); and the application of the material assistance test.

These new PFE rules are important. They also are complicated, requiring a cascading series of determinations, which are outlined below.

Background

Over the past several years, there has been growing congressional concern about the United States’ reliance on companies related to potential foreign adversaries, particularly China, in the supply chain for critical products. This concern has been the subject of investigations and hearings,2 and it has resulted in the enactment of several laws imposing restrictions on foreign products and components.

The first of the new statutory restrictions was enacted in 2021, as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).3 The IIJA established grant programs for, among other things, battery processing projects, recycling projects, and critical minerals mining projects. In each case, the law prohibited grants from being awarded to projects using material that originates from or is supplied or processed by a foreign entity of concern (FEOC).4 The definition of a FEOC covers organizations that are designated as threats to national security by various federal agencies.5

Several other recent laws imposed similar restrictions, including the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which imposed restrictions with respect to semiconductor manufacturing projects;6 the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2021, which imposed restrictions associated with Chinese military companies;7 the Uyghur Sanctions Act, which imposed restrictions on various companies operating in or associated with China’s Xinjiang autonomous region;8 and the NDAA for fiscal year 2024, which imposed restrictions on seven specifically identified Chinese battery production companies.9

The 2022 IRA extended, expanded, and established various clean energy tax credits. In one case—the new section 30D tax credit for electric vehicles—the IRA imposed a FEOC restriction, making the credit unavailable for an otherwise eligible clean vehicle if any of the critical minerals contained in the battery “were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of concern [as defined in the IIJA]” or if any of the vehicle’s battery components “were manufactured or assembled by a foreign entity of concern (as so defined).”10

As Congress began work on the bill that became the OBBBA, there was significant interest, among the bill’s proponents, in cutting back the IRA clean energy tax provisions, partly for budgetary reasons and partly for other policy reasons.11 The final version of the OBBBA enacted many provisions along these lines, including provisions terminating or limiting the duration of energy tax incentives and imposing new requirements that must be met in order to claim the remaining incentives.

A key part of this effort was the dramatic expansion of the FEOC restrictions. Under the OBBBA, the FEOC restrictions—now referred to as the PFE restrictions—apply more broadly to many more energy tax provisions than just section 30D; the restrictions also reach more deeply, imposing restrictions that go well beyond those under the FEOC rules. The new PFE rules are, essentially, FEOC on steroids.

We now turn to the operation of the new rules.

Operation

The new restrictions apply to six tax credits, but the scope of the restriction varies. For three credits—the section 45Q carbon sequestration credit, the section 45U nuclear credit, and the section 45Z clean fuels credit, the scope is relatively limited, simply prohibiting a PFE from qualifying for the credit.12 For the three other credits—the section 45Y and section 48E clean electricity credits and the section 45X advanced manufacturing credit, the scope is broader, not only prohibiting a PFE from qualifying for the credit but also denying the credit for projects with respect to which a PFE provides material assistance.

We next discuss the definition of a PFE. Then we turn to the rules regarding material assistance.

Definition of a PFE

New Tax Code section 7701(a)(51) provides, simply, “the term ‘prohibited foreign entity’ means a specified foreign entity or a foreign influenced entity.” (Emphasis added.) So, at the most basic level, a PFE includes both an SFE and an FIE.

The first of these terms, SFE, comprises five categories of entities drawn from the FEOC rules and other existing statutory definitions.13 The five categories are as follows:

A FEOC (per the existing statutory definition).14

A Chinese military company (per an existing statutory definition).

A listed Uyghur sanctions entity (per an existing statutory definition).

A listed prohibited battery entity (an existing statutory definition).

A “foreign controlled entity,” which is the government of a “covered nation” or an entity that is a citizen of, incorporated in, or controlled by a “covered nation.”15

There are various details to consider, and some of the relevant lists can be expanded by administrative action.16 That said, as a general matter, the determination of whether an entity falls into one of these five categories, and hence constitutes an SFE, is relatively mechanical, although facts and circumstances, such as indirect ownership, could be complicating factors.

Then comes the more difficult part. A PFE, again, includes not only an SFE, but also an FIE. With respect to an FIE, the determination requires the application of a series of tests, some complex and subjective.

As a general matter, the determination that an entity is an FIE looks back to whether an SFE is involved. Specifically, an FIE is an entity that is subject to either formal control or effective control by an SFE.

The test for formal control,17 in section 7701(a)(51)(D)(i), is mechanical. An entity is an FIE if any one of the following relationships exists:

An SFE has authority to appoint a covered officer.

A single SFE owns at least 25% of the stock.

SFEs, in the aggregate, own at least 40% of the stock.

SFEs, in the aggregate, hold at least 15% of the debt.

However, testing for formal control is only the first level of analysis. Even if none of these relationships exist, an entity nevertheless is an FIE if it has made a payment to an SFE in exchange for the SFE’s right to exercise any one of four forms of “effective control,” which are control of a qualified facility; control of energy storage technology; control of the extraction, processing, or recycling of a critical mineral; or control of the production of an eligible component.

This takes us to the meaning of the term “effective control.” As a starting point, the statute provides that “effective control” means an agreement providing a SFE counterparty with “specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation … or energy storage….” The Treasury Secretary then is directed to issue guidance regarding effective control. Until such guidance is issued, the statute further provides that “effective control” means the unrestricted contractual right of an SFE counterparty to control any one of the following: the amount or timing of the production of components; the amount or timing of the production or storage of electricity; the use of components; the purchase or use of output; access to data, a site, or personnel; or maintenance, repair, or operations.

There are special rules for licensing. New Tax Code section 7701(b)(51)(D)(ii)(III) provides that, with respect to agreements for licensing intellectual property (and related agreements), “effective control” means the retention of a contractual right to specify or direct the sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals; the retention of a contractual right to direct operations; the retention of a contractual right to limit the use of the intellectual property; the retention of a contractual right to receive royalties for more than 10 years; the retention of a contractual right to provide services for more than two years; or a limitation on the provision of data, information, or know-how.18

Finally, the statute establishes special rules exempting certain publicly traded entities,19 defining various terms, and establishing rules for determining the beginning of construction (BOC). Notably, BOC rules for PFE purposes differ from BOC standards for other energy credit purposes.20

Pulling this together, the definition of a PFE starts with a relatively mechanical definition, of a SFE, then expands to include a FIE, which is an entity that is subject to either formal or effective control by an SFE, with effective control determined by several tests that are subjective and will be fleshed out by forthcoming guidance.

For three energy tax credits, the determination of whether an entity is an PFE is the end of the matter: Under sections 45Q, 45U, and 45Z, if the taxpayer itself is a PFE, it is not eligible for the credit; if the taxpayer itself is not a PFE, no limitations apply.

Not so for three other energy tax credits: Under sections 45Y, 45X, and 48E, even if the taxpayer itself is not an PFE, it is prohibited from claiming the credit for a facility that receives material assistance from a PFE.

The key provision is OBBBA section 70512(b), which amends Tax Code section 45Y(b)(1) to add new subparagraph (E), which provides, “[t]he term ‘qualified facility’ shall not include any facility for which construction begins after December 31, 2025, if the construction of such facility includes any material assistance from a PFE (as defined in section 7701(a)(52)).” Sections 45X and 48E contain similar limitations.21

We now turn to the definition of material assistance.

Material Assistance

The OBBBA establishes a new overarching definition under paragraph (52) of Tax Code section 7701(a). It provides, in subparagraph (A), that the term “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” means:

With respect to any qualified facility or energy storage technology, a material assistance cost ratio which is less than the threshold percentage applicable under subparagraph (B), or

With respect to any facility which produces eligible components, a material assistance cost ratio which is less than the threshold percentage applicable under subparagraph (C).

Paragraph (52) then goes on, in subparagraphs (B) through (G)—which stretch over more than a dozen pages of statutory text—to elaborate: defining the material assistance cost ratio (MACR), establishing threshold percentages, establishing a system for providing safe harbors, and establishing certification requirements.

The general rule establishes that material assistance is provided if the MACR is less than the relevant “threshold percentage.” Put simply, the MACR measures the percentage of applicable direct costs attributable to non-PFE sources. Determining the MACR is, on its face, relatively straightforward. Under section 7701(a)(52)(E), the MACR is the quotient of the amount of total applicable direct costs attributable to the qualified facility, energy storage technology, or production of eligible components, less the applicable direct costs attributable to products, components, or energy storage technology that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, divided by the total applicable direct costs. In other words, the MACR is the ratio of total applicable direct costs minus applicable direct costs attributable to an PFE compared to the total applicable direct costs. For example, if the total applicable direct costs of constructing a qualified facility are US$100, and the applicable direct costs attributable to an PFE are US$20, the MACR is 100-20/100, or 80%. For qualified facilities and energy storage technology, applicable direct costs include labor and materials. For eligible components, the applicable direct costs are materials.

So far, so good. The MACR then is applied against a “threshold percentage,” which varies by product and over time. With respect to products, there are separate percentages for qualified facilities, for energy storage technology, and for components—with components broken down into solar components, wind components, inverters, battery components, and critical minerals. With respect to the time period, in each case, the threshold percentage increases (that is, becomes more stringent) by year. For example, for inverters, the threshold percentage rises by increments of 5 percentage points a year from 2026 to 2030—that is, from 50% in 2026 to 70% in 2030, effectively reducing the percentage of applicable direct costs that can be PFE-related.

In an implicit acknowledgement of the complexity of the MACR system, the Treasury Secretary is directed to establish “safe harbor tables” and other appropriate guidance to identify the total direct costs (of manufactured products and components) attributable to a PFE and to “provide all rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer’s material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” The statutory deadline for the safe harbor tables and other guidelines is 31 December 2026.

In the meantime (that is, before the safe harbor issues are promulgated), a taxpayer may rely on two sets of materials, so long as the taxpayer does not know or have reason to know to the contrary: on the tables included in IRS Notice 2025-0822 (to establish the total direct cost of any listed component or manufactured product) and on a supplier’s certification (to establish that the product or component was not produced or manufactured by a PFE and to establish total direct costs).

Having thus laid out the system for calculating the MACR, the section 7701(a)(52) definition of “material assistance” then briefly concludes with some “housekeeping” provisions: defining various terms, providing regulatory authority, and establishing rules for the treatment of existing contracts, to prevent circumvention, for determining BOC23 and for determining ownership. The OBBBA also extends the statute of limitations and establishes significant penalties in the case of errors and understatements associated with the MACR.

Forthcoming Guidance

The provision of regulatory authority, in paragraph (52)(G), comes with a post-enactment twist. Three days after signing the OBBBA, President Trump issued an executive order, entitled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies For Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources,”24 directing the administration to implement the OBBBA clean energy tax provisions consistently with the intent of the OBBBA, which the executive order describes as including the “end [of] taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign adversaries.” As part of this implementation effort, the executive order specifically directs the Treasury Secretary to “take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the [OBBBA].” Given this direction, we expect the administration, in issuing guidance interpreting the PFE provisions, to lean into a stringent interpretation that will provide further clarity on the implementation of the PFE rules. Members of Congress continue to retain a close interest in these developments as well. Several senators, including Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Sen. John Curtis (R-UT), and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) have placed holds on certain Treasury nominees as they evaluate Treasury’s guidance.25

With respect to nonbudgetary policy, President Donald Trump’s recent executive order (see footnote 24) decried “taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign adversaries.”

Section 7701(a)(51)(B)(i) incorporates four of the five, subparagraphs (A), (B), (D), and (E), but not subparagraph (C), which includes a list of “covered nations” that is identical to the list of covered nations incorporated elsewhere in this OBBBA provision and hence would be redundant.

15 Under present law, a “covered nation” is China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran. See Pub. L. No. 116-283 § 9901(8).

16 Under subparagraph (D) of the fiscal 2021 NDAA FEOC provision, an entity is a FEOC if it is “alleged,” by the US Attorney General, “to have been involved in activities for which a conviction was obtained” under various national security laws. Under subparagraph (E), an entity is a FEOC if the Treasury Secretary determines that the entity is “engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to the national security or foreign policy of the United States.”

17 Tax Code § 7701(a)(51)(D)(i). “Formal control” is not the term used in the statute itself; rather, it is a term we use here for convenient reference.

18 There is an exception for the bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. Tax Code § 7701(b)(51)(D)(ii)(III)(bb).

19 The rules with respect to publicly traded entities are particularly complex. As a starting point, the definition of a PFE excludes an entity that is traded on a national securities exchange regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or on any other exchange or market that the Treasury Secretary determines has sufficient rules in place (unless the exchange is incorporated, organized, or has its principal place of business in a covered nation (currently China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran)), or either the entity’s securities are traded in a similar manner or at least 80% of the securities are held by an entity whose securities are traded on a national exchange regulated by the SEC. However, the exclusion does not apply if the entity is required to report under certain beneficial ownership rules or if a SFE either has the authority to appoint a covered officer or holds more than 15% of the debt. 26 U.S.C.

20 See footnote 3 of IRS Notice 2025-42, noting “Section 70512 of the OBBBA added . . . new restrictions regarding certain foreign entities in order to qualify for the § 45Y credit and the § 48E credit, among others, and included separate beginning of construction rules for those new provisions.” The IRS Notice further indicates the IRS and Treasury are drafting responsive guidance to implement those restrictions.

But the latest planetary health check from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research is a brutal reminder of how close the Earth is being pushed beyond repair. Seven of the nine planetary boundaries are now breached, with ocean acidification added to the danger list. Yet the world has proved that cooperation works: the ozone layer is healing, air pollution controls are working. A decisive test looms at the end of the month, when governments must file new climate pledges, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). This is no time to ease off: the fossil-fuel era must end, and the clean‑energy transition must accelerate.

There is real concern that big emitters, including Australia and the EU, will fall short of what is needed to avoid extreme heating. The EU is set to miss this month’s NDC deadline, while most fossil-fuel producers plan to cut emissions at the margins instead of phasing out production. Since Donald Trump has withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, the US will make no fresh commitments at all. At the UN, Mr Trump trotted out the same stale oil-industry talking points he’s been peddling for years.

But there are also encouraging signs, including the fact that global investment in renewables keeps rising. In the first half of 2025 it reached a record $386bn, 10% higher than the same period last year. China alone installed more than 250GW of solar power capacity in this brief period – more than twice as much as the rest of the world combined. However, China’s new NDC targets just 7% to 10% cuts in emissions by 2035 – not enough to hit Paris’ goals. It’s the right direction but the wrong speed.

Global investment in clean energy, including nuclear and grid upgrades, is also up, and expected to reach around $2.2tn in 2025 – roughly twice the amount being spent on fossil fuels. Since inadequate grids have been an obstacle to the expansion of clean power in many countries, including the UK, this too is good news. However, the rise of anti-climate populists in European states including Germany is deeply concerning, and perhaps explains the EU’s increased caution. A “statement of intent” by the bloc last week indicated that it expects to commit to emissions cuts of up to 72.5% by 2035 (compared with 1990 levels), which falls short of the 79% or more that campaigners have pushed for.

Responsible politicians everywhere must proactively address voters’ concerns about the impact of green policies on their lives, and keep reminding them how much more costly and dangerous the alternatives to a green transition are. In the US, too, climate policies are progressing – despite the Trump administration’s opposition. About 19 states, and corporations covering two-thirds of US corporate revenues, still back net zero.

Renewables growth is essential, but unless carbon emissions are reduced at the same time, net zero is impossible.

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, September 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy announces the LAMP National Summit, taking place October 8–10, 2025, at the historic St. Regis Hotel in Washington, D.C. This annual gathering brings together state legislators, policymakers, business leaders, and innovators from across the nation to shape the policies powering America’s digital and energy future.

Over three days, attendees will take part in plenary sessions, awards presentations, policy breakouts, and skills workshops designed to equip leaders with practical tools to make an impact in their state. Discussions will span artificial intelligence, national security, energy dominance, clean energy innovation, government efficiency, free and fair elections, and lessons learned from recent disaster response efforts. The program also includes recognition ceremonies honoring leaders and community heroes who have advanced freedom, equality, and civic excellence nationwide.

“The LAMP National Summit is about preparing today’s leaders for tomorrow’s challenges,” said Sarah E. Hunt, President and Founder of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy. “Through LAMP we’ve created a space where state lawmakers, innovators, and civic leaders can exchange ideas, strengthen relationships, and leave better equipped to make an impact in their state.”

This exclusive summit will bring together 50+ state legislators, members of Congress, federal appointees, industry leaders, and innovators. Participants will engage directly with decision-makers at the state and federal levels; drive conversations at the intersection of national security, energy abundance, AI, and resilience; and help shape breakout sessions, panels, and sponsorships aligned with their priorities.

“Attending the last LAMP Summit gave me the chance to connect with peers from across the country and dive into practical solutions—everything from advanced nuclear and hydrogen to the responsible use of AI. These conversations didn’t just stay in Washington. I’ve brought ideas home that are now informing policy discussions in my own state on national security, strengthening the energy grid, and tackling housing so that the American dream remains within reach for every family,” said Amelia Powers Gardner, Utah County Commissioner.

The LAMP National Summit is open to elected officials, policy professionals, and invited guests who share a commitment to effective leadership and collaborative problem-solving.

“I am thrilled to welcome Valencia Pipe Company to Rocky Mount to launch their East Coast distribution hub,” said Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson.","Lenovo will invest $77 million to expand its existing manufacturing and fulfillment facility in Whitsett, North Carolina. The global technology company is expected to create more than 400 new jobs as it expands its server manufacturing and fulfillment capabilities in Guilford County.

“Lenovo has been a significant contributor to the North Carolina economy for the past 20 years and the expansion of our facility in Guilford County, which first opened in 2007, will build on our long-term commitment to the state and Triad region for many years to come. Our desire to further expand here is driven by strong customer demand and the strength of the region’s connectivity, workforce, and business infrastructure, meaning we can deliver to customers more quickly and efficiently,” said Ryan McCurdy, President, North America and North America Site Leader, Lenovo. “We welcome the support received from the community and government agencies and look forward to working with all to bring this investment to fruition.”

North Carolina is one of more than 30 manufacturing locations for Lenovo in 11 different markets around the world, and is part of the company’s global/local strategy that balances global scale with local capabilities and delivery. The Guilford County expansion will strengthen the company’s footprint in the Piedmont Triad, further integrating the region into Lenovo’s global supply chain excellence and innovation.

“Given Lenovo’s long history in North Carolina, we are particularly pleased that they have again chosen to expand their operations here. The state continues to be an ideal environment for global tech companies like Lenovo,” said Chris Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina (EDPNC). “With our skilled labor force, strategic location, and pro-business climate, North Carolina is well-positioned to support this kind of transformative investment.”

“Lenovo’s expansion will be another major milestone in Guilford County’s tech momentum,” said Sherri Thomas, Chair of the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce. “This announcement is a reflection of the partnerships and talent that make our region a place where great companies want to grow.”

The Guilford County Economic Development Alliance, comprised of the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce and the High Point Economic Development Corporation, worked together with the EDPNC, North Carolina Department of Commerce, Guilford County, Duke Energy, Guilford Technical Community College, and Guilford Works to support Lenovo’s expansion.

CMC Brings Jobs, Investment To East Spencer

CMC, a global leader in the manufacturing, recycling, and fabrication of steel and metal products, will establish operations in East Spencer, North Carolina. The company will locate in a facility within the new Rusher Farms Commerce Center, creating new jobs over the next five years and investing $1 million in equipment. CMC plans to begin operations at the facility in fall 2025.

The new East Spencer facility will support CMC’s growth strategy while contributing to Rowan County’s expanding industrial sector.

“As the first company to establish operations in the new Rusher Farms Commerce Center—our town’s first designated economic development area—CMC’s arrival is truly a catalyst for revival,” said East Spencer Mayor Barbara Mallett. “We are thrilled to welcome CMC to our community and are confident that their presence will bring transformative benefits, fostering growth and prosperity for all.”

“CMC’s decision to expand in Rowan County highlights the advantages our area offers, from a skilled workforce to a strategic location,” said Greg Edds, chairman of the Rowan County Board of Commissioners. “We look forward to building a long-term partnership with CMC as they continue to grow.”

“We are thrilled to welcome a company with CMC’s longstanding reputation and global reach to our community,” said Rod Crider, president of the Rowan Economic Development Council. “This investment not only brings high-quality jobs but also strengthens the foundation of advanced manufacturing in our region.”

Valencia Pipe Company Grows In South Rocky Mount

California-based Valencia Pipe Company (VPC) will open a 70,000-square foot manufacturing facility in the old Trinity building in Edgecombe County at 1549 Vance Street in South Rocky Mount with operations set to begin October 1, 2025.

The company manufactures rotationally molded polyethylene containers for use as water, septic, cistern and multi-use tanks. The company also manufactures parts used with various types of tanks. With $18 million in annual sales, Valencia Pipe Company is the 32nd largest rotational molder in North America according to Plastic News magazine.

Rocky Mount will be the third production facility that Valencia Pipe has opened in the past two years. Facilities were opened in Miami, OK and Wabuska, NV in 2024. Opening the Rocky Mount plant is a major step for the company as it moved to attract more East Coast customers as well as to better serve all of its customers across the U.S.

“We invested in this market using the latest in manufacturing technology and bringing in industry experts to guide us at every stage of our process. We’re very excited for this next phase in Rocky Mount,” said Valencia Pipe Company CEO Andrew Dervin.

Valenica Pipe officials point to the company’s success based on its track record for meticulous product design, customer service and deep industry expertise. The products the company will manufacture in Rocky Mount are difficult to bring to market because they are produced in accordance with environmental and government regulations.

The company has invested in the latest manufacturing technology for the plant so that it can be put into operation as quickly as possible, according to Christopher Butler, Valencia Pipe Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.

“I am thrilled to welcome Valencia Pipe Company to Rocky Mount to launch their East Coast distribution hub,” said Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson. “They are renowned for their quality product, superior customer service, rapid turnaround times, and corporate community support. We are grateful for the new jobs and look forward to their continued growth. I stand ready to support them however I can.”

“We are so excited that Valencia Pipe Company has chosen Rocky Mount because they see an opportunity to not only expand a successful company, but to make a difference in a community that is underserved with minimal job opportunities,” commented Bob Pike, President and CEO of the Carolinas Gateway Partnership. “This project is the first of many new efforts that Carolinas Gateway Partnership is working on that will help build better futures through economic growth.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/valencia-news-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 01:58:53.131836

The credit, aimed at lending a helping hand to those who are struggling to afford their bills, will be given to those who participate in a short educational workshop on October 2.

An estimated 80 million Americans are having trouble covering the cost of their energy bills, per a 2024 survey, thanks to the spiking prices of electricity and gas.

This issue will likely worsen, as utility companies have requested or received approval for substantial rate increases, adding roughly $20 billion to consumer costs.

Those struggling to pay their energy bills often sacrifice other basic needs such as food, education, and healthcare to do so, with low-income households hit the hardest.

To lend a helping hand to these Americans, federal programs such as LIHEAP exist, as do smaller-scale state and local programs and initiatives.

For example, cash-strapped Illinoisans are being invited to attend a helpful workshop where they can get their hands on a $300 energy credit.

The City of Carbondale, Illinois - roughly 100 miles southeast of St. Louis - is encouraging customers of the energy company Ameren to attend the Ameren Illinois Community Development Workshop on October 2, per a city press release.

Ameren, which provides electric and natural gas services to customers in Illinois and Missouri, will host the event from 9 am to 4 pm at the Carbondale Civic Center located at 200 South Illinois Avenue.

Ameren energy advisors will be on-site to help review attendees' accounts in real-time and offer tips for how to save on future energy costs.

The event will also feature a brief workshop that will educate participants on the company's clean energy programs.

Those who complete the onsite educational workshop will receive a $300 energy bill credit toward their Ameren Illinois account.

The workshop will also benefit Ameren by providing feedback that the company can use to better support its customers in the future.

Space is limited and available on a first-come, first-served basis, with Ameren encouraging customers to pre-register for the event to secure a spot.

This event is expected to take roughly one hour, according to the power company.

ARE YOU ELIGIBLE?

In order to qualify to receive the $300 energy bill credit, workshop participants must have an active Ameren Illinois electric or gas account.

They are also required to have a household income at or below 300% of the federal poverty level.

A single-person household, for example, must make $3,912 or less per month, while a family of two is capped at $5,289.

A three-person household is subject to a $6,663 monthly income, and a family of four must make $8,037 or less per month to be eligible.

The Ameren account holder must be present at the event in order to qualify for the bill credit, with participants being instructed to bring the following:

Ameren Illinois bill

Photo identification

Proof of income for the past 30 days

The $300 credit will come as a relief to Americans as many grapple with energy insecurity.

“Americans nationwide are facing an unprecedented affordability crisis from rising utility bills. A majority of consumers say they do not fully understand the charges on their utility bills. They feel powerless as energy consumers,” said Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines.

“Factors driving these increases are diverse and vary by region, but the end result is the same: utility consumers who are stressed out. They want to see action.”

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today said that they are joining nine of their Senate colleagues in calling for the Trump administration to reverse course on its disastrous decision to eliminate federal standards for greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars and medium and heavy-duty trucks that curb air pollution.

The Environmental Protection Agency recently walked away from decades worth of settled science that greenhouse gas emissions threaten Americans’ health and welfare by contributing to climate change. This rollback of an EPA decision from 2009 would decimate regulations that reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution from cars.

“If the Trump administration persists with eliminating federal vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards, it will be responsible for damaging the environment, hurting public health, costing drivers money, cutting American jobs and competitiveness, and increasing our dependence on foreign oil,” the senators wrote in their letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

“Americans should be able to drive and share the road with cleaner, more efficient vehicles that help clean up our air, save families money at the pump, and strengthen American competitiveness and energy independence. We urge you not to destroy these life- and cost-saving vehicle emission standards on the basis of faulty science and unlawful attacks on the clean air statutes passed by Congress,” the senators conclude.

The letter was led by Senator Edward J. Markey, D-Mass. In addition to Wyden and Merkley, the letter was cosigned by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., Jack Reed, D-R.I., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Alex Padilla, D-Calif., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Mazie K. Hirono, D-Hawai’i, Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Cory Booker, D-N.J.

Wyden and Merkley have long worked to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and secure investments promoting clean air in Oregon and nationwide. In March 2025, Wyden, Merkley, and 11 other Democratic senators slammed the Trump administration’s decision to roll back its finding that greenhouse gases are harmful to health and welfare. In September 2025, Wyden and Merkley sounded the alarm on EPA’s proposal to declassify greenhouse gases as a public health threat. During that same month, Wyden and Merkley joined the entire Senate Democratic caucus in opposing the Trump administration rolling back the endangerment finding. In September 2024, Wyden, Merkley, and other members of the Oregon congressional delegation secured a major investment in transportation decarbonization research at Portland State University.

Will the site be able to reopen in the near future, or will Core Natural Resources opt to lease the site for another energy company to step in?","One of the largest coal producers in the Wyoming region has taken the tough decision to idle two out of three units at the Itmann mine. Core Natural Resources made the announcement that the site will temporarily halt production, keeping only one of the three units online. In the current state of the American economy, and the rise in inflation being felt across several sectors, not just in the United States, but all around the world as well, jobs are at a premium. Union activists have come out to state their concerns over the job cuts that halting production might cause.

Consol Energy’s merger with Arch Resources was supposed to create more employment

America, along with the rest of the world, is reeling from the disastrous state of the global economy. Everything is on the rise, especially in the United States. So when a large employer like Consol Energy makes an announcement that they will keep most of the Itmann site idling, the inevitable effect on the workers will be substantial, to say the least.

According to data from the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the site produced an astonishing 292,500 short tons (265,000t) of coal in the first half of this year. The company announced in August that it would be laying off around 200 coal miners in Wyoming County, which has not gone down well with the workers’ unions, which we must remember play a crucial role in securing and safeguarding workers’ rights.

While not representing the workers at the Itmann site, the United Mine Workers of America did make a statement on the matter.

“While the Itmann Mine #5 and Preparation Plant are not represented by the UMWA, we are always concerned when coal miners and their families face job loss. The announcement that more than 200 workers are impacted is unfortunate news for those affected and their communities. No one who works hard to provide for their family and power our nation should be left without support. We hate to see anyone in the mining community lose their job, and our thoughts are with those affected. We hope Core Natural Resources will do everything possible to support its workforce during this time,” – UMWA Communications Director, Erin Bates.

With Itmann idling, and Leer South still offline, what does the future have in store for Core Natural Resources

West Virginia is a crucial location for the company. Yes, the news of the idling of the Itmann site is a concern, but we would be remiss if we did not mention that the Leer South site remains offline as well. It is seen as one of the company’s most valuable assets, producing 500,000-800,000 st/quarter of high-volatile coking coal.

The mining company chose to halt operations at Itmann following a devastating fire that damaged crucial infrastructure in January. They stated at the time that they hoped to reopen the site in the summer; however, workers sealed the site after detecting high levels of carbon monoxide inside. Will the site be able to reopen in the near future, or will Core Natural Resources opt to lease the site for another energy company to step in?

CEO Transition

As previously announced on September 3, 2025, Zentek's former CEO Greg Fenton has resigned, and CFO Wendy Ford has been appointed Interim CEO. Zentek's Board of Directors has expressed its full confidence in Wendy's ability to guide Zentek during this transition, citing her deep financial expertise, proven leadership within the Company, and strong commitment to advancing Zentek's commercialization strategy. Her appointment ensures continuity in both operations and strategy while the Board of Directors conducts a comprehensive search for a new CEO to support Zentek's next phase of growth.

As part of this process, the Board of Directors has engaged Lock Search Group - a leading executive recruitment firm that helps organizations grow and scale by placing high-impact leaders in mission-critical roles. In tandem with the Board, they will facilitate the search for the Company's next CEO who can provide strategic leadership to communicate and execute Zentek's long-term vision.

ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters

Canada

As announced on June 12, 2025, ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters achieved an average infectious aerosol removal efficiency of MS2 bacteriophage of 42% compared to an untreated filter, which achieved an average of 16%. These robust results align with previous tests performed with bacteriophage Phi6 - a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses. These results validate that ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters are unique in their ability to accomplish the following simultaneously:

Controlling infectious aerosols effectively, in line with American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (""ASHRAE"") standard 241

Maintaining this performance without an increase in pressure drop, energy consumption or carbon emissions

Operating with existing Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (""HVAC"") units

Eliminating the need for any additional equipment

Extending filter life and reducing changeout frequency, thereby lowering labour and waste disposal costs compared to denser filters

ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters were advanced through the Government of Canada's Innovative Solutions Canada (""ISC"") program, underscoring their credibility and relevance to public-sector needs and beyond. ISC also profiled Zentek in its ""Helping Canadians Breathe Easy"" feature, further validating the innovation and potential demand across Canada. As mentioned on October 17, 2023 a result of Zentek's successful ISC Testing Stream project, and eligibility under the Pathway to Commercialization (which ""gives small and medium-sized enterprises the opportunity to sell their innovation directly to the Government of Canada""), the Company looks forward to working with Public Services and Procurement Canada to facilitate federal procurement and adoption of ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters at scale.

To fully capitalize on this unique opportunity, Zentek is actively engaging with customers and manufacturing partners to service both Western and Eastern Canada. In addition, the Company is planning to hire a National Sales Leader - as well as building out a commission-based sales team - to drive adoption of ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters across key sectors, including commercial, institutional, government, education, and healthcare. This will facilitate direct engagement with both prospective and existing clients, deepen market penetration, and is intended to accelerate revenue growth as Zentek scales its go-to-market strategy in Canada.

The Company believes another one of its unique opportunities is to work with electrical utility companies interested in funding and supporting widespread adoption of technologies that can reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Zentek can help these organizations achieve this objective simply by using ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters in place of more dense filters to improve indoor air quality and the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 241, ‘Control of Infectious Aerosols.'

As part of its continuing technical business development strategy, Zentek will be presenting at the ASHRAE IEQ 2025 Conference in Montreal, one of the industry's leading global forums on indoor environmental quality. The Company's presentation, ""Energy-Efficient Solutions for Improving Indoor Air Quality and Reducing Carbon Emissions in a Canadian School: The Role of Silver-Graphene Oxide Treated HVAC Air Filters"", will take place on September 25, 2025 and demonstrate how ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters deliver superior pathogen removal, measurable energy and CO₂ savings, and seamless compatibility with existing HVAC systems compared to alternative strategies. Showcasing this data to an international audience of experts and decision makers not only further validates ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters but also expands Zentek's visibility and creates new pathways for business development and strategic partnerships in the HVAC and indoor air quality markets.

Health Canada

Zentek continues to work closely with Health Canada on the regulatory classification of its ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters, having recently submitted a formal response to the agency's preliminary regulatory position.

The Company continues to evaluate its options during the review period and remains committed to a fair and transparent regulatory process that ensures Canadians have access to innovative, energy-efficient solutions that improve indoor air quality and reduce the spread of respiratory illness.

United States

Zentek continues to explore the optimal product registration pathway to access this market in a timely manner while also ensuring the strategy supports long-term, sustainable growth. This includes exploring options with Altek Advanced Materials Inc., a Nevada incorporated private company focused on the commercialization of advanced material technologies in the United States as previously announced on September 3, 2025.

The Company intends to leverage the supply chain model for its go-to-market strategy in Canada to help support a successful launch in the US when it is able to do so.

International

Zentek continues to create awareness of the unique ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filter value proposition outside of North America by collaborating with partners in the Middle East, India and South America.

In the Middle East, the Company is actively collaborating with its Saudi-based manufacturing partner, Filtration Solutions Industrial Co. (""FSCO""), a leading manufacturer and distributor of air filtration products, to support local deployment and scale-up of ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters. In the Gulf region, the Company is advancing discussions with large-scale infrastructure stakeholders and government-linked organizations to better understand regional market needs. To help accelerate commercialization, the Company has engaged two experienced commission-based representatives for this region. In addition, the Company's partnership agreement with RSK Group is structured to help coordinate technical and business development activities in the Middle East. The Company believes these efforts position it to advance pilot installations, regulatory alignment, and regional manufacturing strategies in line with national climate and energy-efficiency goals

With its partners in India, the Company has entered into non-disclosure agreements with HVAC filter manufacturers and end customers to explore opportunities for commercializing ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters and other products. The Company continues to deepen strategic partnerships through a local presence in India, including initiatives with academic institutions and industrial collaborators.

The Company is also focusing on South America, where the Company is working closely with Canadian Trade Commissioners to identify and develop key market opportunities. To accelerate adoption, Zentek has engaged a commissioned salesperson dedicated to the region, to support direct engagement with potential partners, customers and government stakeholders. This combined approach of on-the-ground representation and diplomatic support is designed to establish early traction, foster trusted relationships, and position ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters as a leading solution for energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and improved indoor air quality across South American markets

Albany Graphite Corp.

Albany Graphite Corp. recently achieved a major milestone, purifying its graphite to 5N (99.9992%) purity with an Equivalent Boron Concentration of 2.60 ppm, meeting the less than 3 ppm threshold required for the nuclear industry. This result, delivered with American Energy Technologies Company using a halogen-free purification process, confirms that Albany graphite has the potential to be a nuclear-grade material; a space historically supplied almost exclusively by synthetic, emission-intensive graphite from China.

This achievement comes at a time when artificial intelligence (""AI"") and data centres are reshaping global energy demand. According to a recent report by the International Energy Agency, global electricity demand from data centres is projected to more than double by 2030, driven largely by AI workloads.1Meeting this demand sustainably will require a significant expansion of nuclear power generation, which many expert analyses, including research by Goldman Sachs, identify as a critical part of the energy mix to provide reliable, carbon-free baseload capacity.2

By developing a clean, natural, North American source of nuclear-grade graphite, Albany has the potential to play a strategic role in enabling the AI revolution, supplying the material critical to nuclear reactors that will power the data centers driving global digital transformation. In doing so, Zentek is not only advancing a high-value resource project but also positioning itself at the nexus of two megatrends: the rise of AI computing power and the need for secure, sustainable clean energy infrastructure.

As development of the Albany Graphite deposit progresses, Zentek is working closely with Constance Lake First Nation (""CLFN"") and engaging with government partners to ensure the project creates meaningful local benefits. Our approach emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and long-term value sharing, with a focus on training, employment, and economic opportunities for the community. By advancing Albany in partnership with CLFN and within the framework of government support for critical minerals, we aim to demonstrate how projects of this scale can deliver not only strategic supply chain security but also lasting social and environmental value for the region.

TrieraBiosciences

Triera Biosciences continues to develop the multivalent aptamer platform technology with Dr. Yingfu Li at McMaster University. Over the last year as part of the $1.1 million Government of Canada contract received via the ISC testing program, Triera utilized the multivalent aptamer technology for the development of a countermeasure for highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1).

On September 18, 2025, Zentek provided a preliminary update on the in vivo (mouse model) testing of the lead candidate developed for H5N1 as a prophylactic agent against A(H1N1) pdm09. Animals given the aptamer lead candidate prophylactically had substantially improved clinical scores, 5x greater survival rates, 80% less weight loss 5 days post-infection, and decreased recovery times compared to the control group.

Following up on these encouraging results, researchers have improved the formulation and administration schedule of the treatment and have prepared materials for more comprehensive testing of the lead candidate's performance against H1N1 and H5N1, which is scheduled to begin in a few weeks.

But as of Sept. 30, that incentive goes away. And while local car dealers aren't sure about the impact, some others feel it will affect sales.

When asked about the situation, Niagara Frontier Auto Dealers Association President Paul Stasiak said, ""What it does is create some urgency, some excitement, and some nervousness. All three.""

And maybe a last-minute opportunity to convince an on-the-fence electric vehicle customer to buy now instead of later as the Biden Administration's up to $7,500 federal tax credit for such purchases gets wiped away by the GOP's Budget Reconciliation measure passed in the summer.

It reflects a difference of political philosophies and priorities on both sides of the climate divide, but also a major multibillion-dollar issue for the auto industry.

So dealers are now trying to spread the word about this incentive to make EV's more affordable and deal with lingering concerns that EV models are more expensive than gas powered cars.

""It varies on a vehicle,"" Stasiak said. ""I mean, there's very affordable EVs depending on the product line, manufacturer, volume. It was a huge difference a little while back, but that's been minimized in many, many cases.""

That soon-to-expire federal tax credit also applied to EV leases and it allowed up to $4,000 for the purchase of a used electric vehicle.

While those federal tax credits will be gone, the New York state tax credit of $500 to $2,000 remains in effect depending on the car's mileage range.

Bloomberg and other news sites report some economists feel without the tax deal EV sales could dip by as much as 27 percent.

So what about overall sales of such vehicles here in Western New York? Stasiak said, ""Is it up a little? Of course it is. The education is there, the utility, the range. Performance. But consumers in our market they're still somewhat skeptical on the infrastructure. The infrastructure (EV charging station availability) is a big thing. People are asking dealers, where do I get a charge? Can I charge it at home? What's it take? Remember, our manufacturers are now offering incentives. You buy the car to get the charger free in many cases.""

Stasiak agrees that the Sept. 30 deadline applies to a confirmed purchase and not the actual delivery date of the electric vehicle.

""It gives the dealers the chance to get a vehicle that's coming in. They might have ordered it, been enroute. They had a commitment from a customer, so if they can proverbially sell the vehicle, they'll allow a little grace period.""

Eliminating the Endangerment Finding would effectively undermine the foundation of federal climate policy, leave Pennsylvania communities exposed to more pollution, more extreme weather, and increasing public health risks.

In the letter to Administrator Zeldin, the members expressed their strong opposition to eliminating the Endangerment Finding, stating it would strip away critical protections and expose constituents to escalating climate hazards that are already devastating Pennsylvania communities.

“The Endangerment Finding is the cornerstone of federal climate action, serving as the EPA's science-based determination that greenhouse gas pollution threatens public health and welfare. Repealing it will not change that reality,” the members wrote. “The overwhelming scientific evidence remains unchanged: greenhouse gas pollution is warming our planet, intensifying extreme weather events, and imposing escalating costs on families, workers, and communities nationwide.”

The delegation highlighted Pennsylvania's vulnerable position as a state that has already experienced devastating climate impacts. According to recent data, Pennsylvania has seen the largest increase in rainfall in the nation since the 1950s, leading to frequent and costly flooding. In 2024 alone, the state endured 12 extreme weather events, resulting in nearly $37 billion in losses. These events caused widespread destruction, killing hundreds of people and leaving disproportionately affected communities with limited resources to recover.

“Pennsylvanians are already feeling the effects of climate change through more frequent and severe extreme weather. These are not distant projections but present realities affecting our constituents from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, from rural farming communities to urban neighborhoods,” the members wrote. “We urge you to maintain the Endangerment Finding and uphold EPA's fundamental responsibility to protect communities in Pennsylvania and across the country from the documented harms of climate change.”

The letter is signed by Representatives Mary Gay Scanlon (PA-07), Chris Deluzio (PA-17), Brendan Boyle (PA-02), Dwight Evans (PA-03), Madeleine Dean (PA-04), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06), and Senator John Fetterman (D-PA).

By Rachel McDevitt

Pittsburgh Congresswoman Summer Lee is leading the Pennsylvania Democratic congressional delegation in opposing the Trump administration’s move to prevent climate action.

The administration wants to overturn the Endangerment Finding, which provides the basis for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate pollution that contributes to climate change.

In a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency’s head sent Monday, Pennsylvania’s seven Democratic U.S. Representatives and Sen. John Fetterman said that move would put their constituents in greater danger.

“These are not distant projections but present realities affecting our constituents from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, from rural farming communities to urban neighborhoods,” the lawmakers wrote.

Lee, who represents Pittsburgh and parts of Allegheny and Westmoreland counties, organized the letter.

The lawmakers said the commonwealth has recorded the largest increase in rainfall nationally since the 1950s. That’s fueled more frequent and severe flooding.

Scientists overwhelmingly agree that climate change increases the likelihood of severe storms and floods.

Pennsylvania saw 12 extreme weather events last year that killed 253 people and cost more than $36 billion in damages, the letter said.

The state is also threatened by rising temperatures, which can worsen air quality, the lawmakers said. They noted that in June this year, Allegheny County hospitals treated over 40 patients for heat-related illnesses.

“By proposing to eliminate the Endangerment Finding, the administration will undermine essential safeguards against climate pollution, leaving our constituents to face more pollution, more health harms, more extreme weather, and higher costs, especially in communities already overburdened by pollution,” the lawmakers said.",https://houlahan.house.gov/images/facebook-meta2.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 22:01:27.669613

Viles told News 2 the exact impact of the federal tax credit cuts on Tennessee’s EV industry is unclear, but any impact will likely be short-lived.
“Obviously, if you take away a $7,500 or $4,000 tax credit, there will be fewer people who make that decision [to buy EVs],” Viles said.

(WKRN) — Buying an electric vehicle may not be as beneficial for your bank account starting at the end of the month, and some believe the change could impact the Tennessee’s electric vehicle industry.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing a new EV, and the $4,000 tax credit for purchasing a used one, will disappear Sept. 30. The cuts were included in the “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress in July. Some believe it may put the breaks on the EV industry’s momentum in Tennessee.

“Those are both really important consumer incentives to encourage folks to take a closer look at an electric vehicle, and those will be going away at the end of the month,” Aaron Viles, senior director of campaigns for the Electrification Coalition, said.

According to the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, the state has made more than $16 billion in capital investments in the EV industry since 2017. Additionally, more than 191,000 EVs have been produced in TN since 2013 by the four major EV manufacturers located in the state.

Viles told News 2 the exact impact of the federal tax credit cuts on Tennessee’s EV industry is unclear, but any impact will likely be short-lived.

“Obviously, if you take away a $7,500 or $4,000 tax credit, there will be fewer people who make that decision [to buy EVs],” Viles said. “It will be interesting to see how many fewer, but I think overall because manufacturers are still very committed to this transition [toward EVs], that ultimately EVs — there will be more and more on the roads.”

Some experts have also predicted potential manufacturing job loss due to the elimination of the tax credits. According to a recent report by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Tennessee has already lost nearly 150 EV manufacturing jobs within the past 12 months due to cancellations or down-scaled investments.

However, the state remains among the top in the country for the most anticipated EV manufacturing jobs, the report said.

Despite that, multiple EV manufacturers in the Volunteer State have slowed or delayed EV production in recent months due to slower sales, including Ford’s EV plant — known as BlueOval City — located just outside of Memphis.

“In Tennessee, there’s a lot of skin in the game because it’s one of the bigger states in terms of those EV investments, so we’ll all need to watch pretty closely and carefully and see what the companies decide to do,” Viles said.",https://www.wkrn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2025/06/VOSOT.00_00_22_00.Still001.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-24 22:00:35.559285

The commission initiated the bird-friendly design effort last year with the formation of a working group that included commissioners, conservationists, developers and architects.
Currently, several planned unit developments approved by Council have bird-safe design elements incorporated into the ordinance to bolster the development’s environmental superiority.
In Arlington County, Virginia, bird-friendly design standards are tied to voluntary density bonus incentives, and noncompliant projects pay into the jurisdiction’s green building fund.
“This feels like a real triumph,” Vice Chair Mariana Krueger said of the progress being made on the bird-safe design effort.","With more than $5.5 billion generated annually in Texas from birdwatching and bird tourism, Austin leaders and community stakeholders want to ensure the safety of the roughly 400 species that reside in or migrate through Travis County each spring and fall.

As such, Watershed Protection staff have developed a set of recommended code amendments and policy updates that they’re rolling out to boards and commissions before sending the proposed changes to City Council, as directed in a resolution Council passed in late 2024.

Bird-friendly designs can include limiting the use of glass, adding solar shading or screens, applying ultraviolet coatings, using glazed or etched patterns or incorporating bird-friendly markers directly on the glass.

The Austin Environmental Commission got its first look at staff’s proposal last week and unanimously endorsed the work. The commission initiated the bird-friendly design effort last year with the formation of a working group that included commissioners, conservationists, developers and architects.

“Birds are a very important part of keeping our environment healthy,” said Craig Nazor of the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, noting their role in controlling insect populations and enhancing the soil with nutrient-rich droppings. Nazor served on the working group with chair Jennifer Bristol, who has led the commission’s work on birds.

Under staff recommendations, new commercial and multifamily buildings larger than 10,000 square feet would be required to meet bird-safe design standards for the first 100 feet of façade, measured by a “material threat factor” rating of 20 or less. The American Bird Conservancy recommends a rating of 30 or less, but Watershed Protection staff are proposing the stricter 20 rating due to the rising threat that windows pose to hummingbird populations and their vital role as pollinators.

Additionally, staff recommends implementing dark-sky lighting compliance standards to include shielded light fixtures, exterior and interior lighting on timers for after midnight and during peak migration, and directional lighting requirements to reduce light pollution that can cause birds to become disoriented.

“Dell Children’s Hospital has dark-sky lighting on their campus and what other building could you possibly want to be safer,” said Watershed Protection’s Leslie Lillly, referring to the pangs one can feel after witnessing a deadly bird collision. The hospital’s “dark-sky lighting is not super bright, and it is very easy to see and navigate around their campus.”

Other dark-sky advantages include conservation impacts, the bio-diversity benefits, and the community-engagement that happens around having bird-friendly design incorporated into the buildings, Lilly said.

Currently, several planned unit developments approved by Council have bird-safe design elements incorporated into the ordinance to bolster the development’s environmental superiority.

Cities across the nation have already implanted bird-safe design standards, with New York City requiring 90 percent of the first 75 feet of a new building’s envelope to use bird-friendly materials. In Arlington County, Virginia, bird-friendly design standards are tied to voluntary density bonus incentives, and noncompliant projects pay into the jurisdiction’s green building fund.

For single-family homes, Watershed Protection recommends an outreach campaign to encourage bird-safe practices. Commissioners agreed the effort could be an easy sell, since retrofitting glass or adding bug or solar screens, exterior shades, or awnings not only reduces bird collisions but also offers energy savings. Moreover, placing landscaping away from buildings further minimizes glass reflections while adding protection from wildfires.

“This feels like a real triumph,” Vice Chair Mariana Krueger said of the progress being made on the bird-safe design effort. “When there’s so much bad news happening every day, this just feels like a little bit of good that I think could mark a real turning point for our city.”",https://i0.wp.com/austinmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7379.jpg?fit=1936%2C1288&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-24 20:59:32.918686

Since February, EVs’ market share has averaged 17%.
Nationally, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids had a 9.5% market share in the first six months of 2025, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.
Grandbouche said the exhaust-free vehicles make sense even without state or federal tax breaks.","Electric-vehicle sales in Washington are lagging far behind targets the state has set for adoption of the climate-friendly vehicles.

After surging in 2024, sales have mostly sagged in 2025. But with federal tax breaks for purchasing electric vehicles disappearing at the end of September, sagging interest in plug-in vehicles has surged, at least temporarily, data from the Washington Department of Licensing shows.

One in four new cars sold in Washington in August can plug into an electrical outlet, the highest market share since October 2024. That was when a state-funded rebate program quickly ran out of money after helping 6,000 Washingtonians go electric.

“There's definitely been an increase that is tangible that we all see for the last 60 days or so, probably spurred by the federal tax credit ending here shortly,” said Kia of Puyallup dealership president Ryan Sawyer.

President Donald Trump’s broad spending and tax bill, passed in July, eliminates a $7,500 tax credit for buyers of new EVs and $4,000 credit for used EVs on Oct. 1. Those clean-vehicle tax credits were created in 2022 as part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to boost adoption of climate-friendly technologies.

Electric vehicles’ share of new passenger-vehicle sales in Washington averaged 22% in 2024 and hit 25% in January 2025 before tumbling after President Donald Trump retook office. Since February, EVs’ market share has averaged 17%.

Federal support for clean cars has evaporated, and many potential buyers disapprove of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's efforts to help dismantle federal agencies for the Trump administration.

Washington state’s sales-tax exemption for electric cars, in place since 2019, expired in July.

Washington’s state requires 35% of model year 2026 vehicles, some of which are already at car dealerships, to run on electricity or hydrogen, with that percentage ramping up annually to 100% by 2035. Dealers can apply credits from the previous year's EV sales to meet the requirement.

Washington’s clean-vehicle requirements are currently in limbo as states including California and Washington are fighting the Trump administration’s attempt to block their clean-vehicle laws.

Though this year’s sales are not keeping pace with state requirements, electric vehicles are much more common on Washington roadways than in many states.

“Washington is second in the nation, behind California, for EV adoption. We have 250,000 vehicles on the road right now,” Josh Grandbouche with the Washington Department of Ecology said.

Nationally, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids had a 9.5% market share in the first six months of 2025, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

Grandbouche said the exhaust-free vehicles make sense even without state or federal tax breaks.

“The vehicles are already cheaper to own, in a lot of cases,” Grandbouche said. “Fueling these vehicles up is about $1 a gallon equivalent, if you're charging at home.”

Transitioning away from gas and diesel engines is central to Washington state’s push to eliminate climate-harming pollution.

Gov. Bob Ferguson announced on Monday that the state intends to provide new incentives for clean vehicles, with specifics to be determined after gathering public input. Any new tax breaks, rebates, or other incentives would have to be passed by the state legislature.

Those subsidies would not be available to drivers wanting to switch from climate-harming vehicles to climate-friendly ones until July.

Tesla remains the dominant maker of electric vehicles in the Washington state market, though its share of EV sales has fallen to 34% since Trump took office, down from 41% in 2024, according to Department of Licensing data.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/ee1895abb49f7a5969fd638bdb8bfb12.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-09-24 20:01:18.082843

With help from state grants and a federal tax credit, Truro bought two 2025 electric Chevrolet Equinoxes and is buying a third. They will bring the town closer to its goal of making 10 percent of its vehicles electric by 2027.

A Chevy Equinox costs about $40,000, but for each one the town bought it got a $7,500 grant from the state and is expecting another $7,500 in federal tax credits, according to Communications Director Katie Riconda.

As electric vehicles generally cost more than their gas-powered counterparts, government incentives were crucial in encouraging people to buy cleaner cars.
However, Searcy said, many Californians have already bought electric vehicles and access to buying them has only increased.
“The tax credits did what they needed to do, which was a financial priming of the pump in order to impact consumer behavior in order to get people to adopt EVs,” Searcy said.
While public favorability when it comes to Musk is low, people shouldn’t lump the future of EVs and Musk together, he said.","Despite efforts at the federal level to curb California’s clean-air vehicle initiatives, including the phase out gas-powered vehicles, optimism remains on the future of electric vehicles in the state.

Yan Searcy, dean of California State University, Northridge’s College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, home of both CSUN’s Institute for Sustainability and its master’s degree in Sustainability Program, said the positive outlook comes despite federal government challenges related to environmental policies, including Pres. Donald Trump’s signing of congressional bill overturning California’s 2035 gasoline-powered car ban.

While Searcy said the state’s 2035 gasoline-powered car ban was always “an ambitious goal,” he remains optimistic as the infrastructure that has been built over the past decade in support of EVs and consumer buy-in that has followed.

“The state has always been the site of innovation when it comes to transportation and that’s going to continue in spite of what is going on in Washington,” Searcy said. “The EV industry is thriving, and I expect more people to buy-in when it comes to zero-emission vehicles in California.”

The positive outlook comes as federal tax credits for zero-emission vehicles — up to $7,500 for car buyers — is set to expire on Sept. 30 after Trump signed his legislative bill in July.

As electric vehicles generally cost more than their gas-powered counterparts, government incentives were crucial in encouraging people to buy cleaner cars. However, Searcy said, many Californians have already bought electric vehicles and access to buying them has only increased.

“The tax credits did what they needed to do, which was a financial priming of the pump in order to impact consumer behavior in order to get people to adopt EVs,” Searcy said. “We had to make it financially attractive for people to take a chance on what at the time was this new technology.

“It seems in California specifically, every third car appears to be a Tesla,” he continued. “You go to shopping malls and there used to be one or two spaces for EVs, now there’s entire sections for vehicle charging, and that can be attributed to having buy-in from people over a number of years.”

That momentum won’t stop anytime soon, Searcy said, despite controversy earlier this year when it came to Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his political activity. While public favorability when it comes to Musk is low, people shouldn’t lump the future of EVs and Musk together, he said.

“It was never about electric cars, people might have had second thoughts when it came to buying an Elon Musk product, but they don’t regret buying the electric car,” Searcy said.

There are also more options than a decade ago when it comes to electric vehicles, Searcy noted, pointing out that car brands like Lucid and Rivian have also broken into the EV car market. Rideshare companies like Waymo, which utilizes driverless EVs and have also sprung up in major cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, are attracting younger audiences in the process.

All of this, Searcy said, makes him confident Californians will continue their support of EVs and their positive impact on the environment.

“We’re raising a generation that is keen on sustainability and we’re not going back,” Searcy said. “There has also been a change in less than one generation in other ways when it comes to being sustainable; everybody now has their own water bottle and that’s just water. At least we can say Southern California was able to do that in less than one generation and I think we will look at EVs the same way in the years to come.”",https://scvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CSUN-EVS.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 20:01:26.122436

The Department of Energy has created a Strategic Uranium Reserve, now actively purchasing uranium from U.S. producers.","The United States has entered a new phase of industrial policy unlike anything seen in decades. Washington is channeling billions of dollars—through legislation, executive authority, and direct procurement—into domestic supply chains deemed critical to national security. Rare earths, nuclear fuel (announced last week), lithium, drones, specialty defense materials, semiconductors, and dual-use emerging technologies are at the center of this effort.

For investors, this may be more than a passing policy experiment. It could represent what many optimists believe will be a lasting structural reallocation of capital—one that may create winners in key industries. Below is a breakdown of the primary programs, their financial commitments, and the investment implications.

How Washington Directs Capital

The backbone of America’s new industrial strategy rests on five powerful policy and funding vehicles. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 allocates over $52 billion to reshore semiconductor manufacturing, research, and workforce development, ensuring the U.S. can meet national security and economic needs without relying on foreign supply chains (think Taiwan). The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) complements this effort with tax credits and subsidies designed to strengthen clean energy, critical minerals, and advanced manufacturing. The Defense Production Act (DPA), Title III gives the Department of Defense authority to provide grants, loans, and long-term purchase agreements to shore up domestic production of materials deemed vital to defense readiness. Meanwhile, the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office leverages federal credit to finance large-scale energy, nuclear, and critical mineral projects that private lenders might consider too risky.

Finally, the Defense Logistics Agency’s National Defense Stockpile is being rebuilt after decades of neglect, with renewed purchases of rare earths, specialty metals, and other strategic materials to secure supply for future military and industrial needs. CHIPS and Science Act (2022): Over $52 billion allocated for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, R&D, and workforce training. The recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act also is helping to allocate $2 billion to the Department of Defense for enhancing the National Defense Stockpile.

Taken together, these tools allow Washington to shape entire supply chains—from mining through advanced manufacturing—while providing anchor demand for private industry.

Semiconductors: The Foundation of Modern Security

Semiconductors are the flagship of America’s new industrial push. The Commerce Department and NIST are already deploying nearly $39 billion in direct awards under the CHIPS for America program to fund new fabs, research centers, and equipment plants.

While chip foundries capture headlines, the ripple effects extend downstream. Makers of lithography equipment, deposition tools, wafer materials, and specialty chemicals could stand to benefit from sustained capital expenditures.

Importantly, CHIPS subsidies come with “guardrails”: firms that accept U.S. subsidies are restricted from expanding advanced capacity in certain foreign jurisdictions. For investors, this reinforces the need to focus on domestic suppliers and toolmakers positioned to capture a larger share of this reshaped global supply chain.

Rare Earths and Critical Minerals

America’s reliance on overseas sources of rare earths, magnets, and strategic minerals has long been recognized as a vulnerability. Washington is now moving decisively.

Pentagon grants and loans—hundreds of millions of dollars via DPA Title III—have gone to companies like MP Materials to build domestic separation and magnet production capacity.

The Defense Logistics Agency has resumed purchases for the National Defense Stockpile, including bismuth and other specialty metals vital for defense.

The Department of Energy has launched multibillion-dollar, multi-year initiatives supporting mineral processing, recycling, and new refining capacity.

For investors, the real opportunity may be in the midstream: processors and magnet makers with high barriers to entry, especially those with government purchase agreements that reduce project risk.

Building a Strategic Uranium Reserve

Nuclear energy is back in focus—especially domestic uranium mining, enrichment, and fuel cycle capacity. The Department of Energy has created a Strategic Uranium Reserve, now actively purchasing uranium from U.S. producers. The first Trump administration tried to buy $150 million worth of uranium in 2020. In May 2024 Biden signed a law to begin moving away from our Russian dependency for uranium. Reuters recently wrote that the U.S. is far behind its peers with only 14 months of uranium inventory while Europe has two and a half years. China has 12 years of worth of inventory of uranium to supply its current needs.

DOE is also supporting advanced reactor designs and enrichment facilities through its Loan Programs Office and Civil Nuclear Credit program.

For investors, the thesis seems clear: uranium miners and fuel fabricators with U.S. operations may have the government as an anchor customer. This could create both a price floor and a financing backstop, improving project viability and long-term returns.

Drones and Autonomy

Unmanned systems have moved from experimental projects to frontline priorities. DARPA and the armed services are investing heavily—often in the hundreds of millions—into drone swarms, autonomy, and counter-drone technologies.

Small drone manufacturers, sensor developers, and autonomy software companies are particularly attractive, as their prototypes can quickly mature into full procurement programs. Unlike many areas of defense, this is a space where small- and mid-cap firms can compete with primes, as technology adoption cascades rapidly.

Investors who monitor DARPA solicitations and Air Force or Army contract announcements may be able to identify promising companies early, before they achieve mainstream recognition.

See Applied Energetics' Chris Donaghey on Directed Energy Weapons and Modern Warfare

Specialty Metals: Restocking the National Defense Stockpile

After decades of neglect, the National Defense Stockpile is being rebuilt. The Defense Logistics Agency has begun purchasing metals like titanium, tungsten, and bismuth through multi-year, multi-million-dollar contracts.

This benefits not only mining and refining companies but also the aerospace, electronics, and munitions manufacturers who rely on secure inputs. Because the global supply base for many specialty metals is narrow, even modest DLA contracts can create material demand spikes for niche producers.

Investors should track DLA solicitations closely, as they often highlight under-the-radar companies positioned for sudden growth.

Investment Implications: Following Federal Flows

For investors, Washington’s industrial policy wave may provide signals related to certain strategies:

Track solicitations and funding calls. NOFOs (Notices of Funding Opportunity) and RFPs (Requests for Proposals) often precede major contract awards.

Differentiate up- and downstream. While miners benefit, midstream processors and manufacturers may offer better risk-adjusted returns.

Seek offtake agreements. Government purchase guarantees, like MP Materials’ DoD partnership, may lower project risk and stabilize revenue.

Boosting Uranium Reserves. DOE uranium purchases and enrichment contracts could provide direct, immediate revenue streams to domestic producers.

Drone Innovation. Small defense and drone innovators could represent significant opportunities as contracts expand.

Mind the guardrails. Export controls and domestic sourcing requirements may determine which companies capture subsidies.

Conclusion: Investing in Washington’s Protectionism

The U.S. government is no longer content to rely on global markets for critical inputs. By combining legislation, executive authority, and direct procurement, Washington is rebuilding domestic capacity across semiconductors, rare earths, nuclear, drones, specialty metals, and artificial intelligence.

For investors, the opportunities could lie in identifying the companies aligned with federal commitments. Those that secure grants, contracts, or offtake agreements may stand to benefit from stable, long-term demand. These are themes I am exploring for my growth clients’ allocations including drone companies when the opportunity presents itself. By positioning ahead of these flows, investors may capture much of the upside of America’s industrial rebuild.

“In order to establish a genuine fusion industry, funding instruments must move beyond traditional research funding as quickly as possible,” the companies argued.
In their coalition agreement, the parties forming the government - chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU alliance and the Social Democrats (SPD) - agreed more support for nuclear fusion research and the goal of building “the world’s first fusion reactor”.
“Germany boasts unique diversity in fusion technology,” their statement said.
“Germany has a unique historical opportunity to develop its own industry with fusion energy and secure its own economic and technical sovereignty in the long term,” they said.","Germany’s public support for nuclear fusion technology must shift gears to avoid that the country falls behind the US and China, according to a joint call by the country’s leading fusion startups Proxima Fusion, Marvel Fusion and Focused Energy.

With cabinet discussions about Germany’s fusion strategy scheduled for 1 October, the companies urged the government to commit 3 billion euros by 2029 to build the large-scale demonstration plants they have planned, which would mark a milestone on the way to commercial applications.

“This corresponds to the government funding required to build three pilot plants, which will herald the start of industrial production,” the companies said. Such funds would leverage additional private investment of 20 to 50 percent, they argued, adding that the US and China are already pouring billions into the technology in a bid for global leadership.

“In order to establish a genuine fusion industry, funding instruments must move beyond traditional research funding as quickly as possible,” the companies argued. “The technology has advanced so far that it now urgently needs mechanisms to enable the transition from research to commercial application at the necessary scale and speed.”

“The intermediate step of pilot plants significantly reduces the investment risk for the government, industry and private investors, drives the rapid growth of the fusion ecosystem right from the start and creates spillover effects across the German economy,” the statement said.

The companies also called for a new legal framework to exempt fusion from laws dictating the use of conventional nuclear fission, which Germany ended in 2023, and for EU coordination via the IPCEI (Important Project of Common European Interest) scheme, which requires member state cooperation and facilitates subsidies. “Germany must actively participate in the planning and implementation of a specific fusion IPCEI to ensure European coordination and exploit synergies.”

Germany wants to build “world’s first fusion reactor”

Germany’s government singled out nuclear fusion as one of six key future technologies two months ago, saying it will present a long-term “Fusion Action Plan” this year, which is to be followed by a “Fusion Energy Research and Innovation Roadmap (FIRE)” in 2026.

In their coalition agreement, the parties forming the government - chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU alliance and the Social Democrats (SPD) - agreed more support for nuclear fusion research and the goal of building “the world’s first fusion reactor”. The European Commission is also preparing an EU fusion strategy.

Fusion technology is still in the experimental stage, and even many proponents say that commercial use is at least decades away, meaning that neither Germany nor Europe can count on the technology to become climate neutral by 2045 and 2050 respectively. But researchers and investors have become increasingly confident it one day can provide a safe, climate-friendly, and practically inexhaustible energy source. Dozens of startups backed by private capital joined the field, bringing new momentum through research milestones.

Window of opportunity

The startups argued that Germany is well-placed to turn its leading role in the technology into a long-term advantage, but it must hurry up.

“Germany boasts unique diversity in fusion technology,” their statement said. The companies pointed out successes in both laser and magnetic fusion, two different approaches with the same goal: fusing light atomic nuclei to release huge amounts of energy.

“Germany has a unique historical opportunity to develop its own industry with fusion energy and secure its own economic and technical sovereignty in the long term,” they said. “The launch of the fusion industry and the framework conditions for its success must be decided politically now, in the coming months.”

“The alternative is clear: without decisive action, the United States and China will take the lead, and Germany and Europe will once again miss out on a future technology.”",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-09-25 06:00:09.109928

They encourage this by teaching respectful communication skills through free workshops, one of which was conducted in the morning before the forum. The driving force that fuels their mission is “bringing Americans together to bridge the partisan divide and strengthen our democratic republic.”

Issues raised by nonprofit groups

Representatives from several nonprofit groups in the region gave short presentations about their work and the challenges they face. Each ended with some specific questions for the members of Congress.

They spoke about a wide range of topics that surely would’ve been of interest to our representatives. These included the need for bipartisan solutions to climate change, protecting the budget for scientific agencies, reforming the process for clean energy permitting, supporting funding for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Housing First initiative, the importance of investing in senior citizen services, concerns about cuts to federal funding for education and students with disabilities, the need to reduce the rancor in politics, and more.

Questions from the audience

During the second hour of the forum, audience members spoke to the photos on the dais in lieu of being able to speak to their absent members of congress. They asked tough questions about topics including concerns about the Smithsonian, protecting our First Amendment rights, the negative impact of tariffs on markets for Idaho agricultural products and family farmers, the chaos caused by ICE raids when crops need to be picked, investigation into conditions at immigration detention centers, stopping President Donald Trump from sending troops into American cities, increased housing costs, the conflict in Ukraine, the need for humanitarian aid for Palestinians, and the importance of adequate funding for national parks.

The tone of the questions was as varied as the people who asked them. Many questions were carefully phrased and delivered in even tones. Other questions reflected the individuals’ frustration and even desperation, with several people literally begging the representatives to take action on issues like rent increases.

Others questions were very pointed. One questioner raised issues with multiple Trump administration actions, saying, “You’re turning a blind eye to these actions, normalizing them. What has to happen for you to stand up to this administration and stop these undemocratic actions?” Another asked, “Are you three merely cowardly Republicans afraid of Trump’s retribution, or are you supporting his lunatic and fascist takeover of our country?”

Great turnout — except for the missing three

Despite not having the senators and congressman present, the mood in the room during the event was positive. People were attentive to the presentations and often applauded the questions.

The recording of the event is now being edited and will be sent to Sens. Crapo and Risch and Rep. Fulcher, with requests for their responses. A short video of Q&A highlights is already posted.

After the event, Dawes summed up the experience: “We were all very disappointed that our members of Congress did not attend, and that they did not even provide a statement that we requested to be able to read at the event. To not even acknowledge their constituents’ request for a statement is very difficult for me to understand. If they watch the video we send them, they will see the respectful demeanor of the crowd and the wide variety of sincere questions and comments made that really deserve a thoughtful response.”

Perhaps the only disrespectful aspect of the event was the behavior of our elected representatives.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-82/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/capitolnight-1-1024x7691758708186.jpeg?h=ae4494b8&itok=-m1GeNLo,N,,2025-09-24 22:58:32.621265

Climate jobs should be good jobs — safe, skilled and union-backed.","Despite recent federal setbacks to the climate justice movement, Austin has a pathway to reduce its carbon footprint, create hundreds of jobs and save nearly $3 million per year in energy costs, according to the Texas Climate Jobs Project (TCJP). The coalition launched its new report, “Powering Public Progress: Decarbonizing Austin’s Municipal Buildings for a Resilient Future,” at a press conference last week alongside city leaders. The report outlines pathways to bolster Austin’s sustainability initiatives while creating union-supported work.

About the Texas Climate Jobs Project

Labor unions across the state partnered to create the TCJP in 2021. The coalition explores policies to strengthen climate resilience while addressing income inequality and creating jobs.

“We founded the Texas Climate Jobs Project because working people deserve to be at the center of our state’s clean energy future,” said Jeremy Hendricks, secretary treasurer of the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LiUNA) Local 1095.

“Texas is the energy capital of the country — but it’s also the most dangerous state for workers, with the highest rates of workplace fatalities, injuries, wage theft and misclassification,” he added. “Texas has the potential to lead the nation in climate action and job creation. But that only happens if labor is at the table — not as an afterthought, but as a driving force. That’s why we launched this project: to make sure climate solutions are also economic justice solutions, rooted in the dignity, safety and strength of Texas workers.”

Ryan Pollock, executive director of the Texas State Building and Construction Trades Council and an organizer with the local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), told the Austin Monitor the TCJP was intended to stand in the gap between the labor force and environmentalists.

“Texas being the energy state, we really needed to be on the front line of this,” he noted.

Coordination with existing city projects

The report’s recommendations fall into three categories: installing rooftop solar panels across city-owned buildings, retrofitting city facilities with climate-resilient infrastructure and creating high-quality union jobs to accomplish this work efficiently. These goals align with the city’s recent climate initiatives.

“I think there’s a lot of synergy between what the report asks for and what we’re doing already,” said Council Member Mike Siegel. Earlier this year, Siegel co-sponsored Council Member Ryan Alter’s resolution directing city staff to identify city properties with the greatest potential for solar generation.

“I was really happy to see the Office of Climate Action and Resilience is taking immediate action to implement this policy,” Siegel said. “Their urgency is driven in part by the federal administration basically canceling solar panel tax credits beginning in about a year. And so we are moving … to start the process of building these solar panels on city land so we can take advantage of the federal tax cuts that are still in existence.”

“Staff are now prioritizing the most viable sites and developing a procurement strategy,” Alter said of the initiative. “Once finalized, the city will issue a multi-site Request for Proposals for a portfolio of solar projects.”

Because Austin’s electrical utility is municipally owned, there is more flexibility to implement union-backed labor practices when expanding the city’s solar network.

“At this moment in history when the federal government is cutting their support for Austin, when the state government continues to be hostile to the goals of our community, it’s really important that we have strategies that are sustainable and realizable using our own resources,” Siegel told the Monitor. He emphasized that the TCJP report will further empower the city to make sure workers are taken care of throughout this initiative. “It’s not enough to say ‘We want solar,’” he said. “We want solar built by well-paid workers at safe work sites who have the right to join a union … all of these things go together.”

City leaders also indicated their support for the TCJP’s second recommendation: retrofitting city facilities for climate efficiency.

“Buildings generate nearly half of Austin’s emissions, so improving their efficiency is critical to reaching our 2040 net-zero goal,” Alter said. “While upgrades come with upfront costs, improved efficiency saves money over time — a win for taxpayers, a win for our environment, and a win for our future,” he added.

In fact, Siegel and Alter partnered during the recent budget cycle to create a climate revolving fund that could support this work. Inspired by similar initiatives in San Antonio and Harris County, the fund will support energy-efficiency projects around the city and will re-invest the savings generated by increased efficiency into additional improvements.

The report also bolsters an existing city priority of establishing local pipelines for green careers. The Austin Infrastructure Academy, a joint effort between the city and several workforce development partners, launched earlier this year. It trains Austinites for success in union and trade careers. Hendricks also pointed to the Austin Civilian Conservation Corps (ACCC), a green jobs program created by former Council Member Alison Alter during the pandemic.

“Austin has room — and real need — for all workforce programs that lift up trainees and workers,” Hendricks said. “There’s definitely potential for overlap and collaboration—especially when it comes to connecting ACCC participants to longer-term union careers in infrastructure, electrification or building retrofits.”

What’s next?

Looking ahead, Siegel told the Monitor he is interested in the potential to bring solar panel manufacturing to Austin, and to create more pathways for high schoolers to pursue union apprenticeships to help install them.

“By creating a goal of adding these additional hundreds of megawatts of solar panels, our electric utility has essentially created a new market of work,” he said. “We want to make sure we’re thinking about the supply chain aspect of this: Can we attract manufacturing to build the renewable energy infrastructure we need? And then also there’s a workforce part of this where we want to make sure we’re training up young Austin workers so that they can get the skills and experience to take advantage of these high-income job opportunities.”

City and union leaders agree that including workers in the transition away from fossil fuels is the only way to ensure an equitable climate future — especially in the face of ongoing pushback from the federal administration.

“Having a strong environmental message … is not enough. We need to build real power to demand and enforce that message, and that’s where the labor movement comes in,” Siegel noted.

“If we’re serious about building a clean energy future in Texas, then unions have to be at the center of it. Climate jobs should be good jobs — safe, skilled and union-backed. We need family-supporting careers with real benefits, so workers can afford to live in Austin and build a life here,” Hendricks said. “That’s how we ensure working people, especially those from communities historically left behind, aren’t just surviving the transition — they’re leading it.”",https://i0.wp.com/austinmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/solar_installation.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-24 20:01:39.560164

As extreme heat becomes one of the world’s most pressing public health challenges, tools like Shaded Route Planning and DeepShade are more than technical experiments.","At the 2024 Paris Olympics, marathoners pushed through miles of scorching pavement while fans crammed into sun-soaked plazas and stadiums. More than a year later, fans remember games that were both fun and fashionable. But for event planners, the sobering challenge of planning for extreme heat remains.

Shade, it turns out, can be vital when the mercury rises. A shadow from a building can lower surface temperatures by 20 degrees Fahrenheit or more, offering life-saving relief. But knowing where shade will be and how to get there isn’t always easy. That’s where Hua Wei and his team at Arizona State University believe artificial intelligence, or AI, can help.

Wei, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, part of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at ASU, has launched two complementary projects that use AI to make shade information practical, accessible and actionable.

One helps people choose cooler walking or biking routes in real time. The other uses generative AI to simulate how shade shifts through the day, providing data for city planners and designers. Together, the projects are part of Wei’s broader mission: harnessing AI to support human-centered, smarter cities.

Staying cool on the move

The first project, called Shaded Route Planning, was designed with people in mind, especially pedestrians and cyclists who face hours of sun exposure during heatwaves. Traditional mapping apps prioritize speed or distance. Wei’s tool adds a third factor: shade.

The system starts by scanning satellite images to spot where shade falls from trees, buildings or other structures. It then lines that information up with maps of sidewalks and streets to figure out how much of each path is covered. From there, the tool gives users several options. They can take the fastest route, the shadiest route or strike a balance between the two.

The prototype has already been successfully tested at the Paris Olympics to help visitors choose cooler paths between venues. In a demo, the shortest route glowed orange across the map, cutting straight down sun-drenched boulevards. A slightly longer path appeared in green, winding through shaded alleys and tree-lined streets.

“Even a small change in the route can make a big difference,” Wei says. “It could mean fewer cases of heat exhaustion and a much more pleasant experience for thousands of travelers.”

Seeing tomorrow’s shadows today

While Shaded Route Planning helps people on the move, Wei’s second project looks at the bigger picture. DeepShade is a generative AI system that predicts how shade appears and shifts in urban areas over time.

The problem is that regular satellite photos don’t show shade very clearly. They may be out of date, grainy or taken inconsistently when shadows might look completely different. DeepShade fixes this by creating realistic “what-if” pictures of shadows throughout the day and across the seasons. It uses information about buildings and the sun’s position to simulate how shade should fall. Those examples then teach an AI system how to generate detailed shade maps on demand. A user could ask the system to show, for example, what an area looks like at 6 p.m. in July, and it will draw the shadows exactly where they’d be.

To refine accuracy, the model uses edge detection to capture crisp building outlines and contrastive learning to ensure shadows evolve realistically over time. In experiments across 12 cities, from Beijing to Tempe, Arizona, DeepShade consistently outperformed other AI methods in generating accurate shade predictions.

In practice, this means city planners could use DeepShade to test how adding a row of trees, adjusting building height or placing a new bus stop might change shade availability for pedestrians. It provides a data-driven way to design “cool corridors” and public spaces that protect vulnerable populations during extreme heat.

A researcher on the rise

For Wei, these projects are part of a growing portfolio of work that blends technical AI expertise with real-world impact. His research on decision-making systems has already earned him a prestigious 2025 National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Award, support from Amazon and collaborations with city governments.

He is particularly focused on what AI researchers call the “simulation-to-reality gap,” or the problem that algorithms often perform well in clean, simulated environments but stumble in messy, unpredictable real-world conditions. Shade, with its dependence on weather, season and urban form, is a perfect example of such complexity.

To tackle these challenges, Wei works closely with other leading researchers, including Yezhou “YZ” Yang, a Fulton Schools associate professor of computer science and engineering. Yang is a thought leader in computer vision, making him an ideal collaborator for projects like DeepShade.

“For me, the promise of AI has always been about more than algorithms. It’s about creating tools that touch people’s lives in meaningful ways,” Yang says. “I’ve long believed that AI for social good means designing systems that don’t just push technology forward, but bring comfort, dignity and well-being to the communities we serve.”

Designing for people, not just systems

At its heart, Wei’s work is about empowering people. As extreme heat becomes one of the world’s most pressing public health challenges, tools like Shaded Route Planning and DeepShade are more than technical experiments. They’re glimpses of how cities might adapt — not in abstract ways, but in the lived experience of a cyclist finding relief under tree cover, a tourist enjoying a cooler walk to an Olympic venue or a community planner deciding where to add the next stretch of greenery.

“We want AI to support decisions that people can feel in their daily lives,” Wei says. “When the sun is beating down, finding shade isn’t just about comfort. It’s about health and resilience.”",http://fullcircle.asu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SCAI-Hua-Wei-2025-EG-6929-w-EDIT.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 20:01:44.558808

Revisions to Final Risk Evaluations The 2024 rule restricted EPA from revising final risk evaluations unless it restarted the prioritization process, except to protect health or the environment.
Manufacturer Requests for Risk Evaluations EPA proposes to scale back the broad information requirements placed on manufacturers by the 2024 rule.
These issues will shape how EPA conducts and documents risk evaluations going forward.","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a potential reset of the risk evaluation process under the Toxic Substances Control Act. If adopted, the proposal would roll back certain procedural requirements of the Biden administration’s 2024 risk evaluation rule (or the Framework Rule), restore elements of the 2017 framework, and create new clarity on when and how EPA can revise evaluations. Manufacturers (including importers) and processors should review the proposal closely and consider submitting comments, as the rule could directly shape the speed, scope, and transparency of chemical risk evaluations going forward.

For the regulated community, this proposal carries several important implications. Because EPA’s determinations of “unreasonable risk” under Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) section 6(b) form the legal foundation for future restrictions, bans, and workplace requirements, any changes to the evaluation process directly affect regulatory outcomes. The proposal would also scale back manufacturer obligations, limiting information requests to what is “known to or reasonably ascertainable” and reducing data requirements that had been expanded under the 2024 rule (for a deeper dive into the 2024 Framework Rule, see our prior analysis).

At the same time, EPA seeks to preserve momentum in the risk evaluation pipeline by allowing revisions to final risk evaluations without restarting the prioritization process—ensuring errors can be corrected and new information addressed without derailing progress on other chemicals.

KEY PROPOSED CHANGES

1. Scoping and Fit-for-Purpose Provisions

EPA proposes to delete the rule language that prohibited the agency from excluding conditions of use from a risk evaluation. Instead, EPA would revise and merge the “fit-for-purpose” provisions to make clear that the scope and level of analysis will be tailored to what EPA needs to decide for a given chemical. In practice, this means EPA may conduct more detailed analysis where risks are more likely and rely on screening-level data where risks appear minimal. For example, EPA might require detailed workplace exposure data for a solvent widely used in industrial degreasing but apply a simpler analysis for a niche use of the same solvent with very low potential for exposure.

Why it matters: This restores EPA’s discretion to focus on uses most likely to drive risk, helping to speed up evaluations and reduce the time spent on low-risk or peripheral uses, while giving industry greater clarity about what will be in scope.

2. Risk Determinations by Condition of Use

EPA seeks to return to making separate risk determinations for each use of a chemical (e.g., workplace use, consumer product use, or environmental release). This was the 2017 approach, whereas the 2024 rule allowed one broad “chemical-wide” decision. EPA also proposes to codify factors it must weigh—such as hazard severity, exposure levels, affected populations, and data quality—while retaining the ability to find unreasonable risk when multiple uses are considered together.

Why it matters: By requiring separate determinations for each condition of use, the proposal makes it more difficult for EPA to regulate uses that are not actually driving risk. Under the current single-determination approach, once EPA finds unreasonable risk overall, it can justify broad restrictions that sweep in lower-risk or non-risk-driving uses of a chemical. A use-by-use approach narrows the scope of regulation to the conditions of use EPA has specifically determined present unreasonable risk, giving industry more certainty and limiting overbroad compliance obligations.

3. Definition of Potentially Exposed or Susceptible Subpopulations

EPA proposes to remove the phrase “overburdened communities” from the regulatory definition of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations” (PESS). The 2024 rule added this term to the statutory examples (children, workers, elderly), but commenters argued it was too vague and could expand risk evaluations beyond exposures tied to the chemical itself. EPA proposes to return to the statutory framework while noting it can still consider other vulnerable groups when supported by science.

Why it matters: The definition of PESS sets the boundaries for who is considered at risk. For example, evaluation of a chemical used in consumer cleaning products might reasonably focus on risks to children and household users. Narrowing the definition makes the scope more predictable and helps manufacturers avoid being pulled into risk evaluations that cover groups unrelated to their chemical or use.

4. Definition of ‘Weight of Scientific Evidence’

EPA proposes to add a definition of “weight of scientific evidence,” describing how it integrates multiple studies and data sources when making risk determinations.

Why it matters: A formal definition increases predictability. For example, if EPA considers both animal studies and human exposure data, companies will know how EPA balances these sources and can tailor submissions accordingly. It also strengthens the consistency and defensibility of risk evaluations, reducing uncertainty for industry.

5. Aggregate Exposure Assessments

EPA proposes to drop the 2024 rule’s requirement that it provide an explanation each time it does not perform an aggregate exposure assessment (which looks at combined exposures from multiple sources). EPA will still conduct these assessments when supported by science but will not be required to justify their absence.

Why it matters: This change will reduce paperwork and keep evaluations moving. For example, if exposures from a chemical’s industrial use and consumer use are both low, EPA doesn’t need to spend time writing a justification for not combining them. That helps avoid delays while preserving EPA’s authority to perform aggregate assessments when needed.

6. Revisions to Final Risk Evaluations

The 2024 rule restricted EPA from revising final risk evaluations unless it restarted the prioritization process, except to protect health or the environment. EPA now proposes to remove that restriction. Instead, EPA could revise or supplement a final evaluation if needed while still ensuring transparency through draft and final documents, public comment, and peer review.

Why it matters: This allows EPA to correct errors or add new information without derailing work on other chemicals. For example, if new data show that a workplace exposure model overestimated risk, EPA could fix the evaluation directly rather than reopening the entire prioritization process. That balance helps protect companies from faulty conclusions while keeping the evaluation pipeline on track.

7. Manufacturer Requests for Risk Evaluations

EPA proposes to scale back the broad information requirements placed on manufacturers by the 2024 rule. Manufacturers would only need to provide information “known to or reasonably ascertainable” for the specific conditions of use they identify. EPA would rely on its other TSCA authorities to gather information on other uses—such as Section 4(a)(2), which allows EPA to require new data from any manufacturer or processor—to gather information on uses not identified by the requester.

If EPA determines that additional information is needed for a comprehensive evaluation, it may develop a strategy to obtain that information using these authorities and, if necessary, delay initiation of the evaluation for up to one year. EPA also clarifies that withdrawn requests do not incur fees.

Why it matters: This reduces burdens on companies by limiting requirements to information they reasonably control. For example, if a company requests evaluation of a chemical it produces for coatings, it must submit data about that use but not about unrelated uses like plastics production. EPA can then turn to other manufacturers or processors for additional data.

TOP 5 OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDUSTRY COMMENT

EPA is seeking public comment on 13 separate subjects in the proposed rule, but the following five may be of particular interest to manufacturers (including importers) and processors because they directly affect compliance obligations, regulatory certainty, and the standards EPA will apply in future risk evaluations.

Scope and Conditions of Use: EPA is asking whether its proposed revisions to the “fit-for-purpose” scoping provisions are clear and appropriate and how to handle conditions of use identified after an evaluation is complete. This will shape how narrowly or broadly future evaluations are framed.

Risk Determinations and Occupational Exposure: EPA invites comment on changes to how it makes and documents risk determinations, including assumptions about workplace exposures. These decisions are central because they drive regulatory outcomes under TSCA.

Definitions of Scientific Standards: EPA is seeking comment on the proposed definition of “weight of scientific evidence,” whether to restore the 2017 definition of “best available science,” and whether to define “systematic review.” These definitions will guide how EPA evaluates data and how companies should generate or present information.

Revisions to Final Risk Evaluations: EPA requests input on when and how final evaluations may be reopened—such as to correct errors or account for new information—and what circumstances should not warrant reopening. This directly impacts regulatory certainty and reliance interests.

Manufacturer-Requested Risk Evaluations: EPA seeks comment on whether to scale back the broad information obligations imposed in 2024, limiting requests to information “known to or reasonably ascertainable by” the manufacturer. This directly affects the scope and cost of the industry’s compliance burden.

Comments must be received on or before November 7, 2025.

These issues will shape how EPA conducts and documents risk evaluations going forward. Stakeholders should carefully review the proposed rule (published in the Federal Register on September 23, 2025) and consider submitting comments to ensure that industry perspectives on burden, scope, and scientific standards are reflected in the final rule.

Her work, which was mostly overlooked at the time, has been validated by decades of research that has built a remarkably clear picture. Average global temperatures have risen since the Industrial Revolution, fossil fuels release CO2 that push up greenhouse-gas levels and human activity is the main cause of global warming.

‘Researching climate change feels like standing in the path of an approaching train’

Yet, as climate scientist Kate Marvel observes in Human Nature, policymakers have taken surprisingly little action in response to the mounting evidence. Efforts have been hindered by decades of lobbying by powerful organizations such as oil companies. In this persuasive book, Marvel argues that people need to embrace an emotional response, not just a data-driven one, to prompt widespread action. Climate scientists and activists would be familiar with some of the emotions that double as chapter titles — anger, fear and grief. But Marvel insists on the need for wonder, love and hope, too.

By weaving in personal anecdotes, she makes the science behind climate change accessible: how Earth’s system functions, how greenhouse gases disrupt it, the effects of global warming and the complexity and uncertainties of models. For instance, Marvel poignantly recounts her fearful experience of living through Hurricane Ida in 2021, which caused disastrous floods that killed at least 13 people in New York City. She then explains that air can hold about 7% more water vapour for every degree Celsius it warms. When that vapour condenses, it drives short, intense bursts of rain. The chapter is especially helpful because it shows not only how storms form but also why warming leads to heavier downpours.

An unsettling truth

I can’t help but share Marvel’s anger and frustration. Climate science has advanced to the point where denying human-driven climate change feels obtuse. Her models, and thousands developed by other scientists, might differ in spatial and temporal resolution, but they all lead to the same unambiguous conclusion: Earth is warming and will keep doing so unless greenhouse-gas emissions drop to zero.

Just how bad will climate change get? The only way to know is to fund basic research

Scientists have watched their models of a warming world come true during their own lifetimes — faster than many expected. It is exciting to see one’s predictions get confirmed, to have been able to forecast the future with remarkable accuracy. Yet, witnessing climate change unfold in real time, with the consequences already visible when they could have been avoided or mitigated, is profoundly unsettling.

The book highlights the devastating consequences of extreme weather by weaving together historical and contemporary examples: a huge volcanic eruption in 43 bc that caused political turmoil in the Roman Empire and famines in ancient Egypt; the devastating droughts of the 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States; and the catastrophic floods in Texas triggered by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. References to Greek mythology and historical events, such as the fall of ancient Egypt because of crop failures triggered by disrupted rainfall patterns after the volcanic eruption, make the narrative engaging and entertaining.

However, Marvel could have discussed social-science studies that demonstrate how climate shocks affect livelihoods and human well-being2–4. These impacts are rarely direct or isolated; they ripple through economic, political and environmental systems.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03032-5/d41586-025-03032-5_51450668.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 22:01:51.512023

The company has also opened a Houston office to support its growth.

House will focus on strategic initiatives and opportunities to ensure the company remains competitive while adapting to the evolving energy landscape, USEDC said. He will also coordinate activities associated with opening and managing the new Houston office.

“Howard brings exceptional depth of experience and strategic insight to U.S. Energy,” Jordan Jayson, CEO and chairman of USEDC, said in a statement. “As we anticipate deploying $1 billion in capital over the next 12-18 months, M&A will be a central driver of our growth strategy. Howard’s track record in mergers and acquisitions is second to none—he understands Houston, he understands Texas, and he possesses extensive knowledge of the industry. Just as important, he’s built trusted, long-standing relationships across the energy community. That rare combination of deal-making expertise and industry credibility is exactly what we need as we strengthen our footprint in Houston.”

House also will join USEDC’s investment committee.

USEDC said that with more than 35 years as an energy investment banker, House brings over $125 billion in transactional experience in the energy space to his new role, including roughly $60 billion of completed strategic advisory mandates, including mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, takeover defense, and restructurings.

House has also raised more than $65 billion in public and private capital markets transactions, the company said.

Targeting growth

USEDC said that House’s industry reputation and extensive oil and gas network will be key to facilitating the firm’s growth and said that House will focus on strengthening industry relationships across the energy value chain as well as sourcing and evaluating strategic opportunities.

“I’m very excited to join U.S. Energy as we establish our presence in Houston,” House said in a statement. “I have watched USEDC grow from an Appalachian-focused enterprise into an active driller and acquirer of both operated and non-op interests across numerous basins. I look forward to playing a role in its future growth.”

House’s experience includes senior roles at Greenhill & Co., Raymond James & Associates, and Lehman Brothers. He began his career in the energy industry as a petroleum engineer at Exxon Co. USA.

USEDC said the opening of the Houston office reflects its commitment to continued growth in Texas and beyond. It said that with Houston being a global hub of the energy industry, establishing an office here will allow USEDC to leverage existing and new relationships in order to enhance deal flow.

Founded in 1980, USEDC is a privately held exploration and production firm that manages assets for itself and its partners. It has invested in, operated, and/or drilled roughly 4,000 wells in 13 states and Canada and has deployed more than $3 billion on behalf of itself and its partners.

The Voltpost Air uses that elevated design with a retractable cable system to protect against weather damage and vandalism, setting it apart from Voltpost’s original curbside charger. It’s also built for faster installation, broader pole compatibility, and better reliability.

It can be installed on both wooden and metal lampposts and utility poles, curbside or in parking lots. Site hosts can deploy one or two chargers per pole, making it a flexible option for cities and property owners. Drivers can pay with the app or by tapping with a credit card. Voltpost Air supports Level 2 charging, up to 9.6 kW per charging port.

Luke Mairo, COO and cofounder of Voltpost, said that “the modular design and quick installation reduce costs and complexity, making it easier than ever to expand charging infrastructure.” Voltpost is already operating chargers in Oak Park, Illinois, and at the American Center for Mobility near Detroit. The company has projects underway in New York, California, Michigan, Illinois, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.

Former US Joint Office of Energy and Transportation executive director Gabe Klein, now a Voltpost board advisor, said, “The transition to renewable transportation requires bold, scalable solutions that can integrate seamlessly into existing urban infrastructure. Technologies like Voltpost’s lamppost chargers are vital because they unlock new opportunities to deploy EV charging.”

The Brooklyn installation is part of New York City Economic Development Corporation’s (NYCEDC) Pilots at Brooklyn Army Terminal (BAT) program, which supports climate-tech companies in scaling new solutions. It’s expected to be available to the public by the end of the year. New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) president and CEO Doreen M. Harris called the model “highly replicable” and said it could be adopted across New York State.

EPA Publishes Proposed Rule for Further Reconsideration of TSCA Risk Evaluation Procedures

On September 23, 2025, EPA released its much-anticipated proposed rule to revise its chemical risk evaluation process under section 6 of TSCA, updating key provisions of the 2024 regulation issued during the Biden administration. The proposed rule, titled “Procedures for Chemical Risk Evaluation Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA),” reflects the new administration’s regulatory priorities and responds to concerns raised by regulated entities about the scope and methodology of prior chemical risk evaluations.

Among the proposed changes, EPA would be required to assess unreasonable risk for each individual condition of use identified within the scope of the evaluation undertaken, rather than issuing a single, overall determination for the “whole chemical” substance. The proposed amendments also would clarify how occupational exposure controls — such as the use of personal protective equipment and industrial safeguards — will be considered in such evaluations, and outline EPA’s discretionary authority in selecting relevant conditions of use, exposure routes, and exposure pathways. Additional revisions include proposed updates to regulatory definitions said to align with Executive Order 14303, “Restoring Gold Standard Science,” and amendments to the procedures for revising or supplementing risk evaluation documents to help EPA meet statutory deadlines. The proposed rule also amends the process and data requirements for manufacturers and importers requesting agency-led evaluations, described as enhancing transparency and regulatory certainty.

Litigation over the 2024 procedural rule has been paused while EPA pursues this rulemaking process.

Public comments will be accepted until November 7, 2025, and can be submitted electronically to the e-docket for EPA-HQ-OPPT-2025-0260.

EPA Announces It Will Prioritize New Chemical Review for “Data Center” Chemicals

EPA announced that it will prioritize review of new chemicals intended for use in data centers or manufacturing covered components, beginning with submissions received commencing September 29, 2025, pursuant to the Executive Order “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure.”

The announcement explains that the July order calls for speeding up permitting “under laws including TSCA that impact the development of qualifying projects such as AI data centers and the infrastructure that powers them,” such as high-voltage transmission lines and other equipment. Therefore, the Agency plans to “prioritize review of certain new chemicals to reduce the regulatory burden to companies looking to invest in them.”

Submitters seeking priority designation must identify their submission as a chemical warranting expedited assessment by attaching a cover letter via EPA’s Central Data Exchange, specifying the application and providing details concerning the data center where the new chemical or covered component will be used.

International PFAS Developments

The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) announced that the draft opinion of its Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis (SEAC) on the proposed EU-wide restriction of PFAS will be finalized at SEAC’s meeting in March 2026. The SEAC draft opinion will cover the evaluation of the socio-economic aspects of the 2022 proposed REACH restrictions on PFAS, including the availability of alternative substances and technologies. Following that meeting, ECHA plans to hold a consultation that will remain open for 60 days, during which stakeholders can provide feedback.

The consultation will use a structured survey format, inviting participants to respond to questions on the potential impacts of restricting the use of PFAS across various sectors. Participants will also be asked to provide specific information about the availability and feasibility of alternatives to these widely used chemicals. All feedback will be entered directly into the question fields for each survey topic.

In preparation for the consultation, ECHA will hold an online information session on October 30, 2025. After reviewing the consultation feedback, SEAC is expected to adopt its final opinion by the end of 2026.

This announcement follows ECHA’s publication of an updated proposal to restrict PFAS. The update was prepared by the authorities from Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, the countries that submitted the initial proposal in January 2023. The update was issued in response to and after completion of a review of more than 5,600 scientific and technical comments received from third parties during the 2023 consultation.

The update contains assessments for eight sectors that were not specifically named in the initial proposal and an assessment of alternative restriction options, beyond a full ban or a ban with time-limited derogations.

However, in response to the updated PFAS restriction proposal, ECHA stated that its Risk Assessment and SEAC Committees would not carry out a sector-specific evaluation of the eight sectors added in the updated proposal. ECHA explained that the European Commission has already stated that the scientific assessment of the restriction by the ECHA committees is scheduled to conclude in 2026. Including a further eight sectors into the committees’ evaluations would require significant time beyond 2026. Therefore, the committees will not evaluate the eight newly identified sectors.

State PFAS Products Prohibitions

There continues to be a growing number of states enacting laws that prohibit PFAS when it appears in consumer (and commercial use) products, with implementation timelines for certain prohibitions that have commenced already or are to come into effect during upcoming years between now and 2032. These bans target a wide array of product categories, including textiles, food packaging, cosmetics, cookware, cleaning products, and juvenile items. The following are recent notable examples.

In April, the PFAS Protection Act, HB 212, was enacted in New Mexico and is one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation targeting PFAS in consumer products. The bill phases out PFAS over multiple years with an effective ban date in 2027 for cookware, food packaging, dental floss, juvenile products, and firefighting foam, and expands to include carpets, cleaning products, cosmetics, fabric treatments, feminine hygiene products, textiles, ski wax, and upholstered furniture by 2028. Starting in 2032, there will be a complete ban on PFAS in all products unless deemed “currently unavoidable” by the state. In addition, the act states that the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board may adopt rules to require the labeling of products in English and Spanish.

In furtherance of the rule development process for labelling, the New Mexico Environmental Department will be holding an informational webinar on product labelling requirements on September 25, 2025 at 1 p.m. MT. To register, email NMED-PFAS@env.nm.gov.on.

This summer, Illinois enacted HB 2516, which amended the state’s PFAS Reduction Act such that beginning January 1, 2026, an individual may not sell, offer for sale, or distribute for sale any products containing intentionally added PFAS in cookware, cosmetics, dental floss, juvenile products, menstrual products, intimate apparel, and food packaging.

California has several pieces of legislation, as well as statutes on the books, targeting PFAS in consumer products. In 2022, AB 1817 was enacted, specifically targeting PFAS in textiles, including apparel, bedding, draperies, and backpacks. By January 1, 2025, manufacturers were required to certify compliance and use safer alternatives. Much more recently, SB-682 was passed by the legislature after some last-minute revisions and now awaits the governor’s signature. This bill would ban PFAS in food packaging, juvenile products, dental floss, some cleaning products, and ski wax by 2028 and phase in certain prohibitions affecting other cleaning product components by 2030, and cookware by 2031.

A Minnesota state administrative law judge has recently disapproved the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s (MPCA) proposed PFAS reporting and fees rule, saying that MPCA did not include a cumulative effect assessment of the regulation required under state law. Additionally, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that a number of the provisions were not rationally related to the MPCA’s objectives for the rules. Other provisions exceeded, conflicted with, or did not comply with the enabling statute. Consequently, the ALJ found those provisions did not constitute enforceable law. MPCA has stated that it will resubmit proposed rules to correct several smaller parts and better document the cumulative effects of the rule.

The synopsis of recent state actions above reflects a contrast, and perhaps growing frustration, with PFAS-related efforts by the federal government. State legislatures remain committed to restricting the use of PFAS — particularly in consumer products. The resulting patchwork of state requirements will serve to heighten compliance complexity for product manufacturers and distributors operating across jurisdictions.

Litigation

Several legal challenges have been filed challenging Agency actions completed during the Biden administration for certain TSCA risk evaluations and other EPA rules, though most have been stayed as the Agency continues its reconsideration efforts:

5th Circuit Extends Stay in PCE Rule Litigation. On September 12, 2025, the Fifth Circuit granted EPA’s request to extend the stay in litigation over its TSCA rule phasing out many uses of perchloroethylene (PCE) for an additional 90 days. Despite opposition from environmental groups, the court will allow EPA more time to reconsider the rule. EPA must report by November 19, 2025 on any plans to revise the regulation and how changes may affect the case.

EPA Seeks Abeyance in Carbon Tetrachloride Rule Litigation in the 8th Circuit. On September 12, 2025, EPA asked the Eighth Circuit to place litigation over its TSCA rule phasing out uses of solvent carbon tetrachloride (CTC) back in abeyance. This request follows a September 4, 2025 clerk’s order lifting the abeyance and directing the parties to submit an amended joint proposed briefing schedule. The Agency is developing a revised rule that will consider updated workplace exposure limits and aims to preserve judicial resources while the rule is reconsidered. No parties to the case have objected to the request.

EPA Extends Compliance Deadlines for TCE Rule Amid Ongoing 3rd Circuit Litigation. On August 18, 2025, EPA announced a 90-day extension of compliance deadlines for certain exemptions under its 2024 TSCA risk management rule for trichloroethylene (TCE), pushing the effective date to November 17, 2025. This follows a May 27, 2025 motion from EPA with the Third Circuit requesting an indefinite abeyance of consolidated litigation challenging its TSCA rule restricting TCE uses, stating that it intends to undertake a rulemaking process to reassess the regulation. The Agency has stated that the delay is necessary to maintain the status quo while litigation over the rule continues, and to allow time for the court to address competing procedural requests.

EPA Seeks Continued Pause in 9th Circuit 1,4-Dioxane Litigation. On July 28, 2025, EPA asked the Ninth Circuit to continue an extended abeyance in a 2021 lawsuit brought by environmental groups and states, challenging the Trump administration’s TSCA risk evaluation of 1,4-dioxane, which concluded certain uses posed no unreasonable risk. The Agency argues that pausing the case is appropriate while related litigation in Union Carbide Corp. v. EPA — which challenges the Biden administration’s reversal of that finding — proceeds in the Fifth Circuit.

5th Circuit Grants EPA Limited Extension in 1,4-Dioxane Litigation. On July 1, 2025, the Fifth Circuit extended its stay in Union Carbide Corp. v. EPA by 90 days, allowing EPA more time to reconsider its revised TSCA risk evaluation of 1,4-dioxane, though the court again declined the Agency’s request for a longer pause. EPA had sought a 180-day extension to continue its review of the Biden-era supplement to the original Trump-era evaluation, which had found no unreasonable risk for certain uses of the solvent. While the chemical company did not oppose the request, the court limited the extension to September 30, 2025, consistent with its earlier decisions to grant only partial stays. EPA now estimates it could complete its revised cancer risk analysis within six to 12 months, depending on the need for public comment or peer review. The Agency’s updated evaluation, released in late 2024, reversed earlier findings and concluded that 1,4-dioxane poses an unreasonable risk, prompting this novel industry challenge.

EPA Highlights 200 Environmental Actions During Trump’s Current Presidency

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced 100 additional environmental actions taken over the past 100 days, bringing the total to 200 since President Trump took office. Key initiatives highlighted in EPA’s August 7, 2025 press release include funding to address lead in school drinking water, steps toward resolving the Tijuana sewage issue, PFAS reduction efforts, and progress on State Implementation Plans.

Industry Veteran Nominated To Lead EPA Chemicals Office

In late July, President Trump nominated Doug Troutman — who served as the interim co-CEO, longtime general counsel, and government affairs lead at the American Cleaning Institute — to serve as Assistant Administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, which oversees toxics and pesticide programs. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will soon hold a hearing on his nomination and, later, the chamber will vote on his confirmation.

Other TSCA Actions

EPA Issues Interim TCE Rule. EPA published an interim final rule in the September 17, 2025 Federal Register extending some compliance dates for the 2024 trichloroethylene TSCA risk management rule. Public comments are due October 17, 2025.

EPA Issues Draft D4 Risk Evaluation. EPA issued its draft TSCA risk evaluation for octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, or D4, preliminarily determining that it “presents unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment under certain conditions of use.” The EPA granted a manufacturer request for the evaluation in 2020. Comments on all aspects of the draft, including the conditions of use without a preliminary determination, are due November 17, 2025.

EPA Confirms Reconsideration of CTC Rule. EPA announced its decision to reconsider the carbon tetrachloride, or CTC, TSCA risk management rule via notice-and-comment rulemaking. EPA asked the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to hold litigation over the 2024 TSCA section 6(a) regulation in abeyance in the meantime. A public comment period will be announced in the coming weeks.

The EPA’s proposal, issued August 1, 2025, seeks input on whether to revise or rescind existing motor vehicle GHG emission standards. The industry group argues that current standards for model years 2027–2032 are no longer feasible, citing changing market conditions, flattened consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs), infrastructure constraints, and the repeal of federal EV incentives.

According to the group’s letter, the GHG standards finalized in 2024 under the EPA’s “Multi-Pollutant Rule” assumed rapid EV adoption supported by federal subsidies and infrastructure investments. However, EV market share has plateaued at under 10% of new vehicle sales through the first half of 2025, far below EPA’s projected path toward 50% market share by 2030.

The letter highlights the July 2025 passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated key incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, including EV purchase tax credits and battery production subsidies. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation contends this change significantly undermines the assumptions behind the current standards.

The organization also points to slower-than-expected charging infrastructure growth and supply chain challenges as barriers to compliance. It warned that without adjustments, automakers face “imminent compliance challenges and infeasible standards” that could disrupt the automotive market.

The letter urges EPA to:

Document why current standards are no longer appropriate.

Issue revised, achievable GHG standards as a “backstop” if the 2009 Endangerment Finding is rescinded.

Consider interim rules based on recent model years to provide regulatory stability.

Maintain programs that offer compliance flexibility, such as credit trading and off-cycle credits.

The group emphasized the need for a legally durable, stable regulatory environment that balances emissions reduction goals with consumer affordability, infrastructure readiness, and long-term competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry.",https://www.act-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vans-charging.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 18:03:01.121941

Ampeco and Autel Europe have passed Open Charge Point Protocol 2.0.1 testing with the MaxiCharger DH480. OCPP is a way for charging stations to securely communicate to the companies managing them.

This way, if there's something wrong with a charging point, staff can be deployed quickly to take care of the issue. The standard also includes security protocols to ensure bad actors can't tap into those communications.

OCPP is a widely popular standard used by ChargePoint and plenty of other charging networks, though Tesla has its own proprietary protocol. The latest version of OCPP, 2.1, has features that enable vehicle-to-grid transfers. An open-source version of OCPP is also available for companies that want to make specific customizations.

Autel's MaxiCharger DH480 is a high-speed 480-kilowatt EV charger. Autel claims it can charge up to 0.6 miles every second. Meanwhile, Ampeco makes the management software for these chargers.

Electric vehicles are a clear upgrade from gas cars, especially since they're much cheaper to fuel than traditional cars.

If you want to save even more on charging costs, home solar is a great option. EnergySage can connect homeowners to local vetted installers who can design a solar panel system perfect for EV charging. It can even save owners up to $10,000 on installation costs through rebates and credits.

With modern communications protocols in place, Autel is confident that its latest chargers will help provide reliable charging across Europe.

In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally concluded that the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere endangers public health and welfare. Based on scientific evidence and research, the agency identified six greenhouse gases as the main culprits and established the legal basis to regulate them under the Clean Air Act.

President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed rescinding this determination, commonly known as the Endangerment Finding, which would upend the government’s ability to regulate emissions of those greenhouse gases from cars, trucks, power plants, and industrial facilities. The EPA, led by Administrator Lee Zeldin, claims that the endangerment finding has justified regulations costing more than $1 trillion, negatively affecting the U.S. economy and auto manufacturing. Critics argue that the Trump administration is ignoring peer-reviewed science and regulatory history to pursue this proposal; they have said it will not only diminish U.S. efforts to address climate change but also put people’s lives and livelihoods at risk.

More From Our Experts

In one bold move, the agency tasked with protecting the American people from environmental harm has sought to smother the regulation of heat-trapping pollutants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin correctly predicts that, if successful, elimination of the Endangerment Finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America” He believes that it would drive “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

With the Endangerment Finding knocked aside, the EPA would have no obligation to regulate greenhouse gases, and the Trump administration could speed up its unraveling of existing climate regulations.

Do you two see a way forward for the Endangerment Finding? Or will future administrations need to find alternative ways to re-establish climate protections?

DAVID M. HART: You’re the lawyer, Alice, so I will defer to you on the detailed legal questions involved here. The Supreme Court’s 2007 decision inMassachusetts v. EPA was 5–4, so my presumption is that there are credible legal arguments on both sides of the matter.

As a matter of policy, I would like the federal government to have the authority to control greenhouse gas emissions. They pose a threat to Americans. They also pose a threat to societies and ecosystems worldwide. As theworld’s largest historical source of emissions, the United States has an obligation to try to address that threat. Regulation could be an important tool to this end.

Unfortunately, this tool has not been used to great effect in the past. The Clean Power Plan, which the Barack Obama administration sought to use to reduce emissions from electricity generation, never went into effect and yet, emissions from that sectorstill declined.

The story is somewhat different for automobiles. Controls on tailpipe emissions have made cars sold in the United Statesmore efficient and encouraged manufacturers to offer electric vehicles, thereby reducing emissions compared to a business-as-usual forecast.

But there are large caveats here. Federal agencies can use authorities thatpredate the Endangerment Finding to regulate fuel economy, and many states—led by California—have been able to impose stronger controls than the federal government, all of which calls into question the particular impact of the Endangerment Finding. And, these regulations have had someperverse effects, notably encouraging sales of SUVs and pickup trucks.

VARUN SIVARAM: David, those are really compelling lenses to evaluate this policy shift, and thanks Alice for kicking us off.

To me, one of the goals of the Climate Realism Initiative is to speak plainly and truthfully about what the United States should do about climate change. I believe the public deserves such transparency, and that policies passed with clear and sensible justifications will have more durability. The EPA’s Endangerment Finding fails this test, so I’m happy to bid it good riddance.

To be clear, I completely agree with the Endangerment Finding’s factual assertion that “six greenhouse gases taken in combination endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.” This is true on a global scale: The world’s emissions of greenhouse gases cause climate change and risk catastrophic impacts on human wellbeing around the world.

But it is equally true that trimming U.S. motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions—as the EPA Endangerment Finding allows under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act through vehicle efficiency standards—will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by much less than 1 percent this decade.

HART: Of course, the United States cannot control global greenhouse gas emissions by itself. As youpoint out in your introduction to our initiative and as you just alluded to, Varun, even if the U.S. eliminated its emissions today, that might have little effect on the pace of climate change. On the other hand, if the United States joins the rest of the world in imposing limits on emissions, the threat could be reduced, if not averted. Handcuffing the federal government, as Trump’s EPA proposes to do, could take such collaboration off the table for future administrations.

SIVARAM: There are two questions at play here, though. First, are global cuts to greenhouse gas emissions desirable? And second, is regulation under the Clean Air Act, enabled by the Endangerment Finding, the best way to achieve it? The answer to the first question is, of course, yes. But I don’t think that the Endangerment Finding charts the best path forward.

On the international front, China and India will continue making energy policies that suit their own interests, irrespective of the decisions made in the United States. At home, one of the more frequently cited benefits of the vehicle emissions standards imposed under the Clean Air Act is lower vehicle running costs for consumers, since they do not need to buy as much fuel.

But this is a paternalistic, ex post justification. If Americans want to spend money on inefficient, gas-guzzling vehicles, the bar to infringe on their liberty to do so should be high. Before the shale revolution, there was a strong national security and energy security case for curbing U.S. fossil fuel import dependency, but those risks aren’t as pronounced anymore, now that the United States is a net oil and gas exporter.

In short, if we are being completely honest, the regulations enabled by the EPA Endangerment Finding have no measurable impact on averting climate-related risks to the health or welfare of future American residents. The Endangerment Finding is a tortured attempted to pass climate policies through an obscure back door without leveling with the American people.

HILL: Honesty and transparency are indeed critical components of effective climate policy. But the Trump administration isn’t just seeking to roll back climate regulations, it’s also going after the science and data that support them.

For example, the Trump administration has reportedly asked NASA to develop plans to end the onlytwo satellite missions designed to measure carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And it has proposed terminating funding for Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, which has measured atmospheric carbon accumulation for close to seventy years—the world’s longest continuous record. It also killed the long-runningdatabase that tracks climate-related disasters costing the nation more than $1 billion each. Started in 1980, that database documents the rising costs of climate extremes for Americans.

At the same time, the administration has dismissed the hundreds of scientists who volunteered to complete the nation’ssixth national assessment—a Congressionally mandated report grounded in peer-reviewed science that evaluates climate risk by region and economic sector. Without access to up-to-date authoritative climate information, American communities and businesses will fly blind to the risks from climate change that their government apparently no longer wants to protect them from.

HART: Climate policy would certainly be much stronger if Congress legislated it in a bipartisan fashion. But it never has. And perhaps it never will.

HILL: I agree that legislation would certainly be a desirable solution if regulation through the Executive branch proves impossible, though I share David’s skepticism that it is a likely one. In the absence of action under Articles I or II, however, one ironic outcome of lifting the Endangerment Finding might be increased activity under Article III of the Constitution: the judiciary.

It could remove a shield that polluting companies have used effectively in litigation. Companies have successfully argued that the Clean Air Act preempts federal common law actions against them. But if the EPA is out of the business of climate regulation, that preemption argument could fall. The dockets of both federal and state courts could swell with lawsuits against utilities and other greenhouse gas emitters. In addition, the regulatory void left by a reversal at the federal level could leave more room for state legislatures to force fossil fuel companies to pay for adaptation and disaster recovery through measures like the Climate Superfund Acts passed in New York and Vermont.

By the way, abandoning the Endangerment Finding also flies in the face of the International Court of Justiceadvisory opinion [PDF] issued earlier this year, which found that nations have legally binding obligations under international law to mitigate heat-trapping pollution and adapt to the changing climate.

HART: Alice, that is a really fascinating and unanticipated twist to this story. I have been and continue to be worried that the courts are being asked to do far too much in a wide range of policy areas, due to failures in our other branches of government. I don’t think that having the courts make climate policy will result in effective action. It’s unlikely to be better than legislation passed by only one party and the use of executive authorities, which the United States has now tried without much success. Perhaps I’ll be proven wrong; a combination of state-level and judicial action have led to important progress in civil rights policy, including most recentlysame-sex marriage.

SIVARAM: I don’t think we should give up on legislation. Building innovative, world-leading energy industries will create jobs and wealth in the United States, something both parties profess to support. It will also reduce the cost of deploying low-carbon energy in other countries. Developing next-generation technology that can be deployed quickly and at scale will enable faster, cheaper diffusion of these technologies to the countries where most future emissions growth will occur.

This kind of constructive approach under my Climate Realism Doctrine could have three components.

Focus our approach to electrifying the economy through the lens of American security and competitiveness. We should be honest that in the next decade, America will do quite well by continuing to extract fossil fuels, using fossil fuels to power domestic industries and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and achieving global geopolitical leverage through energy dominance. But in the medium- and long-term, the United States risks losing economic competitiveness to China, which is electrifying its economy and producing far more electricity (through clean sources such as nuclear, solar, and wind) and using electricity for electric vehicles, electrified industry, and more. Such an economy will be cheaper, more advanced, and fundamentally more competitive thanks to the basic physics of why electrified technologies are more efficient than combustion-based ones.

Pass legislation focused on advancing U.S. innovation in electric and clean technologies and scaling-up technology advances to commercial scale. U.S. clean industries need support to bring cutting-edge innovations to market and compete with giant Chinese producers.

Pass legislation creating early markets for advanced U.S. technologies, such as solid-state battery powertrains. The military might purchase drones or vehicles with next-generation batteries, restricting purchasing to U.S. companies, for example. Such early markets create a demand-pull for U.S. clean technologies.

When the United States is able to bring together voters and legislators on both the right and the left to agree that global climate change threatens U.S. security and welfare, the set of interventions we should undertake will likely focus heavily on the more than 85 percent of emissions from China and emerging economies, adopting a muscular and realist approach to induce those economies to reduce their emissions as a condition of the United States reducing ours.

HART: Either way, these developments ultimately put the burden back on people like us to persuade the public as well as policymakers why the United States ought to do something to help the world slow and ultimately eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.

Arizona State University and the Vellore Institute of Technology, or VIT, have created a pathway through International Transfer Programmes, or ITP, which allows students to begin their Master of Technology in smart mobility program at VIT and then complete a Master of Science in clean energy systems at ASU.

The clean energy systems program is offered through The Polytechnic School, part of Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at ASU, and is located on the Polytechnic campus in Mesa, Arizona.

VIT is recognized as one of India’s leading private engineering institutions, with more than 90,000 students across its campuses. Its smart mobility program is very competitive, and the new degree pathway broadens opportunities for talented students, equipping them with additional resources and a global perspective.

VIT Chancellor G. Viswanathan welcomed the launch.

“We are excited to partner with Arizona State University in launching this dual degree program,” he says. “It brings a unique international dimension to our students’ academic journey and enhances their potential to lead in the clean energy revolution.”

A.M. Kannan, a Fulton Schools professor of engineering and program chair of the clean energy systems program at ASU, is excited to provide students with hands-on research opportunities in Arizona as they complete their second year of graduate school. The Polytechnic School has a heavy emphasis on applied, experiential learning to provide a strong foundation for the students’ growth.

“We have 12 faculty members in our program,” Kannan says. “The robust faculty base we have dedicated to clean energy systems can help students move to the next level.”

The faculty’s expertise spans photovoltaic systems, power electronics for renewable energy integration, electric vehicles, autonomous driving, batteries and much more. That breadth of subject matter expertise will guide students in shaping their research interests and, for some, help create pathways into ASU’s new doctoral program in clean energy systems.

Faculty members in the program also maintain close connections with industry, ensuring students can engage with experts, tackle practical challenges and strengthen their professional development skills.

During the first year of study at VIT, the curriculum provides a strong foundation in theoretical knowledge. In their second year at ASU, students begin advanced technical training and project-based learning. Ultimately, students will earn two master’s degrees — one from VIT and one from ASU — leaving the program equipped with academic depth, applied experience and international exposure that will set them apart in the field.

The collaboration benefits students, while strengthening the Fulton Schools’ clean energy systems program by expanding research, drawing top international talent and raising the school’s global profile.

Graduates of the program will have advanced knowledge of career pathways in clean energy systems, including at energy technology firms, research institutions and utilities.

They’ll also have the option to pursue Optional Practical Training, or OPT, upon completion of their degree, or continue to the doctoral program.

This program offering lays the foundation for future collaborations with other institutions around the world that share ASU’s commitment to advance clean energy systems.

By connecting students in India and the U.S., the collaboration contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of affordable and clean energy, and gives students the skills they need to take on global challenges.

The collaboration also highlights ASU’s role as a global leader in innovation and workforce readiness.",https://news.asu.edu/sites/g/files/litvpz161/files/2025-09/ASU-VIT-hero-1920x1080-2025-v2-toWEB.jpeg,N,,2025-09-24 18:02:32.369778

It’s that time of year again, when the world’s climate elite converge on New York for their annual pilgrimage. Climate Week 2025 is filling the skies with private jets and the streets with motorcades, while in between cocktail receptions and panels, the emissaries of environmental virtue instruct the rest of us to do with less.

The United Nations General Assembly is also in town, offering a convenient stage for the political left’s global climate agenda. For decades, it has imposed costly mandates — emissions targets, fuel standards and regulatory frameworks — that punish the U.S. energy sector, push allies toward unreliable renewables and allow major emitters such as China to ignore deadline after deadline without consequence.

That agenda is on full display at Climate Week, this time with a carefully chosen figure meant to lend bipartisan credibility.

Benji Backer, the 27-year-old founder of the American Conservation Coalition and Nature Is Nonpartisan, is billed as the conservative voice of the climate movement. Polished and adept at wrapping himself in MAGA-friendly language, he is precisely the sort of figure the movement hopes will render its program more palatable to young conservatives.

However, his record tells a different story. Mr. Backer has called President Trump “despicable and indefensible,” praised Greta Thunberg’s “critical role” in shaping climate awareness and endorsed government control over 30% of America’s land for environmental purposes. He supports many of the policies long championed by liberal climate activists, including subsidies for “green hydrogen,” government-created incentives that redirect markets toward wind and solar, and expanded restrictions on fossil fuel development.

Mr. Backer is invaluable to the climate left. After decades of failed predictions and economically destructive policies, the movement has a credibility problem with ordinary Americans. A self-declared conservative willing to echo their premise — that carbon dioxide is an existential threat and fossil fuels must be aggressively curtailed — gives an illusion of bipartisan consensus.

Never mind that the movement’s agenda hasn’t worked. The flagship U.N. climate agreements have cost trillions of dollars without meaningfully altering global temperature trends. The largest emitters, especially China, remain on the same trajectory, exempt from serious restrictions. Billions of dollars in subsidies for wind and solar have produced an energy grid that is more expensive and less reliable.

The movement’s apocalyptic deadlines have come and gone without the promised catastrophe. Climate-related deaths are down 99% since the 1920s. People around the world are living longer, healthier and wealthier lives, and the primary driver of that progress has been access to affordable, abundant energy, overwhelmingly from fossil fuels.

Mr. Backer’s “commonsense” branding can’t hide the fact that his approach would take us in the opposite direction. By accepting the left’s framing of the problem and the solution, he offers not a conservative alternative but a more marketable version of the same failed plan.

Fortunately, the Trump administration is intent on moving in the opposite direction. It is ending the regulatory war on domestic oil, gas and coal, restoring investment in American energy production, and recognizing that wind and solar cannot replace reliable baseload power. It refuses to treat carbon dioxide as the enemy and instead focuses on technology, efficiency and innovation that expand prosperity without sacrificing energy security.

American energy dominance means stable, affordable prices for American families, a secure supply chain for our nation and our allies and the ability to withstand global price shocks without reliance on OPEC or hostile regimes. It ensures that the power needs of a growing economy — from households to next-generation technologies such as artificial intelligence data centers — are met with reliable, abundant domestic energy.

That prosperity is worth defending. Affordable, abundant energy is the foundation of modern life. It has lifted billions from poverty, extended life expectancy and enabled freedoms and comforts unimaginable a century ago.

Climate Week is doing what it always does: staging a spectacle, declaring the crisis graver than ever before, and demanding more control over how we live, work and consume.

Mr. Backer may be the most useful prop in that performance, but he is not the voice of conservative environmentalism. He is the cover for an agenda that has failed on its own terms and now seeks to survive under a different brand.

We need to reject the repackaging and stay focused on what works: energy abundance, economic growth and the freedom to pursue both without apology.

Critics argue the plan weakens safeguards to protect people from toxic exposures.

The EPA on Monday released proposed changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that would remove amendments made in 2024 under the Biden administration. TSCA is a federal law under which the EPA evaluates chemicals to make sure human and environmental health will be protected before chemicals are put into the marketplace. The proposed changes include removing the 2024 amendment that required the agency to consider every use and exposure route of a chemical when evaluating risk.

In its explanation, the EPA wrote that the 2024 amendment could “negatively impact EPA’s ability to complete risk evaluations in a timely manner” and added that the agency should have discretion in deciding which “conditions of use, exposure routes and exposure pathways it will consider in risk evaluation,” a move that would allow the EPA to exclude some uses of a chemical from its reviews.

This proposed change ignores that people are often exposed to the same chemical from different sources, said Maria Doa, senior director of chemicals policy for the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. “If you live in a community and there’s a facility nearby releasing a chemical into the air … and you are exposed to the same chemical from a product that you use at home, your body doesn’t treat these exposures differently,” she said.

“What happens is they would regulate the one use and not the other. But if you look at the combination, they both contribute to your exposure,” Doa added.

Other proposed changes include scaling back how much information manufacturers need to provide for a proposed chemical; considering personal protection and safety equipment use when evaluating workplace chemical risks; and allowing the agency to determine if certain uses of a chemical carry unreasonable risks instead of making a single risk judgment based on all of the chemical’s uses — the latter approach negatively impacts technological innovation and businesses, according to the proposed rule change.

Doa said these changes are “all coordinated in order to lower what they characterize as exposures and risk.”

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin touted the changes as “a clear, predictable, commonsense approach that’s grounded in the law and the science” in an accompanying statement.

“This work is yet another example of how we can and will protect human health and the environment while allowing manufacturing and industrial sectors to thrive,” he said.

Evidence of Industry Influence

The EPA has made multiple environmental rollbacks in the first few months of the Trump administration that appease the industries the agency regulates. The proposed TSCA changes are in line with suggestions from the National Association of Manufacturers’ “wishlist” sent to the Trump administration last December.

Last week, The New Lede reported that top EPA officials are frequently meeting with lobbyists from the chemical, plastic, agricultural and energy industries and mostly shutting out health and environmental groups.

The Service said in an August 2024 assessment that because it planned to use “Best Management Practices,” that any potential effects on soil erosion or Lake Monroe’s water quality would be mitigated.

But the Court reviewed studies that the Forest Service cited for its plans and found them either outdated or irrelevant to the project. One of the studies cited was 30 years old and another used a metric which “carries little to no weight” for measuring the impacts of logging in Jackson and Lawrence counties.

Pratt’s ruling says the Service’s assessment offers “only generalized assurances” that its efforts to mitigate harm will be effective, but no analysis or reason for this conclusion. And “platitudes are not enough to satisfy (the National Environmental Policy and Administrative Procedure Acts).”

The law doesn’t require that an agency prevent harm or mitigate its impact. But it needs to take a “hard look” to measure the effects of its plans.

The ruling says, “The project should not move forward until that determination is made.”

The ruling sides with Monroe County Board of Commissioners, Indiana Forest Alliance, Hoosier Environmental Council, and Friends of Lake Monroe. It’s the third suit trying to halt the logging plan since 2020.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4c6306b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1197x628+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fimages%2Fnews-images%2Fhoosier_national_forest_copy.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 18:03:25.279567

Solar continues to break records in July

EIA’s latest monthly “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through July 31, 2025), once again confirms that solar is the fastest growing among the major sources of US electricity.

In July alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar (i.e., >1-megawatt (MW)) surged by 36.9% compared to July 2024, while “estimated” small-scale (e.g., rooftop) solar PV increased by 12.7%. Combined, they grew by 30.4% and provided 9.4% of US electrical output, up from 7.5% year-over-year.

Moreover, utility-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic expanded by 37.4%, while generation from small-scale systems rose by 11.0% during the first seven months of 2025 year-over-year. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by 29.9% and was 8.9% (utility-scale: 6.7%; small-scale: 2.2%) of total US electrical generation for January to July – up from 7.0% a year earlier.

As a consequence, solar-generated electricity year-to-date (YTD) easily surpassed – by over 54% – the output of US hydropower plants (5.7%). In July alone, solar-generated electricity more than doubled the output of hydropower. In fact, in both July and YTD, solar produced more electricity than hydropower, biomass, and geothermal combined.

And for the first time ever, 4% more electricity was generated in July by utility-scale solar (33,119-GWh) than by wind farms (31,831-GWh). Including small-scale systems, solar outproduced wind by over 35% during the month (43,092 GWh).

Wind is still on a growth trajectory

US wind turbines produced 10.8% of US electricity in the first seven months of 2025, an increase of 3.5% year-over-year, and they almost doubled electrical generation by the nation’s hydropower plants.

In July alone, wind-generated electricity was 13.8% greater than a year before.

Wind + solar are beating coal, nuclear

During the first seven months of 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 19.6% of the US total, up from 17.8% during the first seven months of 2024.

Further, the EIA reports that the combination of wind and solar provided 19.1% more electricity than did coal during the first seven months of 2025, and 14.1% more than nuclear. In fact, as solar and wind grew rapidly, nuclear-generated electricity dropped by 1.0%.

Renewables are still on the rise

All renewables combined (wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, and geothermal) produced 9.9% more electricity between January and July than they did a year ago and provided 26.7% of total US electricity production compared to 25.1% 12 months earlier.

Electrical generation by the combination of all renewables grew three times faster than total US electrical generation (9.9% vs. 3.3%). Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas, which saw a decline in electrical output by almost 3.5% during the first seven months of 2025.

“Notwithstanding enactment of the anti-renewables provisions in the Trump megabill, solar and wind continue to power ahead,” noted the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director, Ken Bossong. “Meanwhile, the electrical output YTD by the Republicans’ preferred technologies – nuclear power and natural gas – has actually fallen.”

While these vehicles offer a cleaner future, they also pose an important question: what happens to their batteries once they reach the end of their lifespan?

By 2030, the global EV fleet is projected to exceed 250M units. Additionally, the cumulative lithium-ion battery waste is expected to exceed 1 billion tons by the same year. Without battery recycling, this waste becomes an environmental problem. However, recycling is not just about waste management but about resource recovery. The materials used in EV batteries, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, are expensive and in limited supply. To put it in perspective, lithium carbonate typically costs around $ 8,200-$ 10,000 per ton, cobalt (battery-grade MHP) more than $ 21,000 per ton, and nickel between $14,000-$16,000 per ton, depending on market conditions. Recovering and reusing these critical minerals makes recycling not optional, but mandatory.

In this article, we will examine what is inside an EV battery, what can be recovered when it reaches the end of its life, and how the recycling process really works. We will also explore where these used batteries come from, which regions lead the recycling market, and how the industry is projected to grow in the coming years.

What is inside an EV battery?

Let’s first examine what an EV battery is made of. Each battery varies depending on factors like energy density, chemistry, and capacity. To simplify, let’s use the Tesla Model 3’s 75 kWh battery as an example. It contains about 12 kg of lithium, 50 kg of nickel, 4.5 kg of cobalt, and 4 kg of manganese. It also includes 70 kg of graphite for the anode, 20 kg of aluminum foil, and 25 kg of copper foil. Besides active materials, each cell has a steel casing, and the pack itself is housed in aluminum and steel for strength and safety. Here, nickel and cobalt face supply risks, with over 60% of cobalt sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Graphite and aluminum are more abundant, yet their significant weight share makes them economically important in recycling.

When EV batteries like these reach the end of their lifespan, material recovery begins. Currently, the global market for recycled EV battery materials is estimated to be worth $500 million in 2024 (according to a report by Stratview Research). Cobalt accounts for the largest share, about 30%. Copper follows with roughly 25%. Although essential for battery production, lithium makes up only about 8%. The remaining materials include manganese, aluminum, and iron.

How are EV batteries recycled?

But how do we recover these metals? The answer lies in the recycling process, where used batteries are carefully disassembled and processed so that every valuable item can be reclaimed. Two main methods are used. Hydrometallurgy relies on chemical leaching to dissolve and separate metals, while pyrometallurgy involves high-temperature smelting to extract them. Hydrometallurgy now dominates the market, accounting for about 70% of the share, because it achieves higher recovery rates (up to 99% for lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, and 95–100% for lithium and aluminum under optimal conditions), consumes less energy, and produces fewer emissions. Pyrometallurgy, although more energy-intensive, remains a valuable method for processing various battery chemistries.

Where do used EV batteries originate from?

To understand this market, it is essential to examine the origin of these end-of-life EV batteries. Cars make up the biggest share, contributing around 58% of the batteries that go into recycling. Close behind are electric buses, with a 41% share, while other vehicles, such as scooters, bikes, or trucks, make up only a negligible representation for now. Since almost all modern EVs, including cars and buses (the biggest shareholders), are powered by lithium-ion battery packs, nearly 97% of the batteries recycled today are lithium-ion. The 3% that remains comes from nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, which were popular in early hybrid electric cars and are now reaching the end of their life, making their way into recycling facilities.

The global map of EV battery recycling

The geography of EV battery recycling closely resembles where EVs are sold and used. In 2024, China accounted for nearly 65% of global EV sales, and it already hosts more than half of the world’s EV fleet. Naturally, this dominance extends into recycling. China alone holds about 65% of the EVs' recycled battery market, giving the parent Asia-Pacific region a commanding ~78% share of the global market.

This is followed by Europe, with a share of around 17%, driven by strong EV adoption policies and battery recycling regulations. Interestingly, from 2025 onward, the EU Battery Regulations introduce minimum recycling efficiency and material recovery targets, such as a minimum of 90% recovery of cobalt, copper, nickel, and lead, and a 50% recovery target for lithium by 2027. Europe is followed by North America, but its share remains low as large-scale EV penetration is still catching up.

The growth of EVs has put critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel under the spotlight, making recycling increasingly important. These materials are scarce and costly, and recovering them eases both supply risks and financial pressures on the EV industry. In 2024, the global Electric Vehicles Recycled Batteries Market was valued at $250 million, and it is projected to reach $300 million in 2025. Looking further ahead, the market is expected to reach USD 3 bn by 2035, expanding at a robust CAGR of 26%. This trajectory illustrates how recycling is evolving from a supporting role to become a primary component of the EV ecosystem.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt26ece40ce4e16eb3/650c1c2b99c3f9722e2269c7/GettyImages-868516744.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-24 17:02:10.762648

These incentives, combined with the federal tax credit, maximize the return on investment for homeowners installing a Tesla Solar Roof.
Beyond energy savings, the Tesla Solar Roof offers a fully integrated new roof replacement with Class A fire, Class F wind, and industry-leading impact ratings.
Compared to conventional rack-mounted panels, the Tesla Solar Roof has fewer roof penetrations and is designed to withstand the severe weather common in Broward County, providing both durability and efficiency.","Air Force Roofing, founded by Joel Alcocer, has announced that it is now one of the few roofing contractors in South Florida qualified to install the Tesla Solar Roof. This premium roof replacement not only provides hurricane-grade durability but also generates clean electricity, helping homeowners reduce energy costs while maintaining top industry standards. The certification allows Air Force Roofing to assist residents in Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach in replacing aging tile or shingle roofs with a Tesla Solar Roof that combines performance, safety, and energy savings.

Data for Broward County highlights the potential savings. Households in Fort Lauderdale pay approximately $0.16 per kWh and use around 20,256 kWh per year. A Tesla Solar Roof sized appropriately can offset most or all of this consumption, translating to roughly $3,240 in annual bill avoidance. Even a 10 kW Tesla Solar Roof producing about 15,000 kWh per year could save homeowners about $2,400 annually before incentives. These calculations are based on local EnergySage data and the typical South Florida solar yield of approximately 1,500 kWh per kW per year.

Homeowners can also take advantage of the federal Residential Clean Energy Credit, which provides a 30 percent tax credit for qualified residential clean energy systems, including solar panels and Tesla Solar Roof tiles. This credit applies to the solar components, such as panels, tiles, inverters, wiring, and paired batteries, but not to unrelated roofing materials or structural costs. The credit remains at 30 percent through 2032, stepping down gradually through 2034 unless extended by Congress.

In Florida, additional incentives further increase the financial benefit. While the state does not offer a personal income tax credit, it provides a 100 percent property tax exemption on the added value of solar systems and a sales tax exemption on solar equipment purchases. These incentives, combined with the federal tax credit, maximize the return on investment for homeowners installing a Tesla Solar Roof.

Florida utilities also support net metering, allowing customers of investor-owned utilities, including Florida Power & Light (FPL), to receive bill credits at the retail rate for excess solar generation. Utilities apply a customary 115 percent sizing guideline relative to past usage, with credits rolling over monthly and annual true-ups defined by utility tariffs. These policies help homeowners achieve the projected savings from their Tesla Solar Roof.

Beyond energy savings, the Tesla Solar Roof offers a fully integrated new roof replacement with Class A fire, Class F wind, and industry-leading impact ratings. It comes with a 25-year product and power warranty. Compared to conventional rack-mounted panels, the Tesla Solar Roof has fewer roof penetrations and is designed to withstand the severe weather common in Broward County, providing both durability and efficiency.

Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach households are ideal candidates for the Tesla Solar Roof, as Florida homes typically consume more electricity than the national average due to heavy air conditioning use. With abundant sunshine and stable incentives, a solar roof replacement provides a practical way to reduce long-term energy costs while modernizing the home’s appearance.

Joel Alcocer emphasized Air Force Roofing’s commitment to combining precision roofing with modern energy solutions. The team ensures homeowners receive a coordinated project with a single warranty and one dedicated installer. By combining Tesla Solar Roof expertise with local permitting knowledge, Air Force Roofing helps Broward County residents navigate product selection, interconnection, and utility paperwork efficiently, resulting in faster energy savings and a seamless experience.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5.png,N,,2025-09-24 19:02:03.943312

And the amount of new clean energy collectively planned by these utilities would replace just half of existing fossil fuel use—not accounting at all for projected demand (or “load growth,” in utilityspeak).
And so, for its efforts, CPS gets a C—a passing grade, compared to the vast majority of utilities.
One other caveat here is that the Sierra Club report grades on a generous curve.
In fact, the average score across utilities was 15—three points lower than the Sierra Club’s baseline assessment in 2021.","Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign released a report this month that scores utilities across the country according to the decarbonization and renewable energy targets scientists say we must hit by 2035 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Titled The Dirty Truth, the report evaluated 75 utilities that together account for about half of all fossil fuel-generated electricity production in the United States, including San Antonio’s CPS Energy, which scored a C—not terrible, but not great either.

The Sierra Club used three specific benchmarks to rate utilities’ progress on climate over the past five years: 1) progress toward retiring all coal-fired power generation by 2030; 2) progress toward building the renewably sourced energy required to replace fossil fuels and meet energy rising demand by 2035; and 3) whether utilities planned to build new gas plants before 2035. The first two metrics added points to a utility’s score, while the third one subtracted them.

After taking stock of the portfolios and clean energy plans for the nation’s most prominent belchers of planet-warming gases, the findings were…not great, especially amidst the Trump Administration’s gutting of federal support for renewable energy and priming demand for power use by data centers and crypto miners.

Xcel Texas wrangled a B for plans to retire the Tolk coal plant in the Panhandle ahead of schedule, while the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) earned an F due to its decision to keep one of the nation’s dirtiest power plants in operation—the Fayette coal plant outside Austin—while failing to advance on renewables.

“LCRA professes a mission to enhance Texans’ quality of life while keeping open a dirty, expensive coal plant and investing almost nothing in the most affordable forms of energy,” Cyrus Reed, legislative and conservation director of the Sierra Club Lone Star Chapter, stated in a prepared release from the nonprofit.

“In fact, LCRA got one of the lowest clean energy scores in the entire United States even though reversing course would help lower bills for its city and co-op customers.”

Overall, American utilities have committed to retiring only 29 percent of the coal in their portfolios by 2030, and seem to be replacing that with new gas-fired generation more than clean energy sources like wind, solar, and battery storage, the report states. While 65 percent of utilities surveyed have improved their clean energy scores over the last five years, 69 percent worsened on gas and 33 percent on coal. And the amount of new clean energy collectively planned by these utilities would replace just half of existing fossil fuel use—not accounting at all for projected demand (or “load growth,” in utilityspeak).

Sierra Club summed up its findings as such:

“[I]nstead of correcting course, many utilities continue to stall, wasting time as projected power demand increases and the transition [from fossil fuels to clean energy] becomes more urgent. This failure has contributed to rising affordability issues, which these companies are now using as excuses to justify continued reliance on fossil fuels.”

Maybe not surprisingly, Sierra Club’s assessments turned up a significant degree of greenwashing: though 65 of 75 utilities (about 87 percent) had made some kind of climate pledge on paper, their promises were not borne out in practice, given that 60 percent of utilities scored a D or F. Conversely, the report found “a clear pattern: utilities that set ambitious, near-term goals take more action to transition to clean energy. Meanwhile, companies that delay action try to hide their lack of progress behind vague, long-term climate pledges.”

Responding to the City of San Antonio’s own Climate Action and Adaptation Plan—which sets specific and actionable targets, aiming for a 41 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, a 71 percent reduction by 2040, and carbon-neutrality by 2050—CPS Energy has taken significant steps to close its dirtiest coal- and gas-fired power plants and increase the share of renewables in its portfolio, alongside conservation goals (albeit less ambitious ones than in decades prior). But CPS has also undeniably leaned heavily on gas-fired peaker plants to make up for shuttered coal and aging gas, including a buying spree on existing plants across South Texas—three last year and four just last week.

And so, for its efforts, CPS gets a C—a passing grade, compared to the vast majority of utilities.

But the devil is in the details. According to a more granular breakdown provided via an online tool, CPS scored 100 percent on its current progress toward retirement of all coal by 2030. But it scored just 30 percent in its progress toward transitioning to all-renewable energy by 2035. And though Sierra Club reports that (as of July 1, 2025), CPS has “0 megawatts” planned from new gas plants through 2035, this doesn’t seem to account for CPS’s recent acquisitions, which add 3,332 MW of gas-fired generation to its portfolio. Nor does it account for the nuclear energy in CPS’s portfolio—still projected at 10 percent in 2030—which although low-carbon during power production is hardly renewable or “clean” on the mining, refining, or disposal side.

One other caveat here is that the Sierra Club report grades on a generous curve. Unlike Texas public school students, who are required to earn at least 70 percent to pass for the semester and graduate for the year, a C in utility world means earning just 35 points out of 100. In fact, the average score across utilities was 15—three points lower than the Sierra Club’s baseline assessment in 2021.

Did anyone even get an A? the students might be heard to grumble. According to The Dirty Truth, three utilities did, though none of these were listed in the report’s appendix, where the highest grade given was a B—including Xcel Texas and Xcel New Mexico.

What we can say is that, viewed against the backdrop of national trends—building some clean energy capacity but not nearly enough to meet rising demand, turning to gas in the name of affordability—CPS appears, well, entirely average. Mid, as the kids might say.

But if there is one main takeaway from this report, it’s that a C isn’t terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good…for a utility. Which is a problem.",https://d3l0i86vhnepo5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24125558/dirty-truth-report-sierra-club-1024x588.png,N,,2025-09-24 17:03:05.294645

Despite vast fossil fuel subsidies distorting markets, clean energy received double the investment of fossil fuels last year.
The bottom line: clean is competitive, and climate action is imperative.
A UN report will calculate their impact for global emissions.
We need urgent action: to unlock funds for developing countries; to seize clean energy benefits and protect lives and economies.","Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the opening of the high-level special event on climate action, in New York today:

As we have just heard, it is still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C by century’s end. We know what permanently breaching that limit would mean for people and planet. The science compels climate action. So does the economics.

Clean energy is powering jobs, growth and sustainable development, generating the fastest and cheapest electricity, insulating economies from volatile fossil fuel markets, providing energy security and sovereignty, and helping to deliver clean and affordable energy for all.

Despite vast fossil fuel subsidies distorting markets, clean energy received double the investment of fossil fuels last year. The bottom line: clean is competitive, and climate action is imperative.

The Paris Agreement has made a difference. In the last 10 years, projected global temperature rise has dropped from 4°C to less than 3°C — if current nationally determined contributions are fully implemented.

Now, we need new plans for 2035 that go much further, and much faster: Delivering dramatic emissions cuts aligned with 1.5°C; covering all emissions and sectors; and accelerating a just energy transition globally.

Your new plans can take us a significant step forward. A UN report will calculate their impact for global emissions. If they fall short, we must create the conditions for a decade of acceleration. We know it can be done.

China met its 2030 wind and solar target six years ahead of schedule. India reached 50 per cent electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels five years early. We are in the dawn of a new energy era. We must seize this moment of opportunity. The thirtieth Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) in Brazil must conclude with a credible global response plan to get us on track.

Five areas are crucial:

First, energy. Fossil fuels still dominate. We must supercharge the clean energy transition. Investing in grids and storage to unlock the full potential of renewables. Lowering capital costs for developing countries. And redirecting fossil fuel subsidies to a just transition.

Second, methane — a potent global heating gas. Drastic cuts this decade are essential — and most can be achieved quickly and cheaply. The International Energy Agency estimates fossil fuel operations could cut 40 per cent of methane emissions today with no net cost.

Third, forests. We must end the destruction of nature’s greatest carbon sinks. This could deliver a fifth of needed emissions reductions by 2030.

Fourth, heavy industry. We have seen important advances in technologies to cut emissions from steel and cement, and heavy transport. They must be deployed urgently.

Fifth, climate justice. Developing countries that did least to cause the crisis are suffering the most. Climate disasters are inflicting damages that exceed the gross domestic product (GDP) of some small islands. Droughts and floods are taking lives, fuelling hunger and inflaming conflict. All while finance gaps prevent investments in adaptation and resilience.

We need urgent action: to unlock funds for developing countries; to seize clean energy benefits and protect lives and economies. That requires reforming the international financial architecture to strengthen developing country participation.

We need effective debt relief and scaled-up solutions like debt swaps and disaster pause clauses. We need a major increase in the lending capacity of multilateral development banks; significant contributions to the Loss and Damage Fund, including from innovative sources; and a major boost in adaptation finance — with developed countries meeting their pledge to double funding this year.

COP30 must show a credible path to mobilizing the $1.3 trillion annually in climate finance by 2035, as agreed at COP29 in Baku: Identifying sources — existing and new; outlining policies, instruments and actions to make finance accessible, affordable and at scale; and establishing credible accountability measures to verify progress.

The science demands action. The law commands it. The economics compel it. And people are calling for it. I look forward to hearing how you will respond – and the UN stands ready to help you to deliver.",https://press.un.org/themes/custom/un3_press/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-24 17:02:45.981867

“Businesses and investors know the truth: that acting on climate is no longer about compliance or reputation management.","NEW YORK CITY: At a main stage event at Climate Week NYC, prominent thought leaders from center-right organizations and former Republican members of Congress made the case for championing efforts to protect the long-standing rights of investors and companies to consider all financial risks in decision-making. They are part of a growing chorus of bipartisan voices working to safeguard the freedom to invest responsibly.

“If investors are denied the ability to invest in what they think is best, that will significantly reduce the opportunities to make profits, to have a market that functions, to have a free market that flourishes,” said Eli Lehrer, President, R Street.

The comments came at Ceres at Climate Week, which included a full-day residency at the Nest Climate Campus on Sept. 24, bringing together investors, companies, and policymakers to explore the current challenges and opportunities in advancing climate action. The main stage event, Championing the Clean Economy: Corporate Action and Protecting the Freedom to Invest, featured former Reps. Ryan Costello (Pennsylvania), Carlos Curbelo (Florida), and Bob Inglis (South Carolina), as well as senior representatives from DEPLOY/US, Freedom to Invest, National Taxpayers Union, and R Street. It was followed by a media availability and a 45-minute public roundtable discussion.

“People should be free to make their investment decision without the heavy hand of government pushing them in one direction or another,” said Brandon Arnold, Executive Vice President, National Taxpayers Union.

“The government shouldn’t be involved in instructing companies or investment firms or individuals in what kind of risks they should take into account or what opportunities they seek when they invest,” said former Congressman Carlos Curbelo (R-FL).

Ceres CEO and President Mindy Lubber and Inherent Group’s CEO and CIO Tony Davis highlighted the ways U.S. investors and businesses are prospering in the transition to an advanced, more resilient economy, spotlighting clean energy investment trends, including the prediction that clean investment globally is expected to reach $2.2 trillion by the end of 2025. “Last year’s 90 percent-plus of all new energy generation was renewables, and why is that? Because it is better technology. They are cheaper and they also provide energy security,” said Davis.

Ceres at Climate Week comes as the U.S. administration moves to undo federal environmental policies aimed at reducing climate pollution and rolls back federal incentives that have bolstered clean energy innovation and job growth. It also comes as frequent and costly extreme weather events continue. Such events cost the U.S. a record $182.7 billion in damages in 2024 and have already cost $93 billion in damages in the first half of 2025.

At the same time, recent analyses show sustained momentum in clean economy investing and corporate climate action. 92% of 500 chief financial officers surveyed said they expect to invest more in sustainability this year, with more than half significantly increasing their investments. An analysis of 6500 companies found 84% are standing by their goals to cut carbon pollution, with 37% increasing their ambitions. And 70% of 74 large asset owners surveyed now integrate responsible investment goals into their strategies, an increase from the previous year.

As Lubber noted in her opening remarks, investors and businesses continue to address climate and sustainability risks because these risks are financial issues.

“Businesses and investors know the truth: that acting on climate is no longer about compliance or reputation management. It’s about profit and resilience. It’s about materiality and not just morality. It is about jobs and the economy and building a clean energy revolution.”

Ceres called for increased business and government action to reduce climate pollution driving extreme weather, double down on prudent financial risk management and clean energy investments, maintain policies that ensure clean air and build a cleaner economy, and protect core investment and business freedoms.

Amentum: 3,000 UK Nuclear Jobs and Waste Management U.S. engineering company Amentum announced Sept. 18 plans to create 3,000 new jobs over four years in UK nuclear power and defense, representing a 50% increase in its UK headcount.
The comprehensive agreement covers artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and civil nuclear energy cooperation, with Microsoft leading a $30 billion investment commitment—its largest outside the U.S..","The most significant week in transatlantic nuclear cooperation since the 1950s atomic partnership unfolded Sept. 14–24, 2025, as a coordinated surge of commercial agreements—totaling over $100 billion—spanned advanced reactor deployments, advanced nuclear fuel supply chains, nuclear waste management, maritime nuclear applications, engineering services, and regulatory harmonization.

Formalized under the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy signed Sept. 15, the announcements seek to align U.S. energy-dominance priorities with the UK’s nuclear ambitions as both countries seek to end reliance on Russian nuclear material and cut reactor licensing timelines from three to four years to roughly two.

The orchestrated wave around U.S. President Donald Trump’s Sept. 16–18 state visit to the UK demonstrates how rapidly the nuclear industry can pivot when regulatory barriers fall and government policies align with private capital. While Trump claimed $350 billion in bilateral deals across all sectors during the visit, the nuclear tranche alone opens the path for both countries to capture surging demand from AI-driven data centers and industrial decarbonization while cementing Western-controlled supply chains for next-generation reactors.

In London, UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband called it the coordinated wave, the start of “a golden age of nuclear,” saying: “We’re kickstarting a golden age of nuclear in this country, joining forces with the U.S. to turbocharge new nuclear developments and secure the technologies of the future.” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright matched that tone, noting that “today’s commercial deals set up a framework to unleash commercial access in both the U.S. and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening U.S. energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.”

Before the Surge: Life Extensions, Supply Chain Strengthening, and First U.S. Fuel Contract

Even before the fortnight of massive nuclear deals kicked off, momentum was building across the Atlantic nuclear partnership. EDF Energy on Sept. 1 announced 12-month life extensions for Heysham 1 and Hartlepool nuclear power stations until March 2028 to add about 3 TWh of generation to reduce imported gas dependence. On Sept. 3, Westinghouse formalized memorandums of understanding with six British suppliers—William Cook Cast Products, Trillium Flow Technology, Curtiss-Wright Controls (UK), Boccard UK, Bendalls Engineering, and Sheffield Forgemasters—to supply key reactor components including valves, pumps, actuators, mechanical electrical piping and instrument modules, pressure vessels, tanks, heat exchangers, and cast and forged steel components for AP1000 and AP300 projects in the UK and internationally. As significantly, U.S. startup Aalo Atomics revealed on Sept. 9 that it had quietly signed in July 2025 the first commercial contract by any U.S. advanced reactor company for enriched uranium delivery from UK-headquartered Urenco.

Centrica/X-energy: Hartlepool AMR Deployment and 6 GW Fleet Ambition

On Sept. 15—a Sunday—UK energy giant Centrica and U.S. advanced reactor developer X-energy announced a Joint Development Agreement to deploy up to 12 Xe-100 Advanced Modular Reactors at the EDF and Centrica Hartlepool site, totaling 960 MW of new capacity. The project would replace the current nuclear station, which is scheduled to retire in 2028, and provide both clean electricity and high-temperature process heat for Teesside’s critical industries. The agreement also sets an ambition for as much as 6 GW of advanced reactors across the UK—marking the largest announced AMR fleet to date. (Read POWER’s in-depth report about this project in POWERnews on Sept. 24).

Beyond headline power figures, the deployment addresses grid reliability and decarbonization needs for industrial loads that cannot depend solely on electrification. The UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) previously identified high-temperature gas-cooled reactors as the top advanced nuclear technology for demonstration, and the Xe-100 is designed to serve industrial clusters and regional utilities.

Centrica is set to provide initial project funding. Full-scale activities are targeted to launch in 2026, and first power is planned for the mid-2030s. The Hartlepool site already carries a new nuclear designation under the UK government’s National Policy Statement, supporting a clear regulatory path. Centrica and X-energy are in negotiations with equity partners and top-tier engineering firms to expand deployment across England, Wales, and Scotland.

Holtec, EDF UK Mull SMR-300 at Cottam Site

U.S. SMR developer Holtec International, EDF UK, and real estate partner Tritax on Sept. 14 announced an MOU to develop Holtec’s SMR-300 small modular reactors at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire. The project will provide clean power to new advanced data centers on the 900-acre site to leverage existing grid connections and infrastructure to reduce development costs and timelines.

The arrangement transforms a historic “Megawatt Valley” site into a clean energy and AI hub, with the 1 GW data center project targeted for this decade and SMRs operational in the early 2030s, the company said. The UK project will benefit from lessons learned to reduce risk and accelerate progress as a second-of-a-kind deployment (following Holtec’s SMR-300 at Palisades, Michigan). Holtec’s Dr. Rick Springman noted the project “represents a potential $15 billion project, creating thousands of local jobs while drawing on the lessons from our Palisades project.”

The project includes foreign direct investment in Framatome’s nuclear fuel fabrication and services and Arabelle Solutions’ turbine manufacture. Great British Energy—Nuclear and the National Wealth Fund are conducting feasibility studies and early-stage investment discussions.

Last Energy/DP World: £80M Port-Centric Microreactor at London Gateway

Washington, D.C.-based Last Energy and global logistics leader DP World on Sept. 15 signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the world’s first port-centric micro-nuclear power plant at London Gateway logistics hub, backed by £80 million in subsidy-free private investment. The proposed PWR-20 microreactor will supply 20 MWe of electricity to power DP World’s ongoing £1 billion expansion of the Thames Freeport facility, with surplus exported to the grid and operations targeted for 2030.

London Gateway links cargo to over 130 ports in more than 65 countries and handles more than 50% of the UK’s deep-sea temperature-controlled imports, making it strategically critical for UK trade resilience. The facility’s expansion will add two new all-electric berths and a second rail terminal, positioning it to become the country’s busiest container port within five years.

Last Energy’s PWR-20 design successfully completed a Preliminary Design Review conducted by the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation, Environment Agency, and Natural Resources Wales in July 2025—the first nuclear developer to achieve this milestone in the UK. The fully modular microreactor uses proven pressurized water reactor technology designed for flexible siting, plug-and-play installation, and rapid scalability within a 24-month delivery timeline. Last Energy plans to own and operate the power plant on-site, eliminating customer capital requirements while providing long-term power purchase agreements.

TerraPower/ KBR: Natrium Reactor Studies

U.S. advanced nuclear technology company TerraPower and engineering firm KBR agreed on Sept. 14 to cooperate in seeking potential deployment of TerraPower’s Natrium reactor in the UK. The collaboration will involve joint studies and site evaluations for the 345-megawatt sodium fast reactor with molten salt-based energy storage system, capable of boosting capacity to 500 MW.

KBR President Jay Ibrahim noted: “Expanding our collaboration with TerraPower to the United Kingdom marks a significant milestone in advancing clean, reliable energy solutions globally.” Each Natrium reactor is projected to create 1,600 construction jobs and 250 permanent full-time positions, building on the companies’ preexisting alliance formed in March for deploying Natrium plants across North America, UK, Europe and beyond.

The agreement supports development of UK nuclear construction skills and domestic supply chain capabilities while positioning the UK to participate in future global export opportunities.

Amentum: 3,000 UK Nuclear Jobs and Waste Management

U.S. engineering company Amentum announced Sept. 18 plans to create 3,000 new jobs over four years in UK nuclear power and defense, representing a 50% increase in its UK headcount. The $203 million investment builds on Amentum’s role as lead delivery partner for Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C nuclear power stations and provider of technical solutions for small modular reactors and fusion research.

Separately, Amentum was appointed Sept. 15 as the only company to win positions in all four lots of Nuclear Waste Services’ Integrated Waste Management Specialist Nuclear Services Framework, valued at £26 million over four years. Amentum Energy & Environment President Mark Whitney emphasized the company will “provide critical specialist capabilities and solutions to enable NWS in ensuring safe and secure management of the UK’s radioactive waste.”

Amentum CEO John Heller, who met with Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, stated: “The energy resilience and national security of both nations depend on continued leadership and advances in energy and technology.”

Rolls-Royce SMR: U.S. Regulatory Engagement

UK SMR developer Rolls-Royce SMR confirmed Sept. 14 that it entered the U.S. regulatory process by submitting an engagement plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in April 2025. The move paves the way for potential deployment of the 470 MW SMR design in the U.S. market, leveraging regulatory harmonization provisions in the new UK-U.S. cooperation agreement.

The regulatory engagement follows Rolls-Royce SMR’s selection in June as the chosen technology in Great British Nuclear’s SMR competition, which positions it to build the UK’s next generation of nuclear power stations. The company is 18 months ahead of competitors in European regulatory processes and has progressed to Step 3 of the UK’s Generic Design Assessment. The U.S. engagement enables potential licensing pathway acceleration through shared regulatory reviews, supporting the bilateral goal of reducing licensing timeframes from 3-4 years to approximately two years.

BWXT: $1.5 Billion Defense Fuels Contract

BWX Technologies announced on Sept. 16 a $1.5 billion contract from the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration to build the Domestic Uranium Enrichment Centrifuge Experiment (DUECE) pilot plant in Tennessee. While primarily focused on U.S. defense needs, the contract supports domestic uranium enrichment capabilities that strengthen Western fuel supply chains amid efforts to eliminate Russian nuclear dependencies by 2028.

The pilot plant will demonstrate low-enriched uranium production for NNSA defense missions before being repurposed for highly enriched uranium for naval propulsion. BWXT President Rex Geveden noted: “Once operational, both facilities will enable us to scale manufacturing, so the United States maintains sovereign capability to produce vital nuclear materials for national security.”

A Big Boost for Regulatory and Policy Collaboration

The Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, signed Sept. 15, formalizes a renewed and expanded MOU between the U.S. NRC, the U.K. Office for Nuclear Regulation, and the Environment Agency of England. It builds on a collaboration that dates to 1975.

Under the refreshed agreement made public on Sept. 18, regulators will share technical reviews and mutually recognize each other’s safety assessments, and work to target reactor design approvals within 24 months and site licensing decisions within 12 months by leveraging completed work and avoiding duplication. The regulators will also coordinate fusion energy programs—employing AI-enabled simulation tools—and co-host a Global Fusion Energy Policy Summit in the United States in 2026 to deepen transatlantic cooperation.

The cooperation extends to site licensing workload sharing and fusion energy collaboration through coordinated experimental programmes combining British and American expertise with AI technology for advanced simulation tools. A Global Fusion Energy Policy Summit will be co-hosted in the United States in 2026 to strengthen international cooperation.

Broader Technology Prosperity Deal

The nuclear agreements form part of the broader UK-U.S. Tech Prosperity Deal signed Sept. 18, encompassing $42 billion in UK investments from major U.S. technology companies. The comprehensive agreement covers artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and civil nuclear energy cooperation, with Microsoft leading a $30 billion investment commitment—its largest outside the U.S..

The framework seeks to position both countries to capture AI-driven energy demand while establishing resilient supply chains for critical technologies and advanced nuclear fuels, bypassing hostile actors and improving energy security for both nations and their allies.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nuclearcoolingtowerssunset_power_web1.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 16:01:08.719526

Part 98, and suspend reporting requirements for the remainder of the program until 2034. The proposal is in response to President Donald Trump's Executive Orders (EOs) 14154, ""Unleashing American Energy,"" and 14192, ""Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,"" and a continuation of the EPA's deregulatory initiative. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""EPA Announces Deregulatory Initiative to ""Power the Great American Comeback,"" March 17, 2025.)

Since its enactment in 2009, and commencing in 2011, the GHGRP has required certain large greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources, including fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide (CO2) injection sites, to report emissions data in a standardized way. The GHGRP data has been used in a number of areas, including in legal, tax and investment evaluation. The standardized data was seen as useful for many stakeholders but has been described as burdensome and unnecessary by the current leadership at the EPA in light of the continuing mandatory information submissions already required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). In its reasons for the repeal of the significant portions of the GHGRP, the EPA also notes that the program, in its current form, exceeds the authority included in the CAA and, otherwise, the agency action lies within the discretion of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

What Is the GHGRP?

The EPA developed the GHGRP in the wake of a 2008 congressional appropriations directive (P.L. 110-161), which provided $3.5 million for the EPA to issue a rule requiring ""mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions above appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy of the United States.""

When the EPA created the GHGRP in December 2009, it relied on its information-gathering authority under Section 114 of the CAA. This provision allows the EPA to require entities to submit reports containing ""information necessary"" either 1) to develop certain types of regulations under the CAA or 2) to assess compliance with existing requirements.

The current GHGRP requires annual reporting of GHG emissions from facilities that directly emit GHGs, as well as from suppliers of fossil fuels and ""industrial GHGs"" such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). It also applies to CO2 injection sites used for enhanced oil recovery or geologic sequestration. Generally speaking, facilities must report if they emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year. Currently, more than 8,000 entities report under the GHGRP.

Although the GHGRP does not itself impose emissions limitations or other regulatory restrictions, the data collected by the regulation has been utilized in a number of data regulatory and nonregulatory ways. On notable example lies in Subpart W of the GHGRP – which governs methane emissions reporting from petroleum and natural gas systems – which was referenced in Section 136 of the CAA, enacted via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. This provision established a ""methane emissions and waste reduction incentive program,"" including a statutory ""Waste Emission Charge,"" or WEC, applicable to certain facilities. See 42 U.S.C. § 7436(c). The legal and practical status of the WEC has since become significantly complicated.1

EPA Proposal

Under the proposed rule, the EPA would eliminate GHG reporting requirements for 46 of the 47 source categories currently covered by the GHGRP, the sole exception from the proposed source categories being petroleum and natural gas systems, as set forth in Subpart W. Within Subpart W, the EPA proposes to repeal reporting requirements for the ""natural gas distribution"" segment – the only segment not referenced in Section 136 of the CAA regarding the WEC. See 42 U.S.C. § 7436(d)(1)–(9).

The other eight segments in the Subpart W source category are unique because, as the EPA states in the proposal, reporting for them ""is specifically required under CAA section 136"" for the WEC.2 For those segments, the EPA would suspend all reporting obligations until 2034 because the WEC has been postponed to 2034,3 and thus reporting ""is not needed"" until that date.4

Otherwise, for the repeal of all other GHGRP reporting requirements, the EPA offers two alternative justifications. First, the EPA proposes to conclude that CAA Section 114 does not authorize the GHGRP because the reporting requirements do not appropriately serve the CAA's rulemaking or enforcement purposes. Alternatively, the EPA proposes that if the GHGRP is permissible, the EPA Administrator has the discretionary to rescind the program if he determines that it is not necessary to implement the CAA.

Implications

This proposal is aligned with recent deregulatory actions taken by the EPA, particularly with respect to GHG emissions. (See Holland and Knight's previous alerts, ""Up in the Air: EPA Opens Comment on Repealing Endangerment Finding, Motor Vehicle GHG Rules,"" Aug. 7, 2025, and ""EPA Launches Comment Period on Power Plant Climate and Air Toxics Rules,"" June 20, 2025.). The proposal also appears to align with President Trump's EOs on the subject.

State-Level Action

While most federal GHG reporting faces potential revision or elimination, several states have established or are currently developing GHG reporting programs of their own. For example, New York has proposed a GHG reporting program with reporting obligations that would begin in June 2027.

In terms of existing programs, the California Regulation for the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (California MRR) first went into effect in 2009. The data collected through the California MRR are used in California's cap-and-trade program and made publicly available annually through the state's GHG inventory. The California MRR generally requires reporting of certain third-party-verified emissions of CO2, nitrous oxide and methane at the facility level. Entities covered by the California MRR include producers of those electricity, cement, lime or nitric acid – as well as petroleum refining and CO2 sequestration, regardless of volume of emissions. In addition, facilities in certain other industries, including fuel suppliers, CO2 suppliers, and importers and exporters of CO2, must report if their annual emissions exceed 10,000 metric tons (MT) CO2 equivalent. More recently, additional reporting requirements have been established by California Senate Bill 253 (2023).

Similarly, the state of Washington's GHGRP went into effect in 2012. The data collected through the Washington GHGRP are used in Washington's cap-and-invest program and made publicly available through the Washington State GHG Inventory. Reporting under the Washington GHGRP is at the facility level, and the program applies to facilities that emit at least 10,000 MT CO2 equivalent annually, as well as fuel suppliers that produce, import or deliver products contributing 10,000 MT CO2 equivalent per year within Washington state and power entities that import or deliver electricity with emissions equivalent to 10,000 MT CO2 equivalent annually.

If the EPA's proposal becomes final, other state and local governments may feel pressure to develop their own programs that would mimic the data gathering requirements of the GHGRP.

Climate Science

The EPA's proposed rule brings to the center stage key questions about the underlying climate science and whether the agency has clear authority to regulate what it describes as a global environmental concern. When the EPA unveiled the proposed rule, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) produced at the same time a report, ""A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,"" prepared by the Climate Working Group.

The DOE report asserted that the science behind the endangerment finding was overstated and relied on overly sensitive models. The DOE report has subsequently been criticized because of DOE's failure to convene the Climate Working Group pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. chapter 10. Studies conducted pursuant to FACA are subject to requirements of transparency, membership balance and open meetings. EPA has also asserted that there is no clear congressional authorization for it to regulate GHG, thereby raising the major questions doctrine. EPA also contends that GHG only impact public health and welfare indirectly.

Greenwashing

The proposed elimination of most GHGRP requirements could complicate the growing field of ""greenwashing"" litigation, in which companies are accused of misleading consumers with environmental marketing claims. If the EPA proposal becomes final in its current form, companies defending their environmental record could face a mixed result. On the one hand, where corporate marketing claims align with a company's reported data under a standardized federal program, the company can point to such alignment in defense of the reasonableness of its claims. On the other hand, standardized public reporting requirements rely on simplified assumptions that may not reflect more nuanced methodologies that companies use when formulating voluntary claims.

Tax

The EPA proposal acknowledges that the GHGRP is somewhat intertwined with several energy tax credits For example, the carbon capture and storage (CCS) tax credit under Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q requires ""secure geological storage"" of CO2 (other than for utilization) to be eligible for the credit. Section 45Q statutorily directs the Treasury Secretary to establish regulations for determining adequate security measures, in consultation with the EPA Ad ministrator, among others. Current Treasury Department and IRS regulations effectuate that rulemaking by cross-referencing, for secure geological storage, EPA's 40 CFR Part 98 subpart RR and other parts of the Section 45Q regulations and direct taxpayers to consider, for utilization, Table A-1 of subpart A. The EPA's proposal recognizes that the Treasury Department and IRS ""may need to revise"" their regulations if the GHGRP is rescinded.

Impact Investing Metrics

If the EPA finalizes the proposed rule, investors that utilize GHGRP emissions data to assess an entity's climate risk, progress toward net-zero goals and other environmental-related investment considerations will need to identify or develop alternative emission data, including attempting to require companies to self report emission data in a standardized manner. If finalized, the proposed rule may produce opportunities for third-party verifying companies to develop voluntary programs that replicate the GHGRP and could serve as a substitute source of data for impact investment purposes.

Conclusion

The EPA's proposed rescission of the GHGRP would serve as a significant deregulatory action. Stakeholders and parties impacted by the proposed rule should participate in the public comment process, which closes on Nov. 3, 2025. For guidance and assistance with engaging in the public comment process, please contact the authors.

Notes

1 In November 2024, the EPA finalized a rule implementing the WEC. However, in March 2025, Congress passed and President Trump signed a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), invalidating the EPA's WEC rule. As a result, the rule no longer has any legal effect, and the EPA formally removed the WEC regulations from the books in May 2025. Importantly, the CRA prohibits the EPA from issuing a new rule that is ""substantially the same"" unless specifically authorized by Congress. While the statutory requirement for the WEC remains in place, the absence of an implementing rule has effectively stalled its enforcement. Further complicating the legal status, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025, postponed the effective date of the WEC until 2034. (See Holland & Knight previous alert, ""Senate GOP Passes Sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" July 1, 2025.)

The Justice Dept. is siding with Enbridge's contentions that Michigan's attempts to revoke its Line 5 easement interfere with federal regulation of pipelines, and U.S.-Canadian treaties.

President Donald Trump's Justice Department has intervened — and taken the side of Canadian oil and gas transport giant Enbridge — in Enbridge's federal lawsuit attempting to stop Gov. Gretchen Whitmer from revoking the company's 72-year-old easement to operate the Line 5 underwater oil and gas pipelines on the Straits of Mackinac lake bottom.

The U.S. Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division and Civil Division announced its filing of a ""statement of interest"" in a lawsuit filed by Enbridge against Whitmer and Michigan Department of Natural Resources Director Scott Bowen in U.S. District Court in Lansing.

The Justice Department is agreeing with Enbridge's assertion in the suit that the Michigan action improperly attempts to override federal authority on interstate pipeline regulation, and federal foreign affairs authority as the pipeline from Alberta, Canada, is subject to U.S.-Canadian treaties.

""The federal government already comprehensively regulates pipeline safety, but Michigan is trying to usurp the Department of Transportation's statutory authority,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement.

""President Trump has made clear that the United States will not tolerate state overreach that interferes with American energy dominance.""

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's Office did not immediately respond to a Free Press request for comment.

Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes, in an emailed statement to the Free Press, noted the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty between the United States and Canada ""expressly prevents public authorities such as the State of Michigan and courts from unilaterally shutting down the pipeline.""

""We will continue to protect and defend Line 5's continued operations consistent with federal law, interstate commerce, and international treaty agreements, all of which recognize the critical role Line 5 plays in providing for the region's energy needs and its economic strength,"" he said.

Built in 1953, Enbridge's Line 5 moves 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids per day east through the Upper Peninsula, splitting into twin underwater pipelines on the Straits of Mackinac bottom, before returning to a single transmission pipeline through the Lower Peninsula that runs south to Sarnia, Ontario. Many have expressed concern about the aging pipes over several years, as anchor strikes, missing pipeline supports and loss of protective pipeline coating have been discovered.

A 30-inch oil transmission line also owned by Enbridge ruptured in July 2010 in Marshall, spilling more than 1.1 million gallons of oil, fouling 38 miles of the Kalamazoo River and prompting a cleanup that took four years and more than $1 billion. Many fear a similar pipeline mishap on the Straits bottom, where Great Lakes Michigan and Huron meet, would be greatly more devastating.

Whitmer in November 2020 announced her intention to revoke Enbridge's 1953 easement with the state to use state-controlled Great Lakes bottomlands for the Straits pipeline. Whitmer's office at the time cited Enbridge's ""persistent and incurable violations of the easement’s terms and conditions"" related to safety and maintenance.

""Enbridge has routinely refused to take action to protect our Great Lakes and the millions of Americans who depend on them for clean drinking water and good jobs,"" Whitmer said at the time. ""They have repeatedly violated the terms of the 1953 easement by ignoring structural problems that put our Great Lakes and our families at risk.""

Enbridge officials have countered that the Line 5 pipeline in the Straits has always remained safe and cite recurring inspections by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, affirming its contention.

In its filing, the Justice Department notes that the federal government took ""decisive action"" in three environmental events described in Whitmer's notice to revoke the Enbridge easement, including an April 2018 anchor strike that dented the outer Straits pipelines and the discovery of significant damage to a pipeline support in June 2020. Following the 2018 anchor strike, Congress amended federal pipeline safety laws, and PHMSA issued an interim final rule to protect the Great Lakes and connecting waters, the Justice Department's filing states.

""By revisiting these same incidents to impose different standards and different results, Michigan is not only thwarting Congressional intent to promote a nationally uniform safety program but also is creating an unworkable patchwork of state standards for interim pipelines,"" the Justice Department states in its court filing.

The Justice Department filing also declares the Michigan action infringes upon ""significant interests of the United States in its conduct of foreign affairs,"" adding the United States has a significant interest in an ""affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy"" that the state easement revocation attempt threatens.

Enbridge proposes to build a 21-foot diameter, 3.6-mile tunnel underneath the bed of the Straits of Mackinac to house a new, 30-inch diameter pipeline to move the oil and natural gas liquids. The tunnel pipeline would replace the twin pipes currently on the Straits bottom.

Michigan Supreme Court allows tribes to appeal MPSC approval of Line 5 tunnel

In other litigation related to Line 5, on Friday, Sept. 19, the Michigan Supreme Court granted an appeal by multiple Michigan Native American tribes and nonprofit environmental groups to challenge the Michigan Public Service Commission's approval of the Line 5 tunnel.

The Supreme Court is allowing a review of whether the state Court of Appeals erred in providing weight to earlier lower court rulings rather than considering on its own whether the proposed tunnel ""will pollute, impair, or destroy the air, water or state's other natural resources or the public trust in these resources."" The high court will also consider whether the MPSC should have excluded ""evidence of the history and risk of oil spills along the entire length of Line 5"" as it approved the tunnel.

“The tunnel project and the dual pipelines are just two versions of one terrible idea that threatens to destroy our clean water, our fishing, and our way of life for the sake of Canadian profits,” said Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle. “Our choice is not between the dual pipelines and the tunnel. Our choice is between an oil spill in the Great Lakes and a clean water future for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. We simply want government officials to consider the safest, cheapest, and most commonsense alternative: Decommission Line 5.”

Barnes said a tunnel allowing for a new oil and gas pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac ""makes what has always been a safe pipeline even safer.""",https://www.farmersadvance.com/gcdn/-mm-/ffe4c3275209be170f944325a37d76e2699a896f/c=4-0-1262-711/local/-/media/2017/06/01/DetroitFreeP/DetroitFreePress/636319240447936425-Enbridge-Line-5-Straits-of-Mackinac-underwater.png?width=1258&height=711&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,N,,2025-09-24 16:01:48.109105

SACRAMENTO — Today, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that there are now 201,180 fully public and shared electric vehicle (EV) charging ports. This is 68% more EV charger ports than the number of gasoline nozzles statewide, according to the California Energy Commission (CEC).

California’s growing number of publicly available EV chargers can be found at locations that are fully publicly accessible, like grocery stores, park and ride lots, and even gas stations, whereas shared chargers can be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas that may have some level of restricted access. This statewide network of public and shared chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in single-family homes.

“With this expanding public network, EV chargers are becoming ubiquitous in California,” said CEC Commissioner Nancy Skinner. “Our goal is to make driving an EV a no-brainer choice for Californians. They are fun to drive, never need an oil change, don’t cause smog, and it’s getting easier to charge your vehicle with public EV infrastructure.”

It has never been a better time to buy and drive an EV in California. Federal incentives of up to $7,500 are still available through the end of September, and thanks to the state’s ever-expanding charger network, 94% of Californians live within 10 minutes of an EV charger.

The majority of California’s public chargers are Level 2, which will provide 25-35 miles of range in about an hour of charging. A growing number are direct current fast chargers (DCFC), which charge EVs much faster, providing almost a full charge in 15 to 45 minutes. Since the CEC’s last count, DCFC public and shared charging ports are up 14% and Level 2 charging ports are up 25%.

FEDERAL ZEV INCENTIVES END SEPTEMBER 30

With federal incentives ending on Sept. 30, 2025, the time to buy a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) is now. Tax credits up to $7,500(link is external) are available for purchase or lease of eligible new ZEVs, which include EVs and hydrogen-fueled vehicles, and up to $4,000 for eligible used ones. Federal incentives for at-home charging and associated battery storage are also available, up to $1,000. Find the right vehicle for you at ElectricForAll.org(link is external).

CALIFORNIA IS CHARGING AHEAD

Each day, more chargers come online in the Golden State, improving the driving experience for EV drivers.

California state agencies are working hard to speed up EV charger installation and plan for increasing grid demand. This includes:

Providing grant funds that support publicly accessible, workplace and at-home EV charging installations, including in multi-family complexes.

Prioritizing shovel-ready DCFC charging installations for the funding incentives available through the CEC’s grant solicitation programs.

Developing the ZEV Infrastructure Plan, which provides critical guidance for meeting California’s zero-emission transportation goals.

Establishing EV charger reliability standards.

State agencies recently published a report(link is external) in response to Governor Gavin Newsom’s executive order reaffirming the state’s commitment to ZEV adoption. While the federal government is running away from ZEVs, California is charging ahead in the fight for clean air for all.

California is tearing down barriers to ZEV adoption and providing financial and other assistance to speed up EV charger deployment, including in low-income areas and rural communities.

MAKING PROGRESS IN THE MEDIUM- AND HEAVY-DUTY SECTOR

The CEC also announced today that there are 20,093 charging and hydrogen fueling points for medium- and heavy-duty (MDHD) zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) vehicles across the state. This is an increase of 3,766 (23%) since the last update in February 2025.

While trucks total just six percent of vehicles on California’s roads, they account for over 35 percent of the state’s transportation emissions and a quarter of the state’s on-road greenhouse gases. Investments in MDHD ZEV stations and infrastructure will result in cleaner air and fewer cases of asthma near major transportation corridors.

The study, published in Cell Reports Sustainability on Sept. 16, indicates that reinforcing the nation’s power grid to handle increased electricity demand could cost between $350 billion and $800 billion nationwide. This would translate to several thousand dollars per household.

Kevin Kircher, a mechanical engineering professor at Purdue and a faculty member of the university’s Ray W. Herrick Laboratories, discussed the challenges and potential solutions during an interview aired on Tuesday night’s “UnPHILtered” with Phil Sanchez on News 8 at 11 p.m. Kircher highlighted the need for efficient equipment and coordinated device operation to reduce costs.

Kircher said that the U.S. electricity grid has become cleaner over the past 10 to 15 years with the adoption of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. This cleaner electricity, combined with competitive electric machines such as vehicles and heat pumps, supports the “electrify everything” movement. The movement aims to replace fossil-fueled equipment with electric alternatives, offering benefits for public health, air quality, and climate change. However, the transition poses significant challenges for the power grid.

Kircher said rebuilding the grid to accommodate increased demand could be costly, but alternatives exist. Those include deploying more efficient equipment, improving home insulation, and coordinating the operation of electric devices.

NEW YORK (AP) — Some countries’ leaders are watching rising seas threaten to swallow their homes. Others are watching their citizens die in floods, hurricanes and heat waves, all exacerbated by climate change.

But the world U.S. President Donald Trump described in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday didn’t match the one many world leaders in the audience are contending with. Nor did it align with what scientists have long been observing.

“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump said. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”

Trump has long been a critic of climate science and polices aimed at helping the world transition to green energies like wind and solar. His speech Tuesday, however, was one of his most expansive to date. It included false statements and making connections between things that are not connected.

Ilana Seid, an ambassador from the island nation of Palau and head of the organization of small island states, was in the audience. She said it’s what they’ve come to expect from Trump and the United States. She added that not acting on climate change will “be a betrayal of the most vulnerable,” a sentiment echoed by Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi, who said that “we are endangering the lives of innocent people in the world.”

For Adelle Thomas, a climate scientist who has published more than 40 studies and has a doctorate, climate change disasters are personal, too. A vice chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s top body on climate science, Thomas is from the Bahamas and said she experienced firsthand “the devastation of the climate disaster” when Hurricane Sandy hit the Caribbean and New York City, the city Trump was speaking from, in 2012.

“Millions of people around the world can already testify to the devastation that climate change has brought to their lives,” she said. ‘The evidence is not abstract. It is lived, it is deadly, and it demands urgent action.”

A look at some of Trump’s statements Tuesday, the science behind them and the reaction.

On renewable energy

WHAT HE SAID: Trump called renewable sources of energy like wind power a “joke” and “pathetic,” falsely claiming they don’t work, are too expensive and too weak.

THE BACKSTORY: Solar and wind are now “almost always” the least expensive and the fastest options for new electricity generation, according to a July report from the United Nations. That report also said the world has passed a “positive tipping point” where those energy sources will only continue to become more widespread.

The three cheapest electricity sources globally last year were onshore wind, solar panels and new hydropower, according to an energy cost report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Subsidies endorsed by Trump and the Republican party are artificially keeping fossil fuels viable, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann. “If one were truly in favor of the ‘free market’ to determine this, then fossil fuels would be disappearing even faster,” he wrote in an email.

Relatedly, Trump falsely claimed European electricity bills are now “two to three times higher than the United States, and our bills are coming way down.” But in fact retail electricity prices in the United States have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The agency expects prices to continue increasing through 2026.

On the international politics of climate, the UN and the Paris Accord

WHAT HE SAID: Trump blasted the U.N.’s climate efforts, saying he withdrew America from the “fake” Paris climate accord because “America was paying so much more than every country, others weren’t paying.”

THE BACKSTORY: The Paris Agreement, decided by international consensus in 2015, is a voluntary but binding document in which each country is asked to set its own national goal to curb planet-warming emissions and decide how much money it will contribute to the countries that will be hit hardest by climate change.

Because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for more than a century, the United States has put out more of the heat trapping gas than any other nation, even though China now is the No. 1 carbon polluter. Since 1850, the U.S. has contributed 24% of the human-caused carbon dioxide that’s in the air, according to Global Carbon Project data. The entire continent of Africa, with four times the population of the U.S., is responsible for about 3%.

On coal being referred to as clean

WHAT HE SAID: “I have a little standing order in the White House. Never use the word ‘coal.’ Only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal.’ Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”

THE BACKSTORY: Coal kills millions of people a year. “The president can pretend coal is clean, but real people — mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters— will die for this lie,’’ said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson..

Trump also called the carbon footprint “a hoax made up by people with evil intentions,” a contention that Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler agreed with. Dessler said the term was coined by oiil companies and may have been designed to shift the responsibility for combatting climate change away from corporations to individuals.

The science of climate change started 169 years ago when Eunice Foote did simple experiments with flasks and sunlight showing that carbon dioxide trapped more heat than the regular atmosphere. It’s an experiment that can be repeated at home and has been done in labs hundreds of times and in greenhouses around the world every day. It is basic physics and chemistry with a long history.

“It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,” reported the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is hundreds of scientists, with doctorates in the field.

In 2018, Trump’s own government said: “The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future.”

On cows and methane

WHAT HE SAID: In “the United States, we have still radicalized environmentalists and they want the factories to stop. Everything should stop. No more cows. We don’t want cows anymore.”

THE BACKSTORY: Cows belch methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Around the world, cattle are often raised on lands where forests have cut down. Since forests capture carbon dioxide, cutting them to raise cattle results in a doublt whammy. Still, no one is suggesting that cows be gotten rid of, said Nusa Urbancic, CEO of the Changing Markets Foundation.

“This polarizing and divisive language misrepresents the environmental message,” Urbancic wrote. “What is true, however, is that cutting methane emissions is a quick win to slow global heating and meet climate targets.”

Trump also blamed dirty air blowing in from afar, floating garbage in the ocean coming from other countries and “radicalized environmentalists.”

Although the United States does indeed now have cleaner air than it has in decades, the pollution seeping into communities is primarily caused by local dirty energy and industry projects, not by other countries. And many experts have said the biggest blow to local air and water quality is the Trump administration’s own wide-ranging rollbacks to the power of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other bedrock environmental laws.

“It is sad to see marine debris, a globally important issue, being misrepresented so completely,” said Lucy Woodall, an associate professor of marine conservation and policy at the University of Exeter.

In Louisiana, the results for the past year may see further grade deductions into the future.

The Sierra Club’s “Dirty Truth Report” evaluates utilities’ plans to deliver cheap, clean energy to customers and gives them a grade based on their investment in renewable energy and commitment to retire fossil fuel-generated electricity by 2035.

Cleco and Entergy are among the 75 utilities featured in the Sierra Club evaluation, which gave the entire industry an F – its lowest grade since it began issuing report cards in 2021.

Holly Bender, the Sierra Club’s chief program officer, said in a news release it was “alarming” to see utilities move backward in their transitions to clean energy transition.

But in contrast to the national trend, New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. earned a C average. It comes after a B last year and an F in 2023. Cleco, headquartered in Pineville, received a B grade for 2025 after four straight years of Ds.

The Sierra Club’s review included grades for utility affiliates.

Entergy New Orleans improved from a B to an A with more investment in renewable energy, who Entergy Louisiana, which fell from a B to a C, lost points for its “over-reliance on gas” and “fewer investments in renewable energy,” according to the report.

The Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group, thinks utilities should emphasize more renewable energy generation, with a focus on community solar projects in particular.

The Sierra report analyzed documents up until a cutoff date of July 1. Alaina DiLaura, the alliance’s policy coordinator, said recent updates to utilities’ ongoing reliance on fossil fuels may make the results more pronounced into the future.

For example, Cleco’s filings with the Louisiana Public Service Commission show plans to transition a coal-burning power plant to natural gas, an aspect of continued fossil fuel use she said the Sierra Club report doesn’t fully consider, as it was filed after July 1.

Despite originally planning to retire its coal-powered Rodemacher Unit 2 power plant in Rapides Parish, Cleco submitted plans Sept. 5 to the Louisiana Public Service Commission to keep it running using natural gas, DiLaura said, which could impact clean energy report scores in the future.

Cleco is also looking to use natural gas at its largest power plant, Madison 3, alongside the petroleum coke (a crude oil refining byproduct) it currently runs on. The utility has informed state regulators it will add “700 megawatts of new gas generation,” DiLaura said, citing its latest filings.

Entergy Louisiana will add 2,200 megawatts of generation capacity – a 20% increase of its statewide output – once it builds three natural gas-powered plants to run the massive Meta data center under construction in Richland Parish.

Entergy New Orleans’ grade improvement may also take a hit, DiLaura said, because its latest plans involve expanding its use of natural gas, which means the utility won’t meet its 2035 goal of net zero carbon emissions.

Entergy New Orleans spokesman Beau Tidwell said that even though it intends to use more natural gas, the company will “remain committed to transparent disclosure about our progress and any challenges we might encounter.”

The Mayor of the West of England and council leaders were joined by business leaders and government ministers at the Bristol Digital Futures Institute to together make the case for more investment in our part of the world. A new investment prospectus includes Mass Transit to help get the West moving and the UK’s first AI Supercluster centred on Isambard-AI, the country’s fastest supercomputer, and sets out their scale of ambition, targeting 28% economic growth over next ten years.

Alongside this cutting-edge technology, the Mayor has highlighted the continued importance of our everyday economy, which provides 57% of jobs across the region including in health and education, hospitality and logistics, and keeps the West running. The Growth Strategy also confirms new work to tackle child poverty, deliver more affordable and accessible childcare, and generate another 135 megawatts of clean energy.

As the combined authority works ever closer with our North Somerset neighbours, the Growth Strategy sets out a future bold for business. With a growing population of more than 1.2 million people and a growing economy already worth £53.7 billion, the West has delivered 21% economic growth over the last decade – a major contribution to the British economy and above the national rate. The Growth Strategy sets out an ambition for a new £500 million West of England Land Acquisition Fund to tackle the housing crisis and ensure high-quality development with the infrastructure that local people and businesses need.

The 120-page strategy highlights sectors with the strongest job growth in the West during the last decade. In that time, the everyday economy (+17%), digital and tech (+52%), creative industries (+82%), and clean energy (+140%) here saw the highest job growth of any region in the country – including London. Planning ahead for the next ten years, major growth zones identified include the West Innovation Arc, Central Bristol and Bath, the Severn Estuary, the Somer Valley, and North Somerset Growth Gateway.

Airbus, Bath Fashion Museum, Boomsatsuma, Step and Stone, and YTL were among those showcasing what they bring to the region.

Helen Godwin, Mayor of the West of England, said:

“The future starts here. Every pound invested into the West of England delivers a real return.

“Our new Growth Strategy is about securing investment for our part of the world to make a difference that we can all can see and feel, including new jobs for local people and better transport to cut congestion and boost productivity.

“Growth must not be an intangible economic concept. It is about all of us – it is about our whole region working together for a brighter future in this new chapter for the West.”

Councillor Kevin Guy, Leader of Bath & North East Somerset (B&NES) Council and Deputy Mayor of the West of England, said:

“I warmly welcome this ambitious ten-year growth strategy which seizes on the amazing opportunities we have here in the West of England. I am personally very pleased to see our ambitious plans for Fashion Museum Bath recognised as a lever to secure investment, jobs and to boost the continued growth of the tourism and culture sectors in our region. We also have strategic plans to attract new commercial and employment opportunities within the Bath Riverside Innovation Quarter, and in the Somer Valley, which would see development-ready sites within a Somer Valley Enterprise Zone.”

Councillor Tony Dyer, Leader of Bristol City Council said:

“Spanning our entire city from its centre to the suburbs, Bristol’s strengths in creative industries, clean energy, and innovation make us a driving force in the region’s economy - attracting people and investment. By working together across the West, this strategy will help us deliver homes, jobs and opportunities for all our communities.""

Councillor Mike Bell, Leader of North Somerset Council, said:

“This strategy is about delivering real change for North Somerset. More chances for young people to build their careers, better transport for families, affordable homes in thriving neighbourhoods, and cleaner energy for the future. It’s about making sure every community share in the benefits of growth and helps to shape a brighter future for the West of England. It is an ambitious and credible pitch for government support and private sector investment that stakes our claim as the place where communities together make things happen.”

Councillor Maggie Tyrrell, Leader of South Gloucestershire Council, said:

“The new Regional Growth Strategy is an ambitious document, which clearly sets out the opportunities for the region, including for South Gloucestershire. The strategy makes it clear that South Gloucestershire stands out as a nationally significant growth opportunity, with an economy that has consistently outpaced the national average in terms of employment and productivity.

“Crucially, we also welcome that the Strategy says plainly that whilst productivity growth is important, economic growth just for the sake of it would be a missed opportunity. We need to make sure the benefits of prosperity are felt by everyone, through more and better jobs for our residents; new education and skills opportunities; new and better homes in accessible locations; and transport network that meets their needs and those of businesses to travel across the region and connect to the rest of the country and world beyond. The Regional Growth Strategy begins to address these challenges.

“Finally, we welcome the way in which the Strategy was developed collaboratively by our teams, and we look forward to continuing this collaboration as we develop the implementation plans that will help realise our shared ambition.”

Professor Evelyn Welch, Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of Bristol, which hosts the Bristol Digital Futures Institute, said:

“I welcome this ambitious Regional Growth Strategy, particularly its vision for the UK’s first AI Supercluster, centred on Isambard-AI—the nation’s most powerful and sustainable supercomputer. The University of Bristol is proud to collaborate closely with our regional partners as a driving force for growth in digital, tech, creative, and clean energy sectors. Our Temple Quarter Enterprise Campus, at the heart of the regeneration of Temple Quarter, exemplifies our commitment to powering innovation, attracting investment, and serving as a dynamic hub for talent, skills, and partnerships to drive our region’s economic future.”

Robert Campbell, Head of Culture and Heritage at B&NES, said:

“On behalf of Bath and North East Somerset Council’s Fashion Museum Bath, I’m pleased to express our strong support for the West of England Combined Authority’s Local Growth Plan. We welcome its recognition of the transformative role that cultural investment plays in driving regional growth. This plan marks a vital step forward in our region’s economic development and, we believe, will deliver substantial and lasting benefits to our communities.”

Today’s publication follows the Mayor and leaders’ pledge in the last fortnight to embed nature in the Growth Strategy, a move backed by the CEOs of Triodos Bank UK and national charity Wildlife and Countryside Link. As the home of the Western Forest, the UK’s first new national forest in three decades, and so much more, the West’s outstanding natural beauty is recognised as a unique selling point in a competitive national and global economy.

It also comes hot on the heels of new research from the Brunel Centre, showing the strength of economic growth across the region. The academics’ paper studied how productivity in the West of England, which has seen the strongest recent growth of any region in the country (+3%, latest figures: 2023), stacks up against London boroughs.

The Growth Strategy builds too on the recent news that the regional authority has invested in Visit West to support the continued growth of the tourism sector, which contributes around £2.5 billion each year to the West’s economy, employs around 45,000 people, and brings 32 million annual visitors to the region.

“The more people have gotten into so-called climate action, the more expensive their energy has become,” Wright said. “That lowers people’s quality of lives and reduces their life opportunities.”

The Trump administration aims to end “cancel culture”, Wright said, wherein “you can’t say anything about climate change” without being “shouted down”. He also defended a widely criticized energy department report which experts say was full of climate misinformation, claiming it only contained one figure that was out of line with a recent National Academies report on climate science.

Asked about concerns that the administration’s widespread attacks on climate policy, Wright said climate action had not delivered.

“We’ve had 30 years, more than 30 years, since the Kyoto protocol,” he said “We haven’t even changed the trajectory of global greenhouse-gas emissions.”

However, since the adoption of the Paris agreement, the projected rise in global warming has been dramatically reduced, from over four degrees celsius of temperature rise expected by the century’s end, to 2.6C if nation’s climate action plans are fully implemented, according to the UN secretary general.

Wright also announced plans to return $13bn in Biden-era funding for green projects, which his department said were “initially appropriated to advance the previous administration’s wasteful Green New Scam agenda”. He did not clarify which green projects would be targeted.

Questioned about his administration’s attempts to halt wind-farm construction, including ones that are already permitted, Wright said the administration is merely investigating widespread concerns about the projects’ impacts, including on whale populations. Scientists say there is no credible evidence that wind turbines pose a major danger to whales.

Asked if future presidencies should be able to launch similar attacks on already permitted fossil-fuel projects, he said they do, citing Biden’s revocation of a permit for the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline.

The president has pledged to slash electricity bills by half. Yet grid operators have said the Trump administration’s efforts to halt renewable energy while keeping costly coal plants online have forced them to increase utility bills. Wright dodged a question about those rising costs, claiming Biden’s efforts to close coal plants raised the price of electricity.

Asked if he plans to go to, Cop30, the United Nations climate talks in Brazil, in November, Wright said no.

Today, the Connecticut Congressional delegation sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin urging him to withdraw his proposal rescinding the 2009 endangerment finding that determined greenhouse gas emissions pose a serious risk to Americans’ health and well-being.

…

In late July, the EPA announced a proposal to rescind the landmark endangerment finding — a 2009 rule that found greenhouse gases and air pollution cause harm to human health and our climate. The finding allows the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The 2009 finding is widely accepted science and is a key tool for reducing pollution.

The delegation’s letter reads:

We write to express our profound concern over the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to reconsider the 2009 endangerment finding and demand that you withdraw the proposed rule immediately. Dismantling the life-saving determination will have dire long-term consequences for the people of Connecticut and our nation, especially our children and grandchildren.

The EPA’s endangerment finding is the agency’s scientifically-backed determination that greenhouse gas emissions pose a risk to peoples’ health and wellbeing.1 Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, this determination requires the EPA to regulate these emissions to protect people from the dangerous impacts.2 The endangerment finding underpins longstanding, commonsense measures the EPA has enacted to address climate change. Rescinding the agency’s determination does nothing to change the fact that climate change harms human health, and this action will put lives at risk.

Climate change is a significant threat to Connecticut, and our residents are already feeling its effects in the forms of sea level rise and extreme weather…Over the last 15 years, Connecticut has been impacted by 24 ‘billion-dollar’ disasters. In the absence of an endangerment finding that allows EPA to take commonsense steps to protect against climate change, disasters like those we have experienced in Connecticut will only continue to grow in scope and severity.

Washington, D.C., September 18, 2025 — Murphy, Bicameral Group of Democrats Announce Plans to Introduce Legislation to Protect Free Speech, Safeguard Against Politically Motivated Harassment and Prosecutions

U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and U.S. Representative Jason Crow (D-Colo.-6) on Thursday joined Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Representatives Greg Casar (D-Texas-35), Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.-06), and Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.-10) at a press conference to announce their intent to introduce the No Political Enemies (NOPE) Act, legislation to protect individuals and organizations, including non-profits, faith groups, media outlets, and educational institutions, from politically motivated harassment and prosecution by the federal government.

This bill would reaffirm the constitutionally protected right to free speech and establish clear and enforceable protections to deter abuse, empower individuals and organizations to defend themselves, and create meaningful accountability. The legislation would also prohibit the use of federal funds for any investigations or regulatory action that would suppress protected speech. The announcement follows threats from President Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and White House Senior Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller to use the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk as justification to weaponize the federal government to go after left-leaning individuals and organizations that don’t align with Trump’s political agenda.

‘Since taking office, President Trump has engaged in a relentless campaign to silence dissent in this country. Targeting Democratic elected officials for prosecution, violating appropriations law to browbeat colleges and universities, and restricting access for journalists was just the start of this broad effort to weaponize the federal government to consolidate power and go after his perceived political enemies. Now, the president and the loyalists he’s installed at DOJ and the FBI have announced plans to exploit the horrific death of Charlie Kirk and use it as a pretext to intimidate and destroy any political opposition to Trump – it’s a page taken right out of the totalitarian playbook. This White House has proven time and time again that it’s willing to trample on the rights of Americans in service of Donald Trump’s agenda and Congress has an obligation to protect the American people and our democracy,’ said Murphy.

‘Charlie Kirk’s murder was horrific. Everyone, regardless of party, must unequivocally condemn political violence,’ said Crow. ‘Past presidents have used these tragic moments to unite the nation. President Trump has instead used this moment to squash political dissent, attack basic rights, and seize power. We must speak out and fight back to protect our democracy.’

‘The United States of America was built on the right to free speech – the right to organize and advocate, to petition your government, no matter your views. But it is simply abhorrent that this administration plans to use the death of Charlie Kirk as a predicate to supercharge their long-standing campaign against their perceived political opponents,’ said Leader Schumer. ‘This isn’t a new campaign – they have long been engaged in an ever-escalating campaign to use the mighty power of the federal government to attack civil society. We Democrats won’t stand for it – we are going to fight it in the courts, we are going to fight it in the court of public opinion, and we are going to fight these attacks in Congress.’

‘The Trump administration’s blatant disregard for our Constitution is eroding the bedrock values upon which our country is built. Congress must act to stop this Administration’s assault on people and organizations simply because they don’t agree with their point of view,’ said Booker. ‘This legislation offers a clear roadmap to protect non-profits, faith groups, media outlets, educational institutions, and others from politically motivated harassment and prosecution by the federal government. This isn’t about whether you are on the Right or the Left—every person and every organization has a right to free speech and to express their views without harassment or persecution. We cannot sit by and watch Trump desecrate the Constitution and undermine our fundamental right to free speech, even if the views expressed are unpopular, controversial, or simply disliked by him.’

‘The Trump Administration is attacking free speech – threatening anyone who dares to speak out against them. This politically motivated weaponization of government clearly defies the First Amendment and demands action from the Congress. This legislation will help provide additional safeguards to protect Americans’ free speech rights from a lawless administration,’ said Van Hollen.

‘The President and his Administration have shredded the fundamental principle that in America, we don’t punish our political opponents — we protect free speech,’ said Padilla. ‘History teaches us that when leaders try to silence entertainers or journalists like Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert simply for questioning their authority or disagreeing with them, it’s not a show of strength, it’s a sign of weakness. No matter how much this Administration tries to silence me or countless others for speaking our minds, we will not stay quiet. The NOPE Act will make critical reforms to help protect the right to free speech for all Americans.’

‘We are at a moment where we must spell out clearly that there will be costs when the people and organizations of our civil society are denied their right to do what they want, and say what they think within the bound of our laws and due process,’ said Smith. ‘This legislation is about upholding the most American of values: that in this country our speech, our words, our principles are protected.’

‘President Trump is abusing the vast powers of the federal government to shut down people who dare disagree with him,’ said Casar. ‘What’s at stake in this moment is the ability of the American people to speak out against the billionaire takeover of our government and be heard.’

‘The Constitution is not a buffet line where you take what you like and ignore the rest. The Constitution is absolute, and it is binding,’ said Houlahan. ‘We did not use the tragic murders of Melissa and Mark Hoffman to rip apart the Second Amendment in June, and we cannot use the murder of Charlie Kirk to rip apart the First Amendment in September. If we continue to smash the foundation of our democracy for short-term political gain, there will be nothing left for us to stand upon.’

‘The Trump Administration is trying to scare those that disagree with him into silence and attacking the most fundamental freedoms that we have as Americans: the freedom to speak out, to dissent, and to criticize our government without fear,’ said Frost. ‘The NOPE Act is about strengthening the laws that protect the people from any and all administrations that fear the truth and fear democracy.’

The NOPE Act would prevent the targeting of individuals or organizations on the basis of their constitutionally protected speech, beliefs, and political participation by:

Reaffirming our Constitution and laws prohibit the president from weaponizing government against people who disagree with the administration. Uphold foundational constitutional principles that protect free speech and political participation. The DOJ, FBI, IRS, and other government agencies cannot be used to silence or target people for criticizing the government with constitutionally protected speech.

Deterring government officials from abusing their power to silence or retaliate against critics. Deter misconduct by making clear there are consequences for violating federal civil rights laws and that federal officials can be held accountable for abuses.

Providing tools for those wrongly targeted to defend themselves in court, including meaningful access to evidence, correcting the imbalance of proof, having the legal costs to defend themselves covered, and allowing courts to quickly dismiss abusive actions.

Providing due process for any U.S. nonprofits the government attempts to label as criminal or terrorist organizations.

Improving transparency and accountability for federal agencies that seek to silence critics. Create mechanisms for improved reporting and accountability for government agencies so that officials who commit misconduct by abusing their power to censor or retaliate against critics can be held accountable.

Washington D.C., September 19, 2025 — Congressman Jason Crow’s (CO- 06)Floor Speech on the Concerning State of US Politics & the Path Forward to Unite Our Country

Almost seven years ago, I came to Congress to serve my community, my state, my fellow veterans, and the country I love – in a different way than I served it on the battlefield. When I put the uniform on as a teenager, I swore an oath to the Constitution. I stand here today to uphold that oath.

I came here to represent a state that has been wracked with trauma: Columbine, Aurora Theater, Club Q, Boulder, and most recently Evergreen High.

I came here because like so many of my fellow veterans I harbor deep resentment for our wars that cost thousands of lives, trillions of dollars, and decades of lost opportunity.

I came here because the American working class has been gutted, left behind, and excluded from the American dream while the elites grow wealthier than ever.

I came to Congress assuming that, together with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, we could solve these problems together. And we could have open and safe debates in a free society.

…

There is courage everywhere we look. We have not yet lost our power.

So many Americans have been sounding the alarm bell for a long time, and they have been right.

We have now reached the inflection point. Now is the time to stand firm. And for us to stand with them. And for us to stand with all those defending democracy. …",https://berkshireedge-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1-21.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 16:01:28.772848

EV sales have been growing steadily over the years, and at a faster pace compared to traditional gas-powered cars. However, the sales have begun to slow down in the U.S. earlier this year, rising only 1.5% over the first six months of the year and actually falling 6.3% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.

With the tax credits expiring, more attractive offers are likely to be on the way, according to Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds. “If you already can’t sell the vehicles at current prices, there’s no way you are going to sell them at today’s prices with this credit going by the wayside,” he said.

Dive Brief:

Investments in residential heat pumps, batteries and solar arrays could meet 100% of projected electricity demand growth from AI data centers through 2029, according to a report from the pro-electrification nonprofit Rewiring America.

The large tech and infrastructure companies behind the U.S. AI boom could unlock more than 93 GW of grid capacity at costs comparable to building a new fleet of gas power plants by paying 50% of the cost of heat pump upgrades and 30% of the cost of onsite solar and storage, Rewiring America said Thursday.

“Hyperscalers are already thinking creatively about how to meet their growing power needs, and this report presents a solution that brings households into the conversation,” Rewiring America CEO Ari Matusiak said in an email.

Dive Insight:

U.S. utilities requested about $29 billion in rate increases in the first half of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for pro-consumer regulatory reform.

The sharp rise in rate hike requests and in already-approved rate increases show that “the status quo isn’t working for households,” Matusiak said. “There’s a way to rebalance the equation and ensure there’s something in it for Americans.”

Matusiak’s group said rising electricity prices compound the consumer burden of broad-based inflation and the pending expiration of federal tax credits for energy-efficient appliances and distributed energy resources, which experts say could push utility rates higher still.

Right now, hyperscalers and the utilities that support them are looking to “centralized, utility-scale solutions, like building fossil fuel or nuclear power plants” to meet near-term load growth projections, Rewiring America said. Instead, it said, targeted residential energy investments could effectively offset the loss of federal energy tax credits, free more than 100 GW of grid capacity over five years and lay the foundation for a more efficient, resilient power system over the longer term.

Those investments could also help hyperscalers and utilities sidestep five-to-six-year lead times and escalating construction costs for combined-cycle gas turbines while reducing exposure to volatile natural gas prices, Matusiak said.

Reported capital costs of combined-cycle power plants to be deployed around 2030 now exceed $2,000/kW, up nearly 50% from plants with expected 2026 deployments, the clean energy group GridLab said in a report this month.

Hyperscalers’ heat pump investments should focus on households using inefficient electric space heating, water heating and air conditioning, Rewiring America said in last week’s report.

For example, the report said fully transitioning Georgia homes from electric resistance heat to heat pumps could free up about 1.5 GW of capacity, or 22% of the state’s projected data center load growth through 2029. Swapping out traditional air conditioners for heat pumps in Texas could unlock 3.9 GW of capacity, or 23% of expected data center load over the next five years.

Heat pumps are two-way climate control devices that can heat or cool homes, depending on the season. By covering 50% of the upgrade cost, the report said hyperscalers could knock the upfront expense down to about $9,000 for a typical home — less than the combined cost of a new furnace and air conditioner.

To unlock 109 GW of additional grid capacity through distributed solar and storage, Rewiring America said hyperscalers would only need to cover 30% of installation costs — the same subsidy provided by the expiring federal home energy tax credit — to reach cost parity with new gas generation.

But that would require every “single-family household in the U.S. [to install] a home battery, and those with a suitable roof [to install] a 5-kW solar system,” the report said. Rewiring America also based its gas-parity projection on a reduction of at least 40% in installed solar and storage costs, driven by economies of scale, streamlined permitting and lower customer acquisition costs.

Though ambitious, the Department of Energy’s January report on virtual power plants and more recent research by the Smart Electric Power Alliance and Sparkfund suggest Rewiring America’s 109-GW target is plausible.

DOE estimated U.S. VPPs — which aggregate customer-sited batteries, thermostats and other latent energy sources — could reach 80 GW to 160 GW by 2030, offsetting 10% to 20% of peak grid demand. SEPA and Sparkfund said distributed capacity procurement, an emerging utility-led approach to VPP deployment, could supply a significant amount of the necessary capacity.

Distributed capacity procurement is just one of several strategies hyperscalers and utilities could pursue to offset expected AI load growth, Matusiak said.

Other promising strategies include clean transition tariffs supporting distributed capacity rather than new generation and scaled-up, performance-based contracts with third-party VPP aggregators, he said.

And in some hot data center markets, traditional utilities might not need to be directly involved at all.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/5qxBqGsn2320LkAY4wNn3fhaYEXEynW7XMUxMpebl8w/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzUwODY0NzEzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-24 15:02:19.451072

We suspect that his advisors did take into account the effect on the renewable energy industry that implementing such tariffs would have.

The Trump led regulatory reforms have had a disastrous effect on the solar sector in the United States

The Trump administration stated that it would be rolling back tax credits and incentives for the solar industry. That, coupled with the disastrous tariffs that the current administration has implemented, has led to a significant drop in the standing of solar power in the country. In the first half of the year, investment dropped by 36%.

What we must remember is that the solar sector is heavily reliant on the global nature of the industry. Several countries in Asia and all around the world develop crucial components for the energy sector in the United States. And much like the rest of America, the tariffs imposed on those countries have had a less-than-ideal effect.

Developers in the solar sector have been forced to reevaluate their investments thanks to the sizable tariffs that the administration has imposed. The Trump-led Department of Energy has also rolled back many permits for operations in the sector, which has only added to the woes of the solar energy industry. Reports are that the requirement that Energy Secretary approve any and all permits for renewable energy projects on federal land has resulted in a bottleneck forming.

Despite the current problems, the outlook for the solar energy sector remains bright

Yes, the current state of affairs is a worry. Reports are that over $22 billion in projects have been scrapped or scaled back siginificantly in the first half of this year. Despite that, the industry insiders are not concerned, as they state that the long-term outlook of the sector remains as bright as a sunrise in Hawaii. Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) CEO Abigail Ross Hopper described this year as “one of the most challenging periods of our industry’s history”

Investors may opt to take their money to Europe, which has a much more positive view on the solar sector and renewables as a whole. The European market saw renewable investments by 63% in 2025. The policy shifts that the Trump administration has championed will inevitably affect the sector. The question becomes, can the US recover from the current state of affairs in the renewable energy sector?

“We fought together with you, tooth and nail on this bill, side by side,” Hopper said. “And thanks to your advocacy, to your presence and to your perseverance, you did prevent a worst-case scenario. While that may not be the outcome we wanted, that outcome matters. That outcome was hard fought and worth honoring. While we worked every possible angle to influence the outcome, I know so many of you are still picking up the pieces. But make no mistake, this is not the end of our story, because we are a mature, resilient industry, and we will not back down in the face of adversity.” – Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) CEO Abigail Ross Hopper

Dive Brief:

Investments in residential heat pumps, batteries and solar arrays could meet 100% of projected electricity demand growth from AI data centers through 2029, according to a report from the pro-electrification nonprofit Rewiring America.

The large tech and infrastructure companies behind the U.S. AI boom could unlock more than 93 GW of grid capacity at costs comparable to building a new fleet of gas power plants by paying 50% of the cost of heat pump upgrades and 30% of the cost of onsite solar and storage, Rewiring America said Thursday.

“Hyperscalers are already thinking creatively about how to meet their growing power needs, and this report presents a solution that brings households into the conversation,” Rewiring America CEO Ari Matusiak said in an email.

Dive Insight:

U.S. utilities requested about $29 billion in rate increases in the first half of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for pro-consumer regulatory reform.

The sharp rise in rate hike requests and in already-approved rate increases show that “the status quo isn’t working for households,” Matusiak said. “There’s a way to rebalance the equation and ensure there’s something in it for Americans.”

Matusiak’s group said rising electricity prices compound the consumer burden of broad-based inflation and the pending expiration of federal tax credits for energy-efficient appliances and distributed energy resources, which experts say could push utility rates higher still.

Right now, hyperscalers and the utilities that support them are looking to “centralized, utility-scale solutions, like building fossil fuel or nuclear power plants” to meet near-term load growth projections, Rewiring America said. Instead, it said, targeted residential energy investments could effectively offset the loss of federal energy tax credits, free more than 100 GW of grid capacity over five years and lay the foundation for a more efficient, resilient power system over the longer term.

Those investments could also help hyperscalers and utilities sidestep five-to-six-year lead times and escalating construction costs for combined-cycle gas turbines while reducing exposure to volatile natural gas prices, Matusiak said.

Reported capital costs of combined-cycle power plants to be deployed around 2030 now exceed $2,000/kW, up nearly 50% from plants with expected 2026 deployments, the clean energy group GridLab said in a report this month.

Hyperscalers’ heat pump investments should focus on households using inefficient electric space heating, water heating and air conditioning, Rewiring America said in last week’s report.

For example, the report said fully transitioning Georgia homes from electric resistance heat to heat pumps could free up about 1.5 GW of capacity, or 22% of the state’s projected data center load growth through 2029. Swapping out traditional air conditioners for heat pumps in Texas could unlock 3.9 GW of capacity, or 23% of expected data center load over the next five years.

Heat pumps are two-way climate control devices that can heat or cool homes, depending on the season. By covering 50% of the upgrade cost, the report said hyperscalers could knock the upfront expense down to about $9,000 for a typical home — less than the combined cost of a new furnace and air conditioner.

To unlock 109 GW of additional grid capacity through distributed solar and storage, Rewiring America said hyperscalers would only need to cover 30% of installation costs — the same subsidy provided by the expiring federal home energy tax credit — to reach cost parity with new gas generation.

But that would require every “single-family household in the U.S. [to install] a home battery, and those with a suitable roof [to install] a 5-kW solar system,” the report said. Rewiring America also based its gas-parity projection on a reduction of at least 40% in installed solar and storage costs, driven by economies of scale, streamlined permitting and lower customer acquisition costs.

Though ambitious, the Department of Energy’s January report on virtual power plants and more recent research by the Smart Electric Power Alliance and Sparkfund suggest Rewiring America’s 109-GW target is plausible.

DOE estimated U.S. VPPs — which aggregate customer-sited batteries, thermostats and other latent energy sources — could reach 80 GW to 160 GW by 2030, offsetting 10% to 20% of peak grid demand. SEPA and Sparkfund said distributed capacity procurement, an emerging utility-led approach to VPP deployment, could supply a significant amount of the necessary capacity.

Distributed capacity procurement is just one of several strategies hyperscalers and utilities could pursue to offset expected AI load growth, Matusiak said.

Other promising strategies include clean transition tariffs supporting distributed capacity rather than new generation and scaled-up, performance-based contracts with third-party VPP aggregators, he said.

And in some hot data center markets, traditional utilities might not need to be directly involved at all.

“In competitive wholesale markets, such as [the Electric Reliability Council of Texas], data centers could contract directly with DER aggregators that monetize grid services,” Matusiak said.

In sum – what to know:

Meta enters wholesale power market – Atem Energy has applied to FERC to sell energy and capacity, aiming to secure supply and flexibility for Meta’s expanding U.S. data centers.

Louisiana AI data center drives demand – The 2 GW+ facility, powered by Entergy’s 2.26 GW gas turbines, underscores the scale of Meta’s AI infrastructure needs.

Nuclear options under review – Meta is also exploring 1.4 GW of nuclear power to meet long-term sustainability and capacity requirements.

Meta, through its newly formed subsidiary Atem Energy, has submitted an application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking approval to sell wholesale electricity in the United States.

The request, filed last week, asks for authorization to participate in energy markets by November 16. If approved, Atem Energy would be in a position to operate as a power marketer, allowing Meta to secure large-scale energy commitments for its data centers and sell unused capacity.

The filing seeks permission to sell energy, capacity, and ancillary services. If Atem intends to operate in competitive markets such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO)—where Meta is developing a major Louisiana data center—it would need to apply for membership.

Atem Energy, wholly owned by Meta and created earlier this year, was established with the aim of managing energy sales tied to the Meta’s growing data center footprint.

The move reflects surging electricity demand from AI infrastructure. Meta’s Louisiana facility is expected to exceed 2 GW of capacity, powered by three combined-cycle gas turbines totaling 2.26 GW, built and run by utility Entergy.

Separately, Meta last year launched a request for proposals to identify nuclear developers capable of providing 1.4 GW of new nuclear generation to support its U.S. operations.

In June, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) had raised its projections for electricity consumption in the country, citing a spike in power demand from commercial sectors—especially data centers—as a key driver. In its latest update of the Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the EIA said it expects total U.S. electricity demand to rise from 4,097 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) last year to 4,193bn kWh in 2025, and 4,283bn kWh in 2026.

The forecast marks a significant upward revision compared to earlier forecasts, which had anticipated more modest growth. The report says that a major contributor to the revised outlook is the expansion of data centers, particularly those supporting artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. “The revisions are most notable in the commercial sector, where data centers are an expanding source of demand,” the report states.

AI data centers are the backbone of modern machine learning and computational advancements. However, one of the biggest challenges these AI data centers face is the enormous power consumption they require. Unlike traditional data centers, which primarily handle storage and processing for standard enterprise applications, AI data centers must support intensive workloads such as deep learning, large-scale data analytics as well as real-time decision-making.

AI workloads, especially deep learning and generative AI models, require massive computational power. Training models such as GPT-4 or Google’s Gemini involves processing trillions of parameters, which requires thousands of high-performance GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). These specialized processors consume a lot more power than traditional CPUs.",https://www.rcrwireless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/datacenter3-123rf.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 15:04:26.200602

Meet our newest Net-Zero Hero, Thira Rose! Thira is an artist, runner, and community leader who’s turning worn-out sneakers and race bibs into powerful works of art. By blending her passions for running, sustainability, and creativity, she’s sparking conversations about the environmental footprint of the sport while reimagining what discarded gear can become. We met with Thira at the site of her most recent race, Zilker Relays, while she was working on her latest art piece. We dove into the inspiration behind her “shoe-scapes,” her journey, and how art can encourage us all to tread a little more lightly on the planet.

Thira with her art supplies at Zilker Park.

What inspired you to take action?

For most of my life, art, running, and sustainability have been core parts of my identity. It wasn’t until after I realized how much my gear impacted the environment that I had the idea to combine all three of my passions into one core practice.

It all began when I transferred from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago to Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, following the COVID-19 pandemic. As I was working toward my Bachelor of Fine Arts and Environmental Studies minor, three students and I were selected to attend the prestigious Tamarind Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to learn the art of stone lithography from master printers in training. With only a week to come up with an idea and put it on paper, I was scanning aimlessly for items with interesting textures to print with that had a story to tell. I thought I was out of luck until I looked at the intricate patterns on the bottom of my running shoes.

Left to Right: Thira shows some of the shoes she uses to make her prints; Thira paints on her race-day bib.

How did you do it?

Before arriving at the Tamarind Institute, I had just finished reading We Can’t Run Away From This, a book by ultrarunner and environmental activist Damian Hall about the impact runners have on the environment. Running shoes are made from a variety of plastics and fibers, which means they take years to break down. With that in mind, I got a pair of shears and cut my worn shoes until I was left with the bare bones and dissected pieces of fiber and plastic soles displayed across the table. I would eventually use these objects as printing tools to create texture in landscapes, making my first shoe-scape, titled “Tread Lightly.”

Top to Bottom: Repurposed shoe materials used to make the shoe-scape art; Thira’s first piece, “Tread Lightly.”

These shoe prints would eventually find themselves painted in the texture of rocks, trees, and skies of colorful landscapes I’ve run through, illustrating the effects humans and our used gear have on the environment we traverse. As I continued working with running shoes as a medium, I began to think about other items runners often throw away — one of those being race bibs.

Race bibs, secured by a few safety pins on shorts or a T-shirt to track someone during a race, are made from Tyvek paper. Due to its waterproof qualities for sweaty people like me, Tyvek is not recyclable and takes a long time to break down. This gave me the idea to use the Tyvek bib as a canvas to capture memories from my races. My most recent race, the Zilker Relays, was hosted at Zilker Park in downtown Austin. The glowing lights of the Austin skyline at twilight are what inspired my bib painting, “Twilight at Zilker Relays.”

Bib painting, “Twilight at Zilker Relays”

What’s been most rewarding about getting involved in this way?

Finding creative ways to reuse worn running gear that I might have otherwise discarded has been a rewarding way to recycle. But my most meaningful experience by far was summiting Mount Kilimanjaro, the world’s largest free-standing mountain, in Tanzania. I was one of twelve Southwestern University students chosen for this trip of a lifetime. With my trail racing background and passion for plein air painting, I set out with a goal: to capture the landscape throughout the eight-day trek using a portable, lightweight easel and painting supplies. At the time, I had recently developed a technique of printing shoe pieces into my landscapes with my own worn-out shoes. What I didn’t expect was to discover a much deeper meaning in the discarded soles I found scattered along the trail.

Left to Right: Thira paints outdoors in Tanzania, Africa; Thira and her friend, Goodluck, hold the paintings they did of each other.

During our trip, we hired African porters to carry our gear, food, and other essential supplies. I befriended Goodluck, one of the porters, who was close to my age and an artist himself. We painted together the entire trip and had many deep conversations about our individual cultures. I asked Goodluck about the shoe pieces I kept finding along the trail, and he informed me that porters wear shoes donated to them by other hikers until they begin to fall apart and degrade into the trail. This opened my eyes to the privilege we encounter in America and the ability people have to discard their gear before it’s used to the fullest extent. I collected every shoe piece I found along the mountain and took them back home to make a series of pieces centered around my experience.

What’s been the toughest part?

After the COVID-19 pandemic, running skyrocketed in popularity. Whether you run at a party-pace on the road or drink craft beers after a tough trail run, there’s a run club for whatever your niche might be. However, running companies have taken advantage of this growing trend by coming out with slightly new iterations of running shoes for every season, in every color you could imagine. More people travel across the globe for races just to earn a new shiny medal and snag another race shirt that will live in the depths of their closet. Running itself is a healthy hobby, but the unnecessary items that might come with it can harm the planet.

Top to Bottom: Thira’s running mate hands a baton off to Thira at Zilker Relays; Thira runs with the baton.

That’s where organizations like Racing for Sustainability give me hope for the future of running. Elite marathon runner and climate activist Tina Muir founded this nonprofit, aiming to help others make races more sustainable through environmentally-conscious race plans. These plans promote initiatives like cupless races and improved recycling station setups tailored to race size. I was fortunate to be accepted onto the Racing for Sustainability team for the Bank of America Chicago Marathon, where I will be fundraising to support the continuation of Racing for Sustainability. If you're interested in following my journey and helping me get to the start line for a good cause, find me on Instagram at @thirartist.

How has your art helped you spark conversations about climate and sustainability?

I’ve had the pleasure of showing my work in several galleries in and around Austin. These spaces provide me with an opportunity to share my work publicly with other runners, artists, and viewers who are curious about my work. I recently exhibited my work in the group show, Positioning Systems, at Northern-Southern gallery in downtown Austin. During a weekly Austin running group that I co-lead, “Artist Run Club,” I had the chance to speak about the meaning behind my work and why I feel it’s essential to preserve the gear that we own and make it outlast its capitalistic deadline.

I believe art and running both have the power to unite us. Through experiences like attending races and groups, like “Artist Run Club,” I’ve come to feel that I’m on the right path to sharing complex issues we must face together through art and the love of running.

What advice do you have for others?

While I choose to recycle my used gear through cutting it up, painting on it, and making it into art, that is certainly not the only solution. Next time you’re tempted to buy the newest pair of running shoes or gear up before trying to set a new personal record at your next race, ask yourself: Do I really need new shoes? Can I skip the race T-shirt? Where can I recycle my medal if I don’t want to keep it? How can I hydrate on race day without relying on plastic cups?

These are the kinds of thoughts and questions I want people to consider after viewing my work. If you’re part of a local running club, consider organizing a trail cleanup day or a “plogging” event (combining trash pickup with jogging). If you’re looking to run a local race, reach out to the race director to ask what kind of sustainable initiatives they have in place for race day. If your old shoes are no longer cutting it and you’re looking to upgrade for better physical health, do your research to find shoes that will outlast their desired mileage. In the rare times I do find myself buying new active wear, I thrift or buy local. Clubhouse Outfitters, a local athletic apparel store in Austin, aims to address the issue of mass production in active wear by prioritizing care and consideration in the items they produce and the fabrics they use.

The list goes on and on, but overall, be conscious of the gear you wear and the way you run as an individual and collectively.

Thira shows a couple of her race bib paintings.

Is there a book, documentary, or other piece of media you would recommend for folks wanting to learn more about these topics?

I previously mentioned the book that initially got me thinking about the connection between running and sustainability, which was Damian Hall’s (@untra_damo), We Can’t Run Away From This. This book dives into the statistics, numbers, and in-depth research on why running can be so detrimental to the environment.

Building on those ideas, Becoming a Sustainable Runner, co-written by accomplished runners and environmental advocates Tina Muir (@tinamuir88) and Zoë Rom (@carrot_flowers_z), explores how to approach running sustainably through the lenses of mind, body, and planet. This book is also what led me to discover Muir’s nonprofit, Racing for Sustainability.

Lastly, Alaskan watercolor artist and storyteller, Max Romey (@trailboundsketches), is inspired by trash and other discarded materials to illustrate stories about how we must work to protect the planet from climate catastrophe. Romey even had an entire project dedicated to collecting discarded shoes on an island in Alaska and illustrating each of them to bring awareness to the effects microplastics have on the planet.

Thira’s work reminds us that you don’t always have to go far to find sustainable ways to care for the planet — sometimes the greatest difference you can make starts with your everyday hobbies. Running has long been a favorite pastime in Austin, and Thira’s art highlights how even the gear we use for the activities we love carries an environmental footprint. She challenges us to rethink waste, find beauty in the overlooked, and make more intentional choices in our daily lives.

From our experience here in South Texas, I can tell you: BlackRock and GIP cannot be trusted with running your power supply.

On the South Texas Gulf Coast, BlackRock and GIP are behind the Rio Grande LNG export terminal. This massive fossil-fuel facility is being developed by bulldozing the ancestral lands of my people, the Esto’k Gna, the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe. This fossil-fuel behemoth threatens our sacred sites, our water, and our future. From the inception of the project, the tribe's perspective and concerns have been largely excluded and ignored. The developers never asked permission, never sought proper consultation, and never respected our inherent sovereignty.

For years, the tribe has told regulators and investors, both international and domestic, that this project is a direct assault on our community, our lands, and our futures. We’ve organized, marched, and testified. We’ve asked BlackRock to acknowledge our concerns. And still, these private-equity executives look past us, treating South Texans and original peoples of the land as mere obstacles to profits — not human beings tied to a land they are willing to destroy.

This is not an isolated incident but the next iteration of a never-ending, colonial, profit-seeking pattern. BlackRock has a long history of investing in companies that trample tribal sovereignty. When profit is at stake, Indigenous rights are dismissed. That’s why Minnesotans should be deeply concerned about this proposed takeover of Minnesota Power.

This is not an abstract problem, but real, lived realities for Indigenous communities in Texas. I know that your communities and environments in Northeastern Minnesota are unlikely to improve under BlackRock’s agenda of profit over people. GIP and BlackRock have already demonstrated that Indigenous voices in Texas do not matter. Why would they act differently once they control Minnesota Power? GIP and BlackRock won’t care about Minnesota, I predict; they won’t care about your futures. They only seem to care about making more money, including sacrificing the health of your communities and even the future health of the environment.

The warning signs extend beyond Minnesota’s borders. Minnesota Power imports a significant share of its electricity from Manitoba Hydro in Canada. Those hydroelectric dams have devastated the lands and cultures of First Nations communities for decades. Entire homelands were flooded, and traditional ways of life were destroyed. Yet this destruction remains hidden behind the “clean energy” label that utilities are cynically quick to advertise. Again, the settler-colonial pattern is clear: Indigenous communities pay the price so corporations like BlackRock can profit.

This is why I speak directly to you, the people of Northeastern Minnesota. What we have seen in South Texas promises to repeat itself on your lands if this sale goes through. BlackRock will say the right things to your utility commission. It will promise reliability, affordability, and even sustainability. It will employ its political leverage. But when it comes to respecting Indigenous sovereignty, the record speaks for itself: BlackRock and other forms of private equity do not respect tribal nations or communities.

Esto’k Gna, the “human beings,” in Texas, have been fighting Rio Grande LNG for years because we understand what is at stake. Our struggle is not just for our community and sacred lands but for future generations.

Minnesotans now face a choice. Will you hand control of your utility over to Wall Street firms that have already shown they will bulldoze Indigenous lands and trample Indigenous rights? Or will you demand that your officials and regulators put your own communities, sovereignty, and the environment first?

From the Rio Grande to Lake Superior, we know what it looks like when BlackRock is in charge. Minnesota, you don’t have to learn the hard way. Please, stop this deal before it’s too late.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/09304c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x800+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F00%2Ffbd7d1c94ed888d5f42322a226ea%2Fchristopher-basaldu.png,N,,2025-09-24 15:02:53.013971

There is some very good news on the climate front. Every US state reduced per capita carbon dioxide emissions from primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2023. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently released data indicating that total US CO2 emissions fell by 20% over the period, even as population rose by 14%. The result is a 30% decrease in per capita CO2 emissions.

The reductions by state range from 49% in Maryland down to 1% in Mississippi. Texas had 24% lower per capita CO2 emissions in 2023 than in 2005, a remarkable amount given that the state experienced 77% growth in real output, a 34% increase in population, and an eight-fold surge in oil and gas production. States at or near the same or smaller levels of reduction include California, Vermont, New York, Washington, Oregon, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and several others. These areas exhibit wide differences in climate policy, geographic size, industrial base, rate of economic development, and virtually every other measure, indicating the diversity of approaches available to address this critical issue.

In Maryland, the key to the decrease was reducing coal from 56% of its input fuel for electric generation in 2005 to only 5% in 2023; natural gas increased from 4% to 41% over the period, and some wind and solar came online. Similar coal retirement and replacement went on in all of the states with the largest reductions.

Transportation is generally the biggest factor on the east and west costs, with electric power the primary source in 18 states. Texas is one of only four states where the industrial sector (which includes manufacturing and agriculture) is the largest source of CO2, another underlying indicator of economic vitality.

While the sheer size and economic strength of the state results in a high level of overall emissions, the reductions indicate genuine and meaningful gains. In fact, Texas has improved dramatically in terms of far lower emissions on both a per capita and a per million dollars in gross product basis than in the past. These reductions take on even greater significance in light of recent scientific research at MIT which reveals that declines in carbon concentrations can be a catalyst to climate regeneration.

A key factor in the improvement in US emissions has been increased electricity generation from natural gas, which releases about half the CO2 per unit of energy as coal, as well as gains in wind and solar. Significant reductions in carbon dioxide released even as business activity has flourished is good news indeed, especially when coupled with credible analysis indicating that such efforts can move the needle on crucial climate issues. Much remains to be done, but the success is notable. Stay safe!

As we became teenagers, we would have little cook outs in the woods and make baked potatoes. We would sit down near a stream and cool our drinks in the water. At night, listening to the sounds of the insects was a cozy feeling.

How did you first become active with the Sierra Club?

I was living in New York City, as an actress. I have always loved the theatre, but I longed to be in the woods. Central Park was my haven. I sought out friends who had cars who could take me to the Catskills to go hiking. Eventually I found the Sierra Club and began going on weekend hikes with them. I would take the train from Grand Central Station and meet the Sierra Club group and join them in hikes in Bear Mountain, Cold Springs and do overnights in the Catskills.

What's your favorite thing about volunteering with the Sierra Club Hoosier Chapter, or a favorite memory from your time here?

As an outings leader it is a joy to show someone a new trail. It is a comfort to hike with kindred spirits who share my love of the environment. The magic of being outdoors elicits heartfelt conversations, laughter and learning all while hiking the outdoors. When I began to see invasive plants encroaching into my beloved hiking trails, I volunteered with other groups that were eradicating these invasives. I soon began offering weed wrangles through the Sierra Club, all the while partnering with other groups who were doing the same. Pulling invasive plants with a hearty group of people is life enhancing.

What would you say to someone who’s thinking of volunteering with the Sierra Club?

Volunteering with the Sierra Club can make a person feel less alone. I have made many good friends through volunteering with the Sierra Club. I have had to ask many questions and people were always willing to help me learn. When we plan a hiking outing, first we scout it with another Sierra Club member. Then, we will list it in Campfire [our events portal] and hike with an interested, intriguing group of people. We're making a difference in the environment by carrying the joy of being outdoors to others.Mahler was a visionary, whose capacity for empathy, for both humans and the natural world, was matched only by his steely refusal to compromise on vital matters of ecological principle. Mahler’s life, lived to the max, is a testament for a new kind of environmental movement: local, radical and charged with the joyful spirit of the life force itself.""

Per the Advanced Clean Cars II program, Washington aims to have 35% of new light-duty vehicle sales be zero-emission vehicles by 2026. Last year, 20% of new sales were electric or plug-in hybrid.

By 2027, EV, or zero emission vehicles, will have to make up 43% of all car sales in Washington. That percentage increases to 51% in 2028 and eventually reaches 100% by 2035, when it will be illegal to register new internal combustion engine vehicles.

New data reveals that while July new title transactions for EVs were 4,380, up from the same time in 2023, they were significantly below that of July 2024 which had nearly 6,500 new title transactions. In both May and June, new title transactions were below those same months in 2023 and 2024.

Washington State Department of Commerce Electric Vehicle Council Analyst Santiago Beltran Laborde told the Electric Vehicle Coordinating Council at its Sept. 17 meeting that “August might even be an even better month of new EV sales.”

Nevertheless, an EVCC’s meeting presentation stated that while the state would be able to meet its 8% sales share for 2025, the “state will struggle to meet this (35% in 2026) mark absent a policy boost or change in market dynamics,” according to the presentation.

However, State Department of Commerce Clean Transportation Managing Director Steven Hershkowitz noted that the “struggle” to meet that goal is “an average across the whole market, but this is not saying that it would be a ‘struggle’ for compliance to be met in the actual Advanced Clean Cars II policy, because of the way credits can be traded in. I just want to make it abundantly clear for anyone who's tuning in to not misinterpret this as suggesting that compliance cannot be met in ACC2, just the across-the-board average of 35% market share.”

Department of Ecology Zero Emissions Vehicle Specialist Joshua Grandbouche added that “we have the significant amount of credits in the credit bank ... that manufacturers earned over the past few years of sales.""

Under Advance Clean Cars II, credits are generated based on the sale of vehicles that meet or exceed the program’s emissions standards. Those credits can either be sold to other manufacturers or used to offset sale deficits up to the next three years.

New Jersey’s electricity ratepayers have experienced significant financial strain, with double-digit rate increases announced in February 2025, projected to range from 17.23% to 20.20% for June and further hikes expected after the July PJM capacity auctions. These increases, coupled with higher usage during heat waves, have created an urgent energy affordability crisis. Addressing this challenge will be a top priority for New Jersey’s next governor.

New Jersey is importing 35% of its electricity, making the state vulnerable to regional grid constraints and wholesale auction price spikes. This vulnerable position places energy policy at the forefront of the 2025 gubernatorial race between Jack Ciattarelli and Mikie Sherrill, making the election a referendum on New Jersey’s energy future.

This article analyzes the candidates’ energy policies and energy records.

Mikie Sherrill: Championing a Clean Energy Transition

Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill’s energy platform centers on the national Democratic stance that climate change requires urgent action via a rapid transition to renewable energy.

Sherrill promotes expanding New Jersey’s solar capacity and introduced the “RAISE the Roof Act” in Congress to broaden the solar investment tax credit to include integrated solar roofs.

Despite major setbacks, Sherrill continues to see offshore wind as essential to New Jersey’s renewable energy leadership.

Details of Sherrill’s position on nuclear energy are not included in this summary; however, her energy platform primarily focuses on renewables and the transition away from fossil fuels.

Sherrill’s natural gas policy centers on reducing methane emissions from existing infrastructure, highlighted by her 2021 “Mitigate Methane Now Act,” which aims to replace aging gas lines and shield low-income consumers from related rate hikes through state grants.

In her June op-ed, Congresswoman Sherrill advocated for increasing and accelerating the deployment of electric vehicle chargers to support the transition to electric vehicles. She backed the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provided funding for EV charging stations in the state.

Sherrill opposes recent utility rate increases, warning they could drive businesses out of state. Her main approach to lowering costs is to add more clean energy to the grid and speed up the process for bringing these sources online, while also holding the regional grid operator, PJM, accountable for delays.

Jack Ciattarelli: A Balanced, All-of-the-Above Approach

Supports an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy, advocating for a new Energy Master Plan that balances various energy sources. He acknowledges the reality of climate change but criticizes Governor Murphy’s clean energy initiatives as overly ambitious and rapid.

Ciattarelli’s stance on renewable energy is complex. While he acknowledges the need for more solar energy, he criticizes federal subsidies for wind and solar, describing them as costly and unreliable.

Champions nuclear power for its zero-carbon benefits and significant role in New Jersey’s energy mix, promoting new “micro nuclear” technologies—a notable change from his 2017 opposition to nuclear subsidies due to concerns over incentives for other renewables.

Supports expanding the use of natural gas as a transitional energy source to boost supply and reduce costs, advocating for its role alongside renewables and nuclear until clean energy becomes more practical and affordable.

In an 2023 op-ed published in the Asbury Park Press, Ciattarelli said the government incentives being used to drive the mandate forward are “insulting and unfair” to working-class people. In May of 2025 Mr. Ciattarelli posted on his social media accounts that he would eliminate the electric vehicle mandates on day one of his administration.

His energy affordability plan centers on repealing what he calls costly state mandates for electric vehicles, appliances, and home construction, which he believes drive up expenses for residents, especially the working and middle class. He also pledges to reform the NJBPU to speed up energy project approvals.

READ THEIR SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON

The energy policy plans of Mikie Sherrill and Jack Ciattarelli both recognize New Jersey’s rising energy costs and the importance of a reliable power supply, but they differ sharply on how quickly and by what methods the state should change its energy mix. Their opposing approaches will shape New Jersey’s future strategies for balancing energy security, affordability, and environmental goals, as the state faces challenges from high electricity rates and dependence on imported power.

The New Jersey gubernatorial race offers voters a clear choice on energy policy: Sherrill advocates for a swift shift to 100% clean energy with investments in renewables and support for nuclear power, while Ciattarelli favors a gradual transition that maintains current use of natural gas and nuclear to prioritize affordability and reliability.

The upcoming governor will face mounting pressure to address rising electricity rates and ensure energy security. The 2025 gubernatorial race will determine whether New Jersey doubles down on a clean energy future or pursues alternative strategies for stabilizing rates and securing its energy supply.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/09/Candidates-Energy-sRGB_feature-image.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 15:04:10.292921

This year, it’s been rechristened to something much simpler: the Cheap Energy Act.
Although oil and gasoline prices have stayed low this year, electricity prices have surged.
That points to the bill’s hybrid nature: Although it’s focused on cheap energy, it retains many policies from an era when Democrats were focused more exclusively on reducing carbon emissions.
If Democrats really do want cheap energy for consumers at all costs, as Casten said, are they willing to accept, say, new fossil fuel development to get it?","House Democrats introduced a new package of proposals on Wednesday taking aim at rising electricity prices. The move signals a shift in how the party plans to talk about the energy industry — and an even bigger change in how the party plans to talk about climate change in the Trump 2.0 era.

After four years in which the party focused on climate change as an existential crisis, Democrats have reoriented to talking about energy chiefly as an affordability problem.

The new package, sponsored by Representatives Sean Casten and Mike Levin, would encourage new power line construction and strengthen utility regulation in much of the country. It would also restore longstanding tax credits for wind and solar energy, which were repealed as part of President Trump’s partisan tax and spending law earlier this year.

Many of the provisions, although not all of them, were first proposed in a Democratic bill called the Clean Electricity and Transmission Acceleration Act last year. This year, it’s been rechristened to something much simpler: the Cheap Energy Act.

“The purpose of the bill is a longtime wish of mine — that we would have an energy policy that puts the interests of American consumers first, by making sure that American consumers have access to cheap, reliable energy,” Representative Sean Casten, who is one of the bill’s coauthors, told me. “We’ve never done that as a country.”

In his view, achieving that goal will require many of the same policies that would cut carbon emissions. But that’s just good luck: “It’s a happy coincidence that cheap is synonymous with clean,” Casten said. “But the goal is cheap.”

The bill arrives at an unusual moment for the American energy economy. Although oil and gasoline prices have stayed low this year, electricity prices have surged. Over the past year, power costs have grown twice as fast as overall inflation. At the same time, the artificial intelligence boom — as well as the rise of electric vehicles and the country’s spate of new factories — have helped increase overall U.S. electricity demand for the first time in decades.

The politics of energy, in other words, have gone topsy-turvy. Americans normally sweat over gasoline prices and don’t think too much about their power bills. But this year, 57% of U.S. registered voters say that surging electricity costs are having at least “a decent amount” of influence on their personal finances, according to a recent Heatmap Pro poll.

“I believe very strongly that right now, in this moment — when electricity costs are increasing at double the rate of inflation, and when the administration has totally doubled down on fossil fuels — that highlighting the ability to transition to more affordable energy, and that clean energy is cheap energy, and talking about the bill in the context of cheap energy, is really the way to go,” Representative Mike Levin, a cosponsor of the bill and a Democrat from California, told me.

The Trump administration knows that electricity is becoming a political problem. Energy Secretary Chris Wright admitted last month that the Trump administration “is going to get blamed” for higher power prices, although he blamed the increase on Democratic policies.

The new Democratic bill contains a slew of reforms to the country’s energy and electricity policies — including some changes that nobody expects to pass under the current administration, and some that could potentially advance in a bipartisan fashion.

Some of the most important are around transmission. The law would beef up the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to plan and approve large-scale cross-country power lines. It would create a new tax credit for developers who build transmission lines, similar to those that exist for other clean energy technologies.

“We have to make it easier to site transmission lines so that we build where we need to build,” Levin said.

The bill also includes a proposal — which has support from some Republicans — mandating that each region of the country have enough infrastructure to send a minimum amount of electricity to its neighbors. And perhaps most importantly, it lays out the rules for how utilities would divide the cost of a new power line — an accounting hurdle that has held back many transmission projects.

Another important set of proposals would reshape the utility industry. The bill would allow state regulators to engage in “performance-based ratemaking,” which compensates utilities for how well they save money rather than how much infrastructure they build. (This is closer to how the EU and United Kingdom regulate utilities — my cohost Jesse Jenkins and I talked about it on a recent episode of our podcast, Shift Key.)

Casten said that changing how utilities are regulated will ultimately get more new power generation built — and keep rates lower — than loosening permitting rules alone. “If we fix the profit incentives in the energy industry so that [utilities] make money by saving their consumers money, then permitting is easy,” he said. (Such an approach is “much smarter” than that taken by Senator Joe Manchin and John Barrasso in their permitting bill last Congress, he added.)

The bill would also allow the government to step in and cover some of the cost of new grid-enhancing or wildfire prevention equipment. It would also spend $2.1 billion to unsnarl and build manufacturing capacity for transformers, a key piece of grid equipment, through the Defense Production Act. Electrical transformers, which can step up or down electricity voltage, have been in short supply since the pandemic, helping to drive up power prices.

“We’re trying to figure out where the bottlenecks are and trying to unclog them, as best we can, so that we can actually deliver the lowest cost energy to the end user,” Levin said.

Other proposals appear to respond to Trump-led initiatives. For instance, the bill would limit the Energy Department’s ability to keep fossil fuel power plants open for an “emergency” when that emergency is more than a year in the future. The Trump administration has used this emergency authority to keep coal, oil, and gas plants open in Pennsylvania and the Midwest.

It would also require the Energy Department to study whether approving a new liquified natural gas export terminal would drive up domestic gas prices before approving it. “If you take gas out of the United States and send it overseas, you're going to reduce supply,” Casten said. “The mere act of connecting those markets raises prices.”

Yet the bill also includes a grab bag of environmental proposals from other Democratic bills, not all of which seem necessarily designed to produce cheap energy. The package would support owners of reflective roofs, expand community solar programs, and double the cap on how much the government can spend on the weatherization assistance program. It would have FERC pay nonprofits that participate in public comment periods on proposed regulations — an approach already used in California — and it would speed up permitting approvals for infrastructure projects that include a community benefit agreement.

That points to the bill’s hybrid nature: Although it’s focused on cheap energy, it retains many policies from an era when Democrats were focused more exclusively on reducing carbon emissions. That change might make for good politics, but it leaves key questions about the future of Democratic energy policy unanswered. If Democrats really do want cheap energy for consumers at all costs, as Casten said, are they willing to accept, say, new fossil fuel development to get it?

Levin demurred. Democrats will next face something like that choice when Congress takes up a bipartisan permitting reform package, he said. But as long as the Trump administration continues to wage a regulatory war on wind and solar projects, he said, then it doesn’t make sense for Democrats to come to the table to negotiate a bill like that.

“If the [natural] gas folks — if they actually want a good-faith dialogue around what the energy system needs — an actual system analysis, looking at AI and data centers and all the rest of it, and then looking at what the permitting situation needs to look like — that would be one thing. But we’re not seeing that. We’re seeing a reflexive repetition of President Trump’s message that wind is bad,” he told me.

“I don’t know how we could have a good faith discussion around permitting reform — or a bipartisan permitting reform package — that would make any sense when people are saying things that are objectively untrue,” Levin said. Many Republican officials “know better,” he added, naming Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “But they don’t want to get sideways with Trump.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTY0MDg2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NzEyODc2Nn0.UsWyKY1KAqOgfue3xVwweSmg4I3MqLNrfdk6_mDQAsA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-09-24 14:02:44.982517

In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Donald Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” He complained that scientists used to warn the governments about “global cooling … then they said global warming will kill the world.” Yet “all of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people” from countries with “no chance for success.” He urged other nations that “if you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”

Scientists first suggested over a century ago that the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels could create a greenhouse effect warming the planet and destabilizing the climate norms in which human beings evolved to survive. As global emissions of carbon and other planet-heating gases have surged over the past several decades, the Earth’s average temperature has risen by more than 1 degree Celsius, an increase that the overwhelming majority of scientists around the world attribute to pollution from fossil fuels and agriculture. The Trump administration issued a report written by contrarians who raised the possibility that climate change won’t be as bad as most scientists say, but more than 1,000 peer-reviewed researchers signed onto a letter condemning the findings. In a statement on the president’s UN speech, Gina McCarthy, the Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency chief and the Biden administration’s climate policy director, said Trump “continues to embarrass the U.S. on the global stage and undermine the interests of Americans at home. He’s rejecting our government’s responsibility to protect Americans from the increasingly intense and frequent disasters linked to climate change that unleash havoc on our country.” For more on the basics of climate change, you can consult this explainer by Heatmap’s Jeva Lange.

3. Exclusive: New England unions sign historic offshore wind agreement

Rhode Island’s biggest labor federation has brokered a deal for union workers to carry out the construction on the SouthCoast Wind project, a 2.4-gigawatt offshore turbine array — and won what the Rhode Island AFL-CIO called the first agreement in the nation guaranteeing organized labor handles all the operations and maintenance of the facility. On a panel I moderated for the Climate Jobs National Resource Center on Tuesday evening, Rhode Island’s AFL-CIO president, Patrick Crowley, told me the “labor peace agreement” will help the union organize more workers in the offshore-wind industry. “The labor movement is in this to win, and we’re not ready to give up the fight yet,” he told me. “If developers want to have a winning strategy, they have to partner with organized labor, because we’re going to make sure that, come hell or high water, we get these things built.”

After a federal judge lifted Trump’s stop-work order halting construction on the Revolution Wind farm off Rhode Island’s coast, a project that was 80% complete before the president’s abrupt intervention, Crowley said executives immediately directed workers onto boats to restart work on the turbines.

4. Oklo breaks ground on its first nuclear facility

Microreactor developer Oklo’s stock price has been on a tear for months, surging to $21 billion in September despite no revenue or completed facilities. That’s starting the change. On Tuesday, the company broke ground on its debut nuclear plant at the Idaho National Laboratory. The California startup, which is also seeking to construct the nation’s first nuclear recycling plant, is the only company in the Department of Energy’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program to secure two projects in the federal effort to prove that new reactor technologies – Oklo’s tiny reactors use a different and rarer kind of coolant and fuel than the entire U.S. commercial fleet – can successfully sustain fission reactions by next July.

“As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement.

5. U.S.-backed startup looks to break China’s stranglehold on gallium

Earlier this month, the federal Defense Logistics Agency backed Xerion Advanced Battery Corp. to help the Ohio-based startup’s efforts to commercialize a novel technology for processing cobalt for batteries. Now, as I reported in an exclusive for Heatmap on Tuesday, the company is applying its approach to refining gallium, another key industrial metal over which China has a monopoly grip.

It’s not the so-called DLA’s only push into minerals. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that the agency is seeking to stockpile up to $40 million worth of scandium oxide over the next five years. The agency plans to buy the rare earth element used as an alloying agent used in aerospace, defense, and automotive technologies from mining giant Rio Tinto.

THE KICKER

A team of researchers in China found a way to turn clothianidin, a widely used pesticide notorious for accumulating in soil and crops and harming human health, into a nutrient for plants that removes the chemical from the dirt. Scientists at Hunan Agricultural University developed a novel biochar-based catalyst that converts the pesticide residues into ammonium nitrogen, a form of fertilizer that helps crops grow. “Instead of simply eliminating pesticides, we can recycle their nitrogen content back into the soil as fertilizer,” Hongmei Liu, a co-author of the study, said in a press release. “It offers a win–win solution for food safety and sustainable agriculture.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTY0NDE1Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNTcwNzY5OH0.VA955vN07bZFMlXa4_JKjAkhyu-5o_f2K0JJ5tHC7_o/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-09-24 14:03:31.015898

This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Since 2021, the Sierra Club has been grading US utilities on their commitment to a clean-energy transition. While most utilities have not earned high marks on the group’s annual scorecards, as a whole they had been showing some progress.

That’s over now. The latest edition of the Sierra Club’s ​“The Dirty Truth” report finds that the country’s biggest electric utilities are collectively doing worse on climate goals than when the organization started tracking their progress five years ago. This year they earned an aggregate grade of ​“F” for the first time.

With only a handful of rare exceptions, US utilities have shed the gains they made during the Biden administration. Almost none are on track to switch from fossil fuels to carbon-free energy at the speed and scale needed to combat the worst harms of climate change. “It’s very disappointing to find we’re at a lower score than in the first year,” said Cara Fogler, managing senior analyst at the Sierra Club, who coauthored the report. But it’s not entirely unexpected.

Utilities had already begun slipping on their carbon commitments last year, in the face of soaring demand for electricity, according to the 2024 ​“Dirty Truth” report, largely in response to the boom in data centers being used to power tech giants’ AI goals. But the anti-renewables, pro–fossil fuels agenda of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress has pushed that reversal into overdrive.

“We have a new federal administration that’s doing everything in their power to send utilities in a direction away from cleaner power,” Fogler said. ​“They’re doing away with everything in the Inflation Reduction Act that supported clean energy. They’re straight-up challenging clean energy, as we’ve seen with Revolution Wind,” the New England offshore wind farm that’s now under a stop-work order. ​“And they’re doing everything in their power to keep fossil fuels online”—for example, through Department of Energy actions that force coal, oil, and gas plants to keep running even after their owners and regulators had agreed on retirement dates.

But utilities also bear responsibility for not doing more to embrace technologies that offer both cleaner and cheaper power, Fogler said. ​“From a cost perspective, from a health perspective, from a pollution perspective, there are so many reasons to build more clean energy and fewer fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we’re seeing that utilities are much less concerned about doing the right thing for the climate and their customers.”

For its new report, the Sierra Club analyzed 75 of the nation’s largest utilities, which together own more than half the country’s coal and fossil-gas generation capacity. The report measures utilities’ plans against three benchmarks: whether they intend to close all remaining coal-fired power plants by 2030, whether they intend to build new gas plants, and how much clean-energy capacity they intend to build by 2035.

As of mid-2025, the utilities had plans to build only enough solar and wind capacity to cover 32 percent of what’s forecast to be needed by 2035 to replace fossil-fuel generation and satisfy new demand. While 65 percent of the utilities have increased their clean-energy deployment plans since 2021, 31 percent have reduced them.

Meanwhile, commitments to reduce reliance on fossil fuels have taken a big step backward as utilities have turned to keeping old coal plants running and are planning to build more gas plants to meet growing demand. As of mid-2025, the utilities had plans to close only 29 percent of coal generation capacity by 2030, down from 30 percent last year and 35 percent in 2023.

And the amount of gas-fired generation capacity the utilities plan to build by 2035 spiked to 118 gigawatts as of mid-2025. That’s up from 93 gigawatts in 2024, and more than twice the 51 gigawatts planned in 2021.

That expanding appetite for new gas-fired power has been supercharged by the surge in forecasted electricity demand across much of the country—data centers are the primary driver of that growth. But much of that expected data-center demand is speculative. And the lion’s share of it is premised on the idea that the hundreds of billions of dollars in AI investments from tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, as well as AI leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic will end up earning those companies enough money to pay off their costs—a risky bet.

The Sierra Club is among a growing number of groups demanding that utilities and regulators proceed with caution in building power plants to serve data centers that may never materialize. Forecasted data-center power demand is already driving up utility rates for everyday customers in some parts of the country, and the new gas power plants now in utility plans aren’t even built yet.

“There is some load we’re naturally going to see—there’s population growth, lots of beneficial electrification we want to see happen,” said Noah Ver Beek, senior energy campaigns analyst at the Sierra Club and another coauthor of the report. ​“But we also want utilities to be realistic about load-growth projections.”

Unfortunately, booming demand growth gives utilities ​“more cover” to invest in polluting assets, Fogler said. Utilities earn guaranteed profits on the money they spend building power plants and grid infrastructure, which gives them an incentive to avoid questioning high-growth forecasts or seeking out lower-cost or less-polluting alternatives.

Some of the most aggressive fossil fuel expansions are planned for the Midwest and Southeast, including by Dominion Energy in Virginia, Duke Energy in North Carolina, and Georgia Power.

Even the handful of utilities that have previously earned high marks for clean-energy and coal-closure commitments in past ​“Dirty Truth” reports have slipped. Fogler highlighted the example of Indiana utility NIPSCO, which earned an ​“A” in the past four reports but only a ​“B” in the latest, largely due to its plan to rely on gas power plants to meet expected data-center demand.

NIPSCO has ​“no plans to pursue the high-load-growth scenario until they see contracts signed and progress made,” Fogler said—a prudent approach that avoids burdening customers with the costs of new power plants built for data centers that may never come online, she said. ​“The problem? Their high-load-growth scenario calls for all new gas. There should be more clean options.”

Most utilities are not capitalizing on the solar and wind tax credits that are set to disappear in mid-2026 under the megalaw passed by Republicans in Congress this summer, she said. Only a handful of utilities, such as Xcel Energy in Colorado and Minnesota, are accelerating their clean-energy deployments to take advantage of those tax credits. ​“We want more utilities to take that period of certainty and speed up what they’ve already planned.”

Going big on clean energy is also the only way to quickly add enough generation capacity to meet growing demand forecasts and contain rising utility costs, Ver Beek noted. Utilities and major tech companies are pinning their near-term capacity expansion plans on new gas plants, despite the yearslong manufacturing backlogs for the turbines that power those plants and rapidly rising turbine costs.

It all adds up to proof there’s still plenty of pent up demand for new vehicles, Smoke said.
If the import tariffs are Thing One, the demise after September 30 of federal EV tax credits qualifies as Thing Two.
“No question we have seen clearly in the data that the first quarter almost always sucks for EV sales.
It will be interesting, however, to see how the various EV brands perform on a more level playing field when there’s no dividing line between those that qualified for tax credits and those that didn’t.","Somehow the auto industry and consumers are figuring out how to deal with the double jeopardy of import tariffs and the impending end of federal tax credits for many electric vehicles, and it’s not at all how insiders thought it would all go down.

When President Donald Trump announced he planned to impose stiff tariffs on imported vehicles among other products, consumers made a mad dash to dealer lots to beat expected price hikes on post-tariff vehicles.

The expectations were dealers would be left with fewer vehicles on their lots and prices would skyrocket on cars and trucks made outside the United States and sales would tank.

It all seemed logical, but sometimes logic doesn’t mirror reality.

Indeed, what happened over the summer is more like an amusement park ride to Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke.

“So you’re seeing inventory deliveries slow down, but yet sales are stronger. So we are seeing supply tighten, a bit like it was back in 2021 or 2022, but it’s created what I’ll call this summer, particularly, a love roller coaster,” observed Smoke during a panel on sales trends at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit on Thursday.

It all adds up to proof there’s still plenty of pent up demand for new vehicles, Smoke said.

That expected tariff-triggered price spike? It was more like a thumb tack.

Average new vehicle prices rose only about a hundred bucks between July and August from $49,400 to $49,500, according the Car Gurus August 2025 Intelligence Report released Thursday.

“Even with rising import costs and economic uncertainty, the market is showing surprising strength. Prices for both new and used vehicles held steady in August, while demand hit multi-year highs. For buyers, that means strong competition for value models—especially affordable EVs, which surged ahead of upcoming tax credit changes,” wrote report author Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market Intelligence at CarGurus.

There’s also the fear of missing out factor, even if not missing out on a new car or truck means missing out on the make or model first on a consumer’s list.

“There's still this disconnect, sort of between how consumers are feeling and what they're doing,” observed Ford Motor Company chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris during Thursday’s panel. “So they may be rushing out to get what they think are the last of the deals. They don't seem to be particularly happy about it.”

So who’s picking up the tab on the added tariff expense? It’s not that easy.

In keeping with Smoke’s “love roller coaster” there are ups and downs. Average list prices of new vehicles actually fell about $500 from $50,000 to $49,500 between April 2 and August 31, according to the CarGurus report.

While some automakers did lower their prices, some, including the Detroit Three companies, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Hyundai, Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover boosted theirs as 2026 models reach showrooms.

But don’t be fooled. That doesn’t mean the cost of other vehicle brands declined as automakers found ways to make up the difference, according to Jessica Caldwell, AVP insights, at auto research site Edmunds.com.

“We have seen is an increase in destination prices in 2025 model year, the average destination was over $1,500. That's another like way I think that you could see some cost increases, and then also changes in vehicle contenting and trim levels,” Caldwell said during the panel discussion.

Indeed, while the combination of pent up demand and ample inventories propped up sales over the summer, Smoke warns consumers are likely to soon see prices affected by tariffs as 2026 models arrive.

“About a quarter of what dealers have on their lots being model year ‘26 so we are seeing more of an acceleration in the increase in MSRP and invoice and average transaction price, but it's still well within what is normal for inflation,” Smoke said.

If the import tariffs are Thing One, the demise after September 30 of federal EV tax credits qualifies as Thing Two.

The rush to beat the deadline is continuing through September, with Smoke predicting record EV sales for the third quarter, boosted by both urgency from consumers and record incentives from some automakers.

But come October, the party is likely to be over.

“We’re going to hit a speed bump when those credits go away,” predicted Smoke. “No question we have seen clearly in the data that the first quarter almost always sucks for EV sales. So I would expect this to have a little bit of a hangover that's going to last us at least through the first quarter of next year.”

Given automakers already laid on generous incentives, Morris notes there’s not much more they can offer to mitigate loss of the tax credits. It will be interesting, however, to see how the various EV brands perform on a more level playing field when there’s no dividing line between those that qualified for tax credits and those that didn’t.

All three panelists agreed EV adoption is simply a slower process than the industry had hoped it would be, but that more consumers who desire some sort of electrified vehicle prefer hybrids.

“For a lot of people, a hybrid is fine, like, that's enough of a change,” said Caldwell. “Because I think for an EV, there is that fatigue of trying to learn something else, and especially like in the post-Covid world, where everyone is really stressed out, and we see this in customer surveys, is they don't necessarily want to buy an EV because they just don't want to. They don't want to deal with the hassle. They've got to figure out the charging situation and all of that, and you just don't want to deal with it.”

One thing is for sure, asserts Smoke, is that the number of internal combustion engine, or ICE, vehicles is beyond the point of growth, declaring that in terms of sales and those on the road, “we’re past peak ICE.”

Indeed, both consumers and the auto industry need to come to grips with a stark reality, said Smoke.

“It's going to be a multiple powertrain world, and we have to deal with the complexity of that.”

The total of 3 GW in capacity to assemble the company’s proprietary Gamma Series monofacial and Gamma Series bifacial solar panels will pair with 3 GW of solar cell capacity that the company is installing in the same location, the company said in a release.

In late August, Boviet announced it had completed exterior construction for the second phase of its cell manufacturing facility, which it said would start volume production next year.

Boviet’s news is sure to hearten solar-industry observers tracking a resurgence in the U.S. domestic manufacturing industry, which has made something of a comeback from severe retrenchment in the face of low-price Chinese imports.

All eyes are particularly focused on developments in domestic cell fabrication. While many manufacturers have brought back gigawatt-plus module-production plants, only a few, such as ES Foundry in South Carolina and Suniva in Georgia, are domestically producing cells.

Earlier-than-expected phaseouts of federal tax incentives for solar have further begged the question of whether announced plans for adding cell capacity, such as Qcells’ intention to include cell production in its intended fully vertically integrated plant in Carterville, Ga., remain on track for completion. Boviet’s announcements of progress to expand both cell and module production might be considered important data points in favor of domestic production.

Founded in 2013 in Vietnam, Boviet projects that it will spend a total of $400 million on its Greenville production site, creating more than 1,300 high-skill local jobs once all production phases are online.

EPA considers wastewater injection permit for Montana Renewables in Pondera County

Evans serves as vice president of government relations for Montana Renewables.

However, Pondera County officials oppose the proposal, citing environmental concerns.

""The commissioners had been assured this would be such a good thing for Pondera County, but the more we looked into it, we thought this if this wastewater migrated into any of the usable aquifers, it could be disastrous,"" Corrine Rose said.

Rose is the Pondera County sanitarian.

Evans said Montana Renewables will comply with all EPA requirements for water quality standards.

""What I can confirm is that what EPA requires from a water quality perspective, for any injection water, we will meet or exceed that,"" Evans said.

Rose also criticized how the EPA has characterized the community in its assessment.

""They characterize us as being, we're losing population and low population. Well, we're important too, and I agree that that's a little offensive. So that is not a reason to then use this area as a waste disposal site,"" Rose said.

We will update you as we get more information.

(JUNE 3, 2024) Many Pondera County and Rocky Mountain Front residents are concerned over a proposed plan to classify wells in the area to Class V, which would allow wastewater from Montana Renewables to be injected thousands of feet below into the Madison Aquifer.

Montalban Oil & Gas is seeking permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, so Montana Renewables can inject their wastewater into the earth.

Pondera County citizens concerned over proposed injection well plan

Montana Renewables create sustainable aviation fuel. To do so they clean feedstocks, creating a by-product referred to as ‘agricultural wash water’. They’re working with Montalban Oil & Gas who are looking to receive permits from the EPA to give the wells Class V distinction. This would permit the injection of treated non-hazardous waste which may have been hazardous prior. Water is taken from the Missouri river.

Some critics have called the extraction of water from the Missouri River to be resource shedding, and damaging to the ecosystem. The water that is pulled goes into an aquifer and not back into the river.

“They need to put up a treatment plant. So at least the City of Great Falls can use that water with that amount of water being taken out of the river,” says David Waldner, a Hutterite living in a colony just a mile or so from one of the proposed injection sites.

Some individuals are calling on Montana Renewables to invest in a treatment plant, so the water can be put back into the river rather than wasted. The company are due to receive a $600 million loan. With he money, they plan to upscale production instead. Montana Renewables have said they plan to submit a discharge permit application to treat their wastewater at the city of Great Falls Water Treatment Plant.

Water planned to be injected has been characterized by Montana Renewables as non-hazardous. Some people are unsure. The Pondera County Sanitarian, Corrine Rose, says despite multiple requests for a sample of injection fluid, she has been repeatedly denied.

When I spoke with Chad Anderson of the Montana DEQ, he told me that Montana Renewables has the responsibility to send in fluid for sampling and testing. With their current Class II permits, they send their sample to Montana Board of Oil & Gas. If the Class V permits are granted, they will send a sample to the EPA. Because the permits haven’t been granted, they have no legal obligation to share their samples with anybody else. If the injection permit is granted, a sample can be shared with the public by way of petition.

Critics who believe Montana Renewables are ‘hiding something’ by withholding their sample say this is counter-intuitive because at this point the fluid would already be in the process of being injected.

I received a letter from the CEO of Montana Renewables Bruce Fleming, which was also sent to Pondera County Commissioners. In it, he outlined a response to some concerns, especially those regarding the contamination of drinking wells. The letter states that the Madison Aquifer (where wastewater will be injected) is not drinkable and that the aquifer does not contact surface water supplies based off geology and experience. It also states the permit they hope to receive would put a ‘cap’ on the maximum quantity of water allowed for injection. The proposed amount being a “tiny fraction of a percent in an enormous, non-potable, deep aquifer.”

The EPA are no longer holding public comment sessions, and many living along the Rocky Mountain Front believe the permits will be granted imminently.

“They're willing to do this because there's not many people there.

The Urban Institute projects that in 2026, the average premium paid by individuals or households with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level (250 percent of the federal poverty level is $39,125 for an individual) would be $919, up from $169.
Premiums would more than double, from $1,171 to $2,455, for people with incomes from 250 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.
And they would nearly double, from $4,436 to $8,471, for people with incomes above 400 percent of the federal poverty level.
If Congress acts quickly, states can lock in lower premiums and spare families a wave of sticker shock this fall,” the letter said.","Without congressional action, more than 7 million people who buy their health insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces would pay much higher premiums next year. Close to 5 million of them wouldn’t be able to absorb the price hike – nor would they be able to afford to buy coverage anywhere else, according to a new analysis.

The study by the Urban Institute, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that in eight states (Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia) the number of people buying subsidized insurance from the marketplace would drop by at least half. Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic white people, and young adults would see the largest increases in the number of insured.

Enrollment in marketplace coverage surged from 11.4 million people in 2020 to 24.3 million this year, largely because of enhanced federal subsidies first made available by the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Unless Congress extends the subsidies, they will expire at the end of this year.

The Urban Institute projects that in 2026, the average premium paid by individuals or households with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level (250 percent of the federal poverty level is $39,125 for an individual) would be $919, up from $169. Premiums would more than double, from $1,171 to $2,455, for people with incomes from 250 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. And they would nearly double, from $4,436 to $8,471, for people with incomes above 400 percent of the federal poverty level.

Jessica Banthin, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said in an interview that the expiration of the tax credits would leave millions without access to any affordable health care options. She also noted that it likely would raise the cost of insurance for those who do remain on the marketplaces.

“People who are sicker will make the effort or find the money to stay enrolled,” Banthin said. “People who are healthier are more likely to leave the marketplace and either find another source of coverage or stay uninsured — they’re more likely to risk it.”

“And so what that means is the people remaining in the marketplace are a little bit sicker on average than they were before, and that means the risk pool is more costly, and premiums go up across the board.”

Last week, Democratic governors from 18 states sent a letter to congressional leaders of both parties, urging them to extend the subsidies.

“The timing couldn’t be more urgent. Insurers are already setting 2026 rates. If Congress acts quickly, states can lock in lower premiums and spare families a wave of sticker shock this fall,” the letter said. “If not, the damage will be felt for years.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-09-24 14:03:41.194410

It was not immediately clear which funds were being targeted. The department did not immediately respond to a request for more details.

""By returning these funds to the American taxpayer, the Trump administration is affirming its commitment to advancing more affordable, reliable and secure American energy and being more responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars,"" the department said.

President Donald Trump dismissed climate change as ""the greatest con job"" in the world during his address to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, doubling down on his skepticism of global environmental initiatives and multilateral institutions.

Trump has pushed to maximize the output of oil and gas, which were already at record production when he returned to office in January, while cutting subsidies for renewable energy and EVs.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright mentioned cancelling the funds in a press conference in New York earlier in the day. Wright said Trump sent a message that the UN and many countries ""have just gotten wildly off track with climate change, exaggerating it into the world's greatest threat. It has spurred massive amounts of spending with very little positive impact.""

But jobs in solar, wind and other clean energy industries grew three times faster than in the rest of the U.S. workforce in 2024, said a study published by environmental advocacy group E2, last week, saying that many of them could go due to Trump's efforts to block renewables.

Wright also said that he has no plans to go to UN climate talks in Brazil in November. But Wright said he enjoys talking about energy and climate with people who see things differently than him, so ""nothing is impossible"" when it comes to his participation in Brazil.

It would help companies ""jump through the hoops,"" he said, putting business owners and others in touch with local economic development officials and assisting them with navigating regulations rather than ""picking winners and losers.""
Other proposals listed in Leonard's plan include: Ending mandatory implicit bias training for health care professionals, which Whitmer ordered in 2020.","LANSING — Michigan should replace its economic development agency with a customer-driven entity focused on helping businesses without targeting individual companies for grants and other incentives, Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Leonard said.

Leonard wants to do away with the Michigan Economic Development Corp, a quasi-governmental agency, in favor of the Michigan Business Action Center. It is among 58 recommendations in his policy agenda released Wednesday, a blueprint he wanted to put out early, he said, to be transparent with voters, to show he is passionate about governing and to present a ""positive vision focused on real solutions to solve problems.""

Other proposals include restoring the ""right-to-work"" law that Democrats repealed in 2023, confronting the literacy crisis with moves such as promoting kids to 4th grade only when benchmarks are met, cutting the 4.25% state income tax to 3.9% and ultimately phasing it out, adopting universal occupational license reciprocity and redirecting ""corporate welfare"" incentives to road funding.

""The scope would be completely refocused,"" Leonard told Crain's of economic development efforts. ""Instead of having a department that hands out hundreds of millions of dollars to select companies, sometimes at the cost of $400,000 per job, this Michigan Business Action Center would be what I would deem a customer service center for all businesses large and small.""

It would help companies ""jump through the hoops,"" he said, putting business owners and others in touch with local economic development officials and assisting them with navigating regulations rather than ""picking winners and losers.""

Leonard, a former House speaker who is one of six Republicans, three Democrats and one independent running for governor, said he is not opposed to state-funded business development programs ""as long as it's fair for everybody,"" adding that he supports things like workforce education and certification.

He criticized giving individual businesses cash or tax breaks up front for jobs and investment but said he backs transformational brownfield plans in which developers put money in and, if successful, get a tax cut on the back end. If they fail, he said, taxpayers are ""not out anything.""

The MEDC's Business Development and Community Revitalization programs, which are funded at $100 million, are in limbo during an ongoing budget impasse in the Capitol that might lead to a partial government shutdown next week.

Second-term Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who cannot run again in 2026 due to term limits, proposed keeping them intact. The Republican-led House's budget would eliminate all $100 million. The Democratic-controlled Senate's budget would slash the funding by $59 million.

Leonard said the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, which was created in 2021, should be eliminated immediately and the money spent on fixing roads and bridges. Automatic $500 million annual deposits into the account are due to end in the coming fiscal year, though Whitmer last week renewed her call for ""new job-creating tools"" to stay competitive with other states and countries.

Leonard said ""subsidies is not the answer. It is the right regulatory and licensure environment, making Michigan a right-to-work state and (having) the right tax environment but also making certain that you have an educated workforce. We've got to address this third-grade reading crisis, and we've got to do something to bring more skilled trades workers into the state of Michigan.""

Other proposals listed in Leonard's plan include:

Ending mandatory implicit bias training for health care professionals, which Whitmer ordered in 2020.

Providing property tax relief by giving competitive grants to local governments and schools that consolidate services; protecting caps even when homes are sold and taxes ""pop up""; and requiring all millage requests to appear on ballots in November of even-numbered years, when turnout is highest.

They’re all urging the EPA—led by former New York State Assemblymember and former Congressmember Lee Zeldin—to abandon the proposal and maintain current climate protections.
The endangerment finding established that greenhouse gas emissions threaten public welfare, and served as the basis for many regulations under the Clean Air Act.
Per the EPA, current greenhouse gas standards increase prices, limit consumer choice, and keep old vehicles on the road.
Here’s the letter from James and the other AGs: And here’s the letter from New York’s congressional Democrats:","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — New York Attorney General Letitia James and the state’s Democratic congressional delegation are working against a proposal by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to rescind a climate change finding. James, alongside attorneys general from over 20 states, both U.S. Senators from New York, and 18 members of the House of Representatives want to preserve the 2009 “endangerment finding” establishing greenhouse gas emissions as a threat to public health and welfare.

They’re all urging the EPA—led by former New York State Assemblymember and former Congressmember Lee Zeldin—to abandon the proposal and maintain current climate protections. Concerned over the EPA’s proposal to roll back the endangerment finding, the electeds published two separate letters to Zeldin and the EPA, available to read at the bottom of this story.

In a press release, James said, “Climate change is real, it is dangerous, and it is already hurting communities in New York and across the nation.” The EPA said that the regulations in question cost Americans $1 trillion in aggregate costs, plus an additional $54 billion each year.

The endangerment finding established that greenhouse gas emissions threaten public welfare, and served as the basis for many regulations under the Clean Air Act. The letter-writers insist that undermining the legal basis for the EPA’s climate regulations will make the environment less livable for New Yorkers. Under Zeldin, who prizes deregulation, the agency wants to repeal all greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles and engines.

Claiming that its prior scientific analysis was unreasonable, doubtful, and unreliable, the EPA said that it can’t actually set emission standards over climate concerns under the Clean Air Act. The agency uses several legal arguments, including the “major questions doctrine” saying that major policy decisions must be explicitly authorized by Congress and not left to regulatory agencies. EPA also claims its previous findings on fossil fuels were flawed because they considered a mix of gases, not just carbon dioxide in isolation.

EPA is basing its proposed rollback at least in part on the Climate Working Group report from the U.S. Department of Energy. It suggested that scientific climate models “run hot,” overestimating future warming. It also suggested that there are benefits to increased carbon dioxide in the world, such as promoting plant growth. Per the EPA, current greenhouse gas standards increase prices, limit consumer choice, and keep old vehicles on the road.

Attorney General James—leading prosecutors from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Washington D.C.—said that repealing the finding would violate established law, Supreme Court precedent, and broad scientific consensus. They contend that the known climate skeptics in DOE climate working group wrote an inaccurate report that didn’t meet scientific integrity standards.

The AG letter pointed to worsening risks of asthma, heart disease, and premature death without climate protections, especially among children, the elderly, and poor communities. James’s office also underscored a previous EPA analysis showing that current vehicle standards could prevent over 8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in the next 30 years, saving $1.82 trillion that would be spent to repair climate-related damage.

In their letter, the congressional delegation said that climate change is already affecting the state from Montauk to Niagara Falls. They pointed out specific climate-related events that have impacted the state since 2009, including Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee in 2011, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, Hurricane Ida in 2021, and historic snowstorms in Western New York in November and December 2022.

The delegation tallied average temperatures in New York as having risen by nearly 2.6 degrees since 1901 and will increase by as much as 11 degrees by 2100. This warming trend is particularly dangerous in cities. New York City’s urban heat island effect traps and intensifies heat, and days over 95 degrees will be 50 times likelier in Albany, Rochester, Syracuse, and Binghamton by the end of the century, they said.

The lawmakers—Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and Reps. Yvette Clarke, Adriano Espaillat, Dan Goldman, Hakeem Jeffries, Timothy Kennedy, George Latimer, John Mannion, Gregory Meeks, Grace Meng, Joseph Morelle, Jerrold Nadler, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Josh Riley, Patrick Ryan, Tom Suozzi, Paul Tonko, Ritchie Torres, and Nydia Velázquez—said that these disasters have already caused billions in damage to infrastructure, private property, and ecosystems statewide. They made the case that, as these events become stronger or more common, New Yorkers with worsening health conditions will be on the hook for recovery costs from heat waves and sea level rise: storms, wildfires, floods, and drought.

The letter also points out that hotter, more humid ecosystems are increasing tick populations, leading to more cases of Lyme disease and higher healthcare costs, especially on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley. The ocean also acidifies by absorbing carbon dioxide as temperatures go up, damaging coral reefs and shellfish, according to the attorneys general.

The state’s agriculture industries like apple orchards and dairy farms are also in the crosshairs of rising temperatures, and winter recreation industries are also threatened by less snowfall, they said. New York has more ski areas than any other state.

Plus, the legislators said repealing the endangerment finding would undo pollution limits on power plants and fuel operations, which are of “particular importance to the public health of New Yorkers.” Gas-fired plants generated 46% of the electricity in the Empire State in 2023.

Used EVs, eligible for a tax credit of up to $4,000, have also seen strong sales ahead of the deadline.

Inventories are shrinking because of the pull-ahead in demand, and many carmakers have indicated they'll cut EV production for the remainder of the year, further limiting availability.

The upshot: EV sales are widely expected to slow after Sept. 30.

Between the lines: A lull in EV sales could be well-timed because it can take years to get a single charging station up and running.

Local permitting and property acquisition take time, and utilities often need to first make expensive electrical upgrades.

Construction delays are also common.

After a slow start, the rollout of charging infrastructure is finally beginning to pick up steam.

""The flywheel is in motion,"" says GM's head of public charging, William Hotchkiss.

""We've got to make sure we don't lose momentum,"" he tells Axios. ""A potential slowdown in EV sales will allow infrastructure to catch up.""

By the numbers: A seminal 2023 study by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimated the U.S. will need 28 million charging ports by 2030 in order to support 33 million EVs (a ""mid-scenario"" EV adoption rate).

The vast majority of those chargers would be private — Level 1 and 2 ports located at single-family homes, apartments and workplaces.

About 1 million of them would be publicly accessible Level 2 chargers at retail stores, libraries, parking garages and other locations near high-density neighborhoods.

Also needed: 182,000 DC fast-chargers along highways and in metro areas to accommodate EV road trips, ride-share drivers and others in need of a quick recharge.

Where it stands: We've still got a long way to go.

The U.S. currently has about 228,000 public charging ports — less than one-quarter of the number we'll need.

Of those, roughly 62,000 are DC fast-chargers — a third of what's needed.

Caveat: Since EV sales have been slower than expected, those targets aren't particularly urgent.

Today, there are about 5 million EVs on the road in the U.S., per S&P Global Mobility — well short of NREL's assumption of 33 million by 2030.

The DOE lab hopes to update those targets in a future study, NREL researcher Eric Wood tells Axios.

What they're saying: ""Regardless of future EV sales, we have to address the underlying challenge that, as it stands, charging infrastructure lags behind demand,"" Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna, tells Axios.

Ionna, a joint venture between eight automakers, aims to build 30,000 charging bays by the end of 2030.

What to watch: After a six-month freeze, the Trump administration has resumed a Biden-era federal program to fund the installation of fast chargers along major highways.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, while nabbing a lot of attention, accounts for only a small sliver of the nation's future charging infrastructure.

Most chargers are being built via private investment by companies that include gas and convenience stores, retailers like Walmart, as well as automakers hoping to prime the pump for EV sales.

Instead of reviving rebates, Newsom stated that the state would redirect funds toward expanding charging infrastructure.

California’s focus shift

During a San Francisco event on September 19, where he signed six climate-related bills, Newsom outlined the state’s pivot, as noted in an Autoblog report. While reiterating California’s leadership in clean transportation, Newsom emphasized that cap-and-trade revenues would bolster charging investments rather than consumer incentives.

“We can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits. There are billions and billions of dollars through 2045 in the cap-and-trade program that continue to make those infrastructure investments, but not the direct subsidies, that we cannot make up for, that were eliminated under the federal program,” Newsom stated.

California’s EV sector

California accounted for about 27% of all U.S. EV sales in 2024, highlighting the state’s central role in adoption, as per data from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. Industry watchers have warned that without incentives, momentum could slow, though the success of Tesla’s vehicles like the Model Y suggests that good EVs could see success even without the federal tax credit.

Newsom also criticized Detroit automakers, singling out General Motors and CEO Mary Barra for what he described as “selling out” the state by opposing its 2035 ban on new gasoline vehicle sales. That regulation, known as Advanced Clean Cars II, is expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 35%, according to the California Air Resources Board.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) could deliver a stronger-than-expected third quarter, as per Wolfe Research, which stated that the EV maker’s vehicle deliveries could reach between 465,000 and 470,000 units this Q3 2025.

Such results would represent a 22% increase from Q2, topping consensus estimates of 445,000. “Q3 is poised to be a strong quarter,” the firm noted.

U.S. and China demand

In the U.S., Wolfe attributed part of the volume lift to consumers accelerating purchases ahead of the expiration of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit. On the other hand, China deliveries are also trending above prior expectations, with Wolfe estimating 165,000–170,000 deliveries in the region, or about 10,000 more than its earlier forecast, as noted n a Yahoo Finance report.

The firm noted that these figures do not yet include meaningful contributions from the newly launched Model Y L. “We estimate 165-170k deliveries in Q3, or ~10k above our prior est,” Wolfe stated, though these volumes “largely do not reflect the recent launch of the Model Y L.”

Earnings outlook

Wolfe noted that it expects Tesla’s Q3 earnings per share to fall between $0.55 and $0.60, which is above the current consensus of $0.49 per share. The firm forecasts automotive gross margins, excluding regulatory credits, of about 16.5% to 17%.

Looking ahead, Wolfe warned that Q4 could prove more challenging due to U.S. demand being pulled forward by tax incentives. Still, Wolfe suggested that factors like stronger seasonal demand in China and Europe could become tailwinds that could help the company’s volumes in the fourth quarter. The ramp and rollout of the Model Y L and upcoming affordable models could also help bolster the company’s Q4 volumes.

Tesla’s sales momentum in China is expected to rise this month, with Deutsche Bank estimating about 72,000 vehicle deliveries for September 2025.

Deutsche Bank’s estimate represents a 27% increase from August 2025, but is roughly flat compared to the same month last year.

Model Y L launch boosts order flow

Dealer feedback compiled by Deutsche Bank suggests that Tesla China’s new orders in September could reach around 73,000 units, which is roughly up 14% year-over-year, as noted in a CNEV Post report. The increase is attributed in no small part to the Model Y L, a six-seat long-wheelbase variant of the best-selling all-electric crossover that was launched last month.

Deliveries for the new model began earlier this September, with current orders scheduled for deliveries in November, as per Tesla China’s official website. Analysts also noted that the Model Y L could be a key driver of interest, particularly among larger households looking for vehicles that have higher seating capacity.

Tesla China’s insurance registrations

Tesla’s insurance registrations in China reached 46,950 units in the first three weeks of September 2025, pointing to a steady pace of deliveries for the month. For context, Tesla delivered 57,152 vehicles in August 2025, as per data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). That figure represents a decrease of about 10% year-on-year, but an increase of over 40% from July 2025’s 40,617 units.

Deutsche Bank’s September projection, if proven accurate, would mark Tesla’s strongest monthly performance since the summer slowdown. China is still critical to Tesla’s overall delivery outlook heading into Q4, and the best-selling Model Y is still expected to play a central role in the company’s sales in the country.

Elon Musk recently addressed his proposed Tesla 2025 CEO Performance Award on X, highlighting that his concerns are about influence, not personal wealth.

The 2025 CEO Performance Award, worth up to $900 billion in TSLA stock, could make Elon Musk the world’s first trillionaire, provided that he hits incredibly ambitious targets for the electric vehicle maker.

Tesla’s ambitious targets

Musk shared his thoughts in a response to an X post that referenced his compensation package. “It’s not about ‘compensation,’ but about me having enough influence over Tesla to ensure safety if we build millions of robots.

“If I can just get kicked out in the future by activist shareholder advisory firms who don’t even own Tesla shares themselves, I’m not comfortable with that future,” Musk wrote in his post.

Tesla’s new performance award would grant Musk shares as the company grows from today’s $1.1 trillion valuation to an incredible $8.5 trillion within a decade. At that level, Tesla would become the world’s largest company by valuation by a notable margin, eclipsing today’s top companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft.

Massive product goals

Elon Musk’s 2025 CEO Performance Award will not be easy to accomplish. To earn his award, Musk would have to lead Tesla an operating profit of $400 billion anually, a substantial increase from today’s $17 billion annually.

Musk’s influence would grow alongside Tesla’s valuation, with his stake rising from 13% to about 25%. Tesla’s board emphasized in its filing that retaining Musk is fundamental to hitting these milestones.

The package extends beyond financials, as it also ties compensation to milestones in Tesla’s core products and emerging technologies. These include the delivery of 20 million vehicles cumulatively, 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and the deployment of 1 million robots, and the rollout of 1 million Robotaxis.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/shell-ev-charging-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 13:03:40.323798

But now, environmental justice has come under fire from the Trump administration, as part of its overall attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
His attacks on diversity, equity, inclusion, and environmental justice are shredding support and protections from many angles.","Trump’s roll-backs of environmental justice funding and programs will directly harm communities already bearing the brunt of our country’s pollution.

Across the country, people are made to breathe noxious fumes and drink strange-tasting water that is making them sick. Perhaps it’s the nearby factory spewing pollution into the air, meatpacking plants dumping waste into rivers, or a cluster of oil refineries nearby. Many communities deal with multiple sources of pollution at once and outsized harm from climate disasters, too.

These problems are not distributed equally. Long legacies of discrimination and prejudice have corralled environmental burdens into Black, Brown, Indigenous, immigrant, rural, and low-income communities, bringing devastating illnesses as well.

The Biden administration, while it didn’t do nearly enough to redress those harms, took some historic first steps. But Trump is ruthlessly dismantling every bit of progress possible with cruel, targeted attacks on these environmental justice communities. Make no mistake — Trump’s rollbacks will cost lives.

Environmental Justice Communities Bear the Brunt of Polluting Industries

Dirty industries wreak havoc on our health across the country, and environmental justice communities bear the brunt by far. Folks in the Gulf Coast, for example, sit in the belly of the beast of the fossil fuel industry. Across Texas and Louisiana, this region has been inundated with polluting infrastructure.

In the town of Port Arthur, TX, residents have been forced to the frontlines of toxic pollution. Nearby sits the largest oil refinery in North America, along with two others. The liquefied natural gas and plastic industries are now also booming in the region.

These industries spew millions of pounds of pollutants into air and lungs, including toxic particulates and carcinogens like benzene and ethylene oxide. Port Arthur residents face a cancer risk 190 times higher than what the Environmental Protection Agency deems “acceptable.”

Gulf Coast communities take a double hit — first from the industry’s toxic air pollution and then from hurricanes and storms fueled by fossil fuel-driven climate change. Hurricane Harvey damaged or destroyed more than 80% of homes in Port Arthur and its neighbor, Beaumont.

These attacks on residents’ health and well-being are another chapter in the long story of racism and classism in this country.

Nationwide, kids in communities of color have asthma at seven times the rate of kids in mostly white communities, by one analysis. Environmental justice communities are less likely to have clean, running water or functioning sewage systems.

They’re also at higher risk during all sorts of climate disasters. For example, one study found that from 2004 to 2018, Indigenous people saw the highest rate of heat-related deaths, followed by Black people.

Environmental justice programs and policies were designed to bring relief and resources to these communities. But Trump’s actions will make matters worse for them. More people will get sick and die.

Trump’s Multi-Pronged Attack on Environmental Justice

For decades, environmental justice organizations have fought for the health and environment of their communities. The Biden administration finally started taking heed.

The Justice 40 initiative, for example, put down a marker. It committed to ensuring that 40% of the benefit from federal investment in housing and clean energy go to environmental justice communities that have been historically overburdened with pollution.

Policies like this were passed to reverse discrimination and injustices. But now, environmental justice has come under fire from the Trump administration, as part of its overall attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion. His claims that environmental justice policies are “discriminatory” are insulting.

Providing federal support to these communities is essential to making amends. It’s a key part of achieving a world in which everyone — no matter their background, ethnicity, or class — has access to clean air, clean water, sustainable food, and a livable future.

Rather than create a brighter future, Trump is dragging us back into a dark past. His attacks on diversity, equity, inclusion, and environmental justice are shredding support and protections from many angles. In just a few months, Trump has kneecapped decades of progress by:

1. Attacking the very foundations of federal action on environmental justice.

In January, Trump struck down an executive order that, for more than 30 years, required agencies to consider how their decisions would affect the health and environment of people of color and low-income communities. This executive order formed the basis for many agency rules written to protect these communities. Now, those rules are more vulnerable to being struck down.

2. Letting polluters that are harming environmental justice communities off the hook.

The Trump administration has shamelessly used its opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion as cover for letting polluters off the hook. For example, it terminated a Biden-era lawsuit against a plastic plant in Louisiana that connected the plant’s pollution with the elevated cancer risk of nearby majority-Black residents. By dropping the lawsuit, the Trump administration claimed it was fulfilling its aims of dismantling “radical DEI programs.”

3. Firing and reassigning federal workers dedicated to reducing pollution and delivering justice.

In January, the Trump administration issued a memo directing agencies to cut jobs dedicated to environmental justice and diversity, equity, and inclusion. A month later, Trump eliminated the Office of Environmental Justice at the Department of Justice, which supported communities in fighting polluters in court.

In March, he completely shuttered the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) environmental justice arm and shut down 10 regional offices, impacting low-income rural communities. The staff in these regional offices worked on the ground with local groups and communities to address pollution.

Soon after, Trump’s EPA announced it would take more than 350 additional workers off the job of tackling pollution in environmental justice communities.

4. Rolling back policies that made environmental justice a major priority.

Early on in his presidency, Trump rescinded a suite of Biden’s executive orders that created an unprecedented focus on environmental justice. Among the programs cut was the aforementioned Justice40 initiative.

5. Cancelling funding for every single one of the EPA’s environmental justice grants.

These nearly 800 grants promised funding for projects to monitor, prevent, and clean up pollution in environmental justice communities, among other goals. In June, a group of nonprofits, Tribes, and local governments sued the Trump administration for canceling $3 billion in funding for 350 Environmental and Climate Justice Grant programs.

In particular, Trump has stopped projects that would have

Monitored air pollution in communities from oil refineries, heavy industry, fracking operations, and highways;

Built resilience hubs that would have provided food, educational opportunities, healthcare, electricity, laundry facilities, and shelter to low-income communities during climate disasters;

Installed wastewater systems in majority-Black Alabama communities where folks can’t afford them and must pipe raw sewage onto their lawns;

Planted trees to help clean the air and provide shade through increasingly hot summers (in cities nationwide, communities of color have fewer trees and endure hotter temperatures in heatwaves);

Built infrastructure to deliver clean, safe water to rural Latino communities in California that have long-relied on wells and small systems delivering pesticide-contaminated water;

Provided electric transit and home air quality upgrades to a predominantly Latino community in San Diego plagued with traffic pollution from nearby highways and industry;

Prevented flooding and erosion due to melting permafrost that threatens critical infrastructure for the Native Village of Kipnuk;

and much, much more.

Trump Is Attacking Communities’ Agency

Crucially, many environmental justice policies were designed not only to benefit communities but also to bring them to the table. For decades, our government and corporations have made development decisions while bulldozing over the needs and wishes of residents — from highways that slashed through majority-Black neighborhoods, to factory farms built right beside rural communities.

Taking the lead from grassroots groups and residents is therefore an essential part of environmental justice. Local communities know what’s best for them and should have a say in decisions about their communities and their land.

Notably, this is a key tenet of our bedrock environmental law, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires the government to take community input on major projects and has allowed residents to stop polluting projects in their communities.

But Trump is taking an axe to this law for the sake of fast-tracking corporate development and fossil fuel drilling. He has also explicitly directed agencies to stop environmental justice analyses when reviewing new projects under NEPA.

Trump isn’t content with taking away people’s health — he’s going after their agency and local democracy, too.

Oppose Trump’s Cruel Cuts to Environmental Justice!

Trump’s rampage against environmental justice programs will have terrible consequences across the country. Worse, when combined with his other policies, these environmental justice cuts become even crueler.

His Big, Ugly bill will kick millions off Medicaid, make healthcare more expensive, and shut down rural hospitals. At the same time, people will continue getting sick, as the government lets corporate polluters have their way with our air and water.

As with all of his agenda, Trump’s intentions are clear: make life worse for the rest of us, especially our most vulnerable neighbors, while clearing the way for more corporate profits. It’s more important than ever for us to stand with environmental justice groups and communities.

We need to fight these Trump policies that put lives and futures at risk. And we need to stop the industries that have harmed these communities for too long.

Bobby Scott (VA-03), U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan (VA-04), U.S. Rep. Don Beyer (VA-08), U.S. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (VA-10) and U.S. Rep. James Walkinshaw (VA-11) on Monday joined Protect Our Care Virginia to discuss the ongoing Trump-GOP health care disaster and the urgent need to stop GOP premium hikes by making Affordable Care Act enhanced Premium Tax Credits permanent. Without action from Congress, the enhanced Premium Tax Credits will expire at the end of this year.

Enhanced Premium Tax Credits have helped make health insurance affordable for326,268 Virginians enrolled in coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and eliminating them would make health care out of reach for too many, forcing Virginians to choose between health care and other basic necessities.

While nearly 9 out of 10 Virginia shoppers qualify for these income-based enhanced Premium Tax Credits (with some paying as little as $10 per month for a plan), insurance companies are seeking to raise premiums for all shoppers as they are anticipating a smaller and sicker pool of people if the credits are allowed to expire. Most of the companies who have agreed to participate in Virginia’s marketplace in 2026 have proposed average rate increases of 20% or higher to account for those who will no longer be able to afford to buy health insurance once they lose their tax credits.

Republicans have already broken their promise to bring down costs for everyday Americans by slashing funding for Medicaid in their Big Ugly Law, and they will continue to drive up costs if they take these tax credits away. Families across the country are already paying the price of the Trump-GOP budget bill and have spoken loudly and clearly that they oppose Republicans’ ongoing assaults on health care.Three rural health clinics in Virginia have already closed as a result of the Big Ugly Law, while six rural hospitals remain at risk of closure. 350,000 Virginians are projected to lose their health care as a result of the health care cuts, but that number can be mitigated with the permanent extension of the enhanced Premium Tax Credits.

“We must stop the upcoming Republican premium hikes,”said Congressman Scott.“Without action from Congress, the enhanced Premium Tax Credits will expire at the end of this year, and the health care costs will increase for more than 326,000 Virginians. Many will face unaffordable premium increases … those that are sick will pay the higher prices. Those that are healthy might drop out, which means that the insurance pool will be sicker and they’ll have to charge higher prices.”

“I was a member of the state Senate when we expanded Medicaid, and I also carried the bill to create the Virginia health care exchange,” said Congresswoman McClellan. “And the reason we did both, just like the reason the Affordable Care Act was passed in the first place, was because we understood that costs go down when the uninsured rate goes down. The more people who have access to health insurance, the more likely they are to get the care they need before it’s too late, or before it’s too expensive …. And yet, with this bill, so many people will not be able to afford health insurance or will lose it all together – over 15 million people – but they’ll still get sick, and instead of going and getting primary care or going when something first feels wrong, they’ll show up in the emergency room when it may be too late, and it’s definitely more expensive to treat, and if they’re uninsured and they can’t pay that bill, the rest of us pay for it.”

“I think one of the benefits that is not discussed enough is the benefit of the exchanges to entrepreneurs and folks who are self-employed,” said Congressman Walkinshaw.“By some estimates, 25% of folks who are on the Affordable Care Act exchanges are self-employed, and for many of them, it’s the existence of the exchanges and the affordability of the insurance on the exchanges that has allowed them to take that leap to start a business. And that’s something I hear my Republican colleagues talk about a lot … they say we should be encouraging entrepreneurship and business creation in this country. Well, if you take away affordable health care on the exchanges, millions of Americans who would like to start their own business will no longer be able to do it. And by the way, some folks who have a small business today who are doing the hardest thing you can do – get a small business off the ground — they’re learning that they might not be able to afford to keep that business going because of the Republican assault on health care.”

“[Republicans] are at it again. They’re coming at our health insurance, and I am one of the millions of Americans that is terrified of opening the mailbox and getting the sheet of paper that says what my premiums will be next year, because as a cancer survivor, I have to pay it,” said Laura Packard of Alexandria. “I cannot go without health insurance. So whatever they charge me, it’s what I have to pay, and if I get no help with paying for it, then I have to decide how I’m going to somehow pay for this health insurance. So millions of people are going to be going through this right now, and lives are at stake. So Republicans in Congress need to do the right thing and extend the tax subsidies now.”

“Many in the hospitality industry like myself rely on these credits to stay healthy and insured,” saidLester Johnson, who owns a restaurant in Richmond. “Before the Affordable Care Act, it was hard for small business owners and self-employed people to get health insurance, but this law has been a much-needed resource to me and my employees. I was able to sign up for a plan, and I have employees who are able to get their insurance through the marketplace as well. Premiums have been affordable for me as well as my staff … We do not want to have to come back and keep fighting this fight every year. So please make these tax credits permanent to give the small businesses and working people one less thing to worry about. Times are already tough, and we cannot afford to lose our health care.”

The program is designed to serve individuals who face barriers to employment, including those who are underemployed, formerly justice-involved or lack postsecondary education. Organizers aim to enroll 100 residents in the full training and certification program over the next three years.

James Taylor, CEO of John Boner Neighborhood Centers, said the initiative has the potential to change the trajectory of many families in the area.

“KeyBank’s investment in the IndyEast Economic Mobility District is a game-changer for our neighborhoods, connecting residents to sustainable, in-demand careers and strengthening our local economy,” Taylor said. “Together with Southeast Community Services and Edna Martin Christian Center, we are creating pathways to prosperity through the Green Jobs Workforce Initiative. This effort is about more than training — it’s about opportunity and long-term stability for families. By preparing residents for success in the green economy, we are opening doors for individuals who have historically faced barriers to employment, while building a more sustainable future for the neighborhoods we call home.”

Participants who complete the program will leave with valuable credentials, including certifications such as the OSHA 30-hour certificate and the Association of Energy Engineers’ Energy Auditor Certificate. Program leaders have set a goal for at least 85% of enrolled participants to complete the program, with at least 80% earning at least one industry-recognized certification.

To track progress and ensure effectiveness, organizers plan to measure outcomes such as participation rates, program satisfaction and long-term impact on participants. An independent third-party evaluator will also be brought in to assess the program.

Yvonne Harrington, corporate responsibility officer at KeyBank, said the initiative aligns with the company’s dual focus on economic mobility and environmental sustainability.

“At KeyBank, we believe economic mobility and environmental sustainability go hand in hand,” Harrington said. “Our support of the Green Jobs Workforce Initiative reflects our commitment to investing in the communities we serve by helping to create pathways to living-wage careers. This program will equip individuals with the essential skills needed for the green economy, strengthen families and help revitalize neighborhoods.”

The investment comes as demand for green jobs continues to grow in Indiana and across the country. By equipping residents with the skills to meet this demand, program leaders hope to create lasting economic and environmental benefits for Indianapolis communities.

KeyBank’s involvement also reflects its broader commitment to community investment. The company, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is celebrating its bicentennial in 2025. KeyBank is one of the nation’s largest bank-based financial services companies, with assets of approximately $185 billion as of June 30. It operates in 15 states through a network of about 1,000 branches and 1,200 ATMs.

Tennessee remains among the nation’s top four states for highest number of anticipated electric vehicle manufacturing jobs despite slowing industry investments, disappearing tax incentives and federal policy uncertainty, according to a new report on electric transportation in the Southeast.

The state held onto its title as runner-up for the most anticipated EV manufacturing jobs in the southeast region, with 16,262 anticipated jobs compared to top-ranking Georgia’s 26,428.

Tennessee’s place in the rankings is largely due to 5,800 jobs promised by Ford Motor Company and SK On’s BlueOval City and BlueOval SK, an electric vehicle and battery manufacturing plant in rural West Tennessee. In return for the $5.6 billion project, Tennessee offered a $900 million incentive package. While battery production at the new plant is moving forward, mass production of Ford’s next-generation electric pickup truck is now delayed until 2028 due to the company’s shift in focus to smaller, more affordable electric models.

Lengthening timelines and industry pressure to create more affordable vehicles are themes highlighted in the Sept. 10 report, which is the sixth-annual study of transportation electrification in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based data analysis firm, prepared the report for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a renewable energy advocacy nonprofit.

The rapid injection of EV manufacturing investments coincided with tax incentives passed under former President Joe Biden’s administration, which likely sped up investments that companies already planned to make, Atlas Public Policy founder Nick Nigro said in a webcast following the report’s release.

But tax incentives of up to $7,500 for EV consumers will now sunset on Sept. 30 as part of the Trump administration’s budget reconciliation bill — named the One Big, Beautiful Bill — passed by Congress this summer, adding to market uncertainty.

The report shows continued momentum from southeastern states, where companies have announced an all-time total of $78.8 billion in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing investments as of June 30. That momentum has slowed considerably, according to the report, with new investments in the southeast region over the last 12 months totaling $4.8 billion, less than a third of the previous year’s $15.2 billion.

The “huge jumps in manufacturing investments” over the last few years when companies began building more domestic-based supply chains were not sustainable, Nigro said.

“There was no doubt there was going to be a natural slowdown … because that’s the normal course of business,” he said. “The question we need to keep in mind as we look ahead is how many of these potential cancellations that are happening now and into the future are because of federal policy, or just because of the normal cycle of business?”

Nigro said it’s too soon to tell.

In the meantime, Tennessee continues to make progress in building out public electric vehicle charging infrastructure, though it still lags behind the charger-per-person rates of the nation and other southeastern states.

Tennessee, like other states, has also seen companies pause or retract investments and planned jobs.

Piedmont Lithium announced in August 2024 that it scrapped plans for an $800 million investment for a lithium hydroxide processing facility in Southeastern Tennessee that would have created around 147 jobs. This is the sole Tennessee cancellation mentioned in the report, which includes data through June.

General Motors announced in September that it would temporarily lay off 700 workers at its Spring Hill assembly plant due to a temporary production slowdown for the Cadillac Lyriq, along with reduced production for its Vistiq EV. Tenneco, an auto parts manufacturer that supplies the GM plant, reported that it would lay off 82 workers in its own Spring Hill facility.

Volkswagen similarly announced that it would furlough around 160 employees and pause production of its electric SUV to align “production volume to market demand,” the Chattanooga Times Free Press reported earlier this month.

What will happen when tax credits sunset? Time will tell.

Nigro said about 80% of EV manufacturing facilities the report tracked in the southeast are already operating in some capacity or undergoing construction. The key question, he said, is whether demand will support full production at these facilities.

Stan Cross, electric transportation policy director with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said it’s too early to tell how the market will react to the end of EV consumer tax credits.

“What we do know is that when we look at adoption of electric vehicles, sticker price remains a top barrier for consumers and fleet operators, even though owning an EV is much cheaper over time,” Cross said.

Nigro estimates that less than half of the electric vehicles sold in the last year qualified for the tax credit — which gives incentives for the purchase of vehicles with responsibly sourced components and North American assembly — indicating consumers are willing to pay for electric vehicles without the incentive.

Industry orgs: Budget bill’s electric vehicle tax credit rollback could hamper Tennessee momentum

Energy market analysis firm Benchmark reported in July that about half of the EVs sold in the United States were eligible for the new clean vehicle tax credit in 2025.

But the “Transportation Electrification in the Southeast” report also notes that most of the southeast’s highest-selling models were eligible for the full or partial tax credit in 2025.

“It’s going to make it tougher for some vehicles to be sold,” Nigro said, adding that companies may embrace more aggressive pricing or find other ways to squeeze costs out of production.

A manufacturing tax credit remains in place for batteries, though with tighter restrictions on foreign material sources.

“The Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure Law, and even the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) signaled to the market that if EVs are going to be purchased by Americans, ideally they’re built with as much domestic content as possible,” Nigro said.

Cross surmised that the sunsetting tax credits may provide a temporary boost to EV sales.

“We’re seeing a real run on EVs right now, as consumers see those tax credits dwindling, and I won’t be surprised if we see record-shattering third quarter sales here in the U.S. as a result,” he said.

Market share grows

Tennessee’s EV sales market share — the percentage of new vehicles purchased that are EVs — came in at 5.4%, a 35% annual growth from last year, according to the report.

This puts Tennessee in the middle of the pack, ranking fourth among the six southeastern states examined by the report. Tennessee’s market share ranks 31st in the nation.

The southeast region logged more than 912,000 cumulative EV sales during the study period, amounting to a market share of above 8%. Tennessee was responsible for 60,434 of those sales.

Charging infrastructure makes progress

Tennessee is ranked fourth in the region for number of electric vehicle chargers per person.

The state saw the lowest rate of growth in publicly accessible rapid EV chargers at 24% — a marked change from holding the highest growth rate of 60% last year.

Tennessee has 830 fast-charging ports and 1,897 slower charging ports, according to the report.

The state’s Fast Charge TN program supported EV charger installation at 35 now-operational charging sites along a 400-mile loop connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga. Another 18 sites are under development, and the application period for the program’s second round of funding recently closed. The program is funded through the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenue from the Tennessee Valley Authority and cost share from grant recipients.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/tennessee_lookout_articles_119/9fdd17bb38d2f2105917b5f5b287afaa,N,,2025-09-24 13:02:57.056778

About 30 people gathered on the first day of fall across from the DeWitt and Manlius solar farms along the Old Erie Canal.

Originally founded by Bill McKibben, an environmental activist, Sun Day was created to demonstrate that clean energy technologies are affordable, reliable and ready to deploy at scale.

“We're not acting enough in this country,” said George Lorefice with Climate Change Awareness and Action (CCAA). “Our federal administration is not promoting it, as a matter of fact, they're knocking it down.”

Starting Jan. 1, 2026, the Trump administration's “Big Beautiful Bill” will eliminate the 30% federal tax credit for homeowners who directly purchase solar systems.

The bill also prompted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to officially terminate $7 billion in federal funding for the Solar for All program, which was aimed at making solar affordable for low income households across the U.S.

Although funding for the Solar for All program was repealed, Lindsay Speer, with the Central Regional Planning Development Board and as leader of the EnergySmart CNY program, said she is thankful that New York remains committed to reducing its impact on climate change.

“There's still state tax credits for solar, there's still state tax credits for geothermal,” she enumerated, “and [New York keeps] working on the programs to help everybody.”

The passing of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, established a 30% federal tax credit for all solar projects until 2033, protecting solar energy development in New York.

From the Solar for All program, New York was meant to receive $250 million in federal funding. Regardless, according to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the state leads the U.S. on community solar and is on the path to installing 10 gigawatts of distributed solar by 2030.

The two hosts of the local inaugural Sun Day event, the CCAA and DeWitt Advisory Conservation Commission (DACC), drew attention to local renewable energy efforts.

The Town of DeWitt launched its solar farm five years ago and announced at the event that it officially runs 100% of its municipal electricity on solar energy.

“This array was specifically set up to satisfy the municipal electric needs for the town,” Sonia Kragh, member of DACC and chair of the sustainability committee for CCAA, said. “That means all the pumps that run water and sewage, the LED lights, things that run the buildings themselves, and now they've got electric charging stations for their town electric vehicles.”

According to the Town of DeWitt’s website, it is projected to save $70,000 per year on municipal electric energy costs.

“I wanted to shout out what DeWitt is doing to show we've paved the path we have a great sustainability policy and plan that you can follow,” Kragh said.

Following the launch of the DeWitt solar farm, the Town of Manlius launched its own solar array. Instead of supporting the municipal needs, its solar focus is on a community project, directly affecting the people of Manlius.

“The town saves 10% on its electric bill,” Katelyn Kriesel, with the town of Manlius said, “and over the lifetime of the project, the town will save or make over a million dollars.”

Krissel said hundreds of households signed up for the community solar project almost immediately, creating a waitlist.

“It's projects like these all around the country that will make a difference,” Krissel said. “We were so thrilled to be able to do the project successfully and to be a part of the climate solution.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/55fae82/2147483647/strip/true/crop/800x420+0+63/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9c%2F60%2F5d8237354e44aca2edb4a304a9d5%2Fsun-day-9-21-25mnunez.jpeg,N,,2025-09-24 13:03:10.075484

The C1, built on Harbinger’s commercial-grade electric truck platform that can be scaled for fleet deployment, is designed for municipalities, nonprofits, and government agencies for “mission-critical mobile operations” — from incident command and disaster response to on-the-ground public health services.

The C1 delivers continuous performance by pairing a first-of-its-kind electric-first solution with a gas-powered range extender to power both mobility and auxiliary systems, with roof-mounted solar and a dedicated house battery providing additional support.

The vehicle also is available on multiple wheelbases and on either an all-electric or plug-in hybrid chassis, with the latter getting up to 500 miles of range, according to Grounded.

“Expanding into government and health care fleets is a natural evolution for Grounded,” says Sam Shapiro, CEO of Grounded. “Today’s public safety, disaster response, and public health teams need more payload, more range, and more flexibility than smaller platforms can deliver. The C1 is our answer — it’s an electrified powerhouse that delivers sustainability without sacrificing mission readiness.”

Grounded’s C1 mobile command center operates as a sustainable forward hub with “secure communications, reliable power, and the mobility” to coordinate responses during severe weather, large events, or multi-agency emergencies.

It also can be upfitted as a mobile clinic, allowing municipalities and nonprofits to deliver mammograms, vaccinations, screenings, and other preventative services directly in the community. A flexible interior creates space for health care teams to expand access in underserved neighborhoods and mobilize quickly during public health surges.

The vehicle’s third primary mission is as a rapid deployment vehicle for disasters. It’s designed to provide resilience and adaptability with extended range, off-grid power, and modular interiors that can support shelter coordination, supply distribution, and emergency relief efforts.

The C1 is available on multiple wheelbases and on either an all-electric or plug-in hybrid chassis.

“For long shifts in the field, durability alone isn’t enough,” says Nadia Meyer, chief product officer at Grounded. “Design matters, too. Human-centered design for the C1 puts intuitive systems and ergonomic layouts first, enabling responder comfort, endurance, and the ability to act faster when it matters most.”

The C1 promises to deliver continuous performance by pairing a first-of-its-kind electric-first solution with a gas-powered range extender to power both mobility and auxiliary systems; roof-mounted solar panels and a dedicated house battery provide additional support.

The vehicle also is equipped with front pedestrian braking, parking assist, and lane-keeping support to enhance fleet safety and protect both drivers and communities. Integrated Starlink delivers secure, high-speed communications anywhere.

Every C1 comes with Harbinger’s platform warranty (eight years/100,000 miles) and a Grounded interior warranty, with national serviceability through Harbinger’s growing network. Charging compatibility spans CCS-enabled networks such as Ford and Electrify America, with additional access to Tesla Superchargers.

The Grounded+ App is tailored to further enhances fleet visibility by providing remote monitoring of energy usage, appliance control, real-time diagnostics, and optimization tools that empower operators to manage costs and prevent failures before they occur.

This development underscores the strategic importance of the company's Thacker Pass project in Nevada, heralded as the largest known measured lithium resource globally, and signals a robust commitment from Washington to secure a domestic supply chain for critical minerals essential for the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) industry.

The news has sent ripples through the financial markets, highlighting the intricate dance between geopolitical strategy, energy transition, and corporate valuation. It positions Lithium Americas at the forefront of the nation's efforts to reduce reliance on foreign lithium sources, particularly amidst ongoing global supply chain vulnerabilities and intense competition for raw materials.

U.S. Government Eyes Equity in LAC: A Strategic Pivot for Critical Minerals

On September 24, 2025, Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) saw its stock price skyrocket by an impressive 68% to 92.51% in pre-market trading, following reports that the Trump administration is actively negotiating for up to a 10% equity stake in the company. This potential government investment is reportedly tied to a reassessment of the existing $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), initially secured in October 2024 for the construction of processing facilities at the Thacker Pass project. The DOE's review, prompted by evolving market conditions and concerns over competition from cheaper Chinese lithium, has also reportedly pushed General Motors (NYSE: GM) for more binding offtake agreements.

This strategic move by the U.S. government signifies a profound commitment to bolstering domestic critical mineral production. Thacker Pass is not just a mining project; it's a cornerstone of American energy independence, projected to produce over eight times the current U.S. output of lithium carbonate for EV batteries. The project, which commenced major construction in early 2025 with Phase 1 targeted for completion in late 2027, has already attracted substantial private investment, including a $250 million strategic investment from Orion Resource Partners in April 2025 and a $625 million investment from General Motors (NYSE: GM) in December 2024, granting GM a 38% stake and a 20-year offtake agreement for 100% of Phase 1 production. While the stock has seen recent volatility, including a 7.84% downturn on September 23, 2025, due to concerns about increased lithium supply from a Chinese mine, its year-over-year performance shows a 31.76% increase, reflecting underlying investor confidence in its long-term prospects.

How a Government Stake Could Electrify the Market

The potential direct equity involvement of the U.S. government in Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) could have a transformative effect on the broader lithium market and the electric vehicle supply chain. This move de-risks the Thacker Pass project significantly, providing an unparalleled level of political and financial backing that could accelerate its development and operational timeline. For the United States, it represents a monumental step towards securing a reliable, domestic source of lithium, drastically reducing its current heavy reliance on imports, predominantly from Chile and Argentina. This strategic independence is crucial for national security and economic stability in an era defined by geopolitical competition for critical resources.

Companies deeply embedded in the EV ecosystem, particularly those committed to North American supply chains, stand to gain immensely. General Motors (NYSE: GM), already a major stakeholder and offtake partner, would see its investment further solidified and its long-term lithium supply secured, potentially giving it a competitive edge. Other domestic EV manufacturers and battery producers could also benefit from the increased availability of U.S.-sourced lithium, fostering innovation and growth within the American industrial base. Conversely, foreign lithium producers, particularly those in regions currently dominating the supply chain, might face increased competition in the lucrative U.S. market as domestic production ramps up. The long-term impact could also include a degree of price stabilization as a major new supply source comes online, although short-term market dynamics will continue to be influenced by global supply-demand balances.

Broader Implications: A New Era for U.S. Critical Minerals

The U.S. government's potential equity stake in Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) transcends a mere financial transaction; it signals a profound shift in national industrial policy towards a more interventionist approach in critical mineral supply chains. This event fits squarely into a broader global trend where nations are increasingly prioritizing resource security, driven by the accelerating transition to clean energy and the electrification of transportation. The lithium market itself has been a microcosm of this volatility, experiencing dramatic price swings—from all-time highs in 2021-2023 to a steep decline in 2024 due to oversupply, now showing signs of recovery in 2025 with projections of tighter markets by 2026.

This strategic intervention by the U.S. government could set a precedent for future collaborations between public and private sectors in developing other critical mineral projects, potentially sparking a wave of investment and innovation across the domestic mining and processing industries. It also sends a clear message to international competitors, particularly China, about America's resolve to build resilient and independent supply chains. The ripple effects could extend to regulatory frameworks, potentially leading to more streamlined permitting processes for critical mineral projects and increased incentives for domestic production. Historically, government involvement in strategic industries has often accelerated development and ensured national interests are met, and this move with LAC could be seen as a modern-day equivalent, adapting to the demands of the 21st-century energy landscape.

What Readers Should Pay Attention to Next

As the situation unfolds, investors and industry observers should closely monitor several key developments. The immediate focus will be on the finalization of any equity agreement between the U.S. government and Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC), including the specific terms and conditions. This will provide clarity on the extent of government involvement and its implications for LAC's corporate governance and strategic direction. Furthermore, continued progress at the Thacker Pass project remains paramount. Watch for announcements regarding construction milestones, the first draw on the DOE loan (anticipated in Q3 2025), and any updates on the project's timeline and budget.

Beyond company-specific news, the broader lithium market dynamics will continue to influence LAC's performance. Keep an eye on global lithium prices, which are projected to climb in the coming years after a period of decline. Shifts in electric vehicle demand, technological advancements in battery chemistry, and new supply coming online from other regions will all play a role. Finally, any further policy directives or legislative actions from the U.S. government aimed at bolstering critical mineral independence will be crucial, as they could create additional opportunities or challenges for Lithium Americas and the wider industry.

Conclusion: A Defining Moment for U.S. Lithium

The potential U.S. government equity stake in Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) marks a pivotal moment for the company and the broader landscape of American critical mineral independence. This strategic move not only validates the immense potential of the Thacker Pass project but also underscores a decisive shift in national policy to secure essential resources for the clean energy transition. While the road ahead will undoubtedly present challenges, including navigating market volatility and ensuring timely project execution, the strong backing from both private investors like General Motors (NYSE: GM) and now potentially the U.S. government positions Lithium Americas for a defining role in shaping the future of the domestic lithium supply chain.

Investors should recognize the dual nature of this opportunity: significant upside potential driven by strategic national interest and a world-class resource, balanced against the inherent risks of large-scale mining development and fluctuating commodity markets. The coming months will be critical as details of the government's involvement emerge and as Thacker Pass continues its journey towards becoming a cornerstone of America's electric future. The success of this venture could serve as a blueprint for future public-private partnerships aimed at strengthening national resource security and accelerating the global shift towards sustainable energy.

Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas from fossil fuel burning, does not directly damage health, but leads to global heating.
However, coal and oil burning for power generation, and the burning of fossil fuels in industrial facilities, pollute the air with particulate matter called PM2.5, which has serious health impacts when breathed in.
Al Gore, a former US vice-president and co-founder of Climate Trace, said there was a clear link between human health and fossil fuel burning.
The particulate air pollution they also create falls downwind into surrounding neighbourhoods and is causing the deaths of 8.7 million people per year,” he said.","Fossil fuel burning is not just damaging the world’s climate; it is also threatening the health of at least 1.6 billion people through the toxic pollutants it produces, data shows.

Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas from fossil fuel burning, does not directly damage health, but leads to global heating. However, coal and oil burning for power generation, and the burning of fossil fuels in industrial facilities, pollute the air with particulate matter called PM2.5, which has serious health impacts when breathed in.

A new interactive map from Climate Trace, a coalition of academics and analysts that tracks pollution and greenhouse gases, shows that PM2.5 and other toxins are being poured into the air near the homes of about 1.6 billion people. Of these, about 900 million are in the path of “super-emitting” industrial facilities – including power plants, refineries, ports and mines – that deliver outsize doses of toxic air.

The organisation highlighted 10 urban areas particularly badly affected by super-emitters, including Karachi in Pakistan; Guangzhou in China; Seoul in South Korea; and New York in the US, where leaders from around the world are meeting this week for the UN general assembly.

Raising the alarm over air pollution is seen by some in the US as a way to counter Donald Trump’s moves to dismantle work by the federal government aimed at tackling the climate crisis. The US president has shut down federal climate programmes, ordered an end to renewable energy projects, and issued a climate report that scientists called a “mockery”.

At the UN general assembly on Tuesday, he denounced climate science as a “con job”. His words were swiftly refuted by scientists.

But Trump’s government claims to be willing to consider some forms of combating pollution. His environmental adviser Ed Russo gave an address to the climate week hosted by Brazil last month in Rio de Janeiro, before Brazil’s presidency of the Cop30 climate summit this November. Russo referred approvingly to the fight against pollution from waste dumps, landfills and other sources. “The impacts of pollution are the critical problem in all of this,” he said, in a video message. “We have to clean up the messes that we made and stop pollution at its source.”

However, he did not say how the Trump administration would seek to clean up toxins, and environmental groups are concerned at the apparent stripping of protections for clean water and air amid restructuring and rollbacks at the main regulatory body, the US Environmental Protection Agency.

Al Gore, a former US vice-president and co-founder of Climate Trace, said there was a clear link between human health and fossil fuel burning. “Facilities that burn fossil fuels are the overwhelmingly dominant source of heat-trapping pollution that is driving the climate crisis – by using the sky as if it were an open sewer. The particulate air pollution they also create falls downwind into surrounding neighbourhoods and is causing the deaths of 8.7 million people per year,” he said. “Now that we can clearly see how and where people are being exposed to this harmful pollution, our leaders must do something to reduce it.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2568ad0eaaf4cd58c4a997db09e5ab51f448630/293_0_2915_2333/master/2915.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9bd4f93f4071f661986d742a66834aa5",N,,2025-09-24 14:02:49.199920

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

Thank you Casey, and thank you all who are joining us here today representing this coalition of forward-thinking representatives from 24 states that banded together really to show the world that despite what occurs in Washington — going back to 2017 — we can still band together and have a profound impact and that was really the birth of the Climate Alliance, which I would submit today in this era is more important now than ever before because the attacks are more incessant. And I would also say that, reflecting on what happened yesterday when our president called the climate crisis, “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” before the UN General Assembly — what we do is we gather and we become even more dug in in our commitment to lead the rest of our country despite the absence of leadership from Washington. So there was a con job — from a con man — and I also would say that he made some reference to we need to let us work together to build a bright, beautiful planet.

So say what you will, we will do our work and we will build that bright, beautiful planet because we are committed. So let's hold him to that. And so now this group working in collaboration is urgently needed. Our democracy depends on this collaboration. No one individual state has the influence to have a real impact on what is happening with emissions and our climate but banded together, the strength of one is what's making the difference. So we are proving the Climate Alliance states are proving you can cut emissions and grow the economy at the same time, which is what naysayers were certain was not possible. And a year ago, the Climate Alliance announced a commitment to train one million new apprentices across its states and territories by 2035.

We are holding to that commitment. We're doing our part in New York, but also today we are really proud to announce that we have achieved a 24 percent reduction in emissions for our 24 member states. That is ahead of schedule. It achieves the goals that we had set out back in — measuring ourselves back to 2005, a long time ago. This was set forth a few years ago, but to be able to achieve this goal of a 24 percent reduction at a time when the numbers were escalated to go down 24 percent — clearly within a range of hitting the target, which was set for 2025, which is 26 percent. These are 2023 numbers. So I have no doubt in my mind that. When we look at the 2025 numbers, we will have more than exceeded our goal of 26 percent. So, that is enormous. We should be proud of that and celebrate that and talk about that back in our home states to know that what they've set out to do was achievable, and we're going to continue building on that success.

So first of all, we build on the momentum. Secondly, we'll innovate new methods of going forward. And then really have to spend way too much energy fighting back the damaging policies out in Washington. This has certainly been a growth year for our lawyers. I can't tell you how many cases that we're involved with to push back on the Trump administration, but certainly anything related to climate, I will continue to devote the resources to do what is necessary.

So let me just give a snapshot of what we're doing here in New York while the federal government refuses to protect us. We will continue to build a healthy and safe future for our people and our planet. And this year I announced a Sustainable Future program, which is the largest single climate investment in New York history. A billion dollar commitment for decarbonization, clean energy and climate resilience. We're putting that money to work in every part of people's lives. At least $50 million will go to Empower Plus to help families transition, building heat pumps and making their homes more energy efficient to help reduce their costs as well as their consumption.

To date, we've already had 5,700 home upgrades and saved millions of dollars for our families and energy costs. We'll put another $15 million to our Clean Green Schools program to make our public schools healthier and more efficient. And for our State University system, we're investing $200 million to help their publicly owned building phase out of fossil fuels and $150 million for our green small buildings program to help upgrade housing as well.

So we also want to focus on emission-free buses, $250 million for that. Vehicle charging stations, expanding our infrastructure at workplaces and apartment buildings, as well as securing another $200 million to accelerate multiple renewable energy projects. That's what we do with the billion dollars in New York. And we're committed to this. And it was bold and it had a big price tag, but the price tag for doing nothing is even greater in our opinion. So this was an investment well worth making.

We're also thinking about how to bolster our energy supplies overall. And we are committed to being very ambitious and on June 23rd this year, I directed our Power Authority for the State to plan the first advanced nuclear plant in a generation, and I'm going to continue that we have access to our Solar for All program as well as, meanwhile in 2027, we're on the cusp of bringing in 20 percent of New York City will be powered by hydroelectric power brought down by Champlain Power Express that I announced during my first climate week when I was a brand new, unexpected Governor back in 2021.

This is something I committed to do, and we're almost done, and this is going to be extraordinary. And again, weaning ourselves off the fossil fuels. And some of you may have seen the news that we had to fight hard to save our offshore wind project that preserves thousands of union jobs. And also, we are on the cusp of completing this — the Empire Wind Project. And we'll be powering over half a million homes in Brooklyn next year.

And so it's still going to happen now because we were able to find the path forward. But I know there's other states, particularly New England, that's under attack. And we're here to stand with you to help thwart those efforts and to show that it is a viable form of power. It is renewable, it is clean. We want to make sure that we continue these investments in offshore wind. And as I said, we'll continue to challenge that in court wherever necessary. And again, I want to make sure we have the workforce. We talk about all this development, all these projects. It's extraordinary, but we have to have people who are trained in the skills that are necessary.

We announced that last year through this alliance, but also NYSERDA awarded $5.1 million to support our offshore wind workforce. We've trained almost a thousand people. We've launched our offshore wind training institute with $20 million, the largest private investment in workforce development of any state, and that is now certified 2,500 workers, which is why I'm going to keep fighting any efforts to shut down offshore wind because now I have the workforce, the investment's been made, the private sector has done their part, and so this is critically important for us to maintain the work that's been done and we hope to continue doing in the future.

We also see climate action advanced manufacturers as partners; we don't have to have a hostile relationship with them. And so we put $300 million towards something called the Power Up Fund to have power ready sites with clean energy to attract companies to New York. It is overwhelmingly successful. People want to go where it's already shovel ready, but also power ready — power ready with the power we want delivered to those sites. And we are holding up our polluters accountable for their grievous mistakes of the past. It's something I'm well familiar with having grown up within line of sight of the Bethlem Steel Plant in Buffalo.

And as a child, I thought the skies were supposed to be orange because that's all I saw was the smoke spilling out of the smoke stacks there. And in Lake Erie, one of the greatest freshwater lakes in the world, absolutely polluted the dead fish everywhere on the beach because they were being killed by the discharges from the plant into the water on a daily basis. So that's where I grew up. So I'm from birth, an environmentalist. In 2024, I signed the Climate Change Super Fund act, shifting the burden of paying for climate change mitigation, off of New Yorkers to the fossil companies themselves.

I know only one other state, I believe Vermont has done that as well. So, of course it's being attacked in court, but what's new? Every time we try to do something ambitious or to stop something bad, it ends up in the courts. And back in 2022, I announced that we had a $4.2 billion environmental bond act to help protect our natural resources.

I just want to say we're doing all this, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that affordability is critically important. I don't think that it was part of the conversation as much as it should have been in the past. It is now front and center on people's minds as the costs of tariffs are being felt, the inflation is not abating, despite the promise that prices were all going to go down on day one, as would utility prices. So we're still waiting for those commitments.

But we're continuing our programs to help people with credits helping pay their bills and with the inflation reduction act rebates, which make energy rebates more accessible. I just want to say this, we just refuse to be derailed by this and we just must hold firm and continue creative ways as we've done to protect the environment individually. I encourage others to look at our success with congestion pricing as well. We're the only state in the nation, the only city in the nation that has undertaken it. We can certainly have the opportunity to explain how it all works, but as much as you want to complain about the traffic this week, it would've been worse.

Since we launched this last January, there have been 17.6 million fewer rides into our targeted zone — our district. And that has resulted in extraordinary reduction in emissions in our city. And we can feel it. People are breathing easier. I know it's going to be a reduction in asthma and a whole lot of other ailments, but it is working and we're so proud of that, and we're using the investments from the dollars raised into investing in our public transportation system, our buses and rail lines. And that's the synergy of all this – it all goes toward a cleaner environment. And we're also fighting alongside California to defend the Clean Air Waiver Act. We're focusing on that, and we're joining other states with the affordable Clean Cars Coalition, advancing environmentally friendly cars.

So lots going on. We're proud of what we're doing, but we never rest on our laurels here in the State of New York. We're always driving ourselves hard. I want to recognize Amanda Lefton, my commissioner of DEC, who has a national reputation already. I and her entire team, and everyone at NYSERDA — I have the smartest, the best, and the brightest.

I'm so proud of those individuals because together we're going to make sure that we lead as a nation and our 24 states spanning together the collective talent around these tables is what's going to continue to set us apart as we even break and smash even more records that we set for ourselves. So thank you very much everyone.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-09/climate1.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=-419pJiB,N,,2025-09-24 12:04:05.856227

Ecuador Ecuador has only tapped 7% of its hydropower potential, with its hydropower system currently remaining under pressure due to droughts which have triggered electricity blackouts.
Uruguay In 2024, hydropower accounted for over 50% of Uruguay’s total electricity production which climbed to a record 14.4TWh.","Despite what it calls only ‘a modest’ total capacity addition of 306MW in 2024, the International Hydropower Association (IHA) says hydropower is still a vital component of the South American energy mix. Currently providing approximately 45% of South American electricity demand, thanks to the region’s natural resources such as the Andes mountains and the Amazon basin, there is still vast potential for generation and only 30% of its hydropower potential is being utilised.

In its 2025 World Hydropower Outlook, the IHA outlined some of the challenges facing regional development, such as maintaining grid stability as renewable energy deployment accelerates. In response to this, South America is playing a pioneering role in developing hybrid systems which combine hydro and other renewables to maximise sustainability and efficiency. A leading example of this approach, the IHA says, is the deployment of PV arrays on hydro reservoir surfaces.

However, there are also what the association terms as being ‘reputational challenges’ in the region. Explaining that the industry is responding to these with a strong focus on demonstrating sustainability in such an ecologically sensitive environment, IHA gives the example of Brazil’s 198MW Mascarenhas plant which was recently awarded gold certification under its Hydropower Sustainability Standard, following on from Brazil’s 3.75GW Jirau plant which also achieved gold certification in 2023. In addition, Colombia’s 2.45GW Ituango and 19.9MW Chorreritas projects were awarded silver certification.

Pumped storage remains largely untapped in Latin America, but a 2024 IADB report highlights its potential to boost renewable integration as ageing hydro plants modernise. The two-stage study identifies 179 possible sites across 11 countries and lays out plans for a pilot project in Pisagua, Tarapacá, Chile, providing 640MW with 12 hours of storage. The pilot uses two 4.5Mm3 reservoirs, four 160MW Francis turbines, and two 220kV lines. The US$570 million project would be constructed over 48 months at a cost of US$32/MWh.

Argentina

Severe droughts since 2024 have critically impaired Argentinian hydropower generation. It declined by 15% compared to 2023, with a further 34% drop in January 2025 due to extremely low river inflows. And although this led to power cuts and higher electricity costs, the IHA says the Argentinian hydropower sector is undergoing major growth.

Modernising ageing facilities has been a priority but several large-scale projects are also nearing completion with new developments planned. Projects include the 1310MW Santa Cruz hydroelectric plant, slated for completion by 2026, and the 950MW Condor Cli Dam set for commissioning by 2027. Still in permitting stages, the 871MW Chihuido project is expected online by 2029.

As a whole though, Argentina has still only harnessed 20% of its hydropower potential. The Inter-American Development Bank recently identified 23 potential pumped storage projects with average installed capacities of 414.5MW.

Bolivia

Described as ‘growing significantly’, Bolivia’s hydropower sector continues to move forward with major projects. The 3000MW Rio Madera hydropower project should start on a feasibility study and environmental licensing soon, with possible commissioning by 2031. In addition, the 1.16TWh Ivirizu complex, and the first stage of the 203MW Miguillas hydroelectric plant, are both expected to be finalised this year.

Brazil

A severe dry spell in late 2024 reduced Brazil’s hydropower output to a three-year low, with hydropower falling to a 50% share of the energy mix during September. Anticipation of low water flows in the future has been a limiting factor in the development of new sites, according to the IHA, and in 2024 only 56MW from 11 new hydropower projects was added to the country’s total generating capacity.

With Brazilian installed hydropower capacity now standing at 110GW, an additional 1.3GW is licensed or under construction. There are currently 32 advanced-stage projects totalling 442MW and 60 licensed projects awaiting construction.

Czech energy company ENERGO-PRO also recently agreed to purchase the 350MW Baixo Iguaçu hydropower plant in the state of Paraná. Commissioned in 2019, the plant plays a critical role in regulating the flow of the Iguaçu Falls, one of the world’s largest waterfall systems. It produces clean, renewable energy sufficient to power one million Brazilians, covering 8% of Paraná state’s annual consumption. The power plant was built between 2014 and 2019 with a total investment of €500 million. Its concession runs until 2049.

Meanwhile, ENGIE Brasil Energia has signed an agreement to acquire the 393MW Santo Antônio do Jari Hydropower Plant, located in Amapá and Pará, and the 219MW Cachoeira Caldeirão Hydropower Plant in Amapá.

Chile

Having realised approximately 53% of its estimated 16GW hydropower potential, Chile is described as exhibiting significant potential for small and micro run-of-river projects and pumped storage. Although the country’s installed generating capacity has ‘grown spectacularly in recent years’, the IHA admits hydropower has only played a relatively small role in this.

However, in 2024, four projects added 157.7MW to Chile’s hydropower capacity. These were:

Los Cóndores (150MW).

Pasada Piedras Negras (3MW).

La Con anza (2.6MW).

Nueva Ampliación PMGD Las Flores (2.1MW).

Four more projects, with a combined investment of US$677 million, are also under construction with the 52MW Los Lagos run-of-river project also recently receiving approval.

Colombia

Hydropower, with an installed capacity of 13207MW, accounts for nearly 64% of the Colombia’s total energy generation. Although construction of the country’s largest hydropower project, the 2400MW run-of-river Ituango scheme, is well under way and expected to reach full capacity by 2027, elsewhere hydropower development is described as lagging. Just two projects were completed in 2024 – the 10.5MW TZ II and the 2MW Alejandría. Two major projects, Porvenir II (352MW) and Miel II (120MW), have been approved and the IHA believes these can help stimulate future growth for the Colombian hydropower sector.

Digital transformation can be viewed as a powerful innovation driver in energy transition efforts. However, according to a new study, there remains a notable gap in research addressing comprehensive, large-scale digital transformation projects in hydropower. EG Gabon et al say that very few existing studies have covered the scope of digitalising a significant proportion of an entire nation’s hydropower infrastructure. In addition they believe few works have delved into the depth and complexity of digital solution architectures tailored for large-scale hydropower plants, with even fewer studies exploring the direct impact of these strategies on national energy policies and the integration of renewable energy sources.

In their research, EG Gabon et al say they address such a critical gap by presenting a real-world, large-scale case study of the digital transformation of Colombia’s hydropower sector. The investigation discusses in detail the digital transformation strategy for the hydropower plants of one of the major players in the Colombian generation market, detailing the automation concept for each individual unit and the integrated architecture for all the hydropower generation systems.

Enel Colombia is one of the largest power generation companies in the Colombian electricity market. Its digital transformation involves the digitalisation of 27 hydroelectric generating units and four pumping stations distributed over 12 plants. These include the:

276MW Paraíso.

324MW Guaca.

19.4MW Charquito.

56.8MW Tequendama.

35MW Salto II.

1MW Limonar.

18MW Laguneta.

150MW Darío Valencia.

1250MW Guavio.

•10MW Guavio menor.

200MW Quimbo.

540MW Betania.

Ecuador

Ecuador has only tapped 7% of its hydropower potential, with its hydropower system currently remaining under pressure due to droughts which have triggered electricity blackouts. The IHA says that with 72% of the country’s power generation dependent on water, the government is turning to solar projects to add resilience.

Government initiatives have been designed to help Ecuador meet its long-term goal of sourcing 80% of its electricity from renewable sources and encourage greater private sector participation. Key projects include two new run-of-river plants, which will add approximately 150MW, and the 3600MW Zamora G8 project which is now in final feasibility stages, with the 254MW Toachi-Pilatón complex nearing completion.

Guyana

Guyana has revived its flagship 165MW Amaila Falls hydropower project after years of delays and failed attempts. IHA says Amaila is central to Guyana’s low carbon strategy, with expectations it will supply more than 50% of the nation’s electricity, reducing dependence on oil. However, key hurdles including financing challenges, indigenous consultation, and environmental concerns remain ahead of the targeted 2029 commissioning date.

Peru

Peru has harnessed 8% of its hydropower potential of 69.45GW. Recent policy initiatives seek to accelerate concessions and consent processes, and shorten environmental review timelines. Six projects totalling 664MW will enter commercial operation between 2025 and 2027. These include the 209.3MW San Gabán III which is located in Carabaya province, Puno. Designed to generate approximately 1.25TWh annually, it will bolster supply to Peru’s southern grid and support the mining sector. In addition, construction of four small hydropower projects is more than 25% complete – CH Santa Lorenza (19MW), CH Anashironi (20MW), Centauro I (12.5MW),.

Engineering and consulting firm AFRY has been selected by Electroperú to oversee the modernisation and life extension of the country’s Santiago Antúnez de Mayolo and Restitución hydropower plants. The project aims to upgrade systems and equipment at both facilities to maintain operational continuity and improve reliability.

Electroperú S.A., Peru’s state-owned energy provider, operates the Mantaro Hydroelectric Complex, which includes the 798MW Santiago Antúnez de Mayolo plant and the 210MW Restitución plant in the Andes. Built in 1973, these plants are essential to the country’s electricity generation.

The modernisation effort, which began in May 2024, will last nearly three years. It includes replacing ageing equipment and upgrading auxiliary systems to extend their operational life, along with training programmes to ensure ongoing safety and reliability. AFRY’s role covers contract review, risk analysis, technical coordination, quality assessment, and supervision of factory and on-site testing. The firm aims to ensure that the project meets the highest technical and safety standards.

Uruguay

In 2024, hydropower accounted for over 50% of Uruguay’s total electricity production which climbed to a record 14.4TWh. Work also began on the modernisation of the Rincón de Baygorria hydroelectric plant during 2024, with plans to increase installed capacity to 120MW. The project is managed by Andritz in consortium with SACEEM.

Venezuela

Venezuela’s hydropower sector has been struggling with declining capacity due to economic challenges and structural neglect of key infrastructure, such as the 10,200MW Guri Dam and the Caroní River cascade. So recent efforts have been focused on restoring existing facilities, such as the reactivation of the General José Antonio Páez hydroelectric complex in Barinas, adding 120MW to the grid. In December 2024, the Latin American Development Bank also authorised a US$380 million loan to help improve the efficiency and extend the operational life of the country’s Simón Bolívar plant.

Revising water treaties: impact on hydropower

Formalised by treaties in 1906 and 1944 between Mexico and the US entered the two nations into an agreement to regulate the upper part of the Rio Grande basin. However, after more than 100 years, things have changed. Because although the priorities of the two sharing countries and conditions in the region have changed significantly since the 1940s, interpretation of the 1944 Treaty has not sufficiently evolved to meet these challenges, according to new research by Sanchez et al in Water International.

The Rio Grande basin has since made it to the list of the most endangered basins in the world, with studies showing its natural flow has been reduced by at least 80% annually. And with more persistent droughts, erratic rainfall and increased heat likely to be the norm going forwards, increasing water scarcity has raised’ legal and constitutional questions’ not only over the supposed ownership of water, but over priorities for water uses and users. Indeed, conditions are described as being particularly bad for Mexico. Three times since 1994 it has had to delay water deliveries until the following five-year cycle because it had fallen into water ‘debt’ with the US.

A more suitable approach could see the Treaty evolving into a more adaptable and beneficial mechanism for sharing the waters of the Rio Grande under the current uncertain and water-scarce conditions, which are expected to prevail into the future. Committing to delivering fixed amounts of water, the authors stress, simply does not make sense in a basin that cannot provide additional water in response to expected future growth. Ultimately, the two countries must recognise that the system needs both more flexibility and greater reliability in the amount and timing of water deliveries to both countries.

This will require a major change in the way both countries manage water resources in the border region and will require time and accountability from federal and state governments in both countries. Mexico, as the treaty prescribes, shoulders the greater burden for ensuring reliable water deliveries to Texas.

“At every political level things have changed,” Sanchez et al state. “The treaty cannot bring or create more water; climate change is reducing water availability on both sides of the border; existing practices and uses cannot continue without significant changes in the extant lax governance systems; and with the model of intensive and extensive agriculture, little will be accomplished without cooperation”.

According to the authors, both countries need to acknowledge that in its current form the Treaty is inadequate and needs to evolve to meet the changing needs of the Lower Rio Grande basin. There needs to be mutual commitment to developing an adaptive framework that flexibly accounts for unpredictable climatic changes, as well as growing populations and shifting economic demands. In addition, the involvement of stakeholders representing diverse interests – including from agriculture, industry, non-governmental organizations, municipal and state governments, and academia – is critical for achieving more effective and balanced negotiations over transboundary waters.

(For a detailed analysis of the bill, see Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""Trump Signs the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" July 3, 2025.) Notably, the OBBB makes comprehensive changes to the U.S. Tax Code, including provisions relevant to single-family offices.

Executive Summary

There are five provisions of the OBBB with particular impact on single-family offices:

The OBBB provides for ""permanent"" repeal of Internal Revenue Code (Code) Section 212 miscellaneous itemized expenses for investment expenses, meaning that certain ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) taxpayers could continue to benefit from a family office structured as a profit-motivated trade or business able to deduct family office, investment advisory and related expenses under Code Section 162.

The OBBB permanently increases the federal estate, gift, and Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) tax exemption to $15 million per person (or $30 million for a married couple) indexed for inflation, expanding wealth transfer planning opportunities for UHNW families and their family offices.

Charitable deductions are limited to amounts exceeding 0.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI) for individuals and 1 percent for C corporations, which may prompt family offices to consider pooling larger charitable contributions to surpass these thresholds. The bill also extends higher AGI limits on deductibility, including the 60 percent deductibility limitation for cash contributions to public charities.

The OBBB raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for joint filers ($20,000 for separate filers) from 2025 through 2029 and continues to permit the pass-through entity (PTE) tax workaround, enabling family offices with pooled investment partnerships to further reduce state-level tax exposure.

The OBBB significantly expands qualified small business stock (QSBS) tax benefits for family offices by reducing the minimum holding period to three years with phased-in exclusion percentages, increasing the qualifying C corporation asset limit to $75 million and raising the capital gains exemption cap to $15 million, thereby enhancing the attractiveness of investing in qualified small businesses.

Deductibility of Expenses

Since 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) has eliminated miscellaneous itemized deductions (MIDs) including some most valuable to family offices such as deductions for investment fees, legal and tax preparation fees, and other similar expenses incurred for the production of income - these deductions were formerly allowed under Code Section 212. The loss of this valuable category of deductions motivated many family offices to employ a modified hedge fund structure for the family office and its clients. In structuring single-family offices in part to enable deductibility of investment advisory and similar expenses borne by the family office, these families were buoyed by the U.S. Tax Court's 2017 decision in Lender Management v. Commissioner, which involved the management company of the family that popularized off-the-shelf bagels. Other family offices, such as Lender Management, had implemented hedge-fund style structures before the advent of the TCJA thereby avoiding alternative minimum tax complications and the 2 percent floor limitations of Code Section 67(a). Meanwhile, some families waited, perhaps believing that the TCJA would sunset on Dec. 31, 2025 thereby restoring prior deductions.

The OBBB poked a hole through the dough of those awaiting revival of investment-related MIDs. The bill ""permanently"" repealed such deductions, and families on the sidelines should now evaluate adopting a family office structure similar to that in the Lender case. Holland & Knight often works with UHNW clients and their family office advisors to establish a management company for family integration and to address the loss of deductibility for investment expense. The family office can engage multiple generations and branches of a family to create or expand pooled investment vehicles and other family office clients. The management company provides investment advisory and other services to these family office clients in exchange for compensation. When family clients are appropriately organized and the family office operates as a trade or business, it is possible for the overall effect to resemble (or improve upon) the pre-TCJA miscellaneous itemized deduction regime.

Increased Federal Estate, Gift and Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Exemption

The TCJA doubled the federal estate, gift and generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax exemption (i.e., transfer tax exemption) for each individual. With applicable inflation adjustments, the current exemption is $13.99 million per individual, reduced by prior taxable gifts. However, under the TCJA, these exemptions were scheduled to sunset to approximately $7 million per person after Dec. 31, 2025.

The OBBB permanently sets the base-level transfer tax exemption at $15 million per person (or $30 million for a married couple) effective Jan. 1, 2026, and adjusted annually for inflation. The OBBB resolves the uncertainty of the prior law and provides enhanced wealth transfer planning opportunities for UHNW taxpayers and their family offices.

Family office advisors are well advised to consider such sophisticated planning opportunities on a generational basis to facilitate the efficient transfer of dynastic wealth. The enhanced exemptions may also factor into the transition of management and ownership of the family office, ensuring the structure can facilitate not only the transition of wealth between generations, but also serve as an effective vehicle to educate younger generations on a family's investment, wealth transition, and charitable planning initiatives and goals.

Charitable Planning

Family offices frequently serve as advisors to family charitable foundations. They also commonly provide broader advice to the family members they serve with respect to charitable planning involving public charities, including donor-advised funds.

The OBBB modifies the availability of charitable deductions that will be relevant to and impact family office clients. Effective Jan. 1, 2026, individual taxpayers who itemize their deductions are permitted a charitable deduction only to the extent the charitable contribution exceeds 0.5 percent of the taxpayer's AGI. Other rules apply to C corporations.

Family offices and family office advisors may wish to advise their family office clients to consider larger, pooled charitable contributions – potentially aggregating multiple anticipated charitable contributions into a single year – to exceed the applicable 0.5 percent threshold. Though the new deductibility floor may not be welcome news, the extension of higher deductibility limitations should have a broader impact for UHNW clients. (For additional details, see Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""Impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on Tax-Exempt Organizations,"" Aug. 12, 2025.)

SALT Deduction and Planning

To the ire of many taxpayers, the TCJA capped the deduction for SALT at $10,000 per year. The OBBB increases the SALT deduction for tax years 2025 through 2029 to $40,000 for married couples filing jointly or $20,000 per year for separate filers.

In response to the TCJA's SALT cap, many taxpayers adopted a PTE tax workaround. Under this strategy, a pass-through entity elected to pay state income taxes at the entity level, as opposed to passing those taxes through to the owners. The owners were then permitted to claim credits to offset their individual income taxes.

The PTE tax workaround is a strategy adopted by Holland & Knight family office clients where those clients consist of multiple pooled investment vehicles taxed as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. Importantly, the OBBB does not restrict the ability of pass-through entities to fully adopt and implement this strategy. As a result, family offices with one or more separate, pooled investment partnerships can leverage this strategy and the increased SALT deduction to substantially decrease the exposure of the various family members to state-level taxes without an offsetting federal deduction.

QSBS

Family offices have increasingly invested in private equity and made direct investments in closely held businesses. When these private equity and/or direct investment opportunities involve QSBS under Code Section 1202, family offices have seen substantial tax-free gains on their initial investments.

Family offices will welcome the significant expansion of QSBS planning opportunities enacted by the OBBB. For QSBS acquired after July 4, 2025, the OBBB made the following substantial, taxpayer-favorable modifications to the QSBS regime:

a reduction in the minimum holding period requirement from five years to three years, with a phased-in exclusion percentage of 50 percent (for a three-year holding period), 75 percent (for a four-year holding period) and 100 percent (for a holding period of five or more years)

an increase in the maximum aggregate gross asset value for a qualifying C corporation issuer from $50 million to $75 million, indexed for inflation

an increase in the single-issuer flat cap on capital gains subject to exemption from $10 million to $15 million, indexed for inflation

The OBBB's material modifications to the QSBS regime substantially increase the value of investing in qualified small businesses. The tax benefits under the QSBS rules have always been significant for those who are patient and careful enough to pursue them. OBBB will now expand and increase these benefits. (For a broader analysis of the QSBS modifications in Code Section 1202 resulting from the OBBB, see Holland & Knight's previous alerts, ""A Look at the Tax Implications of Gifting Qualified Small Business Stock,"" Aug. 28, 2025, and ""A Look at Transfers of Section 1202 Qualified Small Business Stock,"" July 18, 2025.)

Conclusion

The OBBB declined to reinstate investment-related miscellaneous itemized deductions. This hurdle should motivate family offices to employ management company incentive structures to recoup these lost tax benefits. Family offices should also utilize the extended and expanded tax benefits for UHNW taxpayers, including SALT deduction caps, historically high AGI limits for charitable donations and increased QSBS exclusions.

The Hydrogen Council’s inaugural Global H2 Compass report delivers some good news for the sector

The global standing of hydrogen is on the rise. The world is acutely aware of the need to decarbonize, especially in the energy sector. The H2 Compass reports that the sector has averaged a 50% year-over-year committed investment growth rate. Since 2020, there have been more than 1,700 H2 projects announced globally, while roughly 50 projects have been publicly canceled in the past 18 months.

The Hydrogen Council has praised the innovation and advancements that the sector has made in the past few years, and stated that it believes that reliance on hydrogen will only grow as time passes.

“The industry has made strong progress over the past five years, demonstrating its ability to innovate and scale. The Global H2 Compass report shows we are now at a pivotal juncture: accelerating market creation and securing binding offtake agreements must become the priority to ensure today’s projects deliver real impact. Achieving this will require stronger collaboration between business and government to build the frameworks and partnerships essential for progress. By aligning our efforts, we can unlock the full potential of H2 to meet the challenges ahead.” – Sanjiv Lamba, CEO of Linde and Co-Chair of the Hydrogen Council

China leads the growth in the hydrogen sector, with North America coming in second

What the industry needs is committed investment. And the heaviest energy consumers have made significant moves in the hydrogen sector. China leads the way with $33 billion of committed investments. North America comes in second with $23 billion, and lastly, Europe ranks third in committed investment with $19 billion.

A major player in the usage of hydrogen comes from South Korea. Hyundai has led the automotive industry in its embrace of hydrogen. The company has made several series of models that use hydrogen as the main fuel source. We have yet to realize the full potential that hydrogen has locked away.

“The Global H2 Compass sends a strong message: our industry has entered the next chapter of build-out, moving from ambition to delivery. With more than 500 projects advancing past FID and investment commitments now exceeding $110 B, a $35 B increase from last year, we are seeing tangible proof of progress. This milestone also reminds us of the work ahead. To sustain this momentum and fully unlock H2’s potential, consistent policy support and effective execution are essential in accelerating a clean, resilient and secure energy future.” – Jaehoon Chang, Vice-Chair of Hyundai Motor Group and Co-Chair of the Hydrogen Council

Hydrogen will continue to play a crucial role in the global decarbonization efforts

We are fully aware of the disastrous effect our reliance on fossil fuels has had on the planet. Several environmental disasters have emerged as a result of our proclivity for fossil fuels. The government leaders of the world have taken significant steps to alleviate the pressure being put on our planet, thanks to the energy demands that we have. The Europeans have made huge investments in the hydrogen sector, along with the ever-innovative Chinese. However, what role will hydrogen play in the United States as time passes?

The Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative is designed to rapidly scope, finance and deploy resilient energy infrastructure, such as microgrids, while federal incentives remain available. Federal incentives are still available for clean energy projects, but the clock is running out, so timely planning is essential.

The initiative aims to help communities reduce reliance on the centralized grid, strengthen energy resilience and support sustainability by scaling distributed energy resources (DERs), including solar panels, battery energy storage, geothermal heat pumps and EV charging infrastructure.

Participants in the initiative include: Microsoft; infrastructure providers AlphaStruxure, AZZO, Celsius Energy, CDM Smith EVerged, Mainspring Energy, Pisgah Energy, Sprocket Power, Sunrock Distributed Generation, Sustainability Partners, Unison Energy, Verdant Microgrid and Viridi; consulting firms Arcadis, Baringa, Viridi Edge and Zurich Resilience Solutions; electrical distributor Graybar; and the nonprofit Resilient Cities Network.

“Communities are under increasing pressure to maintain reliable, affordable power in the face of aging infrastructure, extreme weather, rising demand and evolving cyber-threats,” said Jana Gerber, North American President of Microgrids for Schneider Electric. “Power outages cost the US economy an estimated $150 billion each year, so the need for resilient energy infrastructure has never been more urgent.”

Examples of resilient energy systems already being deployed include:

AlphaStruxure microgrids at two bus depots in Montgomery County, Maryland, which will eventually support some 270 electric buses.

A 2.9-megawatt solar and microgrid system across eight municipal buildings in Piscataway, New Jersey, which includes 28 EV charging stations and enough battery energy storage to provide up to five days of backup power.

This more modest growth indicates a market that is broadening faster than it is deepening, Wood Mackenzie said.
Interestingly, Wood Mackenzie found VPP offtakes were the largest where utility data center commitments were the largest.
But doing so could limit private capital and aggregator access to the DER market, Wood Mackenzie said.
“In other words,” Wood Mackenzie said, “they would likely get behind the [distributed capacity procurement] model without utility ownership.”","The virtual power plant (VPP) market broadened more than it deepened over the last year, found Wood Mackenzie’s annual North American virtual power plant market report.

Company deployments, unique offtakers, and programs monetized each grew over 33% year-over-year. This reflects pull from new flexibility buyers as well as push from new VPP players, many who are filling new roles in the value chain.

“An ‘independent distributed power producer’ business model has emerged, whose thesis is that energy arbitrage and grid service revenue can finance an electricity retailer’s third-party-owned storage offering,” Wood Mackenzie said.

At the same time, overall VPP capacity grew 13.7%. This more modest growth indicates a market that is broadening faster than it is deepening, Wood Mackenzie said.

“Utility program caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at Wood Mackenzie.

Enrollment caps on utility programs, capacity accreditation reforms in power markets, such as the migration to effective load carrying capability, and market barriers to small customers have limited capacity growth in existing programs, according to Wood Mackenzie.

Interestingly, Wood Mackenzie found VPP offtakes were the largest where utility data center commitments were the largest. California, Texas, New York and Massachusetts are the leading states, comprising 37% of all VPP deployments. However, the regions with the greatest utility commitments to data center capacity, PJM and ERCOT, were also found to have the greatest disclosed VPP offtake capacity.

“This drives home the opportunity for utilities and even hyperscalers themselves to procure new VPP capacity to offset data center coincident peak demand, enabling faster grid connection,” Wood Mackenzie said. “In this way homeowners and business owners might actually earn revenue from the connection of new data centers, offsetting potential bill increases.”

Wood Mackenzie said that while hardwire providers are understandably enthusiastic about utilities as a new sales channel, the majority of other VPP companies do not support utilities rate basing DER.

But doing so could limit private capital and aggregator access to the DER market, Wood Mackenzie said. “There is far more enthusiasm for utilities integrating DER into system planning and operations, specifying where such resources are needed, but letting the market supply them, via customer programs and competitive solicitations.”

Doing so will enable the market to find the lowest-cost solution and drive innovation across the whole value chain, from program marketing to cross-technology optimization.

VPP critics of utility ownership see a utility monopoly of capital deployment choking off private capital and aggregator access from the DER market. According to Wood Mackenzie, the critics would rather customers and third-parties own assets and utilities procure grid services from them through customer bring-your-own-device programs, procurement contracts and flexibility markets.

What would you say are the most significant contributing factors to the unprecedented growth and transformation of the battery supply chain currently?
There’s been speculation about the long-term impact of tariffs on the supply chain.
How do you think supply chain resiliency will be defined years from now?
Steinberg: Certainly for this administration, supply chain resilience is America doing things itself.","The United States’ shifting administrative landscape continues to impact the global supply chain, creating challenges across markets, investment, trade, and policy. Uncertainty in Washington, D.C., and global investment hubs has led to market fluctuations in goods such as minerals and battery technologies, reshaping relationships between the US and its international partners, particularly amid growing competition with China.

Ben Steinberg, Executive Vice President and Co-Chair of the Critical Infrastructure Practice at Venn Strategies, will lead a plenary session at the Battery Show North America 2025 in Detroit, MI, titled “Leaders’ Roundtable: Industry and Policy Insights on Building a Resilient Battery Supply Chain for the Transportation and Energy Sectors.” The session will explore innovation growth, the policy’s role in supply chain resilience, and fostering partnerships. Ahead of his session, Battery Technology had the opportunity to interview him, and Steinberg shared insights on the future of US supply chain policy and the factors shaping resilience in the battery industry.

What would you say are the most significant contributing factors to the unprecedented growth and transformation of the battery supply chain currently?

Ben Steinberg, Executive Vice President and Co-Chair of the Critical Infrastructure Practice at Venn Strategies: We still have electric vehicle (EV) batteries being produced in key regions around the country and globally. You can't shy away from the fact that transportation electrification is a huge driving force and where we're headed as a global society.

You also have other downstream sectors, including grid storage—energy storage solutions paired with renewable energy—as well as dispatchable power for applications such as data centers that power artificial intelligence (AI) or industrial facilities like manufacturing and logistics centers. Finally, we’re seeing a further need for the electrified warfighter, whether it be soldier wearable, shipboard, or via drones. This is certainly playing out on the battlefield in Ukraine, and we will also see NATO alliance countries increasing their spending on similar technology in the coming years. Between transportation, electrification on the grid, the industrial market, and defense, we have a lot of growth opportunities for batteries.

There’s been speculation about the long-term impact of tariffs on the supply chain. What is the reality of the situation today?

Steinberg: I think it's a huge concern. I certainly want to see the US succeed, but in order for people to produce in this country, we need to bring in talent, machines, and resources to be able to do the work. I'm one of the first people out there to say we need homegrown industries, and we need to be as self-sufficient as possible. But our country can't do everything.

If you're going to build a mine and do that in a sophisticated way with, for example, autonomous underground machines that can do the mining in the safest, most effective, and efficient way, those pieces of equipment are likely to be built only in other countries. We shouldn't penalize our mining industry for going out and getting that equipment to do the project in a cost-effective, safe manner.

The US faces tough choices regarding trade deficits, revenue, and unfair trade practices, while aiming to support domestic manufacturing. A key challenge is China's dominance in global resources, processing them, and selling technology at below-market prices.

The question is, what are we going to do in relation to tariffs and that relationship? And how do we use trade negotiations with others, even our allies, to influence their relationships with China? Ideally, we have a system that lessens the burden of working in the U.S. with our allies and ratchets up tariffs on those where we do not align.

How well is the industry adapting to policy changes stemming from the new administration, and what impact has it had on the supply chain?

Steinberg: The train of thought here is the president has declared an energy emergency, and he's tied critical minerals to it. Critical minerals also include derivative products, which include batteries, EVs, semiconductor chips, and rare earth magnets.

You have to follow that train of thought to get to a conversation on batteries. It is an upstream, supply-side policy focus. And what industry needs to work on with Washington is that these minerals or materials need to go into something, like advanced technology, to have a thriving, productive society.

I think there's also a wariness about whether or not we have the ability to be self-sufficient and do mineral and battery production work without burning through money while China is out there underselling products to take over the entire market.

On the other hand, there are opportunities for folks to engage on battery-related priorities with the government. For instance, we are seeing the Department of Energy open up some of the stalled minerals and battery projects from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and new funding opportunities are opening up for mineral processing associated with the battery industry.

Certainly, we already worked really hard with Congress this year on the writing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which protects tax credits for the battery industry through production credits (45X) and investment credits for deployment (48E, 45Y). Final guidance for those credits will likely come out on those early to mid-next year.""

US President Donald Trump holds up a chart while speaking during a “Make America Wealthy Again” trade announcement event in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 2, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

There's a big opportunity here, and we're right on the cusp of being able to seize it. But there is work to do from the industry standpoint to make sure that the government understands why the work is so important, that industry can really deliver on the promise of making batteries at home, and works with the government to seek the best opportunities.

The other area where I think there's an opportunity to succeed is in these trade deals with countries such as Japan, which has offered to, as part of their trade deal, put $550 billion into the country. There's a real opportunity to work with partners like that. Folks should be thinking about that, because Japan has a lot to offer in the battery arena.

I think about South Korea as well. Unfortunately, we've had a big issue with the LG Energy Solution/Hyundai raid recently. I think there needs to be a lot of work done on diplomacy on that front to fix those issues because they too are such a critical part of the American competitiveness story.

What are examples of innovations today that are impacting supply chain resiliency?

Steinberg: The key is building processing technologies at scale in the US. That is the bedrock. That's where the slim margins are. There's a lot of hesitancy among chemical companies and material processors to set up shop here and know that they'll have battery producers and other large original equipment manufacturers to buy the product over the long term and at scale.

We have a lot of work to do from a financial standpoint and a policy standpoint to set up battery material processing facilities in the U.S. That is the biggest linchpin that the industry should be focused on in my opinion – those large partnerships.

Accelerating innovation in the battery sector is crucial, especially for startups struggling to enter large manufacturers' supply chains, which currently takes years. The goal is to consistently reduce qualification timelines to one year, fostering greater innovation and learning from China's advancements. It's not to say that the large companies are not doing it - it's that there is an opportunity to bring even more innovation into the system and to shorten those timelines.

How do you think supply chain resiliency will be defined years from now?

Steinberg: Certainly for this administration, supply chain resilience is America doing things itself. However, it also involves strong partnerships with our allies, enabling us to leverage each other's resources, expertise, and workforce.

Supply chain resilience requires long-term policies recognizing batteries as vital to the U.S. economy and national security, alongside government and industry investments to drive reliable programs and projects. Strong public-private and international partnerships are essential to leverage financial and natural resources, fostering collective resilience and effective collaboration with allies.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltbef56277f04a9d0a/650c1c89d9781a832a970fda/Burrel_20Feature_20Fig.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-24 12:03:57.513021

Dive Brief:

A coalition of mayors groups, attorneys general and seven cities and counties submitted extensive letters regarding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to rescind the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which concluded that emissions of six greenhouse gases endanger human health and is the underpinning for greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act.

The EPA “fails to seriously consider the impacts of these regulatory actions in cities,” stated a 14-page letter signed by the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Climate Mayors, C40 Cities and the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.

Attorneys general from Kentucky and West Virginia, meanwhile, are co-leading a 26-state coalition that submitted an 82-page letter in support of repealing the endangerment finding, stating it “was built on shaky ground — legally and scientifically.”

Dive Insight:

The EPA on July 29 proposed rescinding federal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, kicking off a formal rulemaking process with a period for stakeholders to comment before the agency finalizes and publishes the proposed rule. Virtual public hearings were held Aug. 19-22, and written comments were due Monday. More than 300,000 comments were filed.

The EPA said rescinding the finding would “save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards” and “give power back to the states to make their own decisions” about greenhouse gas regulations.

In its 225-page letter opposing the repeal, the coalition of attorneys general and cities and counties “describes the harms that the States and Local Governments are daily experiencing and that will be exacerbated if EPA finalizes the Proposal.”The letter argues that rescinding the endangerment finding would violate Supreme Court precedent and “disproportionately affect certain vulnerable groups and communities with environmental justice concerns.”

“We will continue to take action against dangerous federal actions that disregard scientific evidence,” said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, one of the letter’s signatories, in an emailed statement. “The importance of upholding this long-held commitment is underscored by the plain truth that the effects of climate change are felt most acutely by working people and Black and Brown communities.”

“New York City is no stranger to the devastating effects of natural disasters,” New York Mayor Eric Adams, who also signed the letter, said in a statement. “With more extreme weather events hitting the five boroughs more often, for our safety and to protect our economy, we must be prepared for the effects of climate change, including by putting in place stronger federal regulations of greenhouse gases.”

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement Aug. 1 that the endangerment finding “represents quintessential federal overreach and was never borne out by the law.” President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin are “reining in this overreach so states such as West Virginia can unleash American energy and compete successfully against China,” Morrisey said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/YBKwsv9prlTkZB2t9UEkiizKRBxvZ5W0CPcSiE1BifI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI5OTgyODkyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-24 12:05:04.012600

Climate finance

Mayor of Phoenix and C40 Cities Steering Committee member Kate Gallego joined The Climate Group Hub Live for the panel ‘Betting on a Breakthrough – Where Should the Smart Money Go Now?’. Joined by The Economist, RMI, Amalgamated Bank and BCG, Mayor Gallego underlined the role of cities in directing investment.

Cities are where climate risks hit hardest, but they’re also where so much innovation starts – from transit to infrastructure.

Kate Gallego, Mayor of Phoenix

Cities are already investing in adaptation and resilience, but they cannot do it alone. Achieving global climate goals means directing significantly more public and private finance toward city-led solutions that protect people, create jobs, and reduce long-term risk.

The future of clean transport

Mete Coban, Deputy Mayor of London and C40 Board Member, joined a vital conversation on the future of clean transport in cities.

Coban highlighted the tangible progress London has made, particularly in expanding electric vehicle access and rethinking transport systems at a local level. But he also acknowledged the steep road ahead and the urgent need for bold, coordinated policymaking to drive further change.

He called for faster action from national governments, more support for local authorities, and a sharper focus on equity to ensure the transition benefits everyone.

As cities around the world grapple with similar challenges, the message is clear: the clean transport revolution is underway, but breaking down the final barriers will require bold leadership, cross-sector collaboration, and a commitment to long-term, systemic change.

Tackling climate disinformation

At the Solutions Dialogue on Information Integrity. C40’s Director of Political Strategy and Campaigns, Donna Hume, addressed the tide of disinformation that threatens climate action.

The event showcased best practices of tackling disinformation, evidence-based policy interventions, and explored how to accelerate the implementation of initiatives that align with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

That was the message Ryan Lisek, program director of Drive Clean Indiana, delivered to the Porter Town Council Tuesday. Lisek came to the council meeting to answer questions about the project.

The $4 million grant was awarded in May 2022, which would enable municipalities in Porter and Lake counties to obtain electric trucks and charging stations. The source of the federal dollars was the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which then-President Joe Biden signed on Nov. 5, 2021. One of the stated goals was to address climate change.

The grant money was originally going to be coordinated through the city of Lake Station, the lead applicant. Lisek said that has changed so that the federal money, held by the Indiana Department of Transportation, will be distributed by the Northern Indiana Regional Planning Commission. Each community would have a separate contract to buy the vehicles.

Lisek said NIRPC’s board is scheduled to approve the arrangement at its December meeting. The communities could begin buying the electric-powered trucks during the first quarter of 2026.

Porter Council President Laura Madigan, D-Ward 1, asked Lisek if there is a possibility that the federal government will suddenly claw back the money.

The way the program works is, the town would pay up front for the vehicles, then be reimbursed for up to 80% of the cost. Madigan said her concern is that the town could purchase a vehicle, and the federal government would suddenly take back the money that had been allocated.

“There is a high likelihood that will not happen,” Lisek said. “However, things have been very different this year.”

Lisek was referring to the change in philosophy on electric vehicles with the Trump administration and budget cuts made by the federal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Councilman James Burge, I-Ward 4, also wondered about the long-term because the Trump administration’s policies have not been as friendly toward electric vehicles compared to the Biden administration.

“It was a big day when Elon (Musk) and Trump broke up,” Lisek said. Musk founded Tesla, a leading electric vehicle producer.

Lisek said he still believes there is a future for electric vehicles. He noted that Ford and Chevrolet continue to be committed to producing the vehicles.

If Porter were to follow through, the grant would provide $33,280 per vehicle. Porter was interested in buying Ford F-150 Lightning pickup trucks. Porter wanted to purchase four trucks, so the grant would pay $133,120, with the town having to come up with $74,880.

The town was also looking to install two charging stations. The grant would pay 80% of the charging station’s $80,000 cost, Lisek said.

Lisek said that the town, at no cost, could receive Tesla charging stations that could be hooked up at a location that would have Wi-Fi, Lisek said.

Council members also asked if the electric pickup trucks would be suitable for police and fire departments.

Lisek said that Bargersville, south of Indianapolis, has a fleet of 14 Teslas and they have saved $500,000 in fuel costs over the past few years. He said that electric vehicles can be charged overnight and can go up to five days without a recharge.

The Porter Town Council has yet to decide what they will do. Town officials at the last council meeting said if they went forward with buying the vehicles, they would buy fewer of them.

In other business, Porter Police Chief Dan Dickey announced that the Police Commission has selected Sgt. Tom Blythe as the next assistant police chief.

The appointment will take effect after Oct. 31, when the current Assistant Police Chief Jason Casbon retires.

Blythe joined the department in 2021. He received honors from the Federal Railroad Administration and Indiana Operation Lifesaver for his actions on Aug. 1, 2021, when he talked a despondent man who was lying down on the tracks at Beam Street into getting up moments before an oncoming train would have run him over.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO, SEPT. 24, 2025 – The Missouri Department of Natural Resources has awarded $3.7 million in financial assistance to the city of Appleton City for upgrades to its wastewater treatment and collection system. The funding will cover the entire cost of the project, which is expected to be completed by March 2026.

The improvements will advance the treatment capabilities of the system’s lagoons, provide operators more flow control, increase retention time, improve the settling process and reduce inflow and infiltration. The project will extend the wastewater system’s life and efficiency so that it can continue to serve the city well into the future.

Project funding consists of a $1.49 million loan and a $2.2 million grant through the department’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund. The department’s funding is estimated to save the city’s ratepayers more than $2 million in principal and approximately $580,000 in interest over the loan’s 20-year term.

“MoDNR provides crucial financing and technical assistance to help communities build public infrastructure that protects public health and the environment,” said Kurt Schaefer, director of the Department of Natural Resources. “Investing in the wellbeing of Missouri’s infrastructure is a catalyst to economic growth and prosperity.”

The department’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund finances improvements to wastewater treatment facilities, sewer collection system rehabilitation and extensions, and combined sewer overflow corrections. The fund also finances security, efficiency and conservation measures. Communities that borrow from the fund benefit from the below-market interest rate and from a department project manager’s assistance throughout the project.

The department is committed to assisting Missouri communities with water and wastewater infrastructure improvement projects.

Last month, the GHG Protocol dropped a bombshell on clean energy markets. Through a blog post and meeting minutes, we learned that the GHGP Independent Standards Board, or ISB, had voted to disregard the recommendation of its experts, walk back expectations previously set publicly, and prioritize optics over impact.

This explosive development relates to the GHGP’s revision process for Scope 2 accounting that governs how organizations calculate the emissions associated with electricity use and clean energy purchases.

And before you dismiss this concern as the realm of wonkish energy nerds, know this: In the U.S. alone, carbon accounting has supported the development of over $150 billion of clean energy infrastructure. Changes to the GHGP Scope 2 Protocol will absolutely shape how much clean energy infrastructure we build in the decade ahead — for better or for worse.

GHGP thumbs its nose at emissions experts and the public

There were two major decisions ahead of the ISB for a vote: whether to advance hourly matching as a mandate for inventory accounting, and whether to advance an impact accounting metric in parallel. Prior to the ISB vote, nearly 40% of the expert Technical Working Group, or TWG, that is tasked with developing the technical standards voted against hourly matching as a mandate, while 74% of TWG members voted to advance impact accounting in parallel as a critical, complementary methodology.

Despite the widespread TWG support, the ISB voted not to advance impact accounting to the public comment period in parallel with hourly matching, while all but a single dissenting ISB member voted to advance the plan to mandate hourly matching.

Some have argued that the ISB didn’t kill impact accounting, but merely sent it on a different path. This is nonsense. The public notes show the ISB prefers not to allow impact accounting for corporate target-setting of net emissions — which would render it functionally useless — and has delayed its public consultation, placing it on an uncertain timeline no longer in parallel with hourly matching. It also stated a need for an increasingly rigorous additionality test, raising doubts about real-world feasibility. So, while the ISB did not explicitly kill impact accounting, they did vote to mortally wound it.

So what happened? How did GHGP’s revision process take such a late, wrong turn? And why do I care? Why should you care?

Why the world — not just Scope 2 — needs impact accounting

The world needs voluntary corporate action that leads to the fastest emissions reductions possible. To that end, we need a viable and useful impact accounting option under the GHG Protocol to maintain and expand the accessibility of voluntary clean energy procurement, and to maximize the real-world emissions impact of those actions.

It’s widely accepted that consequential accounting (aka impact accounting) is the best metric available to incentivize high-impact investment in new projects. That’s because — as its name implies — it focuses on measuring the system-level impact of energy consumption and clean energy procurement over simply allocating existing emissions to consumers of power.

Impact accounting calculates two fundamental numbers: the emission impacts caused by an organization’s electricity consumption, and the emission impacts caused by an organization’s procured clean energy generation. As soon as you embrace that basic premise, you empower and incentivize organizations to site and operate their consumption to minimize the negative impact of their consumption, and to site and operate their clean energy procurement to maximize the positive impact.

Mandated hourly matching’s costs outweigh the benefits

Hourly matching has its merits toward certain goals under specific conditions. It has the potential to yield a more rigorous attributional inventory. It can create an incentive for clean firm generation, such as geothermal and nuclear. And at very high matching percentages (i.e., >90% hourly matching), it can achieve greater avoided emissions as compared to the current status quo of annual matching.

But that’s about where the benefits stop and the long list of problems begins.

Hourly matching incentivizes more renewable energy where clean energy is already abundant (e.g., Global North power grids where large corporations concentrate their loads) at the expense of where that investment is most needed and most valuable.

Hourly matching can unintentionally incentivize poor grid citizenship, per McKinsey, when entities prioritize self-centric reporting over system-level needs. Hourly matching not only allows, but incentivizes procurement of RECs from existing clean, firm projects, such as legacy hydro and nuclear over investment in new infrastructure.

Operationally, hourly matching is “absolutely impossible” for many distributed and variable load profiles. Hourly matching is expensive: analysis from experts such as TCR find a significant cost premium. And while many organizations have signaled a willingness to pay premiums to increase their impact, few have shown the same appetite to pay a premium for accounting benefits alone.

Given all those challenges, mandating location and hourly matching is expected to be destructive to voluntary demand, as has been pointed out repeatedly by NGOs and a variety of trade groups, including both the buyers and the sellers of clean energy.

Lastly, experts from Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Stanford, Minnesota, Texas and many others agree that hourly matching’s on-paper benefits “rely on simplified assumptions that do not reflect the economic or physical realities of project development or grid operations.” Harvard’s renowned power market expert Bill Hogan was more blunt: “24x7 matching of individual generation and load is not workable.”

A chorus of experts and stakeholders has been sounding the alarm on this issue with increasing urgency. Beyond the sources above, those shouting include non-profits (GHG Institute, RMI), academics (MIT, University of Cologne), consultants (E3, Green Strategies), startups (Ever.Green, Clearloop) and individual experts (Jigar Shah).

Despite all these voices, the GHGP appears to be caving to a vocal minority of hourly matching advocates focused on ensuring their procurement preference becomes a requirement for the entire voluntary market.

It’s not too late for GHGP to course correct

The lure of hourly matching is that it fights against a trope common among clean energy antagonists: How can companies claim to be powered 100% by renewable energy when the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine?

My response to that? Carbon doesn’t care if it’s emitted at night in California or during the day in Virginia: it warms the planet all the same. The focus of the GHGP should not be on backing usage claims about what power a company is consuming — something impossible to prove given grid dynamics — but to measure carbon emissions as accurately as possible.

So, if you wake up in the morning passionate about allocating blame for existing emissions, then you should applaud the ISB’s current trajectory. But if instead you care, as I do, about accelerating the development of valuable clean energy infrastructure and advancing our fight against climate change, then please join me in advocating for an about-face for the GHGP’s current trajectory.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/7B-SosXhekOVysfaYuAGUSfYGVQc42L3Gp4Wb2zRvZA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzYwMjQxNzg2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-24 14:02:54.246519

This brings its total annual manufacturing capacity to 3GW.

In April of 2025, the company kick-started work at the Greenville PV Module Factory (Phase I). The factory produces Gamma series of monofacial modules and Vega series of bifacial modules. Both the products are based on passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) technology.

The factory is now equipped with three module production lines. This, the company insists, will contribute toward meeting “the growing demand for domestically produced solar products”.

“The addition of a third production line marks another important milestone in our Greenville journey,” said Marco Marquez, the General Manager of the Greenville factory. “It further enhances our ability to serve our customers with reliable, US-made PV modules while creating high-quality local jobs.”

$400 Million Investment

Boviet Solar has sought to expand cell manufacturing capacity in tandem with its module manufacturing capacity, and in August completed exterior construction work on a cell manufacturing facility at the Greenville site. The cell facility is expected to begin commercial operation in the second half of 2026, and the factory’s cell and module components represent a USD 400 million investment.

Along with Boviet Solar, ES Foundry has made significant progress in establishing its cell manufacturing facility in the US, beginning production at its South Carolina plant in February. The company is prioritising PERC cell technology, which CEO Alex Zhu recently described as more “proven and reliable” than tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells. Although TOPCon cells boast higher efficiency, they have been entangled in several patent disputes between manufacturers throughout this year.

In the 1960s and 1970s, pioneering minds like Victor Papanek, Jane Jacobs and R. Buckminster Fuller wrote about sustainability from a societal perspective. This was followed by a plethora of books and TV shows that highlighted repurposing objects and materials – often retrieved from dumpsters – as a form of sustainable design. By the 1990s, design departments in Anglo-European universities were teaching sustainability by having students refashion waste and reclaimed objects into new forms. The outcomes rarely had any discernible impact and often looked like recycled trash. Much of it was, at best, what McDonough and Braungart refer to as “down-cycling” – stopping off as something else on its way to landfill (2003, p.59).

Shifts in Sustainable Design Education

Today, many sustainable design programs exist within schools of architecture, focusing on building adaptation and reuse. After all, many buildings long outlive the purpose for which they were built (Hollis, 2009. p.9). Other sustainable design programs around the world have a focus on “transformation” and societal shift, often aligned with the UN’s 17 sustainability goals encompassing zero hunger, quality education and clean water.

While science is vital in giving us a grasp of the facts, the climate crisis is every bit a cultural crisis. Those of us in the arts and humanities have an equally vital role to play. Sustainability is interdisciplinary, period.

The MFA in Design for Sustainability at CCS

This is the ethos of the MFA degree in Design for Sustainability at College for Creative Studies. Artists and designers have transformative powers in shaping culture, and can effect important change in the climate crisis. The program welcomes those from other disciplines, too – earth scientists, engineers, technologists, accountants, and philosophers – who all bring important insights to the class. The curriculum foregrounds a design mindset, utilizing visualized thinking and creative tool kits to explore three key areas:

Zero-waste materials and circular systems

Sustainable cities and civic infrastructure

Environmental stewardship

Students approach these through systems intervention and strategic narratives.

Complex Challenges in Sustainability

The challenges within sustainability and the climate crisis are incredibly complex, made up of a myriad of wicked problems within convoluted systems. Often, one well-intended intervention can lead to further problems. For example, plastic bag bans can advance reuse, but often lead to an extreme excess of heavier reusable bags. Waste diversion strategies require an interrogation of the entire system.

In the case of soda cans, the process begins with the extraction of bauxite ore from the ground, through the shipping, processing, shipping again, fabrication, sale, consumption, and its eventual return to the production cycle. This includes looking at ancillary processes like applying ink to the outside of the can, lining the inside with a film of acrylic or polyester, crating the cans, wrapping them in polythene, displaying in shops, not to mention the complexities of manufacturing sugary effervescent drinks that fill them.

The key is making the linear circular and reducing the amount of materials and energy used along the way, but it also begs the question: in what other ways could we quench our thirst?

Detroit as a Living Laboratory

For hands-on experience, Detroit is the perfect place to learn about sustainability, with powerful initiatives from both the ground up and the top down. There are many grassroots organizations and NGOs addressing food waste, urban farming, composting, clothing, building reuse and material salvage, climate justice, clean drinking water, clean rivers, green ways, green spaces, and energy reduction, to name a few.

The City of Detroit has a robust sustainability office and is in the process of finalizing its waste diversion strategy. The State of Michigan has proactive measures for ambitious sustainability goals, which it showcases annually at the Michigan Healthy Climate conference. CCS has an incredible community and industry network with whom we partner for experiential learning.

The program is transformational for its students and those with whom they work.

“We’re doing the exact opposite of what the U.S. is doing, which, by the way, I find concerning and problematic,” he said in an interview in New York City. He described the actions of the Trump administration on climate as “basically checking out.”

But other big economies, he said, are continuing to step up their targets for reducing their emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases. That will be put to the test on Wednesday in New York City, where the United Nations plans to host a climate summit at which 118 countries are expected to announce their 2035 emissions-reductions targets under the Paris climate accord.

That session could be a bit awkward for the European Union, given that its lawmakers haven’t yet finalized the E.U.’s 2035 climate targets. China is expected to announce its targets, which will be closely watched given the scale of China’s current emissions, but also its rapid embrace of solar, wind and battery manufacturing and its desire to pivot a significant part of its economy to clean-energy technologies.

In a speech on Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly, Mr. Trump spent a portion of his speech dismissing the dangers of climate change and lashing out at wind turbines, environmentalists and allies around the world.

The United States has said it will withdraw from the Paris accord, so it is not expected to participate in the U.N. climate summit this week or announce emissions-reductions targets of its own.

Mr. Hoekstra brushed off the E.U.’s delay in issuing its new climate targets as a feature of Europe’s democratic setup. The European Union has tentatively agreed to reduce its emissions in the range of 66 percent to 72 percent by 2035, compared with 1990 levels, and Mr. Hoekstra said the terms would be finalized by the time the international climate talks known as COP30 begin in Brazil in early November.

The San Diego-based company announced it will offload a 45% stake in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to a consortium led by private equity group KKR and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The deal, valuing the business at $31.7 billion, is expected to close in mid-2026 and marks one of the largest transactions in the US energy sector this year.

Sempra will remain a minority investor alongside the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority but says the sale will free up funds for regulated utility operations in California and Texas. Chief Executive Officer of Sempra, Jeffrey W. Martin, called the deal “a major step towards reshaping Sempra as a leading US utility growth company”.

The timing of the divestment coincides with a final investment decision on Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 in Texas. Backed by global investors including Blackstone, Apollo and Goldman Sachs, the $14 billion project will add two new liquefaction units, effectively doubling the site’s export capacity. Construction is due to begin soon, with operations targeted for 2030 and 2031.

For local communities, the LNG expansion is expected to generate thousands of construction jobs and long-term operational roles, as well as cementing Port Arthur’s role in US energy exports. The project also strengthens America’s position as the world’s top LNG supplier, a role that has grown increasingly important amid global energy insecurity.

Analysts say the twin announcements reflect a balancing act: Sempra is narrowing its business to focus on the steadier returns of utilities while still holding a stake in high-growth global gas markets. Proceeds from the sale will support Sempra’s $48 billion capital programme for 2025–2029 without raising customer bills through new equity financing.

In partnership with the EPA’s Region IX office, the researchers tracked some 20,000 enforcement letters sent under the agency’s Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule (RRP).
Each letter was sent to 5,000 contractors; an additional 5,000 contractors who served as the control group received no letter.
Interestingly, the positive incentives letter was much less effective, prompting only 1.5% of the never-before-certified contractors to get certified.
Regulators may want to consider pairing with researchers to design the best wording for similar enforcement letters.","For regulators with dwindling enforcement resources, convincing businesses to comply with rules is only becoming more challenging. Yet, regulators still have options.

Harvard Business School Professor Michael Toffel and fellow researchers teamed with the US

(EPA) to test which messages about lead-paint violation penalties increased compliance among California contractors. The article “Sending a Message: An Empirical Assessment of Responses to Punitive and Non-punitive Compliance Messaging Strategies” finds that the threat of the stick is more powerful than the reward of the carrot, challenging conventional wisdom on cooperative enforcement strategies.

In partnership with the EPA’s Region IX office, the researchers tracked some 20,000 enforcement letters sent under the agency’s Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule (RRP). The rule, issued in 2008, requires renovation contractors working on buildings built before 1978 to be EPA Lead-Safe-Certified. The researchers find that a carefully crafted message emphasizing the risk of inspection or certification checks yielded nearly twice as many certifications as the least effective letter, even when the probability of being caught remains low.

The findings challenge conventional wisdom and offer a cost-effective tool for agencies operating under resource constraints, say the authors. “When you bring up threats of penalties together with the heightened possibility of inspection, all of a sudden, some people take it more seriously,” says Toffel, the Senator John Heinz Professor of Environmental Management.

He coauthored the paper, forthcoming in the journal Ecology Law Quarterly, with Jodi L. Short, the Mary Kay Kane Distinguished Professor of Law at UC Law, San Francisco; Elizabeth A. Keenan, a professor at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business; and Melissa Ouellet, a data scientist at the University of Potsdam’s Hasso Plattner Institute in Germany.

When agencies and academics partner

The challenges to enforcement are significant. Estimates suggest that there are over half-a-million remodeling businesses in the United States, but the agency inspects less than 0.5 percent of them annually. The renovation contractor market ranges from publicly traded multinational companies to day laborers, making it difficult to create an enforcement strategy that reaches everyone.

The EPA’s California enforcement team turned to Short to help design a field experiment that would test several alternative enforcement letters to California contractors to determine which version was most effective in prompting the contractors to get certified. Short put together the team of researchers, including Toffel, to help craft four different messages.

Four kinds of letters for 20,000 contractors

A sample list of 20,000 contractors who ultimately received letters was culled from almost 185,000 names in the California Department of Consumer Affairs’ Contractors State License Board database and EPA data that included expired certifications.

Mailed in January and February of 2023, letters fell into four categories. Each letter was sent to 5,000 contractors; an additional 5,000 contractors who served as the control group received no letter.

All four versions of the letter provided information about the program, including potential penalty amounts and compliance assistance resources. The Informational (baseline) letter stopped there, and the other three letters added additional messaging as described above. It turns out that the prospect of getting caught proved to be more effective than an information notice that included the threat of fines, a plea on moral grounds, or a carrot-based approach that dangled inclusion on a list of certified contractors recommended by

.

“It’s the probability that you'll be detected, the possibility that you'll get caught, that gained traction,” Short says. “That seemed to be enough to move the needle for some contractors.”

Deterrence is a powerful tool

Another important finding: the deterrence letter was most successful with never-before-certified contractors—boosting compliance by about 50%. For that group, 3.3% of letter recipients got certified, whereas the informational letter yielded 2.2% new certifications. Interestingly, the positive incentives letter was much less effective, prompting only 1.5% of the never-before-certified contractors to get certified.

Contractors whose certification had expired responded best to the informational letter, with 10% re-upping certification. The deterrence letter was close behind at 9.6%. “It's an important insight that you can actually do worse than simply providing information. That’s a little counterintuitive,” Short notes.

The “moral” incentive letter, for instance, which led to certification by only 7.6% of the expirees who received it, may have resulted in a backlash, the authors write.

“Maybe it's so obvious that contractors were offended when they got a letter that said ‘you have to protect the children.’ And they may have thought ‘Duh, that's what I'm doing.’ It's hard to know just from the data that we have, because we did not talk to individual contractors about their reactions to the letters” Short says. “We can only speculate. But it does suggest that using moral messaging, particularly for things that might be morally obvious, can backfire.”

Implications for regulators

Even when regulatory enforcement resources are tight, the mere perception of heightened enforcement can be effective, the authors suggest. Contractors who know that enforcement probability is low may have been lulled into thinking they’d fallen off the agency’s radar, the authors write, perhaps producing an “outsized deterrent effect” when they learned that they are visible to the regulator.

Regulators may want to consider pairing with researchers to design the best wording for similar enforcement letters. In the EPA’s case, the agency got many contractors to follow the lead-safe rule with little cost, and running the experiment cost very little as the agency was already planning to send letters.

Experiments can help regulators be more productive in achieving their goals, Toffel says, “as much as 50% more, in this research project.” While such approaches don’t require academic support, a researcher’s insight can’t hurt.

“We're going to do research anyway,” Toffel says. “Many of us aim to do research that can have real-world impact, such as helping managers craft more effective messages. This research project enables regulators to get more out of whatever amount of resources they have to invest in enforcement and inspection actions.”

They’re aiming to break ground in 2026 and kick off operations by 2029. What sets this project apart is its use of autothermal reforming combined with carbon capture and sequestration from 1PointFive, designed to trap more than 95% of CO₂ emissions. With an annual capacity of 1.4 million metric tons, Blue Point is poised to satisfy surging demand for clean ammonia—whether as a next-gen fuel or a greener fertilizer—while creating over 100 direct jobs and upwards of 300 indirect roles. CF Industries will handle long-term operations and maintenance, drawing on decades of expertise running the nearby Donaldsonville Complex and a skilled Louisiana workforce.

Strategic & Regional Impact

Louisiana has long been kingpin in the global ammonia scene, and this investment cements that crown while pushing the state into the spotlight for next-generation fuels. For JERA and Mitsui, a reliable pipeline of low-carbon ammonia ticks big boxes for Japan’s energy security and climate pledges. The plan taps into Louisiana’s plentiful feedstock, deep-water ports and efficient export routes—driving down shipping expenses and the carbon footprint of transported ammonia. In doing so, Blue Point not only underscores the U.S. stance in the budding clean ammonia market but also beckons fresh renewable energy dollars to the region, giving local GDP a healthy boost. Throw in looming carbon border adjustments, ESG-linked offtake deals and evolving trade rules, and you’ve got a game-changer for industrial decarbonization on a global scale.

Technical Snapshot

At the heart of Blue Point is autothermal reforming (ATR), where natural gas meets oxygen and steam to whip up a hydrogen-rich syngas. Then comes the magic: a state-of-the-art CCS system that captures over 95% of the CO₂. Engineers have tweaked the process to recover heat and cut energy losses, which is critical given how energy-hungry ammonia production can be. Once captured, the CO₂ gets compressed, piped and permanently tucked away in geological formations courtesy of 1PointFive. The design is modular too, meaning CF Industries could replicate or scale it at other sites—a blueprint for broader industrial decarbonization.

Historical Context

Ascension Parish sits smack in Louisiana’s famous “Chemical Corridor”—or “Cancer Alley,” as locals sometimes call it. Since the 1950s and ’60s, fertilizer and petrochemical plants, including CF Industries’ own Donaldsonville Complex, have keyed off cheap feedstocks along the Mississippi. But community memories run deep: leaks like the 2013 ammonia release at Donaldsonville still fuel calls for cleaner operations. Over the decades, nearby universities and tech schools have cranked out generations of chemical pros. Now, project leaders are in talks to expand scholarships and apprenticeships, making sure Blue Point has a steady stream of homegrown talent.

Policy & Financing

Even though the Inflation Reduction Act doesn’t single out ammonia, its tax credits for carbon sequestration and low-carbon hydrogen feedstock are a big win for Blue Point’s bottom line. Louisiana’s economic development agencies sweetened the pot with property tax breaks, workforce training grants and revolving loan funds. By sharing upfront costs between public and private players, they’ve lowered the project’s weighted average cost of capital. The result? A more attractive levelized cost of ammonia and a faster path to ROI—key factors that ultimately sealed the investment decision.

Partnership Structure & Execution

The joint venture’s equity split mirrors each partner’s strengths and contributions. CF Industries leads day-to-day operations and maintenance, leveraging its decades of know-how at Donaldsonville. Meanwhile, JERA and Mitsui bring deep pockets and global market reach. CF’s extra $550 million investment secures dedicated storage, loading docks and pipeline tie-ins, ensuring a smooth startup and robust O&M. While exact equity percentages are under wraps, the shares are structured so CF Industries’ operational role and JERA/Mitsui’s offtake guarantees all line up neatly.

Export & Global Relevance

With 1.4 million metric tons of annual capacity, Blue Point is tailor-made for exports. Louisiana’s deep-water ports and inland network make shipping clean ammonia to Asia and Europe a breeze. Japanese utilities see ammonia as a hydrogen carrier that can back up renewables, and direct shipping lanes from the Gulf Coast slash midstream handling costs. Plus, competitive freight rates—up to 15% below global averages—could position U.S. ammonia as the go-to, lower-carbon feedstock for fertilizer makers and marine fuel blenders. European refiners have already asked about trial shipments, adding diversity to the offtake lineup.

Economic & Job Creation

Blue Point isn’t just big on emissions cuts—it’s a local economic engine. We’re talking 103 high-wage permanent jobs plus another 311 in construction, logistics and service roles. Beyond payroll, the project inks contracts with local steel shops, mechanical firms and haulers, cranking up the multiplier effect. Once up and running, Blue Point could pump around $50 million a year into local tax coffers—boosting Ascension Parish’s finances and fueling vital public services.

Community & Stakeholder Engagement

Outreach kicked off early, with partners pledging open-book emissions reporting. Community groups have long pushed back on industrial growth over air quality and health concerns. Blue Point’s reply? Top-tier CCS, 24/7 leak detection systems and regular emergency drills. They’ve also agreed to fund independent air-monitoring stations and back local health programs to tackle pollution legacies. But they know the real work is ongoing dialogue and robust third-party oversight to keep that social license in good standing.

Environmental Considerations

Sure, CCS slashes CO₂ streams, but stacking new plants in an already dense industrial zone comes with trade-offs. Critics warn it might mask upstream methane leaks tied to natural gas. The project’s environmental impact statement dives deep—modeling potential CO₂ migration, assessing seismic risks of storage sites and laying out worst-case scenarios. Third-party verifiers will audit CCS performance, while the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and EPA will keep a close eye on permits. Balancing cleaner ammonia production with local air quality remains a hot topic.

Key Takeaways

This $4 billion investment will bring Blue Point online by 2029, churning out 1.4 million metric tons of low-carbon ammonia annually.

Advanced autothermal reforming and CCS by 1PointFive aim to capture over 95% of CO₂ emissions, showcasing scalable carbon capture and sequestration.

Over 100 permanent and 311 indirect jobs—plus a $550 million ancillary infrastructure boost—will supercharge the regional economy.

Federal and state incentives help lower the levelized cost of ammonia, speeding up the project’s ROI.

At the same time, attacks on higher education are suppressing their freedoms and effectiveness.
His disdain for DEI in higher education appears to be a driver for his attacks on higher education.","The Sept. 30 deadline to avoid a government shutdown and fund the government through the 2026 fiscal year has both Republicans and Democrats scrambling.

Continuing resolutions have become far too common. The White House pushed for a four-month continuing resolution, which was mostly ignored. The House voted for a seven-week continuing resolution, which was subsequently voted down in the Senate. All such efforts do nothing more than “kick the can down the road” and delay hard decisions.

Given the forecasted deficits resulting from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” financial waste is something that our nation can ill afford. With more than $37 trillion of accumulated government debt, independent of who owns such debt, the fiscal time bomb continues to tick, with budget hawks remaining as the lone voices expressing any concern.

If there is any hope that our nation will be able to climb out of its current fiscal quagmire, money spent by the government should have some positive return on investment. Of course, this does not mean that every expenditure must provide an immediate positive payback; expenditures related to healthcare and national security, for instance, are necessary investments in the well-being of the country. What it does mean is that across a swath of the population, the nation should be better for spending taxpayer dollars.

Examples of such investments in the past are ubiquitous.

In 1956, President Eisenhower signed legislation that created the interstate highway system. This investment has benefited every person who has traveled on our nation’s road transportation system. The economic benefits of this investment have been immeasurable. Not only did the construction of the system create jobs, many companies built systems around it, including hotels, restaurants and shopping venues. This investment continues to pay dividends across the economy.

The same holds true with the national airspace system, which the Federal Aviation Administration oversees. Ensuring safe and reliable air travel creates economic value that a large swath of the population benefits from. That is why not making the necessary investments to upgrade and enhance the air traffic control system are ill-conceived, risking a lost trust in what is a national benefit for most people.

Another investment that enjoys a positive return on investment is higher education. An educated population creates wealth. It has facilitated our digital economy, encouraged entrepreneurship and permitted our service economy to grow at a pace that produced a $293 billion trade surplus in 2024, with nearly 20 percent of this due to international education. College training will continue to be required for many new jobs created in the future. Higher education is indeed a national treasure — a model for excellence that is emulated across the globe.

At the same time, attacks on higher education are suppressing their freedoms and effectiveness. Given that education produced a $50 billion trade surplus in 2023, cutting the very industry that provides a positive return on investment is nonsensical.

The president may be measuring return on investment based on his ideological likes and dislikes. His disdain for DEI in higher education appears to be a driver for his attacks on higher education. Moreover, his style in negotiating “deals” with countries on tariffs gives each of them the motivation to flatter his ego and appease his every whim.

Then there is the cost of servicing the accumulated government debt. Uncertainty surrounding the president’s on again, off again, changes in tariff rates created uncertainty in the economy, pushing the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady, rather than dropping them as the president wanted. A slowing economy prompted the recent one-quarter point drop in the Federal Reserve benchmark interest rate, the first such rate decrease in nine months. Note that each one-point drop in interest rates would save the government no less than $6 billion in monthly debt service payments just on short-term debt alone.

In an era with out-of-control government spending, persistent budget deficits and a Congress whose actions seem only to serve to help them get reelected and retain their own power, something has to give. Spending more because it is easy is not a sustainable path forward.

This time around, lawmakers have their hands full to avoid a government shutdown. History suggests that some compromise will be reached at the 11th hour, though some believe this time may be different. Recall that the most recent government shutdown occurred during the first Trump administration. It remains to be seen whether history will repeat itself.

When DOGE was created to root out government waste, it needed look no further than how Congress funds the government. As someone who spent time in the federal government, continuing resolutions and the threat of a government shutdown create more financial waste than anything the 2.3 million federal employees can ever imagine squandering on their own.

In an ideal world, a simple concept like return on investment should be the foundation for how the government sets and funds budget priorities. With ubiquitous government dysfunction in Washington today, however, continuing resolutions that dodge difficult decisions and steer clear of reasonable compromises continue to be the path taken, all paid for by taxpayers.

New York’s $1 billion Sustainable Future Program is a critical step toward a healthier and more equitable future, lowering energy costs for families and creating thousands of good jobs.
We look forward to continued collaboration with Governor Hochul to advance these critical programs,” Climate Jobs NY Executive Director Esther Rosario said, “Governor Hochul’s Sustainable Future Program is a transformative investment in New York’s clean energy future.
That’s why we applaud today’s announcement allocating dedicated funding for medium- and heavy-duty truck charging in New York State.","Governor Hochul today, while participating in the U.S Climate Alliance’s roundtable, announced the next steps for her landmark $1 billion Sustainable Future Program to accelerate capital projects in New York's transition to a cleaner, greener future. This historic investment will create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for New Yorkers, and slash harmful emissions in the face of federal rollbacks.

“New York is a national leader in climate action, and we're proving that we can build a thriving green economy while protecting our planet,” Governor Hochul said. “While others may retreat, we are doubling down. The $1 billion investment from our Sustainable Future Program will directly benefit New Yorkers by making our homes more energy-efficient, our schools healthier, and our communities more resilient. We are creating jobs, improving public health, and ensuring a just and affordable transition for every community.”

The $1 billion Sustainable Future Program, announced in this year’s State of the State, is the largest climate investment in New York’s history. Today’s announcement allocates funding to key areas of the state's climate plan to help make the transition more affordable for all New Yorkers.

Empowering New Yorkers with Energy Efficiency

$50 million will be allocated to the EmPower+ program to provide low- and moderate-income residents with no-cost home energy assessments and energy efficiency upgrades. NYSERDA will focus this funding on heat pump installations, a key technology for reducing reliance on fossil fuels in residential heating and cooling.

Greening Our Schools

$50 million will be used to help under-resourced public schools across the state decarbonize their building portfolios. This investment will improve indoor air quality for students and staff and reduce the schools’ carbon footprint.

Investing in Thermal Energy Networks

$200 million is dedicated to expanding thermal energy networks, which use a system of pipes to share heating and cooling resources among multiple buildings. This funding will support projects at municipal and State-owned buildings, and will specifically include several projects within the State University of New York (SUNY) system:

SUNY Purchase: $50 million to design and construct the first phase of a thermal energy network and establish a framework for future geothermal systems on campus.

State University of New York at Buffalo: $68 million to design and build energy hubs and thermal energy networks, phasing out fossil fuel-based systems and replacing them with on-site electrical systems.

State University of New York at Stony Brook: $22 million to design and construct thermal energy systems at two buildings on campus.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “Governor Hochul has made clear her commitment to supporting generational investments like the Sustainable Future Program to foster an improved quality of life for all New Yorkers. Cleaning the air we breathe while lowering energy costs by advancing renewable energy projects, zero-emission transportation options and energy efficient building upgrades provides communities across the state with a critical foundation for a sustainable future.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, “Governor Hochul is making nation-leading investments to meaningfully fight climate change and make a future truly sustainable in New York. This landmark $1 billion Sustainable Future Program is supporting New York’s transition to an affordable and accessible green future that will offer relief for homeowners, create clean energy jobs, and reduce pollution statewide.”

New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “The Power Authority is advancing the largest portfolio of utility-scale, clean energy generation in decades, and the Sustainable Future Program will help us move viable projects to fruition. When we build projects, alone or in partnership, we must consider capital costs, long-term maintenance, fuels costs and financing. The Governor’s investment in renewable projects from the sustainability fund will enable us to be shovel-ready sooner on priority projects.”

New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, “The critical investments being made through the Sustainable Future Program will deliver the best of both worlds – it will develop important pathways to long-term sustainability and will make New York more affordable for the residents and businesses here today. At HCR, we’re excited the $150 million allocated to create the Green Small Buildings Program will allow eligible homeowners and renters to benefit from new heating systems that improve efficiency and reduce energy costs. We thank Governor Hochul for her continued efforts to combat climate change by championing programs that will ensure a greener future for all of New York State.”

SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. said, “SUNY remains committed to helping Governor Hochul achieve the state’s climate goals, and thanks to her investment we will be able to transition the State University of New York at Buffalo, SUNY Purchase, and the State University of New York at Stony Brook to more efficient and sustainable energy sources. This funding will help SUNY meet its goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions and ensure students will have a brighter, more sustainable future.”

New York State AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento said, “We support Governor Hochul’s commitment to accelerating the State’s clean energy goals, a move that not only creates good-paying jobs and lowers energy costs but also significantly benefits hardworking New Yorkers. As we transition to a greener economy, we must invest in our workforce, particularly by ensuring that New York's clean energy and climate projects are built, operated, maintained, repaired, and manufactured by workers who earn good wages and enjoy the benefits and protections guaranteed by union contracts.”

New York State Building Trades President Gary LaBarbera said, “If New York is going to successfully establish a strong green economy that equips us to meet our climate and energy goals, we must ensure we are creating good paying union careers that will give more hardworking people the opportunity to pursue the middle class and reinvest in their communities. Investments like the Sustainable Future Fund, which embeds apprenticeship programs, project labor agreements, and prevailing wage requirements into projects at the core of the state's clean energy transition, are crucial to these efforts. We applaud Governor Hochul for continuing to push forward these initiatives that bolster our sustainable future and improve the lives of countless New Yorkers, including our tradesmen and tradeswomen.”

New York Director for the Building Decarbonization Coalition Lisa Dix said, “Governor Hochul is showing how states can lead by example. New York’s $1 billion Sustainable Future Program is a critical step toward a healthier and more equitable future, lowering energy costs for families and creating thousands of good jobs. The Building Decarbonization Coalition strongly supports funding for Thermal Energy Networks, weatherization, heat pumps, and the EmPower+ program, which will cut emissions and expand access to clean energy. We look forward to continued collaboration with Governor Hochul to advance these critical programs,”

Climate Jobs NY Executive Director Esther Rosario said, “Governor Hochul’s Sustainable Future Program is a transformative investment in New York’s clean energy future. These resources will cut emissions, create good union jobs, and lower energy costs for families. From Thermal Energy Networks to expanded NYPA renewable energy funding and support for EmPower+, these investments move us closer to a healthier, more affordable, and more resilient New York. We thank Governor Hochul for her leadership at a time when clean energy investments are under attack, and for advancing a bold vision for our state’s future.”

New York League of Conservation Voters Julie Tighe said, “While the federal government retreats from its commitments, New York is stepping up by investing in clean air, good-paying jobs, and healthier communities. From heat pumps in our homes to clean rides for kids, from boosting renewables and funding cutting edge thermal energy networks, the Sustainable Future Fund delivers real, bold action for New Yorkers. We applaud Governor Hochul for showing the country what strong state leadership looks like.”

Evergreen Action Vice President for States Justin Balik said, “In the face of federal retrenchment, it’s clear that we’ll be looking to states for leadership on solving our most pressing challenges. These investments will lower costs and cut pollution, delivering tangible and meaningful benefits to New Yorkers across the state. This move by Governor Hochul sets a strong foundation to build on going forward.”

Trucking Association of New York President Kendra Hems said, “The trucking industry is fully committed to sustainability. From adopting low sulfur diesel, to meeting and exceeding EPA emission standards, to investing in cleaner fuels like CNG and renewable diesel, our industry has consistently championed initiatives that reduce emissions and improve air quality. Incorporating electric trucks in the applications where they make the most sense is an important step forward. But to make electrification successful, we need our government partners to invest in the infrastructure that will support it. That’s why we applaud today’s announcement allocating dedicated funding for medium- and heavy-duty truck charging in New York State. This investment represents a critical milestone toward building a cleaner, more efficient freight system while ensuring the reliability our economy depends on.”

Assemblymember Didi Barrett said “When we established the Sustainable Futures Fund in the budget, it was with a recognition that New York State must provide the resources necessary to help people, communities, schools and not for profits across the state lower their carbon footprint. I am pleased that the Sustainable Futures Fund will include support for the essential EmPower+ Program, which has helped thousands of New Yorkers decarbonize their homes, as well as critical funding to decarbonize our schools, expand thermal energy networks, and accelerate renewable energy projects.”",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-09/climate1.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=-419pJiB,N,,2025-09-24 11:02:49.511988

This year’s summit arrives on the heels of the third-hottest summer ever recorded in the northern hemisphere (surpassed only by 2023 and 2024) and a season defined by extreme weather disasters that made the climate crisis impossible to ignore.

The Palisades Fire tore through Los Angeles, leveling homes in affluent communities where the impacts of climate change had typically felt more abstract and remote. More people died from wildfire smoke in the US last year than from car crashes. Across the country, unprecedented flooding devastated towns from Asheville, North Carolina, where entire communities lost their homes and businesses, to Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas, where 20 young campers and seven adults tragically perished.

Despite mounting human suffering and the nation’s top scientists sounding the alarm on the health impacts of climate change with new studies, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, is now moving to dismantle the very foundation of U.S. climate policy. He proposes eliminating the EPA’s Endangerment Finding — a cornerstone ruling that recognizes greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and gives the agency the authority to limit pollution from vehicles and power plants. Zeldin’s move flies in the face of science, law, and basic morality

United in Action

This is why EARTHDAY.ORG joined with the Climate Action Campaign (CAC), and dozens of allied organizations to deliver over 225,000 public comments to the EPA, in person, urging them to uphold the Endangerment Finding. On September 17, we gathered at the U.S. Capitol for a press conference that underscored just how high the stakes are.

In a room filled with journalists and climate advocates, eight members of Congress—from Maine to Texas—spoke candidly about how climate change is already harming Americans of every background, through rising seas, collapsing fisheries, emerging diseases, and worsening wildfires.

Senator Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, warned that repealing the Endangerment Finding would eliminate regulations that “will kill jobs, cause families to shell out more for gasoline, and hurt our kids with asthma attacks.”

Representative Chellie Pingree, of Maine, spoke to the collapse of her state’s fishing economy and the spread of climate-driven diseases: “It impacts our lives every single day. It’s impacting our economy and our livelihood.”

Rejecting the influence of corporate profiteers, Senator Alex Padilla, of California, reaffirmed his commitment to constituents: “We refuse to allow corporations to speak louder than our kids and our neighbors. We’re seeing industry profits rise while communities burn down. And we’ll keep speaking out. We’ll keep standing up to what we know is wrong, because too many lives and future generations depend on it.“

The most powerful testimony, however, came from children. One girl declared, “Kids want the EPA to protect our health and future. Our generation is expected to live through three times as many climate disasters as our grandparents, and we’re already living through them.”

An impassioned boy pleaded, “To every adult listening today who cares about children now and our lives in the future, we are asking you to please protect the Endangerment Finding and our future.” Their words were a reminder that climate change is not an abstract threat. It is impacting the lives of real people, in real time.

Delivering Public Outcry

After the press conference, we carried box after box of public comments to the EPA headquarters. Though the agency has recently weakened many avenues for public input, we refuse to let these voices go unheard, even if we have to deliver their comments by hand.

As we set the boxes down in the EPA’s lobby, recently adorned with an austere presidential portrait, it was a good moment to reflect on everything we had heard at the Capitol from both seasoned elected leaders and young activists alike. Every person who spoke did so because they or their communities had already suffered loss because of climate change. Their message was clear: denying the causes, reality and dangers of climate change is not just a policy failure, it is an act of harm that results in destroyed homes, lost livelihoods, and shattered futures. If the Endangerment Finding is repealed, lives will be lost.

All of this unfolds on the eve of Climate Week NYC, beginning September 21. These global summits have often been criticized as inaccessible and toothless, more about speeches than solutions. But with the Endangerment Finding under direct attack, it is no longer enough for leaders to merely acknowledge the climate crisis.

The EPA is doing everything it can to deny the terrible costs of climate change, and we need the participants of Climate Week to help set the record straight. They must speak up and act, and they must do so with the same urgency that millions of families already feel in their lungs, their wallets, and their communities.",https://www.earthday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/240224_uscapitol-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 11:04:14.928467

Fermi America is looking to build out energy storage, solar, natural gas, and nuclear power at a private grid in Amarillo, Texas.
However, as Starrs and Reams noted during the RE+ panel, focusing solely on the reliability of renewables, without being completely swayed by the administration’s whims, could be a viable approach.","Further actions by the US president include declaring a national energy emergency, vowing to fill the country’s strategic oil reserves, and reinforcing his promise to “drill, baby, drill”. He intends to boost fossil fuel production in Alaska and export natural gas.

Significant changes have also occurred at the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO). Under the Biden administration, Jigar Shah headed the LPO, which regularly announced loans and investments for a wide array of renewable energy projects.

Recent activity from the LPO has focused on restarting the Palisades Nuclear Plant in Michigan.

On 16 September, the office announced the release of a sixth loan to support the plant’s restart, disbursing around US$156 million of the up to US$1.52 billion loan guarantee. To date, this total is still less than half of the guarantee, with US$491 million disbursed.

The shifts in policy have come with shifts in messaging, with the administration often citing threats to national security from “foreign controlled energy sources,” and in turn, creating a “National Energy Dominance Council”.

Experts weigh in at RE+

Isaiah Menning, External Affairs Director at American Conservation Coalition, highlighted, “The animating force (for Conservatives) right now is what serves the American interest. Everyone knows that America First is what President Trump is going for.”

Menning also stated that the party’s main objections to renewables are reliability and dependence on foreign countries.

Heather Reams, President and CEO of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES), said the way to address these concerns is to focus on lowering energy costs and highlighting American innovation.

“That is really going to be compelling for Republican members of Congress: It’s solutions-oriented, we’re innovating, we’re shoring up supply chains, we’re ensuring there’s a healthy balance, and we’re driving costs down.”

Tom Starrs, Vice President for government and public affairs at EDP Renewables, shared how EDP is changing its tactics in an attempt to appeal to “rural” communities.

Starrs said the company realised “we can’t have a developer, a guy with, you know, long hair and an earring walking into a hearing room in a rural community in the Midwest, and expecting him to have any credibility.”

“We decided a couple of years ago to hire someone from that local community for every project we have advancing through the development cycle.”

“The perfect examples are a family man, or the guy who runs the local chamber, or the owner of a local diner where all the old white guys go for morning coffee and chat. It doesn’t really matter who it is, as long as they have credibility within the community.”

The panel members then addressed a question from the audience about how to counter misinformation about renewables.

This is a topic that Kevin Smith, CEO of Arevon Energy, recently spoke to ESN Premium about, saying: “Our philosophy is to engage early and often with town officials, fire departments, and the local community. Some developers try to proceed quietly, hoping not to attract attention, but this approach can lead to misinformation spreading in the community. We prefer to be upfront.”

Starrs emphasised that these conversations come down to highlighting the economic advantages of BESS, solar, and other renewables. He said, “We have to fight, we have to combat this information with actual good information.”

Reams pointed out the support that Republicans currently have for these projects, using a recent study from CRES as an example.

“Our organisation just put out a poll, which found that solar enjoys 80 to 90% of support from Republicans, so nothing’s changed with voters.”

A change to renewables’ messaging

A point emphasised throughout the panel was how to frame solar, particularly as a technology that serves “American interests” and “American energy dominance.”

This messaging has been proving successful for energy storage.

After the OBBB was signed into law, Isshu Kikuma, energy storage analyst at BloombergNEF (BNEF), while speaking with ESN, provided some insight into why energy storage may have retained the Investment Tax Credit (ITC).

“I think that’s because the current administration focuses on reliability quite a lot. Right now, they don’t talk much about decarbonisation or the energy transition, but I think they do care about reliability. To maintain reliability, dispatchable power sources, or power sources with flexibility, are definitely key for the power grid. I think that’s why they’re keeping the support for energy storage, as well as other technologies like geothermal and nuclear.”

Peak Energy president and CCO, Cameron Dales, spoke with ESN about the state of the US battery storage industry after the signing of the Budget Reconciliation Act into law. This conversation also gave insight into the changes in the positioning of BESS technology.

Dales said, “In the end, from a national security perspective, it’s one of a handful of really critical technologies that there’s a bipartisan consensus that we need to control our own destiny, and the ability to store energy is one of the critical needs in the economy.”

Recently, some of this messaging has been taken a step further, such as with Fermi America, co-founded by former US Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Fermi America is looking to build out energy storage, solar, natural gas, and nuclear power at a private grid in Amarillo, Texas.

When announcing this project, Fermi highlighted comments from US Congressman Ronny Jackson, stating, “This strategic investment and key innovative partnership between Fermi America and the Texas Tech University System is expected to establish the world’s largest energy-driven data centre, placing America firmly at the forefront of the global AI race against the Chinese Communist Party.”

It is undoubtedly vital to develop a secure supply chain for BESS, solar, wind and other renewables in the US and to stimulate American manufacturing, creating jobs and meeting our growing energy demands.

However, as Starrs and Reams noted during the RE+ panel, focusing solely on the reliability of renewables, without being completely swayed by the administration’s whims, could be a viable approach.

Starrs and Reams noted that no action has been taken to build out transmission infrastructure for data centres, leaving the grid vulnerable in the near future.

Reams said, “I think that we need to hold the administration and other federal policy committees accountable for the lack of investment in transmission infrastructure and other regulations.”

Starrs continued, “Republicans are already blaming us for the overnight price hikes in cities, and they have a history of criticising us in the clean energy sector, attacking the Democratic party for major grid outages during thunderstorms. So, I think we need to be more effective in both defence and offence in our advocacy strategy.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-03-102535.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 12:05:35.310698

“We are extremely pleased to announce our first participation in a tax credit insurance transaction. This success reflects months of dedicated effort and a logical extension of NER’s capabilities in supporting the clean energy industry,” said George Schulz, CEO of NER. “We appreciate Alliant for their leadership on this transaction and our insurance partners for their continued support of NER’s work to deliver innovative, large-scale performance insurance solutions for breakthrough technologies.”

“Alliant is pleased to welcome NER into the tax insurance market and extends our sincere appreciation for the valuable support they provided to both our firm and our client,” said Dan Schoenberg, Executive Vice President of Alliant Mergers & Acquisitions. “We look forward to strengthening our collaboration with NER and their insurance partners in the years ahead.”

With this transaction, NER plans to deliver much-needed capacity to the tax credit insurance market by combining its tax and technology underwriting expertise to offer comprehensive insurance solutions that address the technology-related risk elements of tax credit transactions, particularly those involving Section 45 and Section 48 credits.

Tax credits have long been a cornerstone of clean energy development. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 enhanced their role by enabling transferability of credits and significantly expanding the pool of capital for renewable energy projects – creating greater demand for insurance to support these transactions. In 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act introduced sweeping changes but ultimately preserved tax credits as a mechanism for financing critical infrastructure, albeit with shorter timelines for certain renewable energy projects.

“With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as well as subsequent IRS guidance, administrative uncertainty surrounding the transition tax credit landscape has eased. In the coming years, tax credits will remain available to finance a wide range of clean energy solutions, including emerging technologies,” said Kevin Broich, Executive Underwriter for Tax at NER. “NER is building a platform to support the rapidly expanding demand for insurance and the need to demonstrate and scale innovative technology solutions.”

This transaction extends NER’s role as a trusted partner to clean energy developers and financiers, demonstrating the company’s ability to combine technology performance expertise with innovative risk-transfer solutions. By applying its underwriting platform to the tax credit market, NER is furthering its mission to enable investment in breakthrough technologies and accelerate the clean energy transition.

Climate change is real.
“Since taking office, Trump has politicised not only climate science but also other observable, empirical truths, notably in public health.
He does not in any way acknowledge the huge issue of climate change.
There were over 600 extreme weather events last year with over 150 being unprecedented, meaning they would not have occurred without human caused climate change – fact.","Climate scientists comment on comments made by President Trump about climate change at the UN conference.

Prof Corinne Le Quere FRS, Professor of Climate Change Science, University of East Anglia (UEA), said:

“Mr Trump is endangering the lives and wellbeing of Americans and people around the world by wrongly denying the realities of climate change. We should be working together to protect people and businesses by limiting climate change as much as possible and adapting to reduce its widespread impacts.”

Prof Kevin Anderson, Professor of Energy and Climate Change at the Tyndall Centre, said:

“The President’s views on climate change should be afforded the same weight as his now-infamous advice to Americans to inject disinfectant as a cure for Covid. In both cases, the suggestion is detached from science, detached from reality, and dangerous if taken seriously. The only real difference is that while the disinfectant comment was quickly mocked and discarded, his climate pronouncements continue to be repeated as if they carry credibility. They don’t.”

Prof Chris Rapley, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London, said:

“Should we be surprised? History and human psychology say no. The question is, does it matter? To which the answer is unfortunately “Yes” – but perhaps not as much as we may fear. Presidents and their entourage come and go. But the economics of energy production are ineluctable. And the climate system is indifferent”.

Dr Matthew Jones, Senior Research Associate in the School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia (UEA), said:

“Trump’s pathetic culture war against all forms of science does nothing to help humanity secure a safe and liveable planet for future generations.”

Dr Karsten Haustein, Climate Scientist, Leipzig University, said:

“Just another stunt pulled from the authoritarian playbook. Distorting the truth so that people lose their sense of reality entirely. Extremely dangerous mass manipulation and demagoguery. Three simple facts: The Earth is round. Climate change is real. Trump and his cronies are a scam. It needs to be said over and over again.”

Dr Injy Johnstone, Research Associate in Net Zero Aligned Offsetting at the University of Oxford, said:

“Trump is correct in one thing: climate change is a scam in the sense that it is the result of listening to con men who have let it get out of hand for so long for their own benefit at the expense of slowing down solutions that are good for people, planet and profit.”

Dr Anupama Sen, Head of Policy Engagement at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, said:

“We stand at a critical moment in history where countries and citizens can make a choice between placing our trust in science and reason – which have underpinned centuries of human progress, including in medicine, technology and more recently in AI – or fall prey to rhetoric, misinformation and division. The overwhelming scientific consensus is that climate change is already happening, does not bow to political cycles, and rewards economies and countries which choose to believe in science, with record investments in green energy, better living standards, and eventually, better energy security.”

Dr Chloe Brimicombe, Climate scientist and public engagement manager, Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS), said:

“Controversially Trump is not wrong that scientists did think 100 years ago that the climate was cooling. Does this mean climate change is a con? No, but if you think about it, it’s difficult to visualise so I guess it is our job to meet someone at what they understand and this is where modelling has it’s real limits. So, here are the facts. Extreme weather is increasingly costing countries money and lives and investing in sustainable energy and technology and helping communities against weather impacts within one’s own country, supports national jobs and makes good business sense and really for a leader I can see why that’d matter.”

Alexis McGivern, Head of Stakeholder Engagement, Oxford Net Zero, said:

“Trump’s comments are deliberately inflammatory, part of a broader and sustained attack on independent experts and the observable realities of science.

“Make no mistake: Trump and his advisors know that climate change is not a hoax. Undermining confidence in experts is simply politically expedient, serving to consolidate power of their increasingly authoritarian regime.

“But this is not simply a rejection of science, or the headline-splash of calling climate experts “stupid people”. The deeper question is who is benefitting (especially financially) from denying evidence while advancing policies like “drill, baby, drill”. The latest Production Gap report shows, again, that the United States still plans to produce far more fossil fuels than is compatible with a 1.5°C world.

“Since taking office, Trump has politicised not only climate science but also other observable, empirical truths, notably in public health. In every case, the gains in money and power flow upward, while those least responsible for climate change remain the first and hardest hit.”

Prof Hannah Cloke, Professor of Hydrology, University of Reading, said:

“My jaw just hit the floor. Donald Trump can predict what he likes, and believe what he likes, but his rhetoric cannot change the laws of physics. The “stupid people” have shown how human activity and fossil fuels are heating up our planet, with impacts on societies and ecosystems everywhere in the world.”

Prof Eric Wolff, Chair of the Royal Society’s Biodiversity, Environment and Climate Committee, said:

“Climate change is real – the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities is resulting in fundamental changes to our planet. It is increasing the risk of extreme weather, warming the ocean and causing ice caps to melt resulting in sea level rise, and threatening ecosystems, lives and livelihoods across the world.

“That is the conclusion of rigorously tested and reviewed scientific evidence, built up over decades. To suggest it is a ‘con job’ is flying in the face both of what we can observe, and of physics.”

Prof Pierre Friedlingstein FRS, Chair in Mathematical Modelling of Climate Systems, University of Exeter, said:

“To quote Upton Sinclair, it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.”

Prof Keith Shine FRS, Regius Professor of Meteorology and Climate Science at the University of Reading, said:

“It’s a real tragedy that a US President can be so poorly informed on how climate is changing and why climate is changing.”

Prof Hayley Fowler, Director of the Centre of Climate and Environmental Resilience and Royal Society Faraday Discovery Fellow, Newcastle University, said:

“The fossil fuel industry and President Trump are perpetrating the biggest con job in the world: the denial of anthropogenic climate warming. The evidence is everywhere and overwhelming. Record shattering heatwaves, flood events and hurricanes are causing colossal economic damages that will continue to increase until we significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This is a scientific fact, one that has been suppressed by the fossil fuel industry for decades as they concentrate on profits.”

Prof Dann Mitchell, University of Bristol, and Lead of the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (Health and Wellbeing), said:

“World leading scientific analysis shows that thousands of heat-related deaths will be avoidable during extreme heatwaves in major US cities, if we can keep global carbon emissions consistent with the Paris Agreement climate goals. For a president to show such disregard for the health of his own citizens is nothing short of reckless.”

Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said:

“Donald Trump’s daft outburst about climate change at the United Nations is perfectly consistent with his other bogus beliefs, such as Tylenol causes autism, you can treat Covid by injecting disinfectant, and US tariffs are paid by exporters. All these myths will potentially cause harm to the American people if they believe them. He is truly the President that the Enlightenment left behind.”

Prof Mark Maslin, Pro-Vice Provost of the UCL Climate Crisis Grand Challenge, said:

“Much of what Trump said at the UN was factually incorrect, deeply misleading and simply wrong. He does not in any way acknowledge the huge issue of climate change. 2024 was the warmest year ever recorded – fact. There were over 600 extreme weather events last year with over 150 being unprecedented, meaning they would not have occurred without human caused climate change – fact. So here’s an analysis of what Trump said and why it is factually wrong.

“■ Trump: Green energy is expensive … Reality: Renewables have gotten cheaper. Renewable energy is often significantly cheaper than fossil fuels, with over 90% of new renewable projects now costing less than new fossil fuel alternatives, largely due to rapid price declines in solar and wind technologies since 2010. For instance, new solar projects can be around £41/MWh, compared to approximately £114/MWh for new gas power stations, making new renewables a much cheaper option for electricity generation. https://www.iea.org/news/rapid-rollout-of-clean-technologies-makes-energy-cheaper-not-more-costly

“■ Trump: Clean Beautiful Coal Reality: UN report says 8 million premature death due to air pollution but new figures are higher – closer to 10 M a year due to particulate matters from the burning of fossil fuels so there is no “clean” beautiful coal https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121000487

“■ Trump: UN said in the year 2000 there is global warming and there will be catastrophic consequences – they were wrong so that’s why they change the term to climate change – i think a simple definition of the difference between the two terms will be good. Reality: US$2 trillion in economic losses from ~4,000 extreme weather events. In just the last two full years (2022–2023), damages were ~US$451 billion https://iccwbo.org/news-publications/policies-reports/new-report-extreme-weather-events-cost-economy-2-trillion-over-the-last-decade/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/11/extreme-weather-cost-2tn-globally-over-past-decade-report-finds

“■ Trump suggested that green energy ‘scam’ is not helping the economy. Reality: Clean energy added ~USD 320 billion to the global economy in 2023. That was about 10% of global GDP growth in that year. https://www.iea.org/commentaries/clean-energy-is-boosting-economic-growth https://www.iea.org/commentaries/clean-energy-is-boosting-economic-growth About 3.5 million Americans already working in renewable energy and growth in clean energy employment is more than twice the rate of the overall U.S. labour market. Also projects that the global market for renewable energy technologies could be worth at least USD 23 trillion by 2030, which implies big opportunities https://www.energy.gov/eere/job-creation-and-economic-growth#:~:text=Funding%20energy%20innovations%20creates%20well,U.S.%20labor%20market%20in%202023.

Prof. Pete Smith FRS, Professor of Soils & Global Change at the University of Aberdeen, said:

“Trump has no knowledge of science and is not qualified to judge what is or is not robust science. His comments on climate change, like his pronouncements on vaccines and links between painkillers and autism, are arrogant and ignorant in equal measure.”

Prof Martin Siegert, Professor of Geosciences and Deputy VC, University of Exeter, said:

“The greatest con-job is not the rock-solid decades-old fully-tested science that proves fossil-fuel burning causes global heating, dirty air and nature loss, but rather the illogical ignorant antiscientific denial of it.”

Prof Joeri Rogelj, Director of Research, Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, said:

“Dismissing climate change is as grotesque as it is wrong. Refusing to believe in thermometers will not make the warming go away. The evidence — measured, observed and understood — is clear: human activities are heating the planet, and ignoring that reality only leaves societies more exposed and less prepared.”

Prof David Viner, IPCC author and expert reviewer, said:

“Trump has just awarded all climate scientists their greatest badge of honour, fantastic. This superbly ignorant statement of Trump endorses all of the work of the climate science and wider scientific community.”

Prof Richard Allan, Professor of Climate Science, University of Reading, said:

“Although Trump thinks he’s really good at predicting things, evidence is needed to back up these empty claims and the science has been clear for a very long time that the climate is warming up, it is primarily caused by burning fossil fuels and without massively building upon the ongoing collaborative and innovative action to curb greenhouse gas emissions the world will be a much more dangerous and unpleasant place to live in.”

Prof Ed Hawkins, National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading, said:

“We have known since the 1930s that burning fossil fuels is warming the climate. We are already seeing the consequences with rising sea levels, hotter heatwaves and heavier rainfall. The risks increase with every bit of further warming and the world will regret not acting faster to reduce carbon emissions.”

Prof Bill McGuire, Professor Emeritus of Geophysical & Climate Hazards at UCL, and author of Hothouse Earth: an Inhabitant’s Guide, said:

“The greatest con job perpetrated in the world isn’t climate change, it is Trump. The staggering ignorance he displays of the science isn’t a surprise, as it mirrors a comparable lack of understanding of many of the critical issues of our time.

“The truth is that climate breakdown, driven by global heating caused by human activities, is unequivocal. Not only this, but the temperature of our world has never climbed this rapidly across the entire geological record. We are heading for climate catastrophe, and the United States is set to be one of the hardest hit countries. In the decades to come, its people will rue the anti-climate actions of this rogue president”.

Prof Bill Collins, Professor of Climate Processes, University of Reading, said:

“The science of climate change has given us useful predictions that have been found to have be extremely farsighted. Predictions from 50 years ago of the level of global warming seen today have been uncannily accurate in forecasting the 1 degree rise over that period. This is in complete contrast to anecdotes of ice ages.”

Prof. Andrew Turner, Lead Author of the IPCC 6th Assessment Report and Programme Lead for Climate & Global Change at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, said:

“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been assessing the science related to climate change over six assessment cycles (now entering its 7th), producing six comprehensive reports authored by the world’s leading scientists. As in all IPCC reports, 6th Assessment Report (released in 2021) has its headline outcomes (known as the Summary for Policymakers) agreed meticulously by all contributing governments. This includes the USA.

“A key outcome is that worsening climate impacts, caused by humanity’s emissions of greenhouse gases, are now detectable all across the world. The impacts, including extreme rainfall, flooding and droughts, and sea-level rise, will continue to worsen with every additional fraction of a degree of global warming in the future.

“The IPCC is tasked with making an assessment that is not policy-relevant, but not policy-prescriptive. As such, unless we urgently reach net-zero emissions, climate impacts will cause worsening economic damage and deaths, with a cost that exceeds taking action now.

“President Trump may not like the message, but fortunately good science does not rely on beliefs or ideologies, and that message will not disappear however much politicians continue to look the other way, with fingers in their ears.”

Dr Chris Huntingford of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said:

“All those involved in climate change research begin with the premise that climate is not changing, the so-called “null hypothesis”. Only after rigorous data analysis and conducting extremely careful physics-led simulations do we consider the “alternative hypothesis” that change is occurring. Unfortunately, as hard as we try to prove otherwise, almost every data stream aligns with calculations indicating the alternative hypothesis: the world is warming in response to greenhouse gas emissions.”

Prof John Marsham, Professor of Atmospheric Science, University of Leeds, said:

“Even the fossil-fuel industry’s own reports from as far back as the 1980s show the reality of man-made climate change, with one report warning “Civilisation could prove a fragile thing”. Nevertheless, the industry has long sought to delay climate action and of course funds the Republican party. If under Trump the USA doesn’t invest in renewables, it doesn’t just delay the action we need – it allows other countries to get ahead and profit from the renewables revolution that is providing cheap secure energy, and jobs, but is an existential threat to profits from fossil fuels.”

Their targets: By 2030, heat pumps will make up 65% of the sales of residential heating, air conditioning, and water heating equipment.
States have the ability to establish the minimum health, safety, and energy standards that developers must adhere to.
Push utilities to deliver clean heat.States can require utilities to slash emissions and electrify buildings.
For example, Massachusetts has required its three major electric utilities to offer discounted winter electricity rates to households with heat pumps.","States are ramping up efforts to get residents to switch from fossil-fuel-fired heating systems to all-electric heat pumps. Now, they’ve got a big new tool kit to pull from.

Last week, the interagency nonprofit Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, or NESCAUM, released an 80-page action plan laying out key strategies to turbocharge heat-pump deployment. Individual states are already putting many of these tactics to the test.

California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia together committed to ambitious heat-pump adoption goals last year. Washington state joined the pact last week. Their targets: By 2030, heat pumps will make up 65% of the sales of residential heating, air conditioning, and water heating equipment. By 2040, that percentage is to climb to 90%.

The goals are essential for addressing climate change. Buildings are directly responsible for 13% of U.S. carbon emissions, in part due to the fossil fuels burned on-site to heat indoor air and water. All-electric heat pumps can do those jobs running on clean power.

The NESCAUM action plan comes as the Trump administration clings tenaciously to fossil fuels. In recent months, the federal government has rolled back energy-efficiency standards for appliances, imposed chaotic tariffs that are raising costs for consumers, and put an early expiration date on the $2,000 federal tax credit that helps homeowners afford heat pumps.

Despite these headwinds, the report shows that ​“states are still finding creative ways to move forward,” said Emily Levin, policy and program director for NESCAUM.

HVAC heat pumps are routinely two to four times as efficient as gas furnaces, capable of heating and cooling interiors using the same physics that refrigerators employ to chill your cucumbers. Heat-pump water heaters work the same way and are three to five times as efficient as gas water heaters. By eschewing fossil fuels, these technologies improve air quality and typically save people money over the long term, even if, on average, they cost significantly more up-front than conventional heating systems. (At least one startup, though, is trying to change that.)

Heat pumps are slowly catching on. In the U.S., the units outsold gas furnaces by their biggest-ever margin last year, but their share of the market is still modest. Citing data from the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade association, Levin said that in 2021, heat pumps accounted for about 25% of the combined shipments of gas furnaces, heat pumps, and air conditioners, the three largest reported HVAC categories. In 2024, they’d risen to about 32%.

“No matter how you look at it, there are still a lot of gas furnaces being sold, there are still a lot of one-way central air-conditioners being sold — all of which could really become heat pumps,” Levin said.

Produced in consultation with state agencies, environmental justice organizations, and technical and policy experts, the NESCAUM report lays out a diverse set of more than 50 strategies — both carrots and sticks — covering equity and workforce investments, obligations to reduce carbon, building standards, and utility regulation. A wide range of decision-makers, often in collaboration, can pull these levers — from utility regulators to governor’s offices, state legislatures, and energy, environment, labor, and economic development agencies. Here are six recommendations from the report that stand out.

Make heat pumps more accessible to lower-income and renter households. A number of barriers need to be overcome to make heat pumps available to these groups, who often struggle to afford the appliances or lack the autonomy to install them. For example, contractors can’t put heat pumps in homes with hazards like mold, lead, asbestos, and rotten beams, but the process to address these problems can itself cost tens of thousands of dollars. Philadelphia’s Built to Last program coordinates aid to carry out these necessary pre-electrification repairs. On the other side of the country, California is launching a program this fall to install heat pumps in qualifying low- and moderate-income homes — for free. Notably, owners of low-income multifamily buildings can also use the program to upgrade their tenants’ heating systems, but they must agree to keep rent from increasing more than 3% per year for up to 10 years after the project.

Set an all-electric standard for new buildings. States have the ability to establish the minimum health, safety, and energy standards that developers must adhere to. New York recently became the first state to require that most new buildings be electric only, making heat pumps the default heating appliances. The rules withstood a legal challenge in July and take effect on Dec. 31.

Use building performance standards to encourage heat pumps in existing structures. Such standards require building owners to meet specific annual limits on energy use or carbon emissions and bring them down over time, or face penalties. Several states and cities have already developed these rules. Maryland, for one, stipulates that owners of most edifices 35,000 square feet or greater must report their CO2 emissions starting this year, hit standards by 2030, and fully ditch fossil-fueled appliances by 2040.

Leverage emissions rules that improve air quality and protect public health. For example, in 2023, the San Francisco Bay Area air district, home to more than 7 million people, set landmark rules requiring that new residential water and space heaters don’t spew health-harming nitrogen oxides, starting in 2027 and 2029, respectively. Heat pumps fit the bill. Switching to the tech nationwide could avert more than 2,600 premature deaths annually, according to electrification advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America.

Push utilities to deliver clean heat.States can require utilities to slash emissions and electrify buildings. For example, in 2021, Colorado adopted a first-in-the-nation clean-heat law doing just that. Lawmakers also mandated that utilities file their implementation plans for approval. In 2024, regulators greenlit a $440 million proposal from Xcel Energy, the state’s largest utility, which included electrifying 200,000 homes with heat pumps by 2030. Maryland is developing a similar standard.

Reform electricity rates so that they incentivize zero-emissions heating. Households with heat pumps tend to use more electricity than other customers, which means they pay disproportionately for fixed costs to maintain the grid on their energy bills. Utilities can correct that imbalance with adjusted rates. For example, Massachusetts has required its three major electric utilities to offer discounted winter electricity rates to households with heat pumps. Elizabeth Mahony, commissioner of the state’s Department of Energy Resources, said she expects the new rates to save heat-pump owners on average $540 per year.

NESCAUM’s Levin stressed that the report is ​“a menu — not a recipe.” Each state will need to consider its own goals and constraints to pick the approaches that fit it best, she added.

Still, ​“I see [heat-pump electricity] rates as one of the areas that’s most promising,” Levin said. Massachusetts’ reforms ​“are really going to change their customer economics to make it more attractive to switch to a heat pump.”

When done right, rate design also avoids the need for states to find new funding. ​“You’re not raising costs on anybody, you’re only reducing costs,” Levin said. At a time when households are seeing energy prices rise faster than inflation, the tactic could have widespread political appeal, she noted.

NESCAUM plans to check back in with states and report out on their progress each year, Levin said. ​“The cool thing about our work is that we bring states together to learn from one another,” she added. ​“Part of making this transition happen more rapidly is lifting up the things that are really working well.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Heat-pumps-in-Hudson.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=6f532340c5f215b5a9dff71118c28685,N,,2025-09-24 12:04:22.543369

Oklo is one of the 10 advanced reactor firms chosen by the U.S. Department of Energy to be a part of its Reactor Pilot Program. The DOE pilot seeks to fast-track small modular reactor (SMR) development, pushing the projects to reach criticality by next July 4.

Aurora-INL is one of the three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.

“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, in a statement. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race.”

Kietwit Corp.’s Nuclear Solutions subsidiary is the lead design, procurement and construction contractor on the Aurora Powerhouse project at the KNL. The Aurora is a planned sodium-cooled fast reactor which will use metal fuel. Its design builds on the Experimental Breeder Reactor II site which was operated in Idaho for 30 years until 1994.

TIME magazine named Oklo's Aurora Powerhouse as one of its 100 Best Inventions of 2023.

Other SMR nuclear firms selected for the DOE pilot include Aalo Atomics, Antares Nuclear Inc., Atomic Alchemy Inc., Deep Fission Inc., Last Energy Inc., Natura Resources LLC, Radiant Industries Inc., Terrestrial Energy Inc., and Valar Atomics Inc.

Those selected firms are encouraged and empowered to seek private funding critical to research and development of next-generation reactor technologies.

TC Energy will focus on ramping up US investments to meet soaring power demand despite signals Canada is showing a more energy-friendly stance.

“The returns we can earn in the United States are significantly more attractive than they are in Canada,” Chief Executive Officer and President Francois Poirier said in an interview during the 2025 Concordia Annual Summit in New York. “I expect that the US will continue to be where we’ll invest.”

The pipeline company is seeking to tap into a push by US President Donald Trump, who recently signed executive orders aimed at boosting artificial intelligence development in the US by loosening regulations and expanding energy supplies for data centers, amid a broader desire for US energy dominance.

Bottom lines up front

Roughly 42 percent of Africa’s population lacks reliable access to electricity at home.

Using Africa’s sizeable untapped gas reserves to help electrify the continent is reasonable and fair, despite the need to cut emissions.

Electrifying the rest of the continent at the lowest possible climate cost within the next decade calls for renewables in most cases, and new gas-fired power plants in countries with gas and low electrification rates.

Limited access to electricity has long constrained both quality of life and economic growth across much of Africa. About 42 percent of the continent’s population still lives in homes without any access to national grids, mini-grids, or even standalone renewable systems. With 19 percent of the world’s population, Africa accounts for just 3.1 percent of global electricity demand. Indeed, the majority of people without access to electricity live in sub-Saharan Africa. This depresses living standards and stymies commercial and industrial development across the continent.

Average annual electricity consumption in Africa (excluding South Africa) was just 180 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2021, compared with 6,500 kWh in Europe and 13,000 kWh in the United States. Most people in sub-Saharan Africa consume less electricity in a year than an average US fridge. Power supplies in the region are not only inadequate, they are often unreliable, with outages a feature of life from Nigeria to South Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa also has the lowest per capita gas consumption of any region, at less than one-quarter of the global average, and accounts for just 4 percent of global gas demand.

According to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 7, UN member states committed to achieving “access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” by 2030. This target will not be reached by that date as the current pace of progress is nowhere near fast enough to connect 600 million African people in the next five years. Still, a growing number of African governments are pushing for universal access to electricity for their countries, and helping them succeed should be a global priority.

It is critical to tackle this challenge now while electrification efforts are being stepped up and over half the African population has access to electricity at home for the first time. Moreover, a significant increase in power generation will be needed to achieve universal electrification at a time of massive demographic growth. The United Nations forecasts that the population of sub-Saharan Africa will grow from 1.3 billion at present to 2.2 billion by 2054 and 3.3 billion by 2100. Power demand will expand even further with the adoption of electric vehicles and construction of new data centers.

It is technically possible to rapidly increase African electrification rates through renewables backed up with battery energy storage systems (BESS), hydroelectric schemes, and geothermal power (where available). Yet change on such a scale would require massive global investment that is not a realistic prospect in the foreseeable future, particularly given the recent drastic cuts to international aid budgets by some western governments.

Africa’s untapped and associated gas reserves can provide part of the solution by supporting renewable energy in boosting electrification rates. Although gas-fired generation is typically more expensive than solar, it delivers the baseload, round-the-clock capacity needed to fuel a rapid increase in intermittent renewable energy production. What’s more, there is a substantial amount of gas expertise in Africa, as gas is the continent’s primary source of electricity, accounting for 43 percent of production in 2024.

In response to the climate crisis, fossil fuel output will taper down, but some production will continue for many years. Emissions from gas-fired plants are at least half as high as those from coal, making gas a driver of climate change. Yet the African continent accounts for such a small proportion of global per capita emissions that new gas projects on the continent would be fair and justified where they would have a demonstrable impact on living standards and where failing to develop them would act as a brake on electrification efforts. Moreover, as this report will demonstrate, gas appears to be either a necessary or commercially viable option only in specific African countries.

Gas-to-power projects carry high upfront investment costs but are often easier to finance when attached to big export projects. The United States and Qatar, in particular, are investing heavily in new liquefied natural gas (LNG) production capacity to satisfy global demand, but European gas markets are keen to secure new sources of supply to displace piped Russian gas, and many Asian countries are switching from coal to gas-fired generation. As a result, there is scope for both new African LNG plants and pipelines under the Mediterranean Sea that could support power production in much of West Africa, while also generating export revenues for Nigeria.

Securing financing for African gas projects will be a crucial challenge, especially in light of the high capital costs for operating projects on the continent and investors’ reluctance to fund hydrocarbon schemes in recent years. However, the new African Energy Bank and the Trump administration’s support for oil and gas investment could make a considerable difference. US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in March that the United States would partner with African governments and companies to support the development of projects using natural gas and other energy technologies, including by providing capital. Indeed, the Trump administration acted quickly to approve $4.7 billion in funding from US Export-Import Bank for TotalEnergies’ Mozambique LNG scheme.

This report will set out why it is reasonable for Africa to develop its own gas reserves to drive electrification, explain how gas can fit into a broader energy transition on the continent, examine which countries would benefit from developing gas projects, and discuss the relationship between gas exports and local consumption. It will conclude with recommendations for how all stakeholders can utilize the continent’s natural gas resources to promote electrification at the lowest possible climate cost.

What role should natural gas play in Africa’s energy transition?

Most African countries account for a tiny proportion of global emissions but desperately need improved power supplies

Developing new gas-fired power plants in Africa to boost living standards and promote industrial growth would help the continent achieve a just energy transition. While effort should be made to rein in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Africa as elsewhere, the energy transition burden of each country should be based on its absolute per capita emissions rather than year-on-year changes in its emissions. The world’s poorest countries, including most African states, have played a very small role in driving climate change, and Africa is responsible for just 3.7 percent of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels—a far lower per capita share than any other region. Per capita carbon emissions in 2021 stood at 1.04 metric tons/year in Africa, four times less than the global average of 4.69 metric tons/year and far lower than the US average of 14 metric tons/year.

New African gas-fired power projects should be developed where they can help speed up much-needed electrification, particularly as new fossil fuel projects continue to be developed elsewhere. The United States plans to ramp up domestic oil production, while China began construction of 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power plants last year. By contrast, South Africa—which has the biggest installed generating capacity on the continent—has a total generation capacity of just 63.4 gigawatts.

In the United States, after years of negligible new gas-fired capacity, developers are building a string of gas plants, leaving some to wait up to seven years for delivery of gas turbines. A single Texas power company, NRG Energy, said on May 12 that it plans to acquire 13 GW of gas-fired generation capacity —seven times the total generating capacity of Uganda.

It was anticipated that a series of planned terminals would boost US liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity from 90 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) to 200 mtpa even before President Trump lifted the ban on new projects. New gas-fired plants are also being developed in Europe, with 20 GW of new capacity planned in Germany by 2030. It is therefore difficult to expect African countries to refrain from developing projects when the big polluters are failing to do so.

Asking low-emitting, energy-poor countries to forgo gas development while wealthier countries continue to expand their production capacity is hypocritical. According to the World Economic Forum in 2020, tripling African power production using gas-fired plants would only add 1 percent to global emissions.

Per capita emissions in most African countries are “lower than what is compatible with a 1.5C degree world, so even if they grow substantially, the continent would not exceed its fair share of emissions,” wrote a leading researcher on the need to assess Africa’s energy transition strategies on a country-by-country basis.

It is possible to integrate more natural gas within a broadly low emissions power sector

It is difficult to overstate the energy poverty of most of sub-Saharan Africa. With some notable exceptions, particularly in South Africa and North Africa, most of the continent has constrained access to reliable power supplies. It is easy to argue that this energy poverty should be overcome by focusing entirely on clean energy. The continent could leapfrog gas use and expensive gas infrastructure, in favor of moving straight to green technologies, in the same way that it has in large part bypassed landline technology in favor of mobile telecommunications. Solar should certainly be the centerpiece of power strategies in most African countries, considering the continent represents 60 percent of the world’s solar potential, and yet it produced just 4 percent of all solar power in 2024.

Africa also has attractive wind resources, although in more limited areas that include South Africa, Morocco, and Egypt. Geothermal energy is another very attractive contribution to any generation mix: It is a renewable source of energy that provides baseload energy because it is “always on.” However, it is available in only a few African countries, mainly along the line of the Great Rift Valley and most notably in Kenya.

BESS can store solar energy and then release it into grids for two to four hours to cover evening peak demand. Long duration energy storage (LDES) projects hold the promise of stabilizing longer-term fluctuations in intermittent power production.

Immediate and substantial investment is needed in these technologies, but they alone cannot achieve 100 percent electrification in many African countries in the near future. Solar power, for instance, may be cheaper than gas-fired capacity per unit of energy and will become even cheaper over time, but it does not produce power outside of daylight hours.

The BESS sector is at an early stage of development in Africa, as costs remain high and expertise low. As for LDES, the only commercially viable technology today is pumped storage hydro, which involves moving water between two reservoirs at different levels: The water is released downhill to drive turbines to generate electricity when it is most needed and then pumped back uphill during lower-cost periods when other technologies are productive. Pumped hydro storage helps to balance grids but is a net consumer of electricity and is technically feasible in only specific geographical areas.

A comprehensive rollout of BESS and LDES should make 100 percent clean energy in Africa possible one day, but most African countries will need a greater baseload power capacity to balance out intermittent sources of power production for a long time to come. Consequently, in the interim, they must be allowed to develop gas-fired generation capacity.

Key power sector terms:

Baseload technologies operate 24/7 except when they are undergoing maintenance. These include oil, coal, and gas-fired projects, geothermal power plants, and hydroelectric schemes, although output falls during periods of prolonged drought.

Intermittent technologies produce variable amounts of power: Solar power plants produce electricity only during the day and wind farms when the wind blows.

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) store surplus power, usually from solar projects during the daytime, to release it into the grid when needed, often in the evening.

Back-up power projects help maintain supplies when other forms of generation are lacking. These can include BESS, small-scale diesel generators, and even some gas-fired technologies that can be used only when required. However, building an expensive gas-fired plant for occasional use only is not commercially attractive without additional system payments. These payments are allocated to generators to reward them for being available to support the grid, in addition to each kilowatthour of actual electricity they produce, particularly during periods of peak demand.

More gas can complement the rollout of low emissions technologies. Developing new gas-to-power projects alongside renewables could help drive access to electricity in many African countries over the next decade. The renewables sector has taken off in a small number of African countries, led by South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco, with large projects currently in development elsewhere on the continent. Yet gas and renewables should not be viewed as an either-or choice: gas-fired projects can be paired with renewable energy and large hydro to provide grids with reliable power where renewable energy penetration is increasing.

Gas-fired plants could be used as back-up for solar and wind power, but this secondary role risks making construction commercially unviable in most markets. Financing is only likely to be secured for gas projects that provide baseload capacity; still, these plants could be downgraded to back-up in the longer term.

Replacing back-up diesel generators with gas-fired capacity offers the added benefit of reducing GHG emissions. At present, millions of African homes and businesses rely on diesel generators to provide electricity when their national grids fail to meet demand. These generators produce 74.14 kilograms of CO2 per million British thermal units (Btu) compared to 52.91 kilograms for gas-fired capacity.

Fossil fuel power plants, whether gas, coal, or oil-fired, currently provide 75 percent of all electricity in Africa, with 25 percent coming from clean energy (7 percent from solar and wind and most of the remainder from hydro). And yet, 54 percent of new capacity added between 2020 and 2025 was clean energy. Coal-fired power plants are the second biggest power-generation technology in Africa (after gas), but the picture is skewed because of its dominant role in South Africa, which hosts 84 percent of African coal-fired capacity. Africa’s coal consumption has remained flat over the past two decades, and little new coal-fired capacity is planned, as highly polluting coal is increasingly overlooked.

Hydro schemes provide round-the-clock electricity but are devastated by droughts and generally not classified as renewable energy projects because of the impact on local communities, flora, and fauna during construction and flooding.

Building a diverse generation mix is a strategic method of balancing out variations in power production. As a result, new gas sector investment should not be made at the expense of renewable energy investment and must be seen as one element of a generally low emissions generation mix.

The benefits of technological diversity, including natural gas, can be amplified by greater cross-border power integration. For example, building high-capacity transmission lines to connect neighboring national grids allows electricity to be moved from areas of surplus capacity to areas of shortage. This helps each area focus on its strengths and even out variations in production. Similarly, a prolonged drought in one country may not affect hydro reservoirs in other countries, while gas-fired plants can stabilize power supplies over a wider area. There is already evidence of cross-border efforts, with power pools­ (where neighboring states share power production to some extent) at various stages of development in Southern, East, and West Africa.

Increased gas use in Africa has many potential benefits

Improving access to electricity, including via gas-fired power plants, will help boost living standards and drive economic growth in Africa, especially for the poorest half of the population that currently lacks any access at all. Consider the enormous benefits of having electricity: Even very small amounts enable children to do their homework in countries where it is dark by 7:00 p.m., medicines to be safely stored at the necessary temperatures, and electronic devices to be charged.

Restricted access to electricity and natural gas hampers efforts to attract manufacturing and industrial investment. Rising labor costs are driving manufacturing offshoring from China to Southeast and South Asia but not yet to Africa, partly because the continent lacks adequate infrastructure. Even if the electrification of industrial processes using renewables is likely in the long term, relying on gas produces lower emissions than coal in industrial processes such as steel and aluminium smelting.

Natural gas is important in the production of nitrogen-based fertilizers, both as a source of energy and as a direct input. At present, African fertilizer production is inadequate to satisfy national and continental market demand at prices farmers can afford, with average use in the sub-Saharan region less than 20 kg/hectare, compared to the global average of 135 kg/hectare.

Gas use can also yield important environmental benefits. In South Africa, unlike most other countries, synthetic fuels provide the bulk of its liquid fuel needs, with most synthetic fuel produced from coal but some from natural gas. Switching more of this production from coal to gas would cut emissions.

Using gas for cooking, often in the form of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), can substitute for kerosene and biomass (such as wood fuel), which contribute to 3.2 million annual deaths from household air pollution and accidents worldwide. Biomass use also drives deforestation and reduces an environment’s ability to absorb carbon. In 2022, 970 million Africans, or 67 percent of the continent’s population, lacked access to clean energy for cooking.

Switching to gas from coal improves air quality. Although natural gas produces roughly 50 percent of the GHG emissions of coal plants, it has other environmental benefits, particularly in terms of lower air pollution. Gas produces virtually no sulfur dioxide emissions or fine particulate matter, whereasparticulate matter from coal use results in 42,000 deaths a year in South Africa.

Improved access to electricity, including from gas-fired plants, would support some climate change mitigation strategies, including water desalination plants, air conditioning, cold storage, and the concrete and steel used in resilient infrastructure. Finally, in the longer term, gas sector pipelines could be converted to transport green hydrogen—produced using renewable energy—to offer continued use by tapping a lower-emissions energy resource compared to natural gas.

On both climate and economic grounds, commercial outlets for gas that is currently flared are needed. Non-associated gas on hydrocarbon fields is only produced in order to be used, but gas is also associated with oil and other hydrocarbons, such as natural gas liquids, where it can be commercially marketed, reinjected to aid oil production, or flared to dispose of it. Flaring creates emissions without any commercial benefit and releases more than 350 million tons of CO2 worldwide, more than Egypt’s total emissions in 2023.

In addition to ending gas flaring, the global warming impact of gas projects can be minimized by reducing methane leakage during LNG transport and through carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). CCUS involves storing carbon from gas-fired power plants and industrial facilities underground, or using it in commercial projects, including in synthetic fuel production.

The commercial rollout of CCUS is only starting to take off worldwide, and it will likely be many years, if ever, before its use is prevalent in Africa. All CCUS options require increased energy use, additional equipment, and state support on early-stage projects.

The ideal generation mix varies greatly among African countries

Decisions relating to the role of natural gas should be made on a country-by-country basis. Because conditions are not uniform across the continent, there is no single approach that should be implemented in all markets.

Some African countries have already launched universal electrification programs. Kenya’s push to hit the 2030 SDG 7 target is discussed later, while twelve countries, including Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) and Nigeria, published detailed plans in January 2025 to connect more people to their respective grids. Yet the best route to achieving full connectivity varies from country to country.

Each country’s energy transition must be feasible within the context of its economy, geography, and natural resources. Rather than offer “unhelpful generalisations,” the international community must “embrace and support nuance and country-specific analysis,” as Youba Sokona, author and vice chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said in 2022.

If universal, reliable electrification can be achieved in the medium term without recourse to natural gas, then new gas-fired plants should be avoided given their relatively high life-cycle emissions. However, countries with relatively low electrification rates and significant gas reserves should be encouraged and supported in building gas-to-power projects.

Angola, Cameroon, Congo-Brazzaville, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Tanzania would all fall into this category. Gas-fired plants would be particularly useful in Nigeria, Angola, Gabon, and Congo-Brazzaville because they flare large amounts of gas. It would also apply to West African countries that can reap the benefits of the coastal gas pipeline between Nigeria and Morocco, which has been proposed to remedy the generally low electrification rates across the region.

Nigeria has enough gas to reach 100 percent electrification—hopefully in conjunction with more rapid renewables development—but gas industry growth has been hampered by attacks on gas infrastructure and low regulated domestic prices.

Algeria has achieved 100 percent electrification but could divert gas that is currently flared to provide additional generation capacity.

Flaring is a problem in Libya and Egypt as well, but financing new power plants in conflict-torn Libya would be difficult, while Egypt is struggling to balance gas exports with domestic requirements. Countries with existing upstream gas operations already have the infrastructure and expertise in place to support new gas-to-power projects. Investment there should focus on transmission connections between gas fields, power plants, and other industrial offtakers or buyers.

Ahead of the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), hosted by Egypt in 2022, academics from fifty institutions, including many in Africa, produced a paper calling on the Global North to stop thinking of the continent as a “homogenous collective” with similar energy needs and a common route to net zero. The research, published in Nature Energy, compared the situation in four African countries: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and South Africa. The researchers offered the following recommendations for balancing electrification with climate concerns in those countries:

Burkina Faso should opt for a combination of solar and diesel projects. The country has a limited power grid, high power costs, and restricted access to finance, so smaller-scale, local solar and diesel projects are favored in addition to improved cross-border transmission connections, rather than building expensive gas import infrastructure. With an electrification rate of just 20 percent, the country needs to focus on cheap and quick solutions.

Ethiopia can continue to rely on large hydro, having built 5,250 MW of dam projects over the past decade, with another 12,000 MW in the development pipeline. The hydro sector now provides 90 percent of its electricity and can be complemented by growing solar and wind power investment. Ethiopia can also use hydro schemes as batteries to compensate for variation in intermittent power production, so gas is unlikely to play a role here.

Mozambique should develop gas reserves for domestic supply alongside LNG projects to provide the baseload capacity needed to balance intermittent renewables production and increase the electrification rate from the current 44 percent. Providing that security challenges in the far northeast of the country are overcome, Mozambique is set to become one of the world’s biggest emerging LNG exporters, so dedicating a small proportion of gas for power and fertilizer production could significantly boost living standards. The government is backing new gas-fired capacity while banking on off-grid solar for rural electrification.

South Africa should combine solar and wind projects with BESS because it would be cheaper and faster than building gas-to-power plants to move away from king coal. The country already has one of the most developed renewables sectors on the continent and is currently developing its first utility-scale BESS projects.

It might be expected that South Africa would be an ideal candidate for gas sector investment. Coal provides 81.6 percent of its generation mix, so switching coal for gas would substantially cut emissions. South Africa produced 394 million metric tons of carbon from all fuel combustion in 2022, the most on the continent, 1.2 percent of the global total and a 40 percent increase over 2021. Fuel combustion emissions come from thermal power generation and internal combustion engine vehicles, with coal plants accounting for 83 percent.

Previously developed South African gas-fired power plants have suffered from lack of gas feedstock, and domestic gas reserves are limited, so efforts to reduce emissions have focused on renewables. Power utility Eskom plans to build a 3,000 MW gas-fired power plant near Richards Bay backed by an LNG import terminal by 2030, with a smaller terminal planned for Ngqura. Yet, import projects have fallen through in the past, and gas is unlikely to play a big role in South Africa.

Research by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) in 2022 concluded that gas will not be needed for South African power sector within the next decade—in part because solar and wind power was 57 percent cheaper than gas-fired plants and short lead times for developing solar projects make them an attractive response to the country’s ongoing power supply crisis. South Africa also has 2,832 MW of pumped storage capacity out of national capacity of 63.4 GW to act as LDES. The IISD also found that coal-fired plants can provide back-up capacity in the medium term, while three-hour BESS facilities are 30 percent cheaper than simple cycle gas plants—the most suitable gas plants in this instance—for covering peak demand.

Still, gas imports could play a growing role in South Africa’s synthetic fuels industry. Sasol, a South African producer of synthetic fuels, currently uses 185 petajoules (PJ) of gas a year, of which 160 PJ/yr is imported by pipeline from southern Mozambique. As these fields become exhausted, alternative sources of gas are needed, including recent discoveries of domestic gas.

Kenya, like South Africa, is a country where gas-fired plants are unnecessary, and it is on track to achieve universal electrification by 2030, with the electrification rate rising from 37 percent in 2013 to 79 percent in 2023. Geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar power accounts for 90 percent of power production, with geothermal and hydro plants providing baseload capacity. Kenya’s 985 MW geothermal capacity is the fifth highest in the world. Plans to build coastal Kenyan gas-fired plants are intermittently proposed and shelved but such projects are optional rather than essential.

Should Africa focus on gas exports or intra-African demand?

More new gas reserves have recently been found in Africa than anywhere else in the world

Africa accounts for just 6.46 percent of global gas output, producing 265 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2023, of which 115 bcm were exported out of the continent. This compares with global production of 4,100 bcm. Four countries—Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and Nigeria—account for 80 percent of Africa’s output. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that African demand will grow by an average of 3 percent per year, reaching 187 to 246 bcm by 2030 and up to 437 bcm by 2050.

Roughly 40 percent of natural gas discovered worldwide between 2015 and 2024 was in Africa, mainly in Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, and Tanzania. Namibia is the latest country in Africa to join the list, with Shell and TotalEnergies making big offshore oil and gas finds. Routine gas flaring is banned under Namibian law, so the gas will either have to be reinjected or commercially marketed. With 246 bcm identified to date, the government of Namibia aims to implement a common gas plan across all fields, including for local power generation and petrochemical production.

African gas is used on the continent for cooking and synthetic fuel production and in various industrial processes but mostly for power generation. The share of gas-fired capacity in the African generation mix has steadily increased from 20.82 percent in 2000 to 43.13 percent in 2024. In many cases, gas-fired power plants are connected to gas fields by dedicated pipelines, but Algeria, Egypt, South Africa, and Nigeria all have more comprehensive distribution networks that are capable of supplying gas to a high number of different customers, large and small. Oil and gas companies need long-term offtake supply contracts with local utilities to invest in downstream gas operations, but signing ten- or twenty-year contracts is a huge commitment for those utilities. Energy subsidies and regulated prices help reduce prices for consumers but deter investment. According to the International Gas Union, about 55 percent of Africa’s natural gas consumption is sold at prices below the cost of supply as governments try to make gas and power more affordable for consumers.

Financing for electrification is currently far from sufficient

Developing gas-to-power projects and associated gas transmission and power grid capacity is expensive. According to the IEA, Africa must double its annual power investment to $200 billion by 2030 to achieve universal electrification while meeting climate change pledges.

African governments and utilities have limited access to financing for new gas and power projects, while capital costs for African projects are often up to three times those in other countries, so the sector urgently needs access to external sources of low-cost finance. Foreign investment is therefore key, whether from commercial investors, the multilaterals, development finance institutions (DFIs), or donors.

Gas-to-power projects in less wealthy countries may not generate enough income to justify construction. Moreover, long-term gas contracts can lock African power utilities into relatively high-cost thermal power at a time when solar energy costs are falling in the region with the best solar resources on the planet.

Environmental, social, and economic risk assessments need to be thorough because of the risk of asset stranding in what are mostly small markets. Although Mozambique and Senegal have large gas reserves to develop for exports, both countries are burdened by a high cost of capital and national debt—and low levels of experience in the sector—so they could be outcompeted by lower-cost exporters.

Financing from the multilaterals and international banks for African oil and gas projects has become scarcer because of climate concerns, but a new source of funding was launched in June 2025. African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and the Africa Petroleum Producers’ Organization set up the African Energy Bank with initial capital of $5 billion, although it was established to support the entire hydrocarbons sector rather than specifically gas-to-power projects.

Egypt has focused on gas

International engineering companies are prepared to develop large gas-fired plants in Africa under sufficiently attractive terms of investment. In 2018, Siemens and Egyptian partners Orascom Construction and Elsewedy Electric completed the world’s three biggest combined cycle gas-fired plants: Beni Suef, Burullus, and New Capital, which provided a total of 14.4 GW out of national capacity of 59 GW in 2022.

Alongside a contract to build six power substations and other transmission infrastructure, they were built for the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, which estimates that they save the country more than $1 billion a year. Siemens’s involvement was crucial to financing as it was able to secure loan agreements from two export credit agencies, Germany’s Euler Hermes and Italy’s SACE, to underpin loans from more than thirty international banks.

African gas exporters favor LNG

The majority of Africa’s gas markets are small and fragmented and have relatively low regulated prices, so it is no surprise that exports drive most investment. Gas can be exported from Africa by pipeline or as LNG, which involves cooling gas to a concentrated, liquid state for sea transport. Such projects require the construction of expensive liquefaction plants in producing countries and regasification facilities in destination markets, but they are generally considered cheaper than piping gas over very long distances. They are also the most flexible form of export, as producers are not tied to specific export markets.

Algeria and Libya both export gas to Europe via subsea pipelines, while both—along with countries further south—also ship LNG. Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, and Angola have traditional onshore LNG plants, but Africa has become a global center of floating LNG (FLNG) development, which entails placing LNG production vessels on offshore gas reserves.

FLNG projects are smaller than their onshore counterparts, but they avoid onshore security difficulties, can be moved to other locations if required, and enable the development of gas reserves that might be flared. Projects are already operating in Congo-Brazzaville, Mozambique, Senegal/Mauritania, and Cameroon. Eni is developing a second FLNG project offshore Congo-Brazzaville and planning a second project in Mozambique, while the UTM Offshore FLNG project is being planned for Nigeria’s deepwater Yoho field, where it would use gas that is currently flared.

A huge onshore project designed to host production for two different consortia has been partially built in northern Mozambique. Work was suspended in 2021 following militant attacks, but TotalEnergies and the other developers plan to restart work this year. Equinor and Shell hope to finalize arrangements on a huge project in southeastern Tanzania. Africa already contributes almost 10 percent of the global LNG supply, but if both of these projects are completed, it will make the southern Tanzania/northern Mozambique region a global engine of LNG production.

With global gas demand rising, US and Qatari LNG production is accelerating, with 350 bcm expected to be added to the world’s 2024 output of 670 bcm by 2030. The scope for African LNG projects beyond those already underway, therefore, may be limited. As with gas-to-power projects, export schemes—whether piped or LNG plants—could stall because of lack of market capacity.

Piping Nigerian gas to Europe could benefit most of West Africa

In addition to their cost, long-distance, cross-border pipelines are difficult to develop due to the number of stakeholders involved—from the supplying to transit and receiving countries. At present, the most high-profile proposed projects in Africa are two rival schemes to pipe gas from the Niger Delta to Algeria and Morocco for onward transportation to Europe. These projects, however, are taking very different routes.

The Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline (TSGP), under discussion since 2022, would run 4,000 km through Niger to Algeria. Backed by two state-owned oil companies, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company and Algeria’s Sonatrach, it would have capacity of up to 30 bcm per year. Although the project would connect big reserves with huge markets, the core challenge will be security in the face of a range of armed groups operating across the Sahel. Similar security concerns have deterred construction of the proposed Turkmenistan-India pipeline through Afghanistan and Pakistan since the 1990s.

Nevertheless, efforts are ongoing, with Penspen energy consultants agreeing to update a feasibility study into the TSGP in 2025, nineteen years after completing its initial study. The desire of European nations to end their long-term reliance on Russian gas may make development more likely this time around.

The rival Africa-Atlantic Gas Pipeline (AAGP) would run around the West African coast and enable onshore connections to eleven countries between Nigeria and Morocco: Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, Gambia, and Mauritania. Gas could be supplied to all of the transit countries as well as European customers.

The challenge with AAGP will be reaching sales and transit agreements with so many countries—not to mention security issues, including on the final stretch through contested Western Sahara. Like the TSGP, this 6,000-km project would have a 30 bcm/year capacity. The governments of Morocco and Nigeria plan to form a special company to drive project development.

Abuja and the project developers must guarantee that supplies to the Nigerian market are not curtailed and ensure that gas is ring-fenced for domestic use at commercially viable prices. If the AAGP succeeds in providing gas feedstock to the eleven transit countries, this could make it the most important piece of infrastructure on the entire continent.

Gas exports can aid rather than block local consumption

Many question whether gas export projects divert production from African markets or help make domestic supply commercially viable. The answer largely comes down to the political will of host governments to demand that developers consider local as well as export needs. The oil and gas companies that develop LNG projects are attracted by export revenues and deterred from domestic markets by their often limited size and low regulated prices.

African governments, of course, are keen to see LNG projects developed. The planned Tanzanian and Mozambican schemes promise the biggest ever single investments into each country, delivering benefits in terms of taxes and royalties to job creation, but it is critical to ring-fence a portion of production for local distribution.

Choosing to export gas or use it for local supply is not a binary decision. The domestic requirements will be small in relation to export volumes and can help drive domestic power generation. Ensuring that gas production benefits local communities can also foster a sense of social and resource justice. For instance, developing LNG projects in northern Mozambique while leaving most locals without access to electricity would be neither just nor sensible given the region’s militant insurgency.

Several governments, including Nigeria, Tanzania, and Senegal, already require that some gas from export-focused projects be set aside for the domestic market. For instance, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission has the ability to force upstream producers to supply the local market.”

Occasionally, there is tension between export obligations and domestic supplies, even when the government is committed to both. Following new gas field discoveries, for example, Egypt’s government has been eager to supply the country’s LNG industry while satisfying growing domestic demand, including from the power sector. However, in response to rising domestic consumption, it has been forced to periodically block LNG production and rely on Israeli gas imports, dealing a blow to export revenues and triggering political criticism at home.

Recommendations

The drive for electrification will continue in at least some African countries with or without increased global support. The whole of North Africa has achieved close to universal electrification, while Kenya and Ghana are among the countries making significant progress toward that goal. For countries making less progress, there is much that can be done to help speed up the process, including by supporting gas sector development where needed. The following principles should guide the development of the continent’s natural gas resources to promote electrification at the lowest possible climate cost:

Climate responsibility should be based on absolute per capita emissions, not on change over time. Apart from South Africa, Africa accounts for a tiny proportion of global GHG emissions.

The goal of achieving universal electrification should be at the core of energy transition strategies. Leaving hundreds of millions of Africans without access to electricity on climate grounds—when the rest of the world’s GHG emissions are so much higher than Africa’s—should not be acceptable.

The primary focus of financing should be on renewable energy development, not least on grounds of cost per kWh. Given its relatively high life-cycle emissions, new gas-fired capacity should be avoided if universal, reliable electrification can be achieved in the medium term without it. However, countries with low electrification rates and access to gas should be backed in building gas-to-power projects—along with projects that rely heavily on gas that is currently flared.

The views of each country’s residents must be taken into account. They understand what it means to use kerosene and biomass fuel and to lack access to electricity.

In terms of electrification, renewables and gas-fired power plants should be seen as complementary rather than competing. Gas-fired capacity can provide baseload capacity to support increased renewables’ penetration, while solar microgrid and standalone residential systems can supply off-grid rural areas.

Pathways to clean energy systems should be considered on a country-by-country basis.

The governments of industrialized countries

Governments in North America, Europe, the Gulf States, and East Asia, among other areas, need to step up support for the African energy transition, mainly in renewables but also in gas-fired capacity where appropriate. This would boost living standards on the continent while minimizing emissions, create stronger African trading partners, and improve political and security stability in the wider world.

The International Partners Group formed at COP26 in 2021 was conceived as the primary mechanism for providing the necessary international financing for the energy transition in developing countries. As part of their efforts, the group would create Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) between investors and host governments, but only four JETPs have been forged to date: with Indonesia ($20 billion), Senegal ($2.6 billion), South Africa ($11.6 billion), and Vietnam ($15.5 billion). The United States pulled out of the program, and additional JETPs are now considered unlikely.

Still, the objective of coordinating development finance institutions (DFIs), the private sector, host governments, multilateral development banks, and philanthropists to work together on the issue is a sound one. New “country platforms”—where host communities have greater agency and more of the funding is provided as direct grants—are being attempted instead, but it is vital that gas remains part of the equation where conditions require it. Whatever arrangement or vehicle is used, comprehensive financing mechanisms must be put in place as soon as possible.

The United States has drastically cut its aid budget, but other countries can continue to contribute, either through their development budgets, DFIs (such as British International Investment [BII] and the German Investment Corporation), or sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). BII, for instance, is committed to improving energy access in Africa, and although it curtailed almost all investment in fossil fuels in 2020, it remains open to financing gas-fired projects where they support human development needs. It should be more explicit in specifying progress toward universal electrification among these needs, and other DFIs should follow suit.

The European Union has various mechanisms for supporting African development, principal among them is NDICI-Global Europe, which aims to improve living conditions and political stability including through investment in the energy transition in coordination with EU member states and institutions. While the organization currently does not finance gas-fired projects, it should do so where gas-fired capacity is the best route to electrification.

Sovereign wealth funds and export credit agencies

Gulf governments and their SWFs are active investors in African development, with the United Arab Emirates committed to co-financing the $25 billion Africa-Atlantic Gas Pipeline from Nigeria to Morocco alongside the European Investment Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the OPEC Fund. The central project will export Nigerian gas to Europe, but the Gulf States and other members of the consortium could also help to finance spur pipeline connections to the West African transit states and gas-fired power plants in those countries.

Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, one of the world’s biggest SWFs and which derives most of its income from the country’s oil and gas industry, is another potential investor. It has halted investment in coal projects but continues to invest heavily in hydrocarbons, as well as African renewable energy, and seeks to promote economic development through its investments. However, it does not appear at present to invest in African gas-fired power plants. Drawing on Norway’s expertise in the gas sector, the fund could further many of its interests by supporting such projects, and its actions and strategies are often followed by other institutional investors.

Despite sizable cuts to the US aid budget, the world’s biggest economy can still play a major role. US Export-Import Bank (EXIM) recently approved a $4.7 billion loan for TotalEnergies’ Mozambique LNG project that will help attract pension and institutional funds “to support upstream gas development and associated infrastructure.” Such investment could be combined with support for Mozambican gas-fired power projects. Because EXIM’s support for the LNG project was rooted in helping US workers and businesses involved in the scheme, it might be inclined to participate in power projects developed by US firms.

The current US government is in favor of wider oil and gas development, so African gas-to-power projects may be able to benefit from US organizations with federal connections. There could also be a pathway to develop gas-fired power plants and other gas projects in exchange for access to critical minerals in infrastructure-for-resources deals. This could be a valuable negotiating tool with mining-rich DR Congo, for instance, where Chinese companies have largely failed to develop promised infrastructural projects. DR Congo has neighboring states with gas reserves both to its north and south, including in Cabinda.

Apart from EXIM, other export credit agencies have played a crucial role in financing African gas-to-power projects. Euler Hermes and SACE were key to developing Siemens’ three gas-fired power plants in Egypt, and their counterparts across the world could play a similarly vital role.

African governments and regional organizations

African governments, the African Union (AU), and the continent’s regional economic communities are key players in driving electrification, including gas-fired power. The AU and regional communities have a particular role in promoting cooperation between different states. Above all, they should support cross-border power transmission integration to help neighboring countries balance out variations in power production, thereby allowing gas-fired plants to supply a larger pool of customers and support more intermittent power production.

The Southern African Power Pool has been operating since 1995, but progress has been slow in other regions, especially with respect to making the West African Power Pool (WAPP) a reality. Nigerian and Ghanaian gas could help supply energy across the region, either piped gas feedstock or electricity via cross-border power interconnectors. Political mistrust and a lack of investment have held back development of the WAPP, while the project clings to its grand vision of many cross-border, high-capacity transmission links. However, transmission integration is more likely to happen by following a step-by-step process than by imposing an overarching plan from above.

The Economic Community of West African States, which oversees the WAPP, also needs to encourage neighboring governments, power utilities, and regulators to cooperate on the technical aspects of integration, such as permitting, regulatory capacity building, and grid operation. It is difficult to trade power across borders when neighboring countries have different electricity standards that make it burdensome to secure project permit approvals.

Academic institutions, think tanks, and research organizations

At present there is very little detailed, specific research on the best energy transition strategy for individual African countries. While more than 150 research groups model the German energy system and propose long-term pathways, there are often none taking the same approach to individual African countries, even those with large gas reserves, such as Mozambique and Senegal. Much more country-specific research is needed, including to assess whether falling renewables and battery storage costs could leave gas-fired assets stranded.

Research is also needed on where gas-fired generation could support renewables and where it would block them. There is a real risk that gas investments could crowd out renewables by locking up infrastructure and capital. Detailed research on the intersection of technology and economics, along the lines of studies conducted by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the United States, would be beneficial. These organizations focus on the US energy sector, but it would be helpful if they and their peers were to dedicate a small portion of their research efforts to energy-poor countries, not least because of the learnings they would gain for their own markets.

Conclusion

Difficult choices are called for when two worthwhile causes come into conflict with each other. With the United Nations estimating that the world is on course for an average temperature rise of 3.1C by the end of this century, it is incumbent on the international community to step up efforts to mitigate climate change. These efforts must include phasing out the vast majority of coal and oil and probably even natural gas projects.

Yet, to more fairly distribute the remaining emissions, developing new gas-fired power plants in Africa should be a top priority. Requiring African countries to abstain from gas development when more prosperous countries are forging ahead could easily appear to be climate colonialism.

Implementing these recommendations to allow gas to be a minor but significant part of Africa’s electrification efforts would yield big improvements in living standards in some of the poorest countries in the world. There would be clear benefits for the people of Africa but also for the wider world through economic development and increased stability.

KM: How has your background and experience informed and influenced the role you want to play at the foundation?

KS: One of the things I’ve learned working in the climate field is that people come from many different backgrounds, and that is a strength. Health is often the most resonant lens for talking about climate, because ultimately, we care about this issue because of how it affects the well-being of the people we love. As a public health practitioner by training, I became interested in climate because I saw how its impacts show up in both big and small ways, multiplying the health challenges communities already face. Our changing climate touches every part of life: it can disrupt a child’s education, delay cancer treatments, make cities too hot to be livable, or compromise access to safe drinking water. And this burden is always borne inequitably, with its impacts being thrust upon those who have less power to push for change. I view my role at Kresge as a connector, clarifying how climate affects every sector, highlighting the implications for health and equity, and helping to advance a more resilient and just future.

KM: What interests and passions do you bring to your work?

KS: In addition to my interest in public health and climate change, I’m passionate about meditation and mindfulness, and try to weave them into daily life. That doesn’t necessarily mean the type of meditation you might be imagining now—sitting formally somewhere quiet—though sometimes it can look like that. But it’s also things like showing up fully in conversations without thinking about my next meeting, brushing my teeth without multitasking, or pausing for a breath before responding to something that bothers me. I have been reflecting on the idea that “calm is a form of resistance,” and I think that applies both personally and professionally. In a world that constantly demands my attention, there is something radical about choosing where my attention goes, rather than having it chosen for me. (If the phrase “attention economy” doesn’t mean anything to you, this is your sign to dig into the concept.)

KM: What do you see as the most urgent need(s) when it comes to improving the health and well-being of people and communities?

KS: Where do I begin! One of the most urgent needs I see is rebuilding social cohesion and a sense of shared responsibility. We saw this during COVID and continue to see it with climate change, where our willingness to prioritize the collective good is fragile at best. In my mind, that willingness of shared responsibility extends to other structural factors that shape daily life, such as access to reliable public transportation, affordable housing, safe water, and clean air. Without them, it becomes easier to retreat into individual solutions and harder to imagine what we owe one another. Strengthening the systems that connect us, and the trust that holds them together, feels essential to improving both health and community resilience.

KM: What is a good book that you’ve read recently that you’d recommend?

KS: I recently read Stuck: How the Privileged and the Propertied Broke the Engine of American Opportunity by Yoni Appelbaum, and I’ve been thinking about it a lot. Appelbaum argues that America’s historic “engine of opportunity,” which is the ability to move for better jobs, cheaper housing, or reinvention, has broken down. The book examines how zoning was employed to segregate communities and how even seemingly progressive policies now limit mobility by reducing housing supply and exacerbating inequality. While not a perfect book, I found it a valuable history that has me thinking about how zoning shapes daily life and opportunity. As our team continues to deepen its understanding of climate mobility and migration in cities, I expect it to be a book I will keep coming back to.

To help explain the impact of this partnership, The University of Texas at Arlington’s J. Ping Liu, professor of physics and a leading researcher in rare-earth materials, shared his insights. Dr. Liu has collaborated with MP Materials on projects supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and has worked with company leaders on research and workforce initiatives at UT Arlington.

Why is this deal between Apple and MP Materials significant?

Liu: It’s significant because it underscores how vital strong magnets are for electronics, clean energy and other high-tech applications in our daily life and national security. In addition, it also demonstrates that for high-tech businesses to succeed at scale, they need broad support—from both industry partners and government. The Apple partnership, along with MP Materials’ agreement with the Department of Defense, provides critical momentum for expanding U.S. magnet production.

Why are rare-earth magnets so important in today’s technology?

Liu: Rare-earth magnets are critical because of their unique electronic structures. The 4f electrons in rare-earth elements are the origin of everything: They give the magnets high coercivity, which makes it possible to create devices that are smaller, lighter but more powerful. Think about a smartphone: It now does much more work than a desktop computer could do 20 years ago. That leap in capability is tied directly to the development of advanced materials, particularly advanced semiconductors and strong rare-earth magnets.

Could this reduce U.S. dependence on China for rare-earth materials?

Liu: MP Materials is unique because it operates the full supply chain, from processing ores at its Mountain Pass mine in California to, now, manufacturing magnets in Fort Worth. If the company can produce magnets at scale and at competitive cost, the U.S. will be far less dependent on imports—especially from China, which currently dominates global supply. The Apple and DOD deals are important steps toward reaching that goal.

What does this mean for Fort Worth’s economy?

Liu: As I have learned, MP Materials chose Fort Worth carefully, recognizing the region’s strengths for high-tech manufacturing. The new facility will boost the local economy through job creation and enhanced manufacturing capacity. This area also benefits from local strong research in physics, chemistry and materials science. MP Materials leaders visited my UTA laboratory in 2022, where they were welcome by our University leadership. That visit led to a sponsored grant and a joint research project from the Department of Energy. These kinds of collaborations highlight how North Texas can become a hub for advanced materials research and production.

How does building a domestic rare-earth supply chain connect to broader national security and sustainability goals?

Liu: I have worked in the U.S. in magnets research for 30 years. In my view, our current shortage in rare-earth supply is caused by the shortage in workforce training (education) and fundamental research in magnetic materials. Look at the facts here: The U.S. has the resources (rare-earth deposition), why does it have the supply-chain problem now? I have witnessed the monotonous reduction of research activities in this area in the U.S. in the past 20 years caused by research funding cuts, which are essentially cuts to the most important supply chains: education and research supply chains. Recall the Manhattan Project, a great time for strong national security in U.S. history—the government invested in scientific research substantially and attracted foreign scientists. Now we can only see this kind of story in the movies. It is clear to me that building strong U.S. education and research supply chains is about more than creating jobs or advancing technology; it’s also a matter of national security and sustainability.

Even though California legislators passed legislation extending carpool lane access through 2027, the program also requires federal authorization, which the Trump administration denied.
‘A Trump traffic jam’ “A Trump traffic jam is on its way to California and other states – all because Republicans in Congress decided to let a wildly successful bipartisan program expire,” Newsom said in a statement last week.
A state report released in August in response to the executive order cited access to carpool lanes as a key factor encouraging people to buy electric vehicles.
In anticipation of the zero-emission-sticker loss, East Bay residents came together in Oakland a few weeks ago to restart the casual carpool program at a location near Lake Merritt.","Electrical vehicle owners who drive on California highways are in for a rough transition next week when their ability to take the carpool lane through traffic or over tolls comes to a sudden stop.

That’s because starting Oct. 1, the state’s Clean Air Vehicle Decal Program — which gave drivers of EVs and other clean cars access to HOV lanes — will come to an end. Even though California legislators passed legislation extending carpool lane access through 2027, the program also requires federal authorization, which the Trump administration denied.

The federal Department of Transportation issued a statement to Reuters earlier this summer, saying that the U.S. Congress opted not to extend the deadline in 2021, when the Democratic party had the majority. However, the Trump administration, with a Republican-controlled House, had the opportunity to extend the program this year and chose not to, despite advocacy efforts by elected officials in California, Arizona and other states.

This is the latest blow to zero-emission, or green-vehicle, incentive programs under Trump. In July, President Donald Trump signed legislation that ended tax credits of up to $7,500 for people buying or leasing a new electric car and up to $4,000 for those purchasing a used EV. Those incentives also end on Sept. 30. In order to continue selling their stock of EVs and other zero-emission cars, some car dealerships still offer rebate programs offered by state governments or by the manufacturers themselves. California no longer has a state rebate program.

“People are disappointed but it’s not really stopping anyone from getting an electric car,” said a sales representative at the Volkswagen of Oakland car dealership on Broadway, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the record. “It now puts them on par with gas vehicles.”

In the Bay Area, the loss of the zero-emission sticker program could increase traffic on already congested roadways, including on the Bay Bridge, which is the main artery into San Francisco from Berkeley.

According to a California Highway Patrol statement to a Los Angeles TV station, drivers will have a two-month grace period before getting cited for violations.

‘A Trump traffic jam’

“A Trump traffic jam is on its way to California and other states – all because Republicans in Congress decided to let a wildly successful bipartisan program expire,” Newsom said in a statement last week. Newsom last year signed a bipartisan state bill, AB 2678, to extend the program. He also signed an executive order in June reiterating the state’s commitment to reducing emissions from cars.

A state report released in August in response to the executive order cited access to carpool lanes as a key factor encouraging people to buy electric vehicles.

“Access to HOV lanes is a well-established, non-monetary incentive that is a critical element in purchasing decisions made by consumers in areas of the state with high congestion,” the report reads.

California was one of 13 states that offered the program.

The Electric Vehicle Association said in a statement that the U.S. needed “every tool available” to speed up the transition to CO2-free cars and noted that oil and gas companies still received “billions in subsidies every year.”

“It’s worth asking why a zero-emission incentive is being cut,” Elaine Borseth, an association board member, said.

We reached out to the U.S. Department of Transportation about whether it would provide any new guidance for commuters who used to the sticker program. They did not immediately respond.

Residents of Berkeley and other East Bay cities are already dreading the change.

Some have taken to Nextdoor to complain about the impending change while others are figuring out how to get friends or colleagues who use the same route to ride share in order to retain access to the HOV lanes.

In anticipation of the zero-emission-sticker loss, East Bay residents came together in Oakland a few weeks ago to restart the casual carpool program at a location near Lake Merritt. The leader of that effort, Camille Bermudez, told us she hoped that the loss of the stickers would lead to more people taking the chance on the revived system.

Bermudez said the return of casual carpool is going great and that many commuters were “excited to have this back as an option to replace their HOV sticker.”

“We’ve had a few people tell us that it’s now their go-to commute method,” she said. “We’d still love to see more participation and ridership.”",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-berkeleyside-cityside.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240831_D7_EG_022-scaled-1.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-24 10:00:25.262069

The project will represent an overall investment of approximately €4.5 billion, the largest made by TotalEnergies in the country in the past 30 years.

TotalEnergies made commitments on job creation in France, especially in Normandy, and chose to implement a European preference policy for major equipment, notably wind turbines and electricity cables.

The 1.5 GW wind farm will supply green electricity to over 1 million households at a competitive price.

Download the Press Release

Paris, September 24, 2025 – The consortium formed by TotalEnergies and RWE has been selected by the Ministry in charge of Industry and Energy as the winner of the Centre Manche 2 (AO8) offshore wind tender. The consortium will be responsible for designing, developing, building, and operating a 1.5 gigawatt (GW) offshore wind farm off the coast of Normandy.

The Largest Renewable Project Ever Developed in France

Located more than 40 km off the coast of Normandy, this will be the largest renewable energy project ever developed in France. Once built, it will generate approximately 6 TWh per year and supply green electricity to the equivalent of over 1 million French households. The electricity will be sold at a competitive price of €66/MWh, as set by the tender.

TotalEnergies will be the operator of the project, relying on its expertise in offshore wind and the management of large-scale marine energy projects. The Company will continue the necessary studies to reach a final investment decision by early 2029. Electricity production is expected to begin in 2033, in line with RTE’s grid connection schedule.

“We are very proud to have won this tender for the construction of the largest renewable energy park in France to date. It embodies Total’s transformation into TotalEnergies in France. This project will be the largest investment made by TotalEnergies in France in decades and reflects our Company’s deep commitment to our country. As a long-standing player in Normandy, we are determined to mobilize our expertise to ensure this project is an industrial success while securing its acceptance by the region. We will work to support the local industrial ecosystem, which has already developed skills through the first offshore wind projects currently being installed. Finally, this project strengthens our development in green electricity production to offer competitive prices to our French customers”, said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.

As part of a strategic review of its investments, RWE has expressed the wish to exit the consortium, subject to French authorities’ approval. In any case, TotalEnergies will pursue the project, assuming all the commitments of the consortium, and will propose to bring a new partner into the project.

A €4.5 billion investment that will benefit the Normandy region and the European industry

The project is expected to represent a €4.5 billion investment and generate significant economic benefits for the Normandy region. Up to 2,500 people will be employed during the three years of construction, and TotalEnergies has committed to offering 500,000 hours of work to apprentices and individuals in professional reintegration. TotalEnergies also plans to engage the local economic ecosystem, which has already developed expertise in offshore wind.

The project will also benefit the European industry, as TotalEnergies intends to source primarily from European suppliers, particularly for wind turbines and electrical cables.

TotalEnergies will ensure the proper integration of the project into the region

In the coming months, a dedicated TotalEnergies team, based in Normandy, will continue the consultation work with local and regional stakeholders that began during the tender phase. It will ensure the proper integration of the project into the Normandy region, especially its coexistence with commercial fishing.

TotalEnergies will also implement crowdfunding financing that will allow local residents and authorities in the Normandy region to invest in the project and directly contribute to the energy transition of their territory. Additionally, TotalEnergies will fund a €10 million territorial fund to support initiatives in training, education, and culture in Normandy.

On environmental matters, TotalEnergies will allocate €45 million to measures aimed at avoiding, reducing, and offsetting the project’s impacts; as well as €15 million to a biodiversity promotion fund in Normandy.

Finally, TotalEnergies has committed to making this project exemplary in terms of recycling offshore wind farm components, with recycling, reuse, or repurposing rates of blades, towers, and nacelles equal to or greater than 95%, and 100% of generator magnets being recycled or reused.

TotalEnergies in France: a historic territorial presence

A leading economic player rooted in France for over a century, TotalEnergies continues to invest in the country to contribute to energy security and the supply of fuels, gas, and electricity across the territory.

Since 2020, while transforming its energy offer, TotalEnergies has invested more than €8 billion in France, nearly half of which has supported the energy transition of its assets and for its customers. With a renewable portfolio of 660 wind, solar, hydro, and battery storage plants, TotalEnergies meets the electricity needs of the equivalent of 1.8 million people in France, ranking among the top three renewable electricity providers in the country with over 2 GW of installed capacity. TotalEnergies supplies electricity and gas to 4.2 million residential and business customers.

Under that agreement, OCI is responsible for the BESS’s development, financing, construction, and ownership, and CPS Energy will have operational control.

When the SCA was announced, the project was expected to enter commercial operation in the first half of 2026. It is now expected to enter commercial operation in Q3 2027.

In a recent interview with Energy-Storage.news Premium, OCI Energy President, Sabah Bayatli discussed the Alamo City’s 4-hour duration, which is a bit of a rarity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, which typically sees 1 to 2-hour duration BESS projects being built.

Bayatli said, “The end-user for long-duration energy storage (LDES) more generally is utilities. They need to balance their own load and they think about that on a long-term basis. I think CPS will eventually use this project to balance its load.”

He continued, “A merchant project would typically not do 4-hours as they do their modelling on price spreads and their financial model will see a 1-2 hour system as optimal. They make their decision based on economics, while utilities have a more long-term view.”

In the same interview with ESN Premium, which came before the LG announcement, Bayatli said of the selection process for the BESS supplier:

“The real challenge is for people financing a project now. If you have only shortlisted Chinese suppliers, you’ll have a problem. The tariffs shift you to beyond China, and you’ll probably have to wait for the 90 day (pause on higher tariffs) to pass. We have different manufacturers shortlisted, including some in the US. But the tariffs actually add more complexity to US-based suppliers with components from abroad, because you have numerous tariffs to take into account.”

Energy demand has spiked.
Electricity prices skyrocketed.
Instead of artificially reducing demand by making energy even more expensive, policymakers in Columbus have taken steps to increase energy supply.
Controlling their energy supply will enhance reliability and give companies greater certainty that their electricity demands will be met.","The Washington Times first published this piece.

Ohio’s sweeping energy policy reforms have taken a bold, market-based turn that state and federal policymakers would be wise to follow. Evolving from Rust Belt factories to a high-tech haven, Ohio has seen the technological future, and it needs energy — reliable, affordable energy — and a lot of it.

Electricity demand was relatively flat for the first 20 years of the millennium, but artificial intelligence, supercomputing, cryptocurrencies, advanced technology manufacturing, and expanded digital services requiring massive new data centers have changed everything. Energy demand has spiked. Energy grids are stressed. Regional power companies can charge record prices. Consumers are left with the choice of paying the increasing rates or turning off the lights.

In Europe, when energy demand exceeded supply, central planners chose to decrease demand by tapping the brakes on economic growth while closing operating power plants. Electricity prices skyrocketed. Germans today pay 10 times what many Americans pay for power, their manufactured goods cost more to make and more to buy, and their less-competitive economy suffers. These higher energy prices, along with overly stringent regulatory regimes, have crippled Europe’s technology sector, leaving it reliant on American companies for computing, data storage and AI.

Ohio has taken a more sensible economic approach. Instead of artificially reducing demand by making energy even more expensive, policymakers in Columbus have taken steps to increase energy supply.

Ohio House Bill 15 set the stage for the state’s energy production to move from a government-regulated monopoly to a market-based competitive field. Taking many of the recommendations made by The Buckeye Institute and Americans for Prosperity-Ohio, the legislation abandons overrestrictive mandates, ends government subsidies, and cuts the bureaucracy that hinders growth and has hampered new energy production for decades.

The law requires the Ohio Power Siting Board to make decisions within 45 days of application, expediting a confusing process that too often takes months or even years to complete. Ohio’s 45-day rule is an overdue fix that will help keep vital energy projects on schedule and out of bureaucratic limbo.

Faster project approvals mean more power to meet surging demand sooner. That means lower production costs and more competitive prices for manufacturers, data centers and computing firms that need reliable, around-the-clock electricity.

The bill also encourages “behind-the-meter” power generation, allowing companies to build new power sources to supply their plants directly. Controlling their energy supply will enhance reliability and give companies greater certainty that their electricity demands will be met.

Ohio has also killed expensive, inefficient government subsidies to utility companies, including notorious taxpayer bailouts for the Ohio Valley Electric Corp. that have cost consumers more than $600 million since 2017 and would have cost another $100 million annually for the foreseeable future. Republicans in Washington just eliminated similar subsidies at the federal level, and for good reason. Taxpayers should not be subsidizing utilities even as they pay record prices for electricity. Removing government subsidies for politically favored companies levels the playing field and encourages genuine competition and innovation in the energy sector.

Finally, Ohio House Bill 15 bars utilities from adding “bill riders” that surprise consumers with unexpected fees. It also replaces outdated electric security plans, which are rate structures that allow utilities to charge hidden fees. Market rate offers are more transparent and competitive pricing systems that let consumers make more informed decisions when choosing electricity suppliers. By aligning default utility rates with the wholesale energy market, market rate offers require utilities to price competitively and encourage them to be more efficient and offer consumers more affordable energy rates.

Ohio has set a standard that other states can and should adopt. States have different energy structures, some more market-based than others, but any state, even those with highly regulated energy monopolies, can benefit from following Ohio’s example.

Ohio’s approach will help deliver less expensive, more reliable energy by increasing supply through competition and deregulation rather than stifling demand with artificially higher prices. Looking to balance grid stability, affordability and innovation, Ohio has rightly eschewed politically motivated mandates, prodded regulators to act efficiently, and prioritized consumers’ concerns over entrenched special interests. That message resonates across economic sectors and will attract new-economy firms looking for reliable energy with transparent, affordable pricing.

States looking to remain economically competitive in an increasingly digital and global market should follow Ohio’s lead or risk suffering Europe’s fate and falling further behind.

Determined to avoid a repeat, Indiana has been cranking fake crowd noise at practice, forcing the offense to communicate under constant pressure.
It’s loud and obnoxious and it rings your ears,” Coogan said of the artificial crowd noise.
For him, it comes down to mental preparation.
As the Hoosiers prepare for one of their toughest road schedules in recent memory, their center’s discipline and edge will be crucial.","It’s Week 5 of the college football season, and the Hoosiers are gearing up for their first road test of 2025: a trip to Iowa City. Fresh off their rout of Illinois, Indiana now has to reset quickly and brace for a hostile environment in their second conference game of the season. Kinnick Stadium is notorious for its volume, and this weekend the crowd will be determined to throw Indiana’s offense off balance. That’s where offensive lineman Pat Coogan says preparation becomes non-negotiable.

“It’s a challenge for sure—there’s no doubt about it,” Coogan said Tuesday. “But you got to prepare for it. You got to prepare for it every single day leading up to it. You can’t just turn it on and on Friday expect to be good. You got to prepare for it, and you got to make sure everyone’s tuned into the cadences and all the little things that sometimes you can gloss over when you’re [playing] at home. But now it’s going to be a bigger challenge. So, you got to prepare for it and make sure everyone’s on the same page.”

The have already learned how damaging a hostile crowd can be. Against reigning national champion Ohio State in 2024, Indiana held firm early, but once mistakes started piling up, the noise grew deafening, and the offense never recovered. A similar story played out in South Bend during the College Football Playoff opener. Even though head coach Curt Cignetti downplayed Notre Dame’s crowd earlier this week, the Hoosiers still struggled to find rhythm.

Determined to avoid a repeat, Indiana has been cranking fake crowd noise at practice, forcing the offense to communicate under constant pressure.

“It’s loud. It’s loud and obnoxious and it rings your ears,” Coogan said of the artificial crowd noise. “We had it on for the whole two hours or however long we were out there today. There’re no breaks or anything because there’s not going to be any breaks on Saturday. So, it’s good preparation for us.”

Annoying or not, the constant noise should help sharpen Indiana’s focus—especially for younger players or transfers still adjusting to high-pressure atmospheres. For Coogan, though, this isn’t new territory.

Before joining Indiana, he played in 30 games with 26 career starts at Notre Dame, giving him plenty of experience in intimidating environments. As a freshman, he ran onto the field against Virginia Tech with “Enter Sandman” shaking the stadium. He’s lined up in Top-15 showdowns, like Duke in 2023, and battled through the Fighting Irish’s playoff run that included a national championship appearance. Coogan has seen—and heard—it all. For him, it comes down to mental preparation.

“It’s more of a mental expectation, you really have to get yourself ready for it,” Coogan explained. “You have to know what to listen to and what not to listen to.

BII’s investment in the initiative’s debt-focussed vehicle, H2R Amplify, will improve energy access for more than 50 million people and mitigate over 3 million tonnes of CO₂e.

It qualifies under the 2X Challenge with the commitment to promote gender equality in the energy sector and expand economic opportunities for women as consumers and employees.

British International Investment (BII), the UK’s development finance institution and impact investor, has announced a $20 million commitment to Acumen’s Hardest-to-Reach (H2R) Initiative. Through the initiative’s debt-focussed vehicle, H2R Amplify, our investment will help expand access to affordable, reliable, and clean energy in frontier economies in Africa – where nearly 600 million people still lack access to electricity and women bear the disproportionate burden of energy poverty.

As part of H2R’s dual-vehicle structure, H2R Amplify will deploy innovative financing to established off-grid solar companies in the most underserved countries in sub-Saharan Africa, accelerating energy access where national electrification rates range from just 59 to as low as 12 per cent. It will offer impact-linked loans and receivables backed financing to help solar companies manage working capital as they scale. H2R Catalyze, the initiative’s patient capital arm, has raised $57 million since 2023 and is already investing in early-stage companies.

H2R Amplify, which was originally developed by Acumen with UK research and innovation support via the Transforming Energy Access (TEA) platform, has now has secured $123 million in commitments at first close. It is structured to attract commercial investment by offering risk protection and enhanced returns through a tiered blended financing model. By offering this blend of financing, it delivers a scalable model that helps solar companies expand into and grow within lower-income countries that are currently underserved or overlooked by traditional investors.

With BII’s support, H2R Amplify is expected to reach more than 50 million individuals, including 40 million gaining first-time access to clean energy products. It is also expected to mitigate over 3 million tonnes of CO₂e by displacing highly polluting fuels such as kerosene.

H2R Amplify is 2X Challenge-qualified, reflecting a strong commitment to advancing gender equality including through increased opportunities for women customers and employees in the off-grid solar sector. Acumen will further support this commitment through Gender Action Plans at portfolio companies and gender-focused technical assistance, to help improve gender inclusive practices and the collection of gender data to track progress.

This investment underscores BII’s commitment to addressing economic inequality and catalysing private sector growth in Africa’s most fragile and underserved regions which often struggle to attract commercial capital. This is further demonstrated through the Africa Resilience Investment Accelerator (ARIA), a platform created by BII to work with development partners to de-risk investments and unlock opportunities in fragile and conflict-affected countries.

Rachel Kyte, UK Special Representative for Climate said: “Being able to access reliable and affordable electricity transforms lives. The UK is working with African leaders, African entrepreneurs, and the energy and finance communities to realise the goal of universal access by 2030. With the support of the UK and other donors Acumen’s Fund will extend clean power to more than 50 million people – unlocking prosperity and driving forward the green energy transition across Africa.”

Chris Chijiutomi, MD and Head of Africa at BII, commented: “With nearly 600 million people in Africa still lacking access to energy, we’re focussed on investing in inclusive energy solutions, to close this gap. This partnership reflects BII’s commitment to backing investments in the most challenging markets, where our capital can have the greatest impact. We also recognise that women bear the disproportionate burden of energy poverty and so we’re pleased that H2R Amplify will seek to create economic opportunities for women through its off-grid solar investments.”

Jacqueline Novogratz, Founder and CEO of Acumen, added: “BII’s partnership reflects a shared commitment to solving energy poverty in the hardest-to-reach markets. By expanding access to clean energy for millions of households and businesses, this initiative holds the promise to provide resilience, agency and dignity, along with light and power. BII’s investment shows how public and private institutions can mobilise the right kind of capital to build markets that endure and unlock human potential.”

Take the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5: it debuted with a sticker close to $62,000, but after 8,000 miles and less than 12 months on the road, at least one is selling for around $37,000.
An Audi e-Tron GT supercar that cost about $124,000 just three years ago is now offered at $52,000.
“If you’re sub-200 miles as your new starting range, they don’t hold their value very well,” he said.
But the federal credits go away at the end of month, which could cause electric car prices to inch upward.","The deals on used electric vehicles right now are shocking.

In 2017, a brand-new Nissan Leaf carried a price tag of about $35,000; today, that same car is yours for less than $6,500. This story repeats across the market. A Hyundai Kona that rolled off the showroom floor in 2021 for more than $43,000 has fallen below $16,000. Even newer models aren’t spared from this kind of depreciation. Take the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5: it debuted with a sticker close to $62,000, but after 8,000 miles and less than 12 months on the road, at least one is selling for around $37,000. The drops are even starker in the luxury segment. An Audi e-Tron GT supercar that cost about $124,000 just three years ago is now offered at $52,000. All of this is before government incentives that could bring costs even lower.

In August, plummeting prices sparked a 59 percent year-over-year surge in used EV sales, according to the research firm Cox Automotive. But the trend also begs the question whether even well-priced used EVs are a bad investment in an asset that will continue to depreciate at an alarming rate. Experts say that depends on the car, and on how the buyer would use it.

“I would buy one now,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. In August, used electric cars typically cost about $900 more than similar gas-powered ones, she added, which is the lowest gap on record. It’s a premium that is likely easily made up in gas savings and far lower maintenance costs because an EV won’t need, say, oil changes. “There’s a really strong value proposition to buying a used EV,” Valdez Streaty said.

But even a deep discount may not be enough for some people to shake off their earlier experiences, or perceptions, about electric cars, said John Helveston, an engineer and professor at George Washington University who studies technology adoption. As he put it, “If you bought a used Leaf even a few years ago, your experience was likely not great.”

That’s because until recently, batteries often deteriorated rapidly, which led to untenable driving ranges and often regrettable purchases. But Helveston said the landscape has changed dramatically, with a trend toward more efficient technologies and bigger packs that don’t degrade as fast. Still, most warranties only kick in once the capacity has fallen below 70 percent. So, Helveston said, the car’s original range remains critical and is one of the best indications of how quickly it might depreciate.

“If you’re sub-200 miles as your new starting range, they don’t hold their value very well,” he said. Conversely, that’s why Teslas — with ranges in the 300- or 400-mile realm — have historically depreciated considerably more slowly.

Although research by Helveston and others has shown that EVs depreciate much more quickly than gas-powered vehicles in the first two to three years, the good news is that after that the rates of decline converge and all cars lose value at a similar pace.

Incentives are another factor to consider. Right now an income-qualified buyer can get up to $4,000 federal tax credit on a used EV costing under $25,000 or as much as $7,500 for a new one. Many states, municipalities, and utilities offer rebates as well. But the federal credits go away at the end of month, which could cause electric car prices to inch upward. On the other hand, a loophole in those incentives led to a glut of leased electric vehicles — more than a million of which are set to hit the used market within the next few years, which could exert downward pressure on prices. It’s unclear how all those elements will interact.

“There’s no crystal ball on this,” said Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence at the website CarGurus, via e-mail. “But given recent trends, we don’t expect to see the price volatility in used EVs that we’ve seen in the past.”

The bad news is that shopping for used EVs can be a bit of black box.

“With a gas car, between age and mileage you know a lot about that car. In the EV, people have no clue,” said Helveston. Battery health, he explained, is more linked to how the car was used than its age or mileage. If, for example, an owner only used super-fast Level 3 chargers, the battery would take much more of a beating than someone who primarily charged in their garage. Plus, even with recent improvements in battery tech, it’s still hard to predict exactly how a battery will perform five or 10 years out.

“There is this huge gap of information and because of that there’s a hesitance to buy it,” said Helveston. There are, however, some things people can do to mitigate those concerns. The first is to ask the dealer or seller to charge a car to 100 percent capacity before the test drive. Then compare the range on the dashboard to the manufacturer’s stated figure when the car was new. That should provide a rough approximation of remaining battery capacity. After a few years, the pack should retain 90 to 95 percent of its rating.

Valdez Streaty said that it’s not uncommon for dealers to either not have or not know how to access battery health information, though that process may become more standardized in coming years. In the meantime, she said, the used car auction that Cox operates — Manheim — rates batteries on a scale of 1 to 100. It’s the largest auction network in North America and is used by many dealers, which may be able to pass along any information they receive about the battery.

“Definitely you want something that’s going to be above 80 percent,” she said.

The other option is to ignore range or depreciation and buy the cheapest car possible and drive it into the ground. This works well for people who only need a car for around town — most people don’t drive more than 40 miles a day — and don’t care about features. This is what Helveston did when he bought a 10-year-old Leaf off Facebook Marketplace for $5,000. It had a remaining range of just 60 miles, but he drives no more than 30 per day.

“The miles are double what I need,” he said, and he doesn’t have to pay for gas or oil changes, either. “If it dies on me, I only invested five grand in it and I’ll buy another one.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/used-EV-electric-vehicle-prices-tax-credit-sales.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-24 11:05:03.317227

Vanguard Renewables is rapidly scaling its national footprint, with operational sites across the Northeast and new facilities under construction in the Midwest and South.","MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanguard Renewables, a leading U.S. environmental services company and producer of biomethane from organic waste, today announced its first utility offtake through a new agreement with CenterPoint Energy, a leading energy delivery company serving over 7 million customers nationwide. The agreement marks a key milestone as Vanguard Renewables scales renewable natural gas (RNG) infrastructure to help states like Minnesota meet their clean energy goals.

CenterPoint Energy will purchase RNG produced at a new anaerobic digestion facility in Meeker County, co-located on a historic dairy and crop farm and integrated into CenterPoint's existing natural gas infrastructure. The system serves 930,000 customers across Minnesota.

Processing up to 290 tons of food and beverage waste daily, the facility will generate approximately 270,000 MMBtu of RNG annually. The project will create up to 100 construction jobs and 10 permanent operational roles, supporting local economic development and expanding access to regionally produced clean energy.

""This agreement with CenterPoint Energy reflects our shared commitment to deploying clean energy solutions that benefit the environment and local communities,"" said Michael O'Laughlin, CEO at Vanguard Renewables. ""It also represents a deeper investment in the Midwest, where we are bringing our circular model to life by harnessing the power of waste to build local infrastructure, support multigenerational farmers, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""

RNG is rapidly emerging as one of the most practical and scalable tools for strengthening U.S. energy independence while transforming waste into a valuable resource. Vanguard Renewables produces RNG by processing unavoidable food waste from manufacturers and retailers with farm-based organics like manure through anaerobic digestion. The captured methane is upgraded to pipeline-quality gas, while byproducts are returned to the farm to support regenerative agriculture.

With over a decade of experience and more than a million tons of waste diverted from landfills, Vanguard Renewables is uniquely positioned to accelerate the deployment of regionally produced RNG. The company's national expansion strategy includes a pipeline of more than 30 projects slated for development by 2028.

""At CenterPoint Energy, we're excited to invest in innovative efforts that help lower emissions and advance Minnesota's energy future, such as Vanguard Renewables' new anaerobic digestion facility,"" said Brad Steber, Vice President, Minnesota Gas at CenterPoint Energy. ""By adding regionally produced RNG to our distribution system, we can provide our customers with a lower-carbon energy source that continues to deliver the safe, reliable service they expect. We look forward to helping grow the RNG industry, create clean energy from waste, and support our regional economies.""

This project is part of CenterPoint Energy's innovation plan, approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission under the state's Natural Gas Innovation Act. The plan includes a diverse set of pilot projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and expanding decarbonization efforts for Minnesota customers.

The new facility will be Vanguard Renewables' third in the Midwest, joining an operational site in Eden and another under construction in River Falls, both in Wisconsin.

According to the “2025 North America Virtual Power Plant Market Report,” virtual power plants reached 37.5 GW of behind-the-meter flexible capacity over the past year. Total capacity grew 13.7 percent last year, while the number of company deployments, unique offtakers, and market and utility programs monetized jumped more than 33 percent.

“Utility program caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie, said.

Also, the report said that the share of VPP wholesale market capacity from residential customers increased to 10.2 percent from 8.8 percent in 2024. California, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts are the leading states, representing 37 percent of VPP deployments. In addition, the PJM and ERCOT regions have the greatest utility commitments to data center capacity and the most disclosed VPP offtake capacity.

“While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

The top twenty-five VPP offtakers procured over 100 MW each this year, while over half of all offtakers increased the number of deployments under them by at least 30 percent, year-over-year. Also, an independent distributed power producer business model has emerged.

“This model is seen as limiting access of private capital and aggregators from the DER market, rather than leveraging customer and third party-owned resources,” Hertz-Shargel said. “Meanwhile, there is broad consensus among experienced wholesale market participants that FERC Order 2222 was a missed opportunity and will not have a significant impact on market access.”",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_1710160621.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 08:59:50.235467

“We risk both our economic and national security when we depend on foreign adversaries like China for materials that are vital to our manufacturing and defense industries,” said Senator Peters, who recently reintroduced the Intergovernmental Critical Minerals Taskforce Act. “We must utilize our partners like LIFT to accelerate the development and production of these materials here at home. Doing so will help create good American jobs while ensuring our manufacturers have reliable access to these important materials.”

The project’s technical approach is multifaceted, and includes a working group of experts from government, including the Air Force Research Lab, industry, including Exothermics, Kratos SRE and Materials Research & Design (MR&D), and academia to pursue technology advancements to scale initiatives, such as solid-state ceramic batteries, as well as to onshore and scale technologies associated with carbon fiber, a critical pre-cursor material for defense-related protection systems often comprised of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) that are in severely limited supply within the United States.

“Indeed, instead of unlocking investment and fast tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills and leave families and businesses hurting,” he said.
Lawmakers in several states have proposed laws requiring PJM members to report their votes to state regulators.
Asthana said criticism of PJM’s interconnection queue, in which 63,000 megawatts of power projects await review for permission to connect to the grid, is not warranted.
Duane later added that as general counsel, PJM board members often asked him to whom they had a fiduciary responsibility.","The organization that manages the electric grid for all or part of 13 states, including Maryland, has moved too slowly in response to skyrocketing energy demand and consumers are paying for it, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday.

Speaking at a conference of energy industry leaders and regulators in Philadelphia, Shapiro said PJM Interconnection must make changes, including giving states a bigger role in its governance, or the commonwealth could leave the consortium.

“We need to be thinking about consumers and their costs, something that PJM, I think, doesn’t really spend a whole lot of time focused on,” Shapiro told reporters Monday after delivering opening remarks at the event.

He said governors from each PJM state share concerns about the Valley Forge-based organization’s backlog of new energy projects awaiting approval while peak energy consumption is expected to increase by 20% in the next decade, according to PJM’s forecast. Much of that demand will come from data centers that house the computing power for artificial intelligence.

“We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects. We’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” Shapiro said.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who spoke via video, said overhauling the state’s power policy was among his first calls for action after taking office in 2022. Youngkin, a Republican, said his administration predicted demand would grow faster than PJM’s forecast.

“Indeed, instead of unlocking investment and fast tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills and leave families and businesses hurting,” he said. “This is a crisis of not having enough power, and it is a crisis in confidence.”

Youngkin said Virginia lawmakers are working on legislation that would allow the state to reassess whether its utilities should remain part of PJM.

“This doesn’t mean that we are walking away, but it does mean that collectively, we recognize we need to represent and protect our ratepayers, and that means sending a clear, unified signal that PJM must modernize,” he said.

PJM was founded in Philadelphia nearly a century ago when three electricity utilities connected their independent grids to share resources and improve reliability. With more than 1,000 stakeholder members, it now ensures the flow of power to utilities in all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois and the New York border to North Carolina.

It is overseen by a board of governors through a consensus-based issue resolution process in which member organizations and stakeholders have weighted votes on issues that will go before the board. These include state consumer advocate organizations, like Pennsylvania’s Public Utilities Commission, but the states themselves have no direct input.

The board’s decisions are ultimately subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

While PJM’s stakeholder process and meetings are open to the public with agendas and minutes posted on its website, members of the public are required to register for an account to watch meetings virtually. And while the outcome of votes is public, critics have compared it to a black box, because how stakeholders vote on questions is secret.

Lawmakers in several states have proposed laws requiring PJM members to report their votes to state regulators. They include a bill introduced by Pennsylvania state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia), which passed in the House in July and awaits action in the Senate.

“Utility companies operating in our regional power grid that determine the electric bills, environmental and public health of 65 million people should never be allowed to vote in secret,” Rabb said. “Such decisions must be publicly disclosed. End of story.”

PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is set to step down at the end of this year, said he’s proud of the reliability that PJM has provided through a series of unusual events during his tenure, including record peak demands, a pandemic, geomagnetic storms and the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which threatened a major transmission line.

Asthana said criticism of PJM’s interconnection queue, in which 63,000 megawatts of power projects await review for permission to connect to the grid, is not warranted.

“There’s a lot of mythology and a lot of things that are said about our interconnection queue,” he said, noting that number is down from 200,000 megawatts when the organization implemented reforms in 2023. PJM also notes that it has cleared tens of thousands of megawatts worth of projects that have failed to come online for reasons outside of its control, including site acquisition, permitting and supply chain problems.

PJM has also worked proactively with members to prioritize important projects, such as restarting Constellation Energy’s former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, and redeveloping Homer City, one of the nation’s largest coal power plants, into the nation’s largest natural gas-burning power stations. Both projects will power data centers.

Experts who spoke during panels at the conference agreed with Shapiro, Youngkin and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who also spoke via video, that PJM is not serving consumers well.

“You’ve got 67 million people who are very concerned, and again, consumers are called voters, and that makes the politicians concerned,” said former FERC Chairman Mark Christie. Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements were recommended by a bipartisan panel of PJM-state governors to fill vacancies on the board, but neither was ultimately nominated.

“PJM should be reimagined in the governance sense,” Christie said, adding that he wouldn’t interfere with the technical aspects of operating the grid. “The policymaking things that PJM does in their political policy, if it’s going to be a regional government for the grid, people who are elected will have a much bigger role in that.”

Vincent Duane, a former senior vice president and general counsel at PJM, said changes need to go deeper than simply giving elected officials a bigger role.

Maryland Democratic leaders tout electricity refund, keep grid operator in the hot seat

“​​I’m going to be blunt and unpopular when I say that PJM has become ungovernable,” Duane said “Adding seats to an already crowded banquet table with 1,000 parliamentarians with vastly different interests, I think, is going to ultimately leave states feeling disappointed with the outcomes.”

What’s missing is more purposeful and deliberate decision making from a strong executive branch in the organization that is accountable to state utility regulators, he said.

Duane later added that as general counsel, PJM board members often asked him to whom they had a fiduciary responsibility. He said he had trouble answering the question. To say the responsibility was to the marketplace or membership was unsatisfactory.

“Until we can get a good answer to that question, it’s premature to start talking about process and voting structures,” Duane said.

Maryland State Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said the question of fiduciary duty is an important one for the success of policies that elected officials create.

“The vast majority of the stakeholders know who their fiduciary duty is to, and it is to their shareholders,” Charkoudian said, adding that for ratepayers that amounts to a wealth transfer to the market participants who are writing the rules.

“You could go example after example after example, where that is the case,” she said. “And that is why it’s untenable to continue at this moment with this governance structure.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5474-1024x768-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 08:00:10.606394

It can be life-threatening and lead to hundreds or even thousands of dollars in losses.

Unfortunately, research out of Texas A&M discovered that the country is shockingly vulnerable to grid outages — and some states are more at risk than others.

What's happening?

EnergySage spotlighted Texas A&M's report in a recent article examining how installing solar panels with battery storage can give homeowners a leg up during grid outages on households without a backup power source or those dependent on gasoline generators.

As an independent, objective expert in the nuances of the rooftop solar industry, EnergySage offers free tools for consumers to obtain easy-to-compare solar installation quotes.

Texas A&M's findings reveal why an increasing number of homeowners are preparing for weather-induced grid outages with the assistance of EnergySage.

The university reported that power outages have risen by 20% since 2019. Texas, California, and Louisiana, respectively, accounted for the most major power outages between 2000 and 2023, according to a Power System Vulnerability Index created using over 179 million data points.

Why is this important?

As EnergySage explains, power outages aren't just dangerous for people who rely on medical equipment needing refrigeration or electricity. During an outage, the average family loses $200 in groceries because of spoilage, and they may need to shell out upward of $25,000 on hotel stays, damaged electronics, and other repairs in the event of water-related property damage.

Dr. Ali Mostafavi, the director of the Urban Resilience AI Lab that used machine learning to develop the vulnerability index, said in the Texas A&M release that the grid failure situation was more dire than they originally suspected.

""We knew that the state of power system vulnerability nationwide is exacerbating. But the magnitude of that was shocking, and greater than we hypothesized,"" Dr. Mostafavi said.

What can be done about this?

Installing solar panels and pairing them with battery storage won't only boost your family's ability to manage whatever climate-related event comes its way.

Along with upgrading to energy-efficient technology, solar and battery storage will also help you significantly reduce your energy bills while slashing dirty fuel-produced heat-trapping pollution responsible for warming the climate and subsequently supercharging extreme weather.

Whether used for everyday power or as a backup energy source, solar panels also improve comfort and peace of mind because they're quieter than gas generators and don't introduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

On average, EnergySage's free services save homeowners $10,000 on solar installations. Now is also the time to connect with EnergySage to maximize your savings, as solar projects must be underway by Dec. 31 to qualify for federal tax incentives. Its state-by-state mapping tool can help you discover which area-specific savings may also be available.

If you're ready to level up further, you may want to consider making a heat pump your heating and cooling technology of choice. EnergySage can connect you with trusted installers who can answer your questions and help you find the right heat pump for your home at an affordable price.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/power-outage.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 08:59:35.064997

Without interventions, Europe risks losing remaining industrial and technological capabilities in solar.” The ‘Reshoring Solar Module Manufacturing to Europe’ report offers a cost gap analysis and policy impact simulation, which finds that producing a solar module in Europe with EU-made solar cells costs around 10.3 €ct/Wp more than producing the same module in China.
The report recommends: Establishing an EU-level output-based support scheme for solar manufacturing, combining grants, loans, and de-risking instruments to cover both CAPEX and OPEX.
It is now up to the Member States to implement these provisions as of 2026.
But its success depends on how Member States implement the non-price criteria in renewable energy auctions.","Solar installations that support supply chain resilience can be competitive with imports from China with the right policy support, a new report from SolarPower Europe and Fraunhofer ISE reveals.

Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO at SolarPower Europe (she/her) said: “This new report underlines that, with the right policies, Europe can competitively deliver 30 GW of solar manufacturing by 2030, creating thousands of local jobs, and building a resilient, innovative solar supply chain that keeps economic value here at home. To meet 2030 goal, the EU and Member States must act swiftly. Without interventions, Europe risks losing remaining industrial and technological capabilities in solar.”

The ‘Reshoring Solar Module Manufacturing to Europe’ report offers a cost gap analysis and policy impact simulation, which finds that producing a solar module in Europe with EU-made solar cells costs around 10.3 €ct/Wp more than producing the same module in China.

The gap stems from higher costs in equipment (+40%), building and facility (+110%), labour (+280%), and material costs (+50%). As a result, such utility solar installations cost about 60.8 €ct/Wp compared to 50.0 €ct/Wp for a Chinese system, translating into a Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) that is 14.5% higher for European-made modules. This gives a hopeful indication that already, EU-made products fall within the 15% limit of additional costs under Net-Zero Industry Act auction rules.

However, the report notes a significant cost difference (2.2 to 5.8 €ct/Wp) between NZIA compliant EU-made and NZIA compliant non-EU-made modules. The Net-Zero Industry Act’s resilience criteria can therefore diversify module supply chains and boost imports from elsewhere in the world, but without more policy measures, reshoring EU production may not be achieved.

Crucially, the report reveals that the cost gap between European made and Chinese imported solar can be further reduced to below 10% with the right mix of policies, such as combining CAPEX and OPEX schemes, both for solar manufacturers and project developers, with output-based support (e.g. successful models have existed in the US (IRA) and India (PLI schemes), and assuming solar factories reaching 3-5 GW capacity.

The report notes that industry support needs range from €1.4 – €5.2 billion annually to reach the 30 GW target for European solar manufacturing for 2030, with up to 39% of costs being recovered through macroeconomic benefits (up to 2,700 jobs and €66.4 million in annual tax and social revenues per GWp/a).

The report recommends:

Establishing an EU-level output-based support scheme for solar manufacturing, combining grants, loans, and de-risking instruments to cover both CAPEX and OPEX.

Implementing NZIA policy schemes across Member States, including “Made-in-EU” bonus points in rooftop support and public procurement programmes.

Notes

The Net-Zero Industry Act: The European Commission adopted the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA) Secondary Legislation on 23 May 2025, establishing the rules for Member States on how to incorporate non-price criteria into renewable energy auctions. This follows the adoption of the Net-Zero Industry Act in June 2024. It is now up to the Member States to implement these provisions as of 2026. The NZIA offers a historic opportunity to reshore clean tech manufacturing in Europe. But its success depends on how Member States implement the non-price criteria in renewable energy auctions. As per the law, Member States are to apply non-price criteria (NPCs) to at least 30% of the auctioned volume per year, or 6 GW annually. These NPCs should account for 15% to 30% of the overall evaluation criteria, with some flexibility allowed in cases where associated costs exceed 15%. Resilience under Art. 26 NZIA is defined as not from the dominant source of supply.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TRINASOLAR.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 08:00:15.529219

Playing a key role in the stability of the European continent, existing interconnectors need to be secured from sabotage, and new projects need to be planned and deployed, especially in regions with the highest risk of technical or political incidents, such as the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Europe.

Three blackouts in the EU were avoided or managed thanks to European interconnectors in the last 5 years.

Ukraine and Moldova would’ve faced severe power loss due to Russia’s aggression, if not for cross-border electricity exchange with EU neighbours.

55% of Europe’s power system has limited electricity import options, increasing the risk of blackouts. Spain, Ireland and Finland are particularly exposed, with very little support available from neighbours in case of grid incidents.

Nine recent cases of Baltic Sea infrastructure sabotage show the need to protect Europe’s interconnection infrastructure.

Interconnectors help stabilise or restart grids after faults

Several examples show how interconnectors helped stabilise grids during incidents that could have otherwise had much more severe consequences.

European interconnectors made recent grid stress events less severe

While European power systems maintain excellent reliability standards, multiple events in the past have put grids to a test. In those moments, interconnectors played a key role in stabilising the power systems and preventing widespread power cuts, or restarting the system if a blackout did occur.

Prevention: interconnectors helped avoid two potential blackouts in Poland

On 17th May 2021, a human error led to the malfunction of a high-voltage substation in Poland – Rogowiec. The substation feeds power from the largest power plant in the country – Bełchatów, into the Polish grid. The incident suddenly disconnected around 3.5 GW of capacity from the system and led to a 158 mHz frequency drop, just shy of the 200 mHz buffer that would put the system in an emergency state.

The Continental Europe Synchronous Area absorbed the frequency deviation by ramping up flows from neighbouring countries. These flows instantly reached 4.5 GW – 2.3 GW more than allowed. Significant load appeared on power lines in Western Poland – 5 lines were operating at above 100% capacity, two of them above 120%, posing a risk of overloading. These violations were resolved by the Polish and German transmission system operators (TSOs), who limited flows and restored the frequency to nominal value within 30 minutes.

Immediately after the incident, the Polish TSO requested emergency support from neighbouring countries to rebuild capacity reserves. Interconnectors were initially essential to prevent further frequency drops, the tripping of generators and cascading failures. Then they became key to rebuilding the system’s reserves while the grid malfunction was being removed.

Another stressful event happened in Poland on 22nd June 2020, when heavy rainfall damaged coal supply lines. This, along with several other random failures, led to a record unplanned generation loss of 5.7 GW, equivalent to a quarter of that day’s peak demand. The event wasn’t as sudden as the one in 2021, and the frequency was not disrupted, so the incident didn’t require a formal investigation.

However, the Polish TSO had to request emergency imports from neighbouring countries and deployed almost all coal plants available in “cold reserve” – plants used only in emergency situations. If interconnectors hadn’t provided 3 GW of power, a blackout would have been a real possibility. Only around 2 GW of coal and pumped-storage capacity was left in the system, meaning 1 GW of demand could not have been balanced, leading to voluntary or forced reductions.

Stability: interconnectors filled France’s generation gap throughout 2022

France has recently faced major generation gaps due to nuclear plant outages. Historically, the country was the biggest exporter of electricity in Europe. However, in 2022, the total electricity generation dropped from 550 TWh in 2021 to 468 TWh – a decrease of 15%. Flows switched from net exports of 42 TWh in 2021 to net imports of 17 TWh. Peak imports reached 11 GW – 75% of the total interconnector capacity. In certain moments, imports covered up to 17% of the country’s peak electricity demand. While French nuclear has rebounded since 2022, the fleet still experiences outages, especially during heatwaves. In those moments interconnectors continue filling the capacity gaps, reducing price spikes as well.

Recovery: interconnectors restarted the Iberian grid after the blackout

On 28th April 2025, Spain and Portugal were hit by the largest blackout in Europe’s modern history, leaving around 60 million people without electricity for hours. Multiple causes led to the incident, and a final report by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) is due in October 2025.

What is already certain is that, after the blackout, interconnectors were essential in restarting the Iberian power system. Just 10 minutes after the blackout, the first France-Spain power line was reenergised, soon joined by the interconnector with Morocco and other connections with France. With the help of hydro and gas units, a full restoration was achieved in Spain around 4 AM on 29th April, around 16 hours after the incident.

The Iberian Peninsula is more vulnerable to blackout risks than other European countries due to limited connections to the continental grid. Following the blackout, Spain and Portugal urged the EU to back new interconnector projects, citing stronger links as essential to preventing future disruptions.

The 2021 blackout in Texas offers a stark warning of what can happen if connectivity isn’t sufficient. In February 2021, severe cold weather left more than 4.5 million people without power for several days, causing 250 deaths. With peak demand above 70 GW but just 1 GW of interconnection, the state was unable to stabilise frequency deviations or replace the 34 GW of missing capacity through imports, leading to a quick collapse. Restarting the system after the blackout was difficult as well – with fossil gas generators rendered unavailable, interconnectors could not be used to resynchronise the system, as was the case after the Iberian blackout. This is why exploring additional interconnection was one of the recommendations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that analysed the blackout.

This ratio varies from 12% in Poland, to almost 200% in Latvia – a country that has relatively small domestic demand, but supports electricity transits between Central Europe, the Baltics and the Nordics. However, there is no guarantee that imports from neighbours will be available instantly and at full capacity. That is why diversification is key: the more neighbours a country is connected to, the higher the chance that cross-border support can be provided on short notice.

Summing the peak electricity demand of countries with three or fewer import directions and an import potential ratio of 25% or lower, up to 55% of Europe’s power system can be considered at risk due to limited emergency import options. Three countries – Spain, Ireland and Finland – are particularly exposed, with very little support available from neighbours in case of grid incidents.

Interconnectors provide security in times of uncertainty and war

Being essential for Europe during Russia’s aggression, interconnectors have also become targets of sabotage.

Interconnectors helped when power systems were attacked

Interconnectors have a key role in stabilising power systems after a fault. But the past three years have also highlighted their other security feature – delivering stable electricity even during war.

Keeping the grid alive during Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure

Before 2022, Ukraine’s power system was connected to the Russian and Belarusian ones. On the day of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine requested an emergency synchronisation with the European power system. This was achieved in a record time of just 3 weeks. This proved to be a critical security move since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine included multiple attacks on energy infrastructure.

By May 2024, about 70% of Ukraine’s thermal generation capacity was either occupied or damaged, compromising the country’s ability to meet domestic demand. Fortunately, up to 2.4 GW of import capacity was available for Ukraine – equivalent to 20% of the peak demand – including emergency response schemes by neighbouring grid operators.

Thanks to interconnectors, during the most severe attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in 2024, Ukraine imported over 800 GWh of electricity a month, though a capacity gap still remained, leading to local power cuts. Imports totalled 4 TWh in 2024, a striking shift from Ukraine’s historical role as an exporter of around 2 TWh of electricity a year in pre-war 2020 and 2021.

Stabilising Moldova ahead of parliamentary elections

Similarly to Ukraine, Moldova’s power system used to be synchronised with Russia and Belarus. In 2022 it also went through an emergency synchronisation process, using interconnectors with Romania – which again proved to be an effective security move. On 31st December 2024, Russia stopped supplying gas to Moldova’s largest power plant, in an effort to destabilise the country ahead of parliamentary elections. Moldova was forced to source up to 62% of electricity demand from Romania.

Fortunately, thanks to grid investments, Moldova’s energy security will soon be strengthened. A new interconnection, Vulcanesti – Chisinau, is due to be deployed by the end of 2025, providing up to 80-90% of Moldova’s peak demand in emergency situations and ensuring independence from Russia. Two other interconnectors are being constructed, Balti-Suceava, due in 2027, and Straseni-Gutinas, due in 2030, allowing for the full integration of Moldova with the European power grid.

Shielding Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from Russia’s energy blackmail

Once reliant on Russia’s power grid, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were fully synchronised with Europe’s grid and decoupled from Russia on 9th February 2025. The Baltic Synchronisation was one of the EU’s biggest grid projects, receiving 1.2 billion EUR of support from the Connecting Europe Facility. The decoupling of Baltic States from Russia was made possible thanks to new cross-border connections between Poland and Lithuania (LitPol Link), and between Estonia and Latvia, as well as existing connections between Estonia and Finland (EstLink and EstLink 2), and Lithuania and Sweden (NordBalt). To further strengthen the energy security of the Baltics, a new interconnector between Lithuania and Poland is being planned: HarmonyLink, due in 2030.

Infrastructure sabotage is now a key threat

Because interconnections play a key role in Europe’s security, they’ve recently come under attack. Since 2022, nine incidents of infrastructure damage have been recorded in the Baltic Sea.

These include five cases of communication cable disruption, and damage done to the Nord Stream and Balticconnector gas pipelines and the EstLink 2 power cable. The damage done to the EstLink 2 interconnector by a Russian shadow-fleet vessel decreased Estonia’s electricity import capacity by 27% just two months before the full decoupling of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from the Russian power grid.

Baltic Sea energy infrastructure is not the only one at risk. In April 2025, Russian hackers disrupted the operations of a Norwegian hydropower facility. In September 2025, over the span of just two days, a train carrying liquified gas exploded near Vilnius, high-voltage lines were disrupted in an arson attack, causing a partial blackout in Berlin, 19 Russian drones breached Polish airspace and Israel carried out attacks in Qatar – one of Europe’s key gas suppliers.

Since the start of the war in 2022, Russia-attributed hackers have targeted energy companies all across Europe, and globally, the frequency of cyberattacks on energy utilities has doubled since 2021, according to the International Energy Agency.

Energy supply is critical not only for civilian life, but also for military response, and energy infrastructure remains a major target, as shown by examples from Ukraine and Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign in Europe.

Europe’s interconnectors need boosting and securing

Interconnectors are key in guaranteeing grid resilience, energy security and, more broadly, Europe’s safety. To continue providing stability against grid failures or geopolitical threats, two sets of actions need to be taken: the expansion of interconnector capacity and better security of existing infrastructure.

The upcoming European Grid Package presents a timely opportunity to strengthen political commitment around both areas.

European interconnection capacity is expected to almost double between 2024 and 2040, or even triple if all currently planned projects were delivered on time. Priority should be given to areas with limited connectivity and high exposure to potential disruption – such as the Iberian Peninsula, Eastern Europe and Finland.

However, strategic investments will only happen with strong political commitment and cross-border collaboration. Worryingly, Poland, the EU’s fifth largest electricity market, has almost no interconnection expansion projects planned, despite recent near-blackout incidents and a high risk of sabotage. Yet, the country could benefit from new projects in the region: the Baltic Energy Hub and an Eastern European transmission highway that would secure Eastern Europe from Russia, and also enable the full integration of Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans with the European power system.

Existing infrastructure needs to be secured as well. The European Commission recently proposed an Action Plan on Cable Security and a Hybrid Toolbox addressing hybrid warfare. Denmark is researching underwater drones that could capture and immobilise hostile underwater vehicles, NATO established a Critical Undersea Infrastructure teams in the UK and Belgium, and already deployed at least 20 drone boats in the Baltic Sea. But these reactive measures must be coupled with coordinated planning and permitting to accelerate grid investments – as more interconnections, lines and substations make the system more resilient if one of the elements is attacked.

In the case of cross-border and offshore projects, this requires more active steering by the European Commission, facilitating regional collaboration and mediating between governments and financing institutions such as EIB and EBRD. Grid enhancing technologies, including digital solutions, should be incentivised in EU funding, enhancing monitoring, maintenance and recovery of grid assets. Supply chain security is essential as well, with a priority for “made in Europe” components and digital systems.

Finally, in both grid expansion and protection, collaboration and coordination is critical, given the group of stakeholders ranges from grid operators, through the EU, governments and financial institutions, to NATO and different branches of the military.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2024/11/5-03-Transmission-power-lines-Unknown.png,N,,2025-09-24 11:03:57.888280

In a time of global economic uncertainty – you can be certain about Australia.","Thank you all for being here this afternoon.

I thank our hosts Macquarie, a great Australian success story.

Among many distinguished guests, I acknowledge our Ambassador, Kevin Rudd and Australia’s Consul-General to New York, Heather Ridout.

When I had the privilege of serving in Kevin’s Cabinet as Minister for Infrastructure, we asked Heather to join the board of a new body we were establishing: Infrastructure Australia.

Its mission was to look beyond the short-term thinking that can sometimes capture planning and investment – and identify true, nation-building projects that would drive growth and boost productivity in our cities and regions.

The outstanding quality that Heather brought to that role is the same one she brings to her work here in the United States: a grasp of Australia’s true potential and ways to unlock it.

This is what today is all about.

For decades, the United States of America has been the proving ground for Australian entrepreneurs, innovators and creatives.

In tech, in finance, in medical research and the arts, Australians have taken the view that if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.

And because this country’s founding spirit owes so much to people chasing their dreams and believing in themselves, because Americans are so generous with their enthusiasm, their mentoring and their support network, and because Americans know a game-changing idea or a world-leading product when they see one, so many Australians have achieved extraordinary success here.

Our cultures complement each other - both our similarities and our points of difference.

Our people have a knack for bringing out the best in each other.

Which is why skills and ideas and insights travel back the other way.

In tech and start-ups, in agriculture and medical science and resources.

And investment flows both ways as well.

Some of the biggest names in America, are expanding their footprint in Australia.

Google, Microsoft and Amazon in digital infrastructure, cloud computing and quantum.

Pfizer, Baxter Healthcare and Cardinal Health in medical manufacturing.

Chevron, Exxon.

Lockheed Martin and Anduril.

Along with your biggest investment and private equity funds.

All of this is a success story, worth celebrating.

All of it proves the enduring and evolving strength of our two countries’ economic co-operation.

I’m here today because I want us to add a new dimension to our partnership.

American capital and Australian manufacturing are a natural fit.

And if we move now, we can make them an unbeatable combination.

We can put our investment partnership at the centre of a defining global opportunity.

The world’s shift to clean energy represents the biggest change since the industrial revolution.

We are looking at ever increasing global demand for clean energy and the technology that generates and stores it.

And if you started with a blank piece of paper and wrote down every asset and resource you would need to thrive in that economic environment, at the end of it, you would hold in your hand a list of Australia’s strengths.

A mining sector that leads the world in innovation.

Along with the iron ore, copper and coal that have built and powered our region’s prosperity.

We are also the world’s largest producer of lithium.

We have the largest global reserves of zinc and nickel.

And we are home to some of most valuable deposits of critical minerals on earth, just about the whole periodic table.

Including the light and heavy rare earths essential for high-tech manufacturing and defence, the digital economy, artificial intelligence, data centres and clean energy.

And I should note – these are just the deposits that we know about.

The experts at GeoScience Australia are still mapping our continent, they classify 80 per cent of it, under-explored.

Our resources are more than what’s our under our soil or seabed.

Australia is the sunniest continent on earth.

And we have the space that makes it possible to co-locate extraction, refining, processing and manufacturing.

To build an entire, secure supply chain, end to end - and power it with clean energy.

And as energy and emissions and transport become more significant factors in the cost of production, compared to the cost of labour.

And as the alignment of economic and security interests becomes increasingly important.

Our Government sees this as an opportunity to create a new source of comparative advantage.

To make more things in Australia.

High-skill workers, making high-value products – with lower production costs and greater certainty.

Australia has the skilled and productive workforce to make this happen.

A world-class university and training sector, with a proud track record of innovation and research.

We have the capability – and we have the capital.

Our system of universal compulsory superannuation, means Australian funds continue to grow and invest.

Over the next decade, total investment in the US from Australian pension funds is expected to more than double.

That will mean more than $1 trillion invested here in the decade to 2035.

These same funds are investing in the drivers of growth in the Australian economy: infrastructure, energy, start-ups and private capital.

Investing in Australia is about what we have – and where we are.

Because when you build your business in Australia, you are building a platform and a presence in the fastest-growing region of the world in human history.

Our relationship with our region runs deeper than proximity.

We are more than neighbours, we’re partners.

Our bilateral – and multilateral – trade agreements give us priority access to every market in our region.

We are deepening our business to business engagement with India and South East Asia, on track to be the third and fourth largest economies in the world by the 2040s.

And Australia’s multicultural society, our diaspora communities and our status as an education and tourism destination means we are able to call on bonds of family and friendship with every nation in our region, indeed the world.

Australia knows the benefits of free and fair trade.

And our economy is geared for international investment, and for decades has been shaped by it.

We welcome it, we value it.

We know the vital role it plays in our national growth and success.

This why, in our first term, our Government streamlined the investment review process.

Making it work better – and faster - for parties that Australia knows and trusts.

We’re building on this with a new focus on clearing away unnecessary barriers to major projects – and accelerating approvals.

So that investment flows into generating new energy, exploring new opportunities and creating good jobs.

Every investment decision begins with a review of the fundamentals.

And Australia’s fundamentals are as good as anywhere in the world.

Low inflation, low unemployment, accelerating growth.

A Triple-A credit rating from all three agencies.

And we sit close to the top of every global ladder for the integrity of our legal and financial system, the security of transactions, timeliness of payments, smart use of technology.

Now, any Australian trade official can give you a compelling and detailed presentation on the strength of those fundamentals.

I’m here as Australia’s Prime Minister to make it clear that our Government isn’t resting on this record.

We’re not waiting for the world to come to us.

We’re going above and beyond.

Our Future Made in Australia Agenda invests in the full life-cycle of projects: upfront capital, innovation and research – and production incentives.

Including new production tax credits for processed critical minerals and renewable hydrogen.

Our plan facilitates new investment in battery and solar supply chains.

And in innovation, from green iron, aluminium and steel to low carbon fuels.

This fits together with our $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund.

Providing loans, guarantees and equity to help commercial projects, including value-adding in resources and renewable energy technology.

All of this is reinforced by our commitment to reducing emissions.

Our targets for 2030 and 2035 have us on track for Net Zero by 2050.

This provides certainty for business to build for the long term.

Put simply, our Government’s plan for a Future Made in Australia, is a ready-made opportunity for investment from America.

And we want to give you every chance to see that for yourself.

Which is why in November, our Minister for Energy, Chris Bowen and our Minister for Industry, Tim Ayres will be hosting an Investor Forum in Australia.

We see that as a focal point for working through the detail and getting deals done.

With targeted and tailored action - from fast-tracking approvals to direct incentives.

As I’ve made clear today, Australia is blessed with an abundance of natural resources.

For investors, we are also home to the most valuable of resources: trust.

Trust that has been earned and built, over generations.

You know who we are – and what doing business with us means.

You can trust in our laws and governance.

You can invest with confidence in our institutions.

You can build a secure supply chain, in our stable democracy.

You can grow and thrive in an economy that values your investment and rewards your enterprise and aspiration.

You can employ Australian workers, with confidence in their skills and smarts and productivity.

You can draw on Australian research and innovation and know that it’s world class.

You can take on the new challenges and opportunities of emerging markets – from a stable and familiar foundation.

In a time of global economic uncertainty – you can be certain about Australia.

Our Government wants to see Australia make this moment count.

We want to make the most of our nation’s strengths – and our people’s potential.

We want to make more things in Australia.

We want you to be part of seizing this opportunity – and sharing in it.

I look forward to continuing this conversation.",https://www.pm.gov.au/themes/custom/pearly/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-24 11:03:38.527745

The company added the third manufacturing line to enhance its ability to meet the U.S.’s growing demand for domestically produced solar products.

The Greenville manufacturing facility’s first phase commenced operations in April this year. It produces Boviet Solar’s Gamma series monofacial and Vega series bifacial solar modules. The company had announced its investment of $249 million for the facility in April last year.

In August, Boviet Solar completed the exterior construction of its Greenville facility’s second phase, which is expected to begin mass production in 2026.

“The Greenville manufacturing hub is central to Boviet Solar’s U.S. growth strategy,” said Sienna Cen, President at Boviet Solar USA. “By investing in both photovoltaic cell and module production in North Carolina, we are strengthening supply chain resilience, delivering reliable ‘Made-in-USA’ solar products, and creating lasting economic impact for the region.

This year, at the New York International Auto Show, Subaru showed off a facelifted version of the vehicle, which has been improved repeatedly during its lifecycle.

""Since its launch, Solterra has consistently improved year over year, with meaningful updates and improvements that our owners have requested. Those include improved cold-weather charging performance, improved interior ergonomics, and more. We've heard a lot from our Solterra owners about those features and what they expect from their EV ownership experience,"" Bethke said.

The SUV has gotten even better this year. ""For the 2026 model year, we're proud to offer additional driving range, faster charging, standard NACS charging port, more power, a larger touchscreen, dual wireless cell phone chargers, and battery pre-conditioning for even faster charging in cold weather, which are great product improvements consumers are sure to love,"" he shared.

While automakers are putting off and/or cancelling vehicles that only run on electrons, given high development costs and a weak market, Subaru is confident in the direction it is headed. The marketing head shared some insights: ""Subaru customers are known for taking their vehicles off the beaten path and beyond. Our internal research shows that many of our owners are still very interested in making their next new car purchase an EV, so offering an all-electric powertrain with our iconic Subaru shape, legendary capability, and all-wheel-drive performance makes sense for those shoppers.""

Experts expect the new-to-market Forester Hybrid and Crosstrek Hybrid to be even more impactful for the market. They reach customers at a pivotal time in the vehicle electrification story for the U.S. Consumers are more interested in the powertrain variant than ever. Forty-five percent say they are very or somewhat likely to seriously consider purchasing a hybrid the next time they buy a vehicle, a June 2025 Pew Research Center report found.

""The Forester Hybrid and new Crosstrek Hybrid target a growing market of compact SUV shoppers seeking electrification in their vehicles now — and more in the future. But offering a hybrid powertrain only isn't enough. We wanted to ensure that hybrid powertrains in the Forester and Crosstrek will perform like a Subaru should. That means to us that those models are every bit as capable as their non-hybrid counterparts, but also efficient, safe, comfortable, and reliable. With the capability of Subaru Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive standard, Crosstrek Hybrid delivers 597 miles of range while Forester Hybrid delivers 581 miles of range,"" Bethke said.

In addition to Solterra, Forester Hybrid and Crosstrek Hybrid, 2026 will welcome Trailseeker and Uncharted battery-powered SUVs to the Subaru lineup. The Uncharted is smaller, matching up in size with the Toyota C-HR. The Trailseeker model is more like the company's Outback wagon.

Bethke is quick to point out that Trailseeker and Uncharted are not designed to be compromises for Subaru customers. ""Trailseeker brings an all-electric powertrain to a familiar shape for Subaru owners and fans. There's more Subaru DNA than just what you see in the sheet metal,"" he explained.

""In addition to Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive and 8.3 inches of ground clearance, the Trailseeker offers more usable cargo space and ample room for passengers with up to 3,500 pounds of towing capacity and standard roof rails. It's also the quickest Subaru we've ever sold in the U.S.""

The Subaru Solterra and Forester Hybrid are on sale now. Crosstrek Hybrid reaches dealers soon, with Trailseeker and Uncharted arriving in 2026.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2723510/2026-subaru-trailseeker.png,N,,2025-09-24 11:05:17.440190
,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-09-24 10:15:15+00:00,Grist,Trump raised $8 million for Hurricane Helene survivors. Where did it all go? - Grist.org,Katie Myers,,,,,https://grist.org/accountability/trump-raised-8-million-for-helene-survivors-where-did-it-all-go/,"It raised $130 million in the wake of Helene, and hundreds of millions more for other disasters this year alone.
North Carolina-based Samaritan’s Purse received $5.2 million, which its representatives said went toward Helene aid but did not elaborate when asked.
In many cases, faith-based disaster relief groups coordinate with local churches, which serve as ready-made response hubs.
“Private aid organizations were really concerned with separating the deserving poor from the undeserving poor,” Greene, who is from Helene-impacted Mitchell County, North Carolina, said.
While Samaritan’s Purse is a disaster relief group that Smith trusts, a linked group, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, is registered as a church.","On a dusty, warm day last October, nearly a month after Hurricane Helene tore across the southeastern United States, Donald Trump stood behind a podium in Swannanoa, North Carolina, to pledge funding and support to survivors of the disaster.

“In the wake of this horrible storm, many Americans in this region felt helpless and abandoned, and left behind by their government,” Trump, still a presidential candidate at the time, said. “And yet in North Carolina’s hour of desperation, the American people answer the call much more so than your federal government.”

Trump was present to, among other things, deliver an update on a GoFundMe set up by his presidential campaign for those impacted by Helene. In three short weeks, the drive had raised $7.7 million from the pockets of ordinary Americans, prominent Republican political operatives, and some of the country’s most influential and wealthiest families.

“My prayers and encouragement goes out to all the victims,” one donor commented on the fundraiser’s public wall roughly a year ago. “I hope you know that we all love you.”

It wasn’t until a few days after money had begun to come in that the crowdfunding effort announced where the contributions were going: Mtn2Sea Ministries, Water Mission, Samaritan’s Purse, and the Clinch Foundation. On October 21, an additional recipient, Sweetwater Mission, was added. Four of the five organizations are faith-based Christian charities. Most of them have close ties to Trump or to prominent supporters of his.

Though political candidates have used GoFundMe to cover campaign costs, campaign finance and philanthropy experts told The Associated Press in October that a presidential candidate had never before used the platform in this way.

GoFundMe has become a central artery of immediate relief for disaster survivors. It raised $130 million in the wake of Helene, and hundreds of millions more for other disasters this year alone. But for all the good it does, critics have long lamented its layers of financial opaqueness. As a private platform, GoFundMe is not subject to public records requests. Anyone can set up a fundraiser, and although the site has an accountability team and lets users flag fraud, scams still happen — including those exploiting disaster victims. The platform has exploded in popularity and raised $30 billion since 2010, with significant growth in the last five years. Still, its lack of a more specific annual fundraising breakdown has prompted calls for further data transparency. The nonprofit’s annual report breaks down how much was raised for individuals and nonprofits, total number of donors, and average donation amounts, among other statistics. It also highlights certain large fundraising moments, such as Helene. But it doesn’t break down total donations by category, nor does it discuss how many campaigns hit their targets or delivered on their promises.

GoFundMe isn’t the only crowdfunding platform out there, either. There’s Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Fundable, Donorbox, and others, though many work better for small businesses and nonprofits; GoFundMe was ranked by one site as the best for personal fundraisers. Other charities and funding organizations support specific populations, like Baby2Baby, which allows donors to give to parents with young infants, or Direct Relief, which provides medical aid.

A year after Helene, what exactly Trump’s GoFundMe campaign paid for remains unclear. Grist reached out to the recipient organizations asking how much they received, and how it was spent. Several responded to an initial email and offered vague explanations, but none except Mtn2Sea Ministries responded to follow-ups for a more specific breakdown of related expenditures.

Mtn2Sea Ministries, based in St. Simon’s Island, Georgia, publicly announced and provided Grist a clear breakdown of its portion of the funds, which it used to buy $25,000 in gift cards for rural communities in Clinch County.

North Carolina-based Samaritan’s Purse received $5.2 million, which its representatives said went toward Helene aid but did not elaborate when asked. South Carolina-based Water Mission would not say how much it received, though it has published updates on its website about its work supporting communities after Helene. Sweetwater Mission, located near Atlanta, did not respond at all to the request. Grist could find no record of a “Clinch Foundation,” as the GoFundMe page called it, though it could be referring to the Clinch Memorial Foundation, in Homerville, Georgia. That group did not respond to Grist’s request for comment. GoFundMe also refused to clarify or confirm.

Trump has repeatedly used Helene as a political signal over the past year: It is time to overhaul American disaster relief, he has argued, by shrinking the role of the federal government in preparedness and recovery. If that vision comes to pass, GoFundMe and private entities like these evangelical nonprofits may play a larger role in disaster recovery, making the pathways of disaster aid harder than ever to track. Some historians and philanthropy experts warn it also may make such work — while potentially more expansive — less equitable in terms of who receives help.

Some of the recipients appear to have friendly relationships with Trump, Trump’s political supporters, or prominent Republicans. The GoFundMe campaign’s top donor is Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S. senator from Georgia, who joined Women for Trump at a Sweetwater Mission donation event in the wake of Helene. Trump later named Loeffler to lead the Small Business Administration. She did not respond to a request for comment about her $500,000 donation. The board of Water Mission, a clean water charity, is studded with prominent Christian business owners, some of whom are large Republican donors (for instance, a member of the Cathy family, which owns the restaurant chain Chick-Fil-A).

The crowdfunding campaign’s biggest recipient, Samaritan’s Purse, is run by Franklin Graham, son of famed evangelical leader Billy Graham and a strong, if complex, Trump ally. Graham traveled with Trump to survey storm damage in Georgia last September, less than a week after Helene. He then delivered the invocation at Trump’s inauguration ceremony in January, celebrating the election results with the words, “Look what God has done. We praise him and give him glory.” Four days later, he accompanied Trump on another visit to Swannanoa.

Darren Grem is a historian at the University of Mississippi who studies the ties between the political right, the business world, and American evangelism. To him, the relationships underpinning the GoFundMe campaign reflect a deep-seated political ethic that ties conservative evangelical leaders and right-wing politics together when disaster strikes. “The goal is assuaging suffering to save individuals, not fix systems,” Grem said. In the short term, disaster response is quick and expansive, with faith-based organizations fanning across disaster-impacted regions to repair homes, replace cars, and deliver truckloads of donations. In many cases, faith-based disaster relief groups coordinate with local churches, which serve as ready-made response hubs.

Humanitarian disaster aid is key to the missions of the organizations that received the GoFundMe donations — and all contributed to the recovery after Helene. If the Clinch Foundation is indeed associated with Clinch Memorial Hospital, that organization fed and housed Helene survivors. Mtn2Sea’s aid benefited some of Georgia’s hardest-hit communities. Water Mission provided water purification packets and large containers of potable water to recipients like Asheville City Schools and a church in Vilas, North Carolina (neither responded to requests for comment).

“As a Christian nonprofit organization, we believe we are called by God to serve others, and we remain steadfast in this mission, committed to carrying it out with love, excellence, and integrity while maintaining political neutrality,” Water Mission told Grist by email.

Samaritan’s Purse spokesperson Mark Barber said its $5.2 million share went into the $90-million pot the organization spent on Helene. The group, based in Boone, North Carolina, has embedded itself deeply in hurricane response and has by its own count built about 300 homes and distributed 163 campers. It has also replaced over 200 vehicles, provided household items to more than 2,700 people, and again, by its count, saved 173 souls.

Grist contacted several Helene survivors who were helped by Samaritan’s Purse, but only one responded. This person declined an interview, noting that while she disagreed with the nonprofit’s conservative values, it was building her a home and she didn’t want to upset anyone.

Grist also reached out to Meredith O’Rourke, who served as the national finance director for Trump’s presidential campaign and who set up the GoFundMe, to ask why it chose these charities. She did not respond. We also contacted the fundraiser’s top donors — Ultimate Fighting Championship President and CEO Dana White, billionaire real estate investors and Trump megadonors Steve and Andrea Wynn, New York real estate investor and current Trump Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff — to ask if they had heard how the funds were spent, and why they chose to donate to the GoFundMe rather than, or in addition to, tax-deductible charities. None responded.

But the choices aren’t mysterious to experts who’ve studied the ongoing relationship between the far right and evangelical philanthropy. Both favor smaller government and individual giving over tax-based public relief, said Alison Greene, a religious historian at Emory University.

Before the sweeping economic, social, and political reforms of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal, which were created to dig the United States out of the Great Depression, three-quarters of disaster relief went through private charities, most of which were faith-based, she said.

“Private aid organizations were really concerned with separating the deserving poor from the undeserving poor,” Greene, who is from Helene-impacted Mitchell County, North Carolina, said. The Great Depression cut so massive a swath of misery that support for federal relief ballooned. Some faith leaders and right-wing politicians opposed that, and continue to. Billy Graham, father of Samaritan’s Purse, was outspokenly among them, as are his descendants.

“Folks like Franklin Graham,” Greene added, “have this narrative that the state destroyed the work of the church.”

Despite Graham’s opposition to state disaster relief funding, his organization has received hundreds of millions of dollars from USAID and the State Department since 2016. The future of this federal funding — about 5 percent of the organization’s budget — remains uncertain, however, after USAID was more or less dismantled.

Grem, of the University of Mississippi, said the faith-based relief community’s alliance with Republican political actors has continued to advantage all involved.

“Evangelicals perfected the art of that deal long before anyone considered Donald Trump a viable political means or end,” Grem said.

First Amendment protections allow religious groups to sidestep federal oversight. Sometimes, Grem said, that’s a strength. “Such groups can quickly mobilize to provide immediate aid,” he said. Evangelical organizations also appear more culturally familiar to some of the communities they serve, and their speed is appealing to disaster survivors who just want a return to normalcy.

Without external checks and requirements, though, “they may misjudge local needs, duplicate efforts, or overlook or short-hop services,” Grem added. “The very same shortcomings often get criticized in bureaucracies like FEMA.” Long-term planning doesn’t really factor in, Grem added. Unlike the Federal Emergency Management Agency, religious charities’ work focuses on immediate needs and rebuilding houses, not long-term disaster risk and mitigation.

Though FEMA can be picky in disbursing aid, it must abide by federal civil rights law; private charities do not. Samaritan’s Purse and other religious charities have publicly opposed gay marriage and abortion. So have members of the Cathy family, who sit on the boards of many similar charities. It’s led some Helene victims to worry they might face differential treatment or judgment, or avoid seeking aid from such groups. Renters and undocumented immigrants are chronically overlooked by both public and private relief efforts.

To top it off, cash flow can be tricky in ministry groups — and things get more complicated with unusual circumstances like this GoFundMe. Warren Cole Smith, who directs the Christian aid transparency watchdog Ministry Watch, supports evangelical disaster relief but worries about the potential for financial mismanagement a GoFundMe presents.

“There are many ways to evade transparency and accountability,” he said, adding that some groups avoid filing required 990 tax forms by registering as a church even when they don’t operate like one. While Samaritan’s Purse is a disaster relief group that Smith trusts, a linked group, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, is registered as a church. Franklin Graham runs both organizations, which often deploy together into humanitarian missions.

“We think using a GoFundMe campaign in this way is not a good idea,” Smith said. “If President Trump had simply recommended these organizations, that way the organizations themselves would be direct recipients of the money … [and] individual donors could make up their own minds about which campaigns to support.”

GoFundMe, for its part, told Grist that the fundraising campaign was verified by its trust-and-safety team, a process that requires drives to “be clear who the organizer is, as well as the person, business, or charity they are raising funds for, the organizer’s relationship to the recipient of the funds, and how the funds will be used,” the organization said. If the team feels information is missing, they put the fundraiser on hold.

Since then, FEMA, though diminished, continues to make a point of opening grant opportunities to faith-based organizations and knocking down political barriers to religious influence.

The Helene campaign is closed, but some previously scheduled monthly donations continued to roll in as of July, and new donors were contributing in May. It is unclear where this new money is going, given that the last official spending update came 11 months ago. GoFundMe representatives assured Grist that the funds have all been distributed to the listed recipients.

Among the donors with messages of support was western North Carolina resident Stacie Johnson, who gave the GoFundMe $5, begging the campaign to notice her family’s plight — her father had lost his home and had no flood insurance. The same day Trump’s drive launched, on September 30, 2024, she had started a campaign for her father. But while Trump’s GoFundMe coffers grew, Johnson’s fundraiser brought in only an eighth of what her family needed. Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.

“I am curious when this money will be distributed,” Johnson wrote on the Trump drive’s page. She detailed her father’s situation before adding, “I pray that someone will see fit to help him rebuild very soon. There’s no other way than kind-hearted souls’ donations at this point.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/trump-gofundme-helene.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-24 06:59:13.498610

But the LNG industry could become a direct competitor of data centers for the U.S. gas supply.","The U.S. LNG export boom could soon face challenges by the end of the decade, both at home and on the international market.

Huge export capacity additions, mostly in the United States and Qatar, are set to tip the global LNG market into an oversupply as soon as next year, depressing prices and eating into the profit margins of the U.S. LNG exporters.

Domestically, the LNG export industry will have to increasingly compete with rising demand for gas for power generation in the United States, where natural gas is expected to meet part of the new power demand created by data centers and the onshoring of manufacturing activity.

Supply Boom

This year, American LNG developers began approving new project investments as soon as the Trump Administration lifted the pause on new LNG projects that was enacted by the Biden Administration.

So far this year, Australia’s Woodside has announced the FID for the Louisiana LNG project and plans to start production in 2029. U.S. LNG exporter Venture Global in July took FID and successfully closed the $15.1 billion project financing for the first phase of the company’s third project, CP2 LNG (CP2), together with the associated CP Express Pipeline. And top U.S. exporter Cheniere has made a positive FID for the Corpus Christi Midscale Trains 8 & 9 and Debottlenecking Project. Upon completion of CCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9, and together with expected debottlenecking and CCL Stage 3, the Corpus Christi LNG terminal is expected to exceed 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in total liquefaction capacity later this decade.

Several other projects are expected to take FID this year and in the coming years, amid a growing pipeline of proposals.

“The more US LNG capacity that takes FID, the bigger the oversupply and longer and deeper the price drop could be,” analysts at Wood Mackenzie said earlier this month.

By 2030, supply from the top two LNG exporters, the U.S. and Qatar, will surge as several U.S. projects are set to start operations and Qatar’s biggest-ever LNG expansion will be completed by 2027.

Year to date, newly sanctioned U.S. capacity accounted for 95% of all FIDs, with Argentina the only other country to have a project reached FID, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Between 2025 and 2030, a total of almost 300 billion cubic meters per year of new LNG export capacity is expected to come online from projects that have already reached FID and/or are under construction, per the IEA.

The agency noted that “This represents the largest capacity wave in any comparable period in the history of LNG markets” and excludes Russia’s heavily sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project, which has started shipping fuel to China on vessels blacklisted by the U.S. and Europe.

With all the new supply coming on stream, the global market will tip from fairly balanced this year to an oversupply of almost 50 bcm next year, and a four-times larger glut of 200 bcm in 2030, according to LSEG estimates cited by Reuters energy columnist Ron Bousso.

Despite emerging risks such as price declines amid an expected global LNG oversupply toward the end of the decade, “US LNG is still one of the hottest investments in energy,” WoodMac’s analysts noted.

The U.S. LNG exports will benefit from growing global demand, WoodMac reckons. Moreover, U.S. LNG contracts will remain commercially attractive to offtakers on a long-term basis, while a growing number of investors want a slice of America’s LNG, which is broadening access to a deepening pool of capital, according to the energy consultancy.

The case for increased LNG exports remains solid—ample supply from U.S. domestic shale gas production, growing need for U.S. LNG, especially in Europe looking to ditch Russian gas by January 2027, and a ‘drill, baby, drill’ policy of the U.S. Administration supporting increased domestic oil and gas output and overseas exports.

U.S. Natural Gas Producers Win Big in Any Scenario

The coming global LNG glut could reduce profits for U.S. exporters in the medium term, but the rise in export capacity is set to raise domestic U.S. natural gas prices. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price will rise from an average of $2.91 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in August to $3.70/MMBtu in the fourth quarter and $4.30/MMBtu next year, reflecting relatively flat natural gas production amid rising exports, the EIA forecasts.

The higher prices are likely to incentivize U.S. domestic gas production, which will be needed not only to feed LNG exports, but also additional gas-fired power generation amid rising power demand, due to the AI boom.

Natural gas producers will have demand for their output coming from both increased domestic gas-fired power and rising LNG exports. But the LNG industry could become a direct competitor of data centers for the U.S. gas supply.

Louisiana-Pacific Investment Narrative Recap

To remain confident in Louisiana-Pacific today, a shareholder must believe in the long-term growth of U.S. home construction, remodeling, and the continued conversion from legacy materials to engineered wood. The recent slide in Louisiana-Pacific’s share price and negative analyst sentiment could elevate concerns about sustained softness in near-term earnings, making volume growth in Siding and OSB the most important catalyst, while persistent demand weakness in housing remains the core risk. If these trends persist, shareholder value could be pressured, though the scale of the impact is closely tied to the housing market’s direction.

Among company announcements, the August 2025 Q2 results stand out as the most relevant, showing revenue and earnings declines over the prior year alongside reduced net profit margins. These results directly underscore why the upcoming earnings report is being closely watched, since ongoing margin compression could influence both analyst expectations and sentiment, potentially shaping how investors judge the company’s ability to weather current headwinds and capitalize on catalysts tied to product innovation and new housing activity.

By contrast, what investors may underestimate is just how much sustained weakness in U.S. housing starts...

Louisiana-Pacific's outlook anticipates $3.3 billion in revenue and $435.7 million in earnings by 2028. This is based on a projected annual revenue growth rate of 4.6% and an earnings increase of $137.7 million from current earnings of $298.0 million.

, a 18% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community show targets from as low as US$49.75 up to US$102.40 per share. While community readings span undervaluation and premium possibilities, sustained housing market softness could present a real hurdle to performance that deserves a closer look from anyone forming an outlook.

During a Grand Rapids Committee of the Whole meeting Tuesday morning, city commissioners signaled their support for the city to put out a request for proposals to pre-qualified vendors. Work has been ongoing by city officials to “streamline the project” at the former Butterworth landfill and pre-qualify 10 vendors that could take part in the development, Grand Rapids Assistant City Manager Doug Matthews said during the meeting.

The city owns about 140 acres of the 180-acre capped landfill located along the Grand River and just east of I-196. The proposed solar development would be constructed on 6 to 10 acres of the city’s property at the Butterworth landfill to be developed into solar infrastructure that would produce up to 2 megawatts of power.

“That provides all the power that we need for about 100 facilities that are connected to the primary circuit during the day,” Matthews said.

Federal clean energy tax credits the project could capture are phasing out at the end of 2026 under the massive budget reconciliation bill that Congress approved and Trump signed on July 4. Under current guidance, projects that begin construction before July 4, 2026 would have four years to be completed and still capture the tax credits, Matthews said.

“If they are started after July 4, they have to be completed before the end of 2027, so clearly we would like to take advantage of the four-year window and not the 18-month window if we can,” Matthews said.

With the city commission’s support, the city now plans to put out its RFP for the project by the end of this month. The goal is to start turning dirt at the landfill site in June 2026, Matthews said.

“We know that those tax credits for solar are in a difficult spot right now,” Matthews said. “It’s part of the reason we’re talking about this now. … The RFP responses will provide us with detail on what the potential cost impacts, or net savings might be, and we’ll factor that into our calculations in terms of our decisions to move (forward).”

Grand Rapids Mayor David LaGrand voiced support for the solar project at the meeting. LaGrand also asked if the city could potentially add a second phase to the plans and increase the scope of the solar array.

Matthews said expanding the project so an additional phase could still leverage the federal solar tax incentives is “certainly something that we can broach.”

As of last year, the city was considering up to three solar installations on the Butterworth landfill property. In addition to the 2 MW array to power city operations, officials were angling for federal and state funding for projects that serve low-income residents as well as Vicinity Energy’s downtown steam plant. The status of that funding is unclear, particularly as the Trump administration cut off a Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act solar program meant to benefit low-income residents.

Meanwhile, infrastructure work to prepare for the 2 MW project has been ongoing, including several primary circuit segment installations. As well, the city accepted a $3 million grant agreement from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy on Sept. 9 to support infrastructure work on the project.

Because of the cap on the landfill site and the condition of the property, the solar panels would have to be ballasted, which means they would be installed into concrete blocks, which is more expensive and requires more engineering, Matthews said. This was one of the reasons they went through the pre-qualification process to make sure they had a pool of vendors that could perform that type of installation, Matthews added.

If completed, the solar project would operate under a power purchase agreement, where the city would purchase the power at an agreed upon price over the expected life of the project. The developer would build and maintain the infrastructure and the city owns the land, he said.

The landfill closed in the 1970s after it was used for dumping industrial waste, leading the property to be classified as a superfund site in 1986. It was deemed fully remediated in 2000 by the EPA, which assessed the site and found it could be used for park space, parking or solar infrastructure.

Given that the EPA’s own assessment of the site recommended solar as a potential use, Matthews said the city doesn’t anticipate many roadblocks in the approval process, which would require future approvals from the EPA and a Butterworth Site Group. The group includes representation from the city as well as several private companies.

The former landfill site also includes additional space for other potential uses, including parking and park development, Matthews said. The city has been in discussions with the Grand Rapids-Kent County Convention/Arena Authority and John Ball Zoo for potentially using part of the site for surface parking for employees of the zoo and Acrisure Amphitheater, Matthews said.

“We know that has been a particular issue for those working in the service industry is the affordability of parking and working downtown and being able to get to their places for work safely,” Matthews said.

The city commission could consider a parking agreement ahead of the grand opening of the Acrisure Amphitheater in May 2026, with the first confirmed act at the venue set for May 30, 2026.

Residential solar installations increased in Pennsylvania in 2022 and 2023, according to the most recent data from the Solar Energy Industries Association.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. This the second in a series about rising electricity prices in Pennsylvania. Read the first story here.

In the steep hills above the Schuylkill River, across the street from a famous cheesesteak place and at the end of a quiet block, sits a typical Philadelphia rowhouse: narrow brick, front porch, fig trees growing in the yard. From the sidewalk, there’s nothing to distinguish this house from its neighbors. But there’s a tiny clue that something is a little different: a sticker on the electric meter with a Solarize Philly logo.

The owner, Liz Robinson, is the current executive director at the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association, a volunteer-based nonprofit that works to increase solar adoption in Pennsylvania. She’s been involved in renewable energy policy in the city and on the state level for decades. Almost 10 years ago, Robinson had solar panels installed on the roof of this house, which she bought as a rental property.

In 2010, then-Gov. Ed Rendell boasted about this Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, calling it “one of the most ambitious of its kind in America” and praising Pennsylvania as “a national leader in the field of alternative energy.” Since 2006, Rendell said, the state had made “remarkable progress,” citing growth in wind and solar generation.

“The Rendell administration did a lot of work to bring manufacturing into the state,” said Laurie Mazer, co-founder of Formation Energy, a Philadelphia-based solar developer. “There really was this moment where Pennsylvania was well ahead of the curve.”

But even as Rendell touted the state’s investment in renewable energy, the landscape was changing. In 2004, the same year the state enacted the AEPS law, drilling began on the first gas well in Pennsylvania to use hydraulic fracturing.

The fracking boom birthed a new way of thinking about energy. By 2013, in a speech about climate change, President Barack Obama was hailing natural gas as a “transition fuel that can power our economy with less carbon pollution,” phrasing that was popular in messaging on natural gas at the time. It was a “bridge” from dirty coal to cleaner renewables, a temporary solution that would lower emissions and secure energy independence.

Fifteen years later, that bridge extends endlessly into Pennsylvania’s future, with no glimpse of the other side in sight.

Natural gas production is still rising in the United States, and 60 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity generation now comes from natural gas. It’s so tied to electricity in some Pennsylvanians’ minds that they can’t imagine how the state could run without it. State Sen. Camera Bartolotta, a Republican who represents a heavily fracked district in the southwest, appears on a billboard on the turnpike with this message: “No fossil fuels, no electricity. Wake up America!”

Only 4 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity comes from renewable energy. Since 2015, that number has only increased by one percentage point, even as states such as Texas, Kansas, Iowa, South Dakota and Maine saw significant gains in renewables.

Pennsylvania now ranks second to last in the country when it comes to the percentage of its electricity generated by renewables, and in 2024, the state ranked 49th for renewable energy growth in the U.S. For utility-level solar, Pennsylvania ranked 41st, supplying just over 1 percent of the state’s electricity. For residential solar systems like Robinson’s, a separate metric from utility-level power generation, Pennsylvania is a middling 26th.

Pennsylvania’s reliance on gas is one of the problems at the root of the state’s soaring electric bills, experts say, because it means local consumers pay more whenever global gas prices go up.

In Texas, the only state that produces more gas than Pennsylvania, renewable energy’s share of the electric market has grown from 12 percent in 2015 to 34 percent in 2024. And residential electricity rates in Texas are about 20 percent lower than Pennsylvania’s, according to June federal figures.

Electricity prices in Pennsylvania continued to rise in 2025, following a sharp increase over the last few years that has hit Pennsylvania households hard. One reason for the most recent surge: data centers and the stress they are likely to put on the grid. New data centers are expected to drive soaring increases in electricity demand over the next five years, according to forecasts from Pennsylvania’s Public Utility Commission. To power them, investors want to build even more natural gas power plants.

“We have become over-reliant on gas as a transitional fuel, and we continue to argue that it’s a transition, yet we are not transitioning,” said Elizabeth Marx, the executive director at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project. “We continue to build out our delivery system for gas, and we are locking ratepayers in to pay for that system for 30 more years.”

“Clean Energy Now”

Robinson traces the origins of Pennsylvania’s failed promise as a leader in renewables to one big shift over the past 15 years.

“The change in the Republican Party is really the story here,” she said.

When she first started working in the field, moderate Republicans in Philadelphia’s collar counties were passionate advocates for conservation initiatives and open-minded about ideas like green energy. As Tea Party candidates and increasing polarization pushed this older generation of Republicans out of office, the legislature became more partisan, more contentious and less willing to compromise.

At the same time, fracking gained ground in Pennsylvania, and natural gas companies poured money into Harrisburg, both through campaign contributions and lobbying. One example: the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, spent more on lobbying in Pennsylvania than in any other state in 2022, according to a Public Accountability Initiative analysis. “There’s a tremendous ownership of politicians that goes on in Pennsylvania by the gas industry,” Robinson said.

The resulting gridlock is particularly acute when it comes to energy issues. Anything that seems to threaten the dominance of natural gas is politically doomed. From the state’s contested membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to updating the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard to legalizing community solar, efforts to make real policy changes at the state level have met with resistance.

“It surprises me, in this day and age, how many climate deniers you have in the legislature. There’s this almost visceral disdain for solar and wind,” said Rep. Greg Vitali, a Democrat from suburban Delaware County who has served in the state legislature for more than 30 years and is considered an environmental leader at the capitol. “It goes beyond an intellectual disagreement.”

Vitali, the chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, said there was effective negotiation and “give and take” when the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard passed in 2004. That isn’t happening now.

One component of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Lightning Plan for energy reform is a bill to allow community solar, where customers can buy shares in a solar project even if they can’t host panels on their own roofs. The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House in May, but it’s now stuck in the Senate, where Republicans maintain a narrow majority. Republicans have controlled the Pennsylvania Senate since 1994.

Elowyn Corby, the mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, an affordable-solar advocacy group, said this state of affairs on renewables doesn’t reflect the feelings of the public. “It’s less about what Pennsylvanians want, because we’ve seen time and time again that when asked, Pennsylvanians like renewable energy. Pennsylvanians love solar,” she said.

The state legislature’s paralysis has effectively ceded leadership of energy policy to other forces, said Mazer, the solar developer. “We haven’t played as much of a role as we could have in deciding what our energy future looks like,” she said.

There’s another kind of energy gridlock at PJM Interconnection, the company that manages the electricity grid in all or parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C. When it comes to Pennsylvania’s emphasis on natural gas generation, PJM is a significant part of the problem, said David Masur, the executive director at PennEnvironment, an environmental organization in Pennsylvania that has closely tracked the state’s lagging investment in renewable energy.

“There’s just hundreds of projects in the queue, and something like 98 percent of them are renewables,” he said.

PennEnvironment estimated that PJM’s backlog of unapproved electricity projects could cost Pennsylvanians $12.5 billion in just one year. In January, after filing a complaint against PJM, Shapiro settled with the operator to stop a rate hike that could have tripled energy prices for Pennsylvanians.

If the system were working the way it’s supposed to, more solar and wind projects would have been coming online as their costs drop compared to gas. Instead, PJM’s delays have created a bottleneck.

“New competition is being blocked by this outmoded, vastly delayed interconnection system,” Corby said. “New energy is not able to come online quickly enough to keep our bills down. PJM needs to move a lot more things through the queue a lot more quickly.”

In a statement to Inside Climate News, a spokesperson for PJM, Jeffrey Shields, said the company has reformed its interconnection process, processing 140 gigawatts of capacity since 2023, with 63 more due to be processed in 2025 and 2026. PJM blames the slowdown on permitting and supply chain backlogs, “none of which are related to PJM,” and nationwide trends that are beyond the company’s control.

“Electricity supply is decreasing while demand is increasing, primarily from data centers, not only in PJM but across the country,” Shields said.

On a rainy day in May, protestors stood in front of PJM’s headquarters outside Philadelphia. Dressed in rain slickers and clutching umbrellas, the protestors held hand-painted signs reading, “Clean Energy Now” and “PJM, lower our electric bills. Connect clean energy.”

As cars zoomed behind him, state Rep. Chris Rabb spoke to the protesters and members of the press about his bill to increase transparency in PJM’s decision-making. Rabb, a Democrat, said he believed his bill could attract bipartisan support, a rare feat in Pennsylvania’s split legislature.

“The reason I think this might have some legs is because so many of our constituents—rural, urban, suburban—are struggling to pay their utility bills. And it’s only going to get worse if PJM continues to operate in this fashion,” he said. “I think it can garner some Republican votes, because they have ratepayers, too, who are not happy about the coming hikes. People are going to be mad as hell, right? They’re going to wonder who to blame.”

Powering the future

Data centers built to power electricity-hungry artificial intelligence technology are projected to consume enormous quantities of power, and in Pennsylvania, gas producers see an opportunity to keep extending the “bridge.”

At Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick’s Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh in July, $90 billion in data center deals between tech companies and natural gas and pipeline companies were announced. These investments could lock in gas as the state’s primary electricity generator for another generation.

EQT, a natural gas company headquartered in Pittsburgh, said it would become a partner in a plan to convert the old coal-fired Homer City Generating Station into a 3,200-acre artificial intelligence campus with the country’s largest gas-fired power plant.

“This agreement ensures long-term energy security for the data center campus, while demonstrating our commitment to powering the future with Pennsylvania gas,” Corey Hessen, one of the leaders of the Homer City project, said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the costs of drilling for gas are going up. “There’s a slowing of production growth happening here in the United States, and the so-called shale revolution is in the later innings,” said Trey Cowan, an oil and gas energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “It’s getting more and more expensive to drill.”

It’s also getting more expensive to build natural gas power plants, said Sean O’Leary, senior researcher in energy and petrochemicals at the Ohio River Valley Institute: “The cost of building a gas-fired power plant has gone up by about two-and-a-half times.”

That could pose problems if all of the gas power plants that PJM thinks it will need to meet growing demand over the next decade are built. Trump’s massive tariffs on steel are likely to further inflate costs, said Christopher Doleman, an LNG and gas specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

And the premise that the bridge was originally built on—that natural gas made sense as a transition to renewables because it emitted fewer greenhouse gases than other fossil fuels—turns out to be far more complicated than the politicians of the 2010s claimed.

Although it’s true that burning natural gas emits fewer greenhouse gases than coal, evidence is growing that its production and transport damages the earth’s atmosphere more than previously thought. Methane is a far more potent driver of global warming than carbon dioxide.

Despite all that, both Corby and Robinson see reasons for hope. One of them is residential solar systems like Robinson’s, which are small enough to bypass the clogged PJM queue.

“It can come online incredibly quickly. It also takes much less time to build,” Corby said. “That’s a really intuitive and easy place to look, where we would see the results quickly.”

More Pennsylvanians are clamoring to install solar panels of their own, especially as electricity prices go up. Residential solar installations increased in Pennsylvania in 2022 and 2023, according to the most recent data from the Solar Energy Industries Association. George Otto, a retiree in State College, said he decided to do so after years of watching Pennsylvania politicians fail to make progress on environmental or climate issues.

“It’s like pushing a rope to get those guys to move on any of this stuff. And so I figured, if we’re not going to be able to do it through them, then each of us can do what we can within our sphere of influence,” he said. “Now I’m happy to provide an example for others to look at and say, ‘Hey, this can work here.’” In addition to reducing his carbon footprint, Otto now pays nothing for electricity.

Pennsylvania has the potential to catch up on renewables, but it needs the political will. Even incremental shifts in power could do that, Robinson said. “Having the House be led by Democrats, even a one-seat majority, has made a world of difference,” she said. “If we can win the Senate, I think that changes everything.”

Corby is heartened by the state’s not-so-distant successes with renewable energy. “It’s important that we remember Pennsylvania’s ability to do good things on energy has not been exclusively on the side of fossil fuels,” she said.

“The question now is, as energy affordability and supply issues become increasingly pressing, will we let ourselves be bogged down by that history or enabled by it to lead again?”

For his part, Vitali has continued to introduce bills that could change the state’s trajectory, even if they have little chance of becoming law.

“There’s a quote I used to have [on] my desk. It said, ‘A leader should be a dealer in hope.’ I don’t feel very hopeful now,” he said. “But we try every day.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250903_robinson_529-1024x6771758705287.jpg?h=16013371&itok=CAenGr0F,N,,2025-09-24 05:58:51.576060

North America: North America’s virtual power plant (VPP) market reached a total operational capacity of 37.5 GW in 2024, marking a 13.7 % year-on-year increase, according to new data from Wood Mackenzie.

The consultancy’s 2025 North American virtual power plant market report highlights that VPP capacity grew from 33 GW in 2023 to 37.5 GW in 2024. At the same time, the number of active deployments rose sharply, from 1,459 to 1,940 – a 33 % increase. Analysts say the faster rise in the number of deployments compared to overall capacity reflects a market that has broadened rather than deepened.

“Utility programme caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at Wood Mackenzie.

The report notes that the share of VPP capacity from residential customers increased from 8.8 % in 2023 to 10.2 % in 2024. This indicates that despite regulatory barriers to small-scale power generation, interest among households is rising.

Hertz-Shargel added that while data centres are a major driver of new load, “there is an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility.”

Looking ahead, Wood Mackenzie points to regulatory pushback as a key obstacle, with utilities’ rate basing practices seen as limiting investment in distributed energy resources.

""It's a pretty exciting time for natural gas,"" Expand Energy Corporation CEO Domenic Dell'Osso said on the producer's most recent earnings call.","The energy demand from data centers is expected to double by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. But the US power grid, full of aging infrastructure, years-long connection queues, and decades of stagnant industrial development, is largely unequipped to handle that demand today.

Much of the answer may lie in ""off-grid"" power, in which data centers get energy directly from their own sources instead of waiting years to be plugged into the grid.

And natural gas is positioned to meet a large share of this demand.

""We're focused on directly powering data center facilities so that they don't have to wait for these multiyear grid expansions that, unfortunately, is what it takes in the United States,"" Chad Zamarin, CEO of pipeline operator Williams Companies, said at a conference in August.

Shares of Expand Energy (EXE), the country's largest natural gas producer, are up more than 24% over the past year. Shares of fellow producers EQT Corporation (EQT) and Range Resources (RRC) are up more than 40% and more than 13%, respectively, while Williams Companies (WMB) is up more than 32%.

Off-grid power can come from a variety of sources.

In March 2024, Talen Energy (TLN) agreed to provide AWS (AMZN) with more than 1.9 gigawatts of energy from its nuclear Susquehanna Steam Electric Station to power a data center next to the plant. And other Big Tech players have promised to find renewable energy sources, like nuclear or solar power, for their AI ambitions.

But these projects can take decades to take on line, whereas a natural gas plant can take around five years, according to Morgan Stanley. And some of these plants are already on line.

""Any market in the United States that has any significant renewables, the only reason why it works is because we've got natural gas capacity that picks up the slack when the sun sets and the wind slows down,"" Williams Companies' chief Zamarin said at a conference in September.

And natural gas is already abundant in the US, cleaner than coal, and cheaper and faster to develop than nuclear power.

In February, natural gas producer Energy Transfer (ET) signed an agreement with the data center operator CloudBurst to provide 1.2 gigawatts of off-grid power for a data center outside San Marcos, Texas. In September, asset manager Blackstone (BX) purchased a natural gas plant in Pennsylvania for more than $1 billion in a bet on future demand.

The world's biggest tech companies are also looking to broker deals for natural gas. In December 2024, Meta (META) began work on a more than 2,000-acre site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, where it will spend $10 billion on a massive data center.

In late August, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved construction plans for three new natural gas turbines that will help to provide the more than two gigawatts of power the data center is expected to consume.

""Recently announced large-scale power and AI or other data center supply deals, both in and out of basin, speak to the fundamental tailwinds to the gas macro,"" said Range Resources finance chief Mark Scucchi on a recent earnings call.

The world's biggest energy companies are also planning for a potential natural gas boom. In January, oil and gas major Chevron (CVX) announced a partnership with the investment firm Engine No. 1 to build natural gas plants throughout the country that will provide data centers with off-grid power.

""It's a pretty exciting time for natural gas,"" Expand Energy Corporation CEO Domenic Dell'Osso said on the producer's most recent earnings call.

""You have people recognizing the value that gas plays in the economy, the efficiency that gas creates for the growth in power demand, which is all tied to our growing economy, fueled by the innovation associated with AI.""

With a new hybrid model on the horizon and XC60 production beginning in 2026, the company is positioning its U.S. plant as a cornerstone of its North American strategy.
Celebrating 70 years in the American market, Volvo has already sold more than five million cars in the United States.","The Ridgeville plant, which broke ground in 2015, has become an important piece of Volvo's global production network alongside its factories in Europe and China. Since its opening, Volvo has invested around $1.3 billion in the site, equipping it with advanced capabilities for multiple platforms, technologies, and models.

Today, the plant has an installed capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year and already produces the fully electric Volvo EX90 SUV as well as the Polestar 3. Volvo's decision to add a new hybrid model reflects its strategy of tailoring vehicles to meet regional demands.

While the company has been pushing forward with electrification through models like the EX30 and EX90, it recognizes that hybrid technology remains important to U.S. customers. The upcoming hybrid, described as a ""next-generation"" model, is expected to be an SUV, given Volvo's recent move away from sedans and traditional wagons in the American market.

The Volvo XC60 joins in

Before the hybrid arrives, Volvo will begin producing the XC60 mid-size SUV in Ridgeville starting in late 2026. The XC60 has long been a top seller for the company, with over 27,000 units sold in the U.S. in the first eight months of 2025, which represents nearly 20 percent more than during the same period in 2024. By shifting XC60 production to South Carolina, Volvo aims to better serve the American market while boosting factory utilization. The 2026 version of the XC60 has already been refreshed with styling updates such as a redesigned grille, new wheels, and an updated 11.2-inch touchscreen.

Adding the XC60 to the U.S. production line will help balance supply and demand more effectively and ensure faster delivery to American customers.

Volvo executives see the Charleston-area plant as central to their future growth in the region. ""The Charleston plant is foundational to our strategic growth plan for the U.S.,"" said Luis Rezende, president of Volvo Cars Americas.

South Carolina officials welcomed the announcement, pointing to the state's growing reputation in the automotive sector. Governor Henry McMaster praised the decision, saying it ""highlights the strength of our workforce and the confidence the world's top companies have in our state.""

Volvo's long-term goal is to fully utilize Ridgeville's production capacity while balancing global electrification goals with regional preferences. With a new hybrid model on the horizon and XC60 production beginning in 2026, the company is positioning its U.S. plant as a cornerstone of its North American strategy.

Naperville’s contract with its longtime power supplier IMEA expires in 2035, but the agency wants to extend its contract with the city and other municipalities until 2055.
Should the city enter into a new contract with the agency, the RFP will allow the city to identify potential clean energy vendors to supplement energy from IMEA.
Proposals from potential clean energy vendors are due by Oct. 29.
“The objective of this solicitation is to secure a reliable, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable energy supply that aligns with Naperville’s commitment to transitioning to clean energy,” the city document states.","Naperville is soliciting bids from potential clean energy vendors as it continues to negotiate a new energy contract with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency.

The request for proposals (RFP)comes about a month after the council voted to allow city staff to negotiate with IMEA on a number of key contract points, many of which revolve around lowering Naperville’s carbon footprint. One of the provisions would allow the city to seek bids for non-fossil fuel energy options.

Naperville’s contract with its longtime power supplier IMEA expires in 2035, but the agency wants to extend its contract with the city and other municipalities until 2055. Critics say IMEA is too reliant on electricity produced by coal.

The current contract does not allow the city to procure energy from other sources, but IMEA members who sign a new 20-year agreement with the nonprofit joint action agency can utilize a Member Directed Resource (MDR) allocation to procure a percentage of their energy needs from a renewable or cleaner energy source, according to a city document on the RFP.

“If Naperville enters into the new contract with IMEA that begins in 2035, it is anticipated that the IMEA Board of Directors will consider including existing nuclear within the definition of MDR and would authorize Naperville to amend its existing contract so as to begin utilizing MDR as soon as January 1, 2026,” according to the document.

Should the city enter into a new contract with the agency, the RFP will allow the city to identify potential clean energy vendors to supplement energy from IMEA. Some of the eligible options include nuclear, wind, solar, hydro and geothermal energy sources.

As for capacity and delivery requirements, energy delivery must start no later than June 1, 2026. The city wants to pay only for capacity and energy delivered, among other conditions.

Proposals from potential clean energy vendors are due by Oct. 29.

“The objective of this solicitation is to secure a reliable, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable energy supply that aligns with Naperville’s commitment to transitioning to clean energy,” the city document states.

It is currently unknown whether Naperville has received any bids. City spokesperson Linda LaCloche said the city does not share information during an open RFP process to ensure “bids, proposals and related preparatory materials remain confidential until the process concludes.”

At the Sept. 16 council meeting, Naperville’s electric utility director Brian Groth said IMEA is evaluating the city’s contract proposal.

“We provided some sample language to IMEA. They are still reviewing it,” Groth, who also serves as vice chairman of IMEA’s board of directors, said. “We expect them, over the next few weeks, to come back with their concepts, their ideas, their feedback on what we provided them, which was language based off the nine tenants approved by council on the 19th.”

As of Sept. 22, the city did not have an update on the status of its negotiations with IMEA, LaCloche said.

High-purity CO2 for the food industry as an additional source of income

Prototype for the Flexpower Plus solution from Landmark, Rolls-Royce and ASCO

Rolls-Royce, energy services provider Landmark and carbon dioxide specialist ASCO have teamed up to commission a 10-megawatt gas engine power plant with a carbon capture system in the United Kingdom. Located in Worksop in the East Midlands region, the first tankers carrying purified and liquefied CO2 have already been picked up from the site for use in the food industry to carbonate beverages such as beer and lemonade.

The CO2 is extracted from the exhaust gases of the mtu gas engines - captured by a recovery system - processed, and liquefied. The plant will capture up to 30,000 tons of CO2 per year. The power plant feeds electricity into the grid for around 10,000 households and helps to ensure its stability. The heat produced by the combined heat and power mtu plants will be used both for carbon capture processes and to supply heat to households in the surrounding area.

“Flexible carbon capture gas engine power plants are an important technology for ensuring a stable decentralized energy supply while reducing CO2 emissions” explained Michael Stipa, Senior Vice President Business Development and Product Management Stationary Power Solutions at Rolls-Royce Power Systems. “This plant in Worksop is a great example of the future of sustainable energy and of a successful partnership between technology companies that want to make a difference.”

Rolls-Royce has supplied six highly efficient combined heat and power plants based on mtu Series 4000 L64FNER gas engines for the power plant in Worksop and will ensure the reliable operation of the plant for ten years under a maintenance contract.

ASCO Carbon Dioxide Ltd. is responsible for the carbon capturing and processing plant and ensures the production of high-purity carbon dioxide. The UK-based power generation company Landmark Power Holdings Ltd. has developed and will operate the power plant.

The project is a joint venture with Victory Hill, a specialized investment company for sustainable energy infrastructure.

The Worksop facility is the first project under the FLEXPOWER PLUS™ concept developed by Landmark Power Holdings, which is designed for flexible power generation using mtu gas engines with improved energy efficiency and ASCO CO2 recovery technology. The partnership focuses on the development and distribution of scalable containerized solutions for clean power and heat generation that integrate carbon recovery technologies. With these solutions in line with the Rolls-Royce strategy the company helps its customers to reduce emissions, conserve resources and remain competitive.

“The captured CO2 is an additional source of revenue and a valuable resource for various industries, including food products, synthetic fuels, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and more,” said Ralph Spring, Managing Director of ASCO Carbon Dioxide Ltd. “Carbon capture is one of the key technologies for the energy transition and will play an even more central role in the coming years as CO2 emission taxes rise, regulatory requirements increase, and mandatory net-zero climate targets come into force.”

A bunch of automakers have announced plans to stop shipping or drastically cut back on EV shipments to the US (Honda, Mercedes, others). So yes, the ones remaining might lower their prices, but you'll have much less choice, and much less financing offers.

The hidden part is that the CAFE penalties are also disappearing and that's going to have weird effects on the market. Automaker fleets have to meet minimum mpg goals, so selling EVs boosts those figures up so that they can sell gas guzzlers that bring the numbers down. So let's say the target MPG for 2025 is 40mpg for example, if you sell an EV with 100mpge and a gas guzzler at 20mpg, then your fleet mpg would be 33.3MPG, and then you pay Tesla ~$2000 for 133 credit units and you're up to the 40MPG fleet compliance amount.

If you didn't sell the EV at all, and paid Tesla only, and sold that 20mpg car, you'd have to buy 20k credits, or $3000. But the problem is that if all the manufacturers do this, Tesla only has so many credits, so the math isn't simply 'oh, well then just pay the extra $1000 rather than taking a $10k loss on an EV'. If all the manufacturers did this, not only would Tesla run out of credits, but also the price would go through the roof.

It's hard to put a precise dollar number on it, but this offsetting is a huge benefit to some manufacturers like Ford that pretty much only sell gas guzzlers (outside the Mach E and the Maverick). There is no longer an incentive for manufacturers to produce these EVs to lower their fleet mpg.

I think this might actually be the bigger story. Between the two effects, it's not unreasonable that manufacturers might lose the $7500 as well as let's say a $10k benefit per EV for CAFE compliance, and that would hugely sway the decision making on something like a $50-70k Ford Mustang Mach E for example.

I think we might very quickly see that new choices are going to dwindle real fast.",,N,,2025-09-24 04:58:29.569346

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","WASHINGTON — Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.",https://media.whas11.com/assets/CCT/images/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71/20241126T221110/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 03:00:29.330905

For clean energy proponents, the message is a clear and concerning one.","In his sprawling address to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Donald Trump attacked both climate change initiatives and clean energy. He called into question the scientific consensus on the topic and the economic viability of clean energy programs. The speech marks one of his most forceful rejections of climate policy since returning to office.

Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” declaring that many predictions by the UN and other international bodies were wrong, made “by stupid people that have cost their country’s fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success.” He derided renewable energy as ineffective, expensive, and a financial drag, calling it a “joke”.

The President zeroed in on Europe and wind turbines in particular, claiming the continent was being “devastated by energy and immigration”. He described windmills as “pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate” before referring to them as ""the most expensive energy ever conceived.""

His rhetoric stood in sharp contrast with international trends and the UN’s broader stance on clean energy. Secretary-General António Guterres, among others, has repeatedly urged nations to accelerate investment in renewables. Meanwhile, wind and solar power are becoming more cost-competitive and are major drivers of new electricity generation worldwide.

Critics say Trump’s claims about renewable energy are misleading. Independent fact-checkers note that while renewable energy infrastructure does require upfront capital, long-term costs have been declining, and many regions have already seen meaningful returns and emissions reductions. They also point out that calling climate science predictions “stupid” and describing green energy as a conspiracy ignores the mounting empirical evidence of climate change and its impacts.

From an oil and fossil fuel perspective, Trump’s speech underscores a clear policy orientation: to re-prioritize traditional sources such as oil, gas, coal, and even nuclear power over clean energy.

Clean energy stocks and ETFs traded lower following the speech, reflecting concern about regulatory and policy headwinds. For countries leaning heavily toward green energy, the warning from the U.S. may add political uncertainty, especially in sectors where technology, subsidies, and regulatory support are key.

The energy market observers, this latest speech confirms the Trump administration's commitment to put traditional energy at the center of its energy policy. For clean energy proponents, the message is a clear and concerning one.

A Turning Point for U.S. Nuclear Fuel Recycling?
Momentum for nuclear recycling has soared in recent months, driven by explicit federal policy shifts, including the May 2025 executive orders.","Advanced nuclear technology firm Oklo has broken ground on its inaugural 75-MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor at an Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site. The project—one of three awarded to the company under the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) newly established Reactor Pilot Program—is targeting operations between late 2027 and early 2028, though that timeline is contingent on regulatory approvals and construction progress.

Oklo on Sept. 22 celebrated groundbreaking for its INL project—which it now calls “Aurora-INL”—noting the milestone stems from a concerted effort spanning five years. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo.

The milestone follows Oklo’s Sept. 5 announcement that it will design, build, and operate America’s first privately funded nuclear fuel recycling facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. As part of that effort, the company is also exploring a pioneering collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to recycle the federal utility’s used fuel inventory. If realized, that initiative could mark the first time a U.S. utility has pursued recycling its own spent fuel into new clean electricity.

Aurora-INL—Oklo’s First Commercial Reactor—Breaks Ground

Santa Clara, California–headquartered Oklo’s efforts are embedded in its vertically integrated approach, which includes advanced nuclear power generation through its Aurora powerhouses—a 50 MWe to 75-MWe liquid metal-cooled, metal-fueled fast reactor technology—fuel recycling, and radioisotope production. The company has recently reported gains toward first commercial deployments across all three business segments.

Construction activities at its first commercial reactor project—Aurora-INL—follow substantial preconstruction work, including site mobilization, early procurement, and groundwork, and are ongoing, set under a master services agreement with Kiewit, its lead constructor.

The Aurora-INL features a 50-75 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor that builds directly on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which operated successfully at the same Idaho site from 1964 to 1994. The powerhouse will use liquid metal sodium coolant and metallic fuel in a fast neutron spectrum design that enables inherent and passive safety features to significantly reduce the number of safety-grade systems required compared to traditional light water reactors, Oklo has said.

The design philosophy, notably, allows the reactor to utilize a diverse fuel portfolio including fresh high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), downblended government stockpiles of uranium and plutonium-based materials that don’t require enrichment, and eventually recycled nuclear fuel. Oklo has said the reactor leverages over 400 reactor-years of proven liquid metal fast reactor operating history worldwide.

While the Aurora-INL is effectively Oklo’s first build, the company has also noted that the project will focus on cost efficiency and speed of deployment through strategic supply chain choices. “Roughly 70% of our powerhouse components are sourced from non-nuclear supply chains, industrials, energy and chemicals, for example,” said DeWitte during the company’s second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 11. “These sectors offer mature, scalable manufacturing capabilities that we can tap into today at lower cost and with shorter lead times than traditional nuclear fabrication.”

Oklo has structured the project around “standardized shippable components like the reactor module, steam generators, and power conversion system” to “simplify installation, support parallel builds and minimize on-site construction complexity,” while designing for “inherent and passive safety” to reduce “the number of safety-grade systems” and “streamline procurement,” DeWitte said. He pointed to the company’s “preferred supply agreement with Siemens Energy” as “a great example of this strategy in action,” noting that Oklo continues to expand the supplier ecosystem “with more partnerships to come as those deals reach commercial readiness.” The company has also tapped engineering giant Kiewit under “a master services agreement” covering “the full scope of design, procurement and construction for the Aurora-INL project,” he said.

Several more reactor projects could follow. Oklo recently broadened its 14-GW pipeline with a partnership with Liberty Energy to launch an integrated gas-to-nuclear power solution, a Notice of Intent to Award from the U.S. Air Force for the first advanced fission deployment at a military installation, and agreements with Vertiv to co-develop data-center power and cooling systems, as well as with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power to explore global project development.

The Regulatory Road

So far, Oklo has made substantial regulatory progress across multiple fronts, including to complete Phase 1 of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC’s) readiness assessment for Aurora-INL’s combined license application (COL) under Part 52. Unlike the traditional Part 50 approach that involves two steps: the filing and approval of a construction permit followed by the filing and approval of an operating license, the company is pursuing Part 52 licensing because it “enables greater deployment speed and repeatability for companies like Oklo that plan to design, construct, and operate their own facilities,” with “the first combined license application serv[ing] as a reference, which can then be reused to reduce the scope of subsequent applications,” the company says in a regulatory dashboard on its website.

“Oklo is pioneering this approach in the advanced nuclear industry: it remains the only advanced reactor company to submit a combined license application and the first to have that application accepted for review,” it notes.

In August, however, the DOE selected the company for three projects of 11 selected under its new Reactor Pilot Program—two awarded directly to Oklo and one to its radioisotope arm, Atomic Alchemy—which seek to reach criticality of at least three advanced reactor concepts outside national laboratories by July 4, 2026.

A key facet of the program is that it allows private developers to build and operate reactors using DOE-issued permits rather than NRC licenses. The program leverages the DOE’s authority under the Atomic Energy Act to exempt reactors built “under contract with and for the account of” the department from traditional NRC licensing requirements.

DeWitte in August noted that President Trump’s May 2025 executive orders are “setting the stage for completely different licensing pathways” where “there is a path potentially to having a regulatory review done under the DOE, build the plant, turn it on,” which could “accelerate timelines considerably” as an alternative to the traditional NRC route. For Oklo’s Aurora-INL project, that aspect potentially creates optionality while the company continues pursuing its NRC combined license strategy.

Notably, the NRC recently revised its Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA) milestones to align with the 12- and 18-month periods cited in Executive Order 14300 (Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission), establishing 18 months for all reactor licenses under Part 52. (The measure, which took effect on May 23, also set various 12-month targets for license amendments, renewals, and other regulatory activities.)

In tandem, the company is also progressing on the Aurora-INL Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F), which is currently funneling through the DOE’s safety analysis process—including completion of its conceptual safety design and ongoing development of the preliminary safety analysis. The facility will fabricate fuel for Oklo’s Aurora-INL powerhouse, which requires high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU). Oklo plans to source five metric tons of HALEU from the former EBR-II reactor.

“The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F,” Oklo noted on Monday.

Oklo Unveils Nation’s First Private Nuclear Fuel Recycling Facility, Eyes TVA Used Fuel Partnership

The Aurora-INL groundbreaking, meanwhile, comes on the heels of Oklo’s plans unveiled on Sept. 5 to design, build, and operate America’s first privately funded nuclear fuel recycling facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The company said the initial phase of that facility had secured $1.68 billion in investment, which would bolster its construction and potentially position it to begin producing fuel in the early 2030s.

Earlier this month, Oklo also noted it is in early discussions with the federal corporation TVA to recycle the utility’s used nuclear fuel at the new facility, while also exploring potential power sales from future Aurora powerhouses into TVA’s service territory. If realized, the collaboration could mark “the first time a U.S. utility has explored recycling its used fuel into clean electricity using modern electrochemical processes, turning a legacy liability into a resource while creating a secure fuel supply for the future,” Oklo said.

The Tennessee nuclear fuel recycling facility, which is slated to mark the first commercial-scale deployment of electrochemical recycling technology in the U.S., will “recover usable fuel material from used nuclear fuel and fabricate it into fuel for advanced reactors,” including fast reactors like Oklo’s Aurora powerhouses. “This process can reduce waste volumes for more economical, clean, and efficient disposal pathways,” the company said.

Oklo has made some gains in demonstrating its pyroprocessing technology, including a successful end-to-end recycling process with Argonne National Laboratory in July 2024. Essentially, Oklo’s pyroprocessing process will involve converting spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from light water reactors (which is in the form of ceramic oxide) to a metallic form. The initial preparation step removes the oxygen and prepares the fuel for the electrochemical separation. The metallic spent fuel is then placed in the molten salt environment, to which an electrical current is applied. The electrorefining process selectively separates the different components of the spent fuel, including the uranium, transuranic elements (such as plutonium and minor actinides), and fission products, including a range of radioisotopes.

In tandem, Oklo has been investigating the potential to harvest the valuable radioisotopes through its strategic subsidiary, Idaho-based Atomic Alchemy. Atomic Alchemy—also a selection under the DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program—has already begun site characterization work on a commercial isotope production facility at INL and has submitted a materials license application to the NRC for its demonstration facility, which will produce revenue-generating isotopes as an early step toward commercial operations. The subsidiary is also developing the Versatile Isotope Production Reactor (Viper), which it says is designed as a cost-effective approach to radioisotope production. DeWitte has compared the technology to “a Ford F-150 version of a reactor that does the job” rather than “a custom Formula 1 race car.” It will allow the company to “make neutrons more cheaply than maybe anything else to irradiate these materials and produce them,” he said.

A Turning Point for U.S. Nuclear Fuel Recycling?

The launch of the Tennessee facility signals a major shift for the U.S. nuclear policy and industry, which has grappled with an impasse on SNF disposal alongside a looming shortage of HALEU fuel needed for advanced reactors. According to the DOE, over 95,000 metric tons of SNF are safely stored across 79 sites in over 30 states.

As POWER recently reported, while nuclear fuel recycling is not new, previous efforts to establish nuclear fuel recycling in the U.S., dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, faltered owing to regulatory, political, and economic hurdles and suffered a setback when President Carter indefinitely deferred commercial reprocessing in 1977. Momentum for nuclear recycling has soared in recent months, driven by explicit federal policy shifts, including the May 2025 executive orders.

At the same time, recycling prospects are looking more attractive, underpinned by soaring demand for HALEU from advanced reactors, billions in private-sector investment in new demonstration plants, technological advances that cut recycling costs and enhance proliferation resistance, and active NRC engagement on regulatory pathways. Generally, recycling prospects are also riding on a reframing of SNF as a high-value resource capable of supplying vast energy while slashing waste volumes are collectively driving nuclear fuel recycling forward in the U.S.

Policy Shift, Private Sector Drive Put Nuclear Recycling Back on the Table. In-depth POWER coverage from its September 2025 issue on how new federal support and private ventures are reviving interest in closing the fuel cycle.

U.S. Spent Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing May Be Making a Comeback—Here’s Why. A look at the history, economics, and evolving strategies shaping reprocessing efforts in the U.S.

In August, DeWitte noted that recycling offers a “massive reserve of material” since “used fuel is effectively 90-plus percent unused fuel. “ When combined with Oklo’s fast reactor technology, it enables “a very cost-transformative” approach where “the actual fuel produced from recycling will be a much lower cost than fresh fuel, like considerably less,” he said. Government stockpiles of downblended uranium and plutonium-based materials alone “could be made into fuel for more than 3 GW of powerhouses” without requiring additional enrichment, he said.

“Fuel is one of the most important inputs for advanced nuclear, and it’s one of the areas where Oklo has built a significant strategic advantage,” he explained. “Our design enables a differentiated fuel strategy built around three complementary sources: access to government stockpiles, commercial supply partnerships, and long-term recycling capabilities. This approach provides greater flexibility, cost control, and resilience than traditional fuel models.”

While the DOE in 2019 awarded the company 5 metric tons of HALEU for its first INL powerhouse, “we’re uniquely positioned to utilize additional government fuel stockpiles made available under recent executive orders, including enriched uranium and plutonium-based materials that don’t require further enrichment,” DeWitte said. “These stockpiles, effectively waste materials that would otherwise be destined for costly disposal programs can instead be turned into a productive asset for clean energy by Oklo.”

Second, Oklo is “working with enrichers such as Centrus and Hexium to meet both near-term and long-term commercial HALEU needs,” DeWitte said. The company has a signed memorandum of understanding with Centrus, which is “currently the only domestic producer of HALEU,” to supply Oklo powerhouses for early deployment. At the same time, Oklo is collaborating with Hexium to explore a laser-based enrichment method—atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS)—that DeWitte said “has the potential to significantly change cost curves” and enable “lower cost scalable production over time.” He also noted that advances in laser technology over the past 30 to 40 years make this “an interesting time now for this” approach, which could deliver “significant improvements in efficiency, cost, and operational characteristics” compared to centrifuge enrichment.

And third, “Our fast reactors can use recovered nuclear material from both today’s nuclear fleet and future advanced reactors, positioning us to recycle fuel over time and build a vertically integrated long-term supply model,” he said. “Together, these efforts form a comprehensive and resilient fuel strategy, one that supports near-term deployment, while building long-term supply independence.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/oklo-snow-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 04:59:36.200306

Hulac,,,,,https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2025/09/trump-moves-to-gut-us-power-to-regulate-greenhouse-gases/,"WASHINGTON — Cutting against overwhelming scientific evidence, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate the legal foundation that empowers the U.S. government to regulate greenhouses gases, which warm Earth to a perilous degree.
The agency this week closed the public comment period for the proposal, which is not finalized and will likely face legal challenges in federal court.

“It is clear that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, both now and in the future.","WASHINGTON — Cutting against overwhelming scientific evidence, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate the legal foundation that empowers the U.S. government to regulate greenhouses gases, which warm Earth to a perilous degree.

The Environmental Protection Agency this summer moved to revoke its own authority to regulate the six primary heat-trapping gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, a highly potent gas that seeps from natural gas infrastructure. The agency this week closed the public comment period for the proposal, which is not finalized and will likely face legal challenges in federal court.

This attempt is the first time the EPA has tried to roll back the authority, called the “endangerment finding,” since its establishment in 2009 after

“For over a decade, the EPA has acknowledged that greenhouse gases are irreparably warming our climate and harm our communities,” New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said Monday. “We will fight this dangerous action and protect our communities.”

Platkin and 22 other attorneys general, plus cities and counties, submitted a letter Monday to EPA, arguing the agency’s move is illegal and built on bad science.

In a separate request, all 11 Democratic members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation urged EPA to drop its “dangerous” proposal

request.

A repeal of the 2009 legal authority, which allows EPA to regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act, would deal a punishing and expansive blow to federal efforts to limit emissions from power plants, automobiles and industrial sources of carbon pollution.

Under presidential administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, the EPA invoked the finding, saying that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and could be regulated under the Clean Air Act, to limit emissions from vehicles, power plants and industrial sites.

If the legal authority is revoked, federal administrations would be blocked from using that law to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

“Repealing the endangerment finding would go against science and EPA’s core mission to protect public health and the environment,” Callie Sharp, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a nonpartisan environmental law group, told EPA officials in August at a hearing.

“It is clear that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, both now and in the future. Those dangers will worsen if the EPA chooses to destroy its own policy tools to meaningfully address climate change,” the Democratic lawmakers said, noting New Jersey’s exposure to extreme flooding due to sea-level rise.

“New Jerseyans know all too well the devastating impacts of the worsening climate crisis to our cities, coastlines, and communities,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th), while Rep. Rob Menendez (D-8th) said EPA should “reverse course on this dangerous proposal” and recommit to doing the important, science-based work that the American people rely on, protecting all of us from worsening natural disasters, extreme heat, and floods.”

Both men sit on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has EPA jurisdiction. Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-7th) is also a committee member.

On Sept. 17, the National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a study that found the scientific proof that humans are placing current and future life at risk by burning fossil fuels — the core scientific fact of climate change — is rock solid.

“This study was undertaken with the ultimate aim of informing the EPA, following its call for public comments, as it considers the status of the endangerment finding,” said Shirley Tilghman, professor of molecular biology and public affairs, emeritus, and former president, Princeton University, and chair of the committee that wrote the report.

When he announced in July the move to attempt to rescind the finding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, a former Republican congressman from Long Island, called the decision “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” Zeldin said in July as he announced the proposal at an Indiana car dealership.

President Donald Trump has for years cast doubt on established climate science, and his administration has proposed deep budget cuts for the EPA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA — 55%, 27% and 24%, respectively. Together, those departments perform some of the world’s most advanced climate science.

The Trump administration and Republican allies in Congress have taken a series of steps to weaken climate programs and pollution regulation, including allowing two New Jersey medical plants to pollute more, scores of industrial sites to release more hazardous air pollutants and to block New Jersey vehicle rules.

To bolster its case to end the 2009 holding, the result of a 2007 ruling from the Supreme Court that forced the U.S. to regulate carbon dioxide and other pollutants, the Trump administration has leaned on a recent Energy Department report that found human climate change is “less damaging economically than commonly believed.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, an executive from the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, industry — a section of the oil and gas business — picked the authors of that report, which dozens of scientists debunked.

In their rebuttal, more than 85 scientists, including Pamela McElwee of Rutgers University, said “key assertions – including claims of no trends in extreme weather and the supposed broad benefits of carbon dioxide—are either misleading or fundamentally incorrect.”

“As someone who works on biodiversity and ecosystems, a glaring omission of the report is the complete absence of any review of the data indicating our natural world is rapidly changing in response to climate change,” McElwee said in a statement. “Rising temperatures and more frequent extreme events like marine heat waves, among other impacts, are changing where species live, their population sizes, and when they hibernate or migrate.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2021/04/Chimney-pollution-smog-climate-change-greenhouse-gas.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 00:58:34.279351

China’s accelerated clean energy transition has long been reshaping the global energy and green technology landscapes, dramatically reducing green technology costs and accelerating their uptake in other countries.
However, while ASEAN countries have enjoyed consistent and steady growth in Chinese green technology investments, NZIPL’s findings indicate that the tide might be turning.
All this signals that ASEAN might no longer be the sole preferred target market for Chinese green technology investments.
As a result, nations looking to attract Chinese green technology manufacturing capital need to appeal to those motivations.","In 2024, clean energy investments contributed approximately USD 1.9 trillion or around 10% to China’s GDP, with the sector growing three times faster than the Chinese economy overall. Furthermore, the leading investor in clean energy worldwide is now providing an opportunity for other countries to also capitalise on the economic growth opportunities of the energy transition by scaling up overseas investments in green manufacturing.

In a first-of-its-kind database that tracks the amount of green foreign manufacturing investments originating from China, researchers from the Net Zero Policy Lab (NZIPL) have found that, thanks to China’s green manufacturing boom, economies from around the world are entering the clean technology industry or advancing up the value chain. For developing nations in the Global South, in particular, this presents a significant opportunity to boost their economies, support their climate commitments and ensure access to affordable and innovative green technologies.

China’s Booming Green Manufacturing Industry Has Brought Investments to Over 50 Countries Across All Regions

According to the new China Low Carbon Technology FDI Database, “China’s Green Leap Outward: The rapid scale-up of overseas Chinese clean-tech manufacturing investments,” since 2022 alone, China’s overseas investments in sectors like solar, wind, batteries, EVs and green hydrogen have surged past USD 227 billion. Importantly, these investments have been allocated to 54 countries across every major region.

NZIPL’s database, which features 461 green technology manufacturing projects announced between 2011 and the first half of 2025, finds that investments have started surging more significantly in the past three years. Over 80% of all projects (387) have been launched since 2022. Last year saw a record 165 announced projects, with Chinese firms committing more than USD 210 billion (the high-end estimate reaches nearly USD 250 billion), or approximately 88% of total disclosed capital.

Interestingly, the database reveals that, in each year since 2022, the pledged investment exceeded the total amount committed over the entire previous decade. The researchers describe the surge of overseas green manufacturing investment as “unprecedented”.

In terms of recipient sectors, the analysis reveals that while solar dominated pre-COVID, since 2021, capital has fanned out to battery materials, full battery plants, EVs, charging equipment, wind and early-stage green hydrogen.

According to the database, over 75% of the green technology projects financed by China are in the Global South or emerging markets, with ASEAN countries home to most of them. Europe remains the key market for downstream battery investments. Other findings include the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region’s 20% jump in new projects registered in 2024.

China’s accelerated clean energy transition has long been reshaping the global energy and green technology landscapes, dramatically reducing green technology costs and accelerating their uptake in other countries. As a result, Ember forecasts that China’s fossil fuel consumption is about to peak and begin falling, triggering a global decline.

“China has opened the door to a new energy future by building electro-technologies at a vast scale, slashing costs and raising the ceiling of possibility,” notes Sam Butler-Sloss, research manager at Ember. “The consequences reach far beyond its borders, enabling the emerging market energy leapfrog and swinging global fossil fuel demand from unrelenting growth to the brink of structural decline.”

ASEAN as China’s Sustainable Manufacturing Investment Hotspot

NZIPL’s database reveals that investments in solar have dominated, with over USD 57 billion allocated to 135 overseas projects. ASEAN remains the key focus market, receiving the bulk of this capital. Indonesia tops the lists for the most projects and most capital attracted by a wide margin. Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand are also among the top five countries with the most projects.

Battery-materials manufacturing is also rapidly growing, and, with 2025 deals included, the total will surpass USD 62 billion, making it the largest single slice of China’s overseas green technology investments. ASEAN nations again dominate, with Indonesia attracting the majority of the investments due to its critical nickel and cobalt reserves.

Regarding EV manufacturing, ASEAN and Europe attract the most significant shares of Chinese capital. NZIPL’s analysis finds that the former remains the top choice due to the lower costs and preferential access to regional markets, while investments in Europe are intended to scale local capacity and meet soaring EV demand across the bloc in compliance with rules of origin.

Regarding wind, Central Asia hosts the most projects, while India also continues to draw Chinese capital.

ASEAN’s Dominance Not a Given with Other Regions Catching Up

According to NZIPL’s database, the ASEAN region has consistently been the primary destination for Chinese overseas green technology manufacturing investments, accounting for approximately half of all projects before 2024. The analysis identifies several reasons for this sustained dominance, including ASEAN’s strategic role as both a manufacturing hub and proximity to Chinese supply chains, its role as a gateway for re-exports and the local business environment, which is familiar to Chinese investors.

However, while ASEAN countries have enjoyed consistent and steady growth in Chinese green technology investments, NZIPL’s findings indicate that the tide might be turning.

In 2024, ASEAN’s share in project counts dropped to its lowest level, mainly due to growth seen across other regions. For example, the researchers identify MENA as the most notable emerging hotspot, with the number of projects there surging from almost none in 2021 to over 20% of total investments in 2024, amounting to nearly USD 50 billion.

All this signals that ASEAN might no longer be the sole preferred target market for Chinese green technology investments. Among the reasons is China’s willingness to seek diversification in the geographic distribution of its capital, as evidenced by the fact that countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus region recorded their first China-backed green technology manufacturing projects in 2024.

Another reason why other regions are quickly making ground and gaining popularity among Chinese investors is their expanding green industrial policies and strategic positioning, as the case of MENA proves.

According to the researchers, a combination of factors drives the discrepancies in project allocation across different markets, including the election of US President Donald Trump and investors’ worries about facing secondary sanctions and tighter rules of origin, tariff concerns, geopolitical tensions and differences in industrial focus.

What ASEAN Can Do to Retain Its Position as the Top Destination For Chinese Green Technology Manufacturing Investments

After analysing early 2025 data, NZIPL unveils a cooling trend in China’s overseas build-out. Despite an expected uptick in the latter half of the year, the researchers note that the overall trend signals consolidation rather than acceleration. Diving into country-specific insights reveals that, while early hotspots like Indonesia continue to enjoy a steady influx of new projects, markets like Vietnam and Thailand are seeing a drop in recent announcements.

According to the report’s authors, three main reasons drive China’s investment motivations — access to host country markets, access to third-country markets and access to raw materials. As a result, nations looking to attract Chinese green technology manufacturing capital need to appeal to those motivations. In the case of ASEAN, the key to continuing to build on its role as the dominating region for Chinese green technology manufacturing investments is in retaining its attractiveness as an export-oriented production base and further improving its FDI openness to remain a step ahead of emerging new hotspots and competitive markets like MENA. This can become possible through a series of steps, including addressing regulatory and permitting issues to ease project development and attract projects that have faced cancellations in other markets due to burdensome procedures.

In the case of Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, which host a high number of projects with overall low investment figures (mainly solar), there is an opportunity to open up alleys for manufacturing other green technologies with higher capital intensity. This is crucial since Europe and the US, which historically have been attracting high-value projects, are now seeing capital steering toward other markets such as Latam, Central Asia and MENA.

According to NZIPL, useful measures for governments receiving Chinese FDI also include introducing incentives such as tax holidays, concessional land and long-term financing, especially for capital-intensive sectors like battery technology. Leveraging resource endowments, as in the case of Indonesia, and planning for accommodating megaprojects by ensuring grid and port infrastructure, as well as talent with the necessary skills, are other crucial measures.

ASEAN has the market fundamentals, geographic advantage and a familiar and welcoming business environment for Chinese investments. Considering that the region is acting from a position of power, the key is not letting the opportunities slip. Doing so in the face of growing competition requires proactiveness — not a wait-and-see approach.",https://energytracker.asia/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Chinas-Green-Manufacturing-Industry-Brings-Massive-Investments-to-54-Countries-Photo-by-Harisankar-on-Unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 05:58:31.428662

The Horse Heaven Hills project was initially permitted by then-Governor Jay Inslee for up to 222 windmills, more than 5,000 acres of solar panels, and large battery storage facilities across 24 miles of mostly farmland from Finley to Benton City in the Tri-Cities metropolitan area, the conjoined cities of Kennewick, Pasco and Richland in southeastern Washington.

Last year, EFSEC reduced the scope of the Horse Heaven project to protect endangered ferruginous hawks and their habitat by creating a buffer zone around their nests. EFSEC also aimed to address other public concerns, such as visual impacts on the Tri-Cities skyline, wildlife migration corridors, and impacts to cultural resources.

Then-Gov. Jay Inslee then requested EFSEC to revisit these mitigation requirements to allow for a larger project, prioritizing clean energy needs over the stricter safeguards.

EFSEC approved most of the original project, nixing only about three dozen proposed turbines.

As reported by The Center Square, in December, a citizen group called Tri-Cities C.A.R.E.S., Benton County and the Yakama Nation filed separate lawsuits against the project.

Fast-forward to a meeting last week in which EFSEC members, who are mostly state agency employees, indicated they are inclined to prevent Scout Clean Energy from putting windmills, solar panels, or batteries within two miles of five ferruginous hawk nests within the center of the project zone. EFSEC has agreed on 1-kilometer buffers for 39 additional nests.

On Tuesday, Paul Krupin with Tri-Cities C.A.R.E.S. told The Center Square that while it’s encouraging to see EFSEC again potentially scaling back the project, he has not seen details of exactly what that will look like. He contends EFSEC has not addressed many of the additional concerns raised by community members, including quality of life and the anticipated loss of property values in the region.

“We don’t know what the council’s going to do. How many turbines, and where are they? They have not told us, and so we don’t know what the council is voting on, and we don’t have any way to really evaluate the true impacts,” he said. “It’s a [mysterious] process.”

Krupin added that EFSEC has failed to address firefighting concerns.

“Between Benton City and Kennewick and up in Canyon Lakes, we have fires here. We need these 727s and DC-10s, so that’s what we’re fighting for,” he said. “And if Scout gets to put those turbines on the ridgeline for 25 miles, there’s 100,000 people within four to six miles of the visual site of all these, and experts predict a 20 to 30% drop in real estate value, which will be devastating. They [EFSEC] are only listening to the governor, and the company talk about economic viability without taking economic harm into account.”

Krupin also raised concerns about a recent change by EFSEC during a June meeting. Members agreed to give Director Sonia Bumpus sole authority to approve nearly two dozen plans and projects overseen by EFSEC.

“Implementing this policy will contribute to timely completion of the plan review process and is consistent with EFSEC’s past practice of delegating certain review and approval authorities to the EFSEC Director. The adoption of this policy formalizes the delegation of this authority to the EFSEC Director and specifies the type of plans to which this delegated authority extends,” noted EFSEC Policy 16-01 document dated June 25.

“You can’t do that without going through official rulemaking,” Krupin said. “The Legislature needs to give you the authority. You can’t give that authority to yourself.”

In August, Tri-Cities C.A.R.E.S. and Friends of the Columbia Gorge filed a petition for judicial review against EFSEC over its policy change, which Krupin argued was made to expedite projects before federal tax dollars evaporate.

“President Trump came out with directives to minimize wind turbines and solar nationwide, and it basically says you have to begin construction by July 4th, 2026. You have to begin construction in order to get the tax credits that these companies need to build and operate, so they’re racing to get these things going,” Krupin said. “Now EFSEC has this new policy, and how do you think they are going to approve all these permits without any oversight whatsoever, and without any public knowledge and engagement whatsoever? I’ve never seen a process like this. I mean, never on earth did I ever imagine that I would see something like this.”

Chad Thompson, Scout Clean Energy’s media contact, emailed a July response letter sent to EFSEC, which said in part, “While ferruginous hawks are listed as endangered in Washington, they are fairly common across their range, which encompasses the western U.S. and Canada. Their rarity in Washington is a function of geography as much as anything, as they are only in the state during the breeding season, and migrate to other parts of their range during the non-breeding season.”

EFSEC responded to a question about the modified site proposal following initial publication of this article.

“Following Council discussion, staff indicated a draft resolution will be developed that the Council can discuss and vote on at a future meeting. These steps may impact the project proponent’s site map. We have not received updated site plans to reflect this discussion,” Karl Holappa, EFSEC public information officer, emailed The Center Square.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/80/f8082e7a-ced7-11ef-9444-7ba83e62af6d/67804dfa2d7ed.image.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 00:58:40.841439

Air Force Roofing founded by Joel Alcocer announced that it is now one of the few roofing contractors in South Florida qualified to install the Tesla Solar Roof a premium code ready roof replacement that generates clean electricity while delivering hurricane grade durability. The advancement positions Air Force Roofing to help Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach residents replace aging tile or shingle roofs with a Tesla Solar Roof that can cut energy bills while protecting homes to the highest industry standards.

Data backed savings made for Broward County. Fort Lauderdale households pay about $0.16 per kWh and use roughly 20,256 kWh per year. A properly sized Tesla Solar Roof can offset most or all of that usage. At today’s local rates offsetting 20,256 kWh equals about $3,240 in annual bill avoidance. Even a 10 kW Tesla Solar Roof that produces about 15,000 kWh per year would avoid about $2,400 annually before incentives. These figures reflect local EnergySage data for Fort Lauderdale and typical South Florida solar yield of about 1,500 kWh per kW year.

Federal Incentive. The Residential Clean Energy Credit (Internal Revenue Code Section 25D) provides a 30% federal tax credit for qualified residential clean energy systems including solar panels and solar roofing tiles such as the Tesla Solar Roof. This credit applies only to the solar portion of the project (panels or tiles inverters wiring and batteries if paired) and does not apply to unrelated non solar roofing materials or structural costs. The credit remains at 30% through 2032 then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring in 2035 unless extended by Congress.

Florida Incentives. While Florida does not have a state income tax credit it does provide:

100% property tax exemption on the added value of solar systems

Sales tax exemption on solar equipment purchases

This means installing a Tesla Solar Roof in Florida qualifies for both the 30% federal tax credit on the solar portion and Florida’s state tax exemptions maximizing return on investment for homeowners.

Net metering support from Florida utilities. Florida’s statewide net metering rule enables customers of investor owned utilities including Florida Power & Light FPL to receive bill credits at the retail rate for excess solar generation with FPL applying a customary 115% sizing guideline relative to past usage. Credits typically roll over monthly with annual true up practices defined by utility tariffs. These policies are important levers in achieving the projected savings from a Tesla Solar Roof.

Hurricane ready performance and Class leading ratings. Beyond energy savings a Tesla Solar Roof gives a South Florida home a fully integrated new roof replacement with Class A fire Class F wind and industry leading impact ratings supported by a 25 year product and power warranty. For homeowners replacing aging clay tile or asphalt shingles this means fewer roof penetrations than conventional rack mounted panels and a single envelope designed to handle severe weather common to Broward County.

Why now for Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach. Florida households use more electricity than the US average due to heavy air conditioning loads making the Tesla Solar Roof a targeted way to rein in long term energy costs while modernizing curb appeal. With strong sun (NREL PVWatts and Project Sunroof datasets show robust output across South Florida) and stable incentives a roof replacement that also generates power has become a financially and functionally compelling upgrade for the region.

Leadership and service. Joel Alcocer emphasized that the team’s mission is to combine precision roofing with modern energy engineering so homeowners receive one coordinated project one warranty stack and one dedicated installer. By pairing Tesla Solar Roof installation expertise with local permitting know how Air Force Roofing helps Broward County homeowners navigate product selection interconnection and utility paperwork with fewer handoffs and faster time to energy savings.

Since 2019, the US has been a net exporter of energy, with 2023 marking a record year for energy exports and peak oil production levels. But sustaining this independence in a reliable and affordable way remains a challenge.

A new report from the Committee for Economic Development (CED), the public policy center of The Conference Board, warns that rising permitting delays, global clean tech competition, regulatory imbalances, and uncertainty around tax credits could jeopardize America's energy advantage.

""Energy independence isn't just about production—it's about building a resilient, diversified energy system that can power new technologies, support exports, and meet growing demand,"" said David K. Young, President of CED. ""By modernizing infrastructure, balancing fossil fuels and renewables, and letting markets guide the way, we can keep the US secure and competitive.""

The report urges policymakers and business leaders to adopt a pragmatic, market-driven approach to energy—one that supports innovation, maintains regulatory neutrality, and leverages the full spectrum of US energy resources to strengthen long-term economic leadership.

Policy Recommendations for a Sustainable Energy Strategy

To sustain US energy independence and promote energy transmission and energy resilience, policymakers and business leaders should recognize that:

Both fossil fuels and renewables are important parts of energy independence.

The power of markets should drive energy policy as much as possible, and government should seek to interfere with or skew markets as little as possible.

Regulation should be based upon sound science, promote fair competition, and be as source-neutral as possible to permit markets to work.

As tax credits for clean energy are sunsetted, states will have an increasingly important role in promoting US clean energy industries, which preserves US jobs in these industries.

Permitting reform is essential for the modernization and expansion of the electric grid, including adding new capacity from all sources.

US business has an active and urgent role to play in leading energy innovation and growing exports of both liquefied natural gas (LNG) and clean energy products as well as promoting emissions reductions in their business interest.

The Definitive Offtake Agreement provides for the supply of up to 4,000 dry metric tonnes per annum (tpa) of battery-grade Lithium Carbonate produced at the Project, expected to commence in 2028, representing approximately 40% of the Project start-up production capacity of ~10,000tpa.

LG Energy Solution is an ideal partner for Anson Resources with its diversified customer base of tier one OEMs and energy storage solutions (ESS) and strong investment to expanding production in North America. LG Energy Solution has eight facilities currently operating or under construction in North America, with stand-alone facilities in Michigan and Arizona and five joint venture facilities with major automakers.

Signing of the Definitive Offtake Agreement with LG Energy Solution marks another key milestone for the Company's develops in the Paradox Basin. This Definitive Offtake Agreement will become effective subject to Anson Resources commencement of commercial production in the Paradox Basin and offtake product qualification with LG Energy Solution.

The Paradox Basin is a globally significant lithium asset, which the Company through its 100% owned USA subsidiary A1 Lithium, is working to develop into one of the largest lithium resources in the United States. The Company is conducting exploration and test work of the brine, that is known to exist, across multiple areas in the Paradox formation. This work is on-going and if successful will support the Company's theory that the brines of the Paradox Basin contain one of the largest lithium resources in North America.

This Definitive Offtake Agreement is also an essential part of the critical path for debt funding at the Final Investment Decision stage.

Anson Resources Executive Chairman and Managing Director Bruce Richardson commented:

""Anson is delighted to have concluded our definitive offtake agreement with LG Energy Solution for at least 40% of our production. LG Energy Solution not only has a diversified customer base of tier one OEM's they also have many energy storage solutions (ESS) customers.

Anson recognized the unstoppable paradigm shift in the US supply chain for electric vehicle battery materials and ESS and the key role that Korean battery manufacturers are playing.

This shift in manufacturing investment has led to an increased demand for lithium produced in the US, not only to shorten supply chains geographically but also increase US content of electric vehicle batteries and electric vehicles,

Anson identified this change, targeted its offtake marketing activities to the companies that have made these investments into North America and in particular, the US where Anson development work in the Paradox Basin in Southern Utah is strategically positioned.

This definitive offtake agreement establishes the foundation for a long-term partnership and we are proud that we will be supplying low cost US made lithium from the Paradox Basin to LG Energy Solution a leading global manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, mobility, IT, and energy storage systems.""

TC Energy will focus on ramping up US investments to meet soaring power demand despite signals Canada is showing a more energy-friendly stance.

“The returns we can earn in the United States are significantly more attractive than they are in Canada,” Chief Executive Officer and President Francois Poirier said in an interview during the 2025 Concordia Annual Summit in New York. “I expect that the US will continue to be where we’ll invest.”

The pipeline company is seeking to tap into a push by US President Donald Trump, who recently signed executive orders aimed at boosting artificial intelligence development in the US by loosening regulations and expanding energy supplies for data centers, amid a broader desire for US energy dominance.

TC Energy recently announced plans to invest $8.5 billion into US energy infrastructure projects planned over the next five years. Poirier also pointed to Mexico as a priority for new investment.

“We have quite a few projects on the drawing board in Mexico, which would include getting natural gas from West Texas into the Northwest part of Mexico,” Poirier said. “There’s definitely the potential to expand” the company’s Topolobampo pipeline and “connect that line to West Texas.”

Still, TC Energy remains bullish on Canada with Prime Minister Mark Carney’s decision to speed construction of a major expansion of LNG Canada, a large-scale liquefied natural gas export project on the country’s west coast.

The project, known as LNG Canada’s Phase 2, would require doubling TC Energy’s Coastal GasLink pipeline’s capacity by adding five to six compressor stations. The capital investment would total several billion dollars, according to Poirier.

Clean energy capacity alone does not guarantee resilience — trust and transparency require policy coordination and governance capability.","ASEAN’s clean energy boom is taking shape. But without coordination, the region risks being locked into low-value roles in the green economy. China has emerged as ASEAN’s largest clean energy financier and now dominates regional electric vehicle and battery markets. Yet beneath the investment momentum, policies, standards, skills development and knowledge transfer remain fragmented. A China–ASEAN clean energy–industrial mechanismcould fill this gap.

Across the region, operations such as nickel processing in Indonesia and mining in the Philippines have drawn criticism for unsafe labour conditions, community displacement and habitat loss. US tariffs of up to 3500 per cent on ASEAN solar exports imposed in April 2025 exposed how fragile regional supply chains are. Without a framework to align industrial policy, workforce upgrading and environmental safeguards, Southeast Asia risks remaining a low-cost assembly hub, dependent on external capital but unable to shape the rules of the energy transition.

For Beijing, deeper clean energy engagement with ASEAN aligns with strategic priorities such as diversifying export markets, embedding outbound manufacturing in emerging industrial hubs and locking in supply chains for critical minerals and green technologies. For ASEAN, China offers capital, technology, and scale.

ASEAN already has platforms such as the ASEAN-China Clean Energy Cooperation Centre and the ASEAN+3 Clean Energy Roundtable Dialogue, but they lack the mandate and focus to align investment, industrial upgrading and governance on a regional scale. What is missing is a dedicated mechanism to link clean energy cooperation with industrial policy — one that embeds environmental, social, and governance (ESG) safeguards from the outset.

A China–ASEAN clean energy–industrial mechanism could anchor cooperation in labour and skills development. The mechanism could convene thematic working groups, support regional training hubs and co-design curricula with industry and academia to match labour upgrading with institutional commitment to build a capable workforce with structured training programs.

The mechanism could bridge the disconnect between capital and capacity. While investment is pouring into electric vehicles and renewable projects, enabling environments remain uneven. Drawing on models such as Singapore’s FAST-P and Indonesia’s Danantara, the mechanism could link Chinese policy banks, ASEAN state-owned enterprises and global financiers to develop ESG-anchored green industrial zones that pair infrastructure with manufacturing. A curated pipeline of bankable regional projects would turn capital inflows into strategic industrial capacity.

The mechanism can also create the institutional alignment required to move from one-off projects to enduring partnerships. Clean energy capacity alone does not guarantee resilience — trust and transparency require policy coordination and governance capability. The mechanism could host Track 1.5 dialogues, enabling joint procurement reforms, decarbonisation case studies and ESG compliance workshops.

Verifiable sustainability safeguards must be continuous and enforceable, not just contractual at project outset. Improving ASEAN’s environmental record will require Chinese corporates to adopt higher operational standards, ASEAN ministries to embed clear ESG regulations and local authorities to enforce them consistently — with the mechanism serving as the channel to align and monitor these efforts.

Initial participation could focus on ASEAN members with significant clean energy and industrial cooperation with China, such as Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia, before expanding as political and market conditions allow. A smaller coalition of willing states sidesteps ASEAN consensus paralysis and gives proof of concept.

But it would need a clear ministerial mandate spanning industry, labour and environment portfolios. The mechanism could be co-chaired by a standing Chinese lead ministry and a rotating ASEAN co-chair aligned with the ASEAN Chair, ensuring continuity on China’s side and regional ownership on ASEAN’s.

Private businesses’ roles would go beyond consultation. As conveners, firms could commit capital and expertise to joint research and development, ESG compliance and local partnerships on supply chains, helping translate government frameworks into tangible industry practice and durable benefits.

For ASEAN, such a mechanism would operationalise centrality by aligning national strategies with regional goals and enabling coherent engagement with external partners. For China, it would provide a structured channel to address ESG concerns, reduce friction and ensure investments generate long-term goodwill and influence.

While the mechanism centres on China given its economic gravity, it would not operate in isolation. Japan and South Korea remain important partners whose engagement could be channelled through the existing roundtable dialogues. This would allow the mechanism to remain focused on aligning cooperation with China, while still complementing and reinforcing wider regional partnerships.",https://eastasiaforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2024-03-26T152237Z_345151988_RC2LT6AGXEA4_RTRMADP_3_TOTW-SOLAR-1024x694.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 20:59:13.378085
