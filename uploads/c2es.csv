Understanding Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV)

Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) refers to solar photovoltaic systems that are directly incorporated into the building envelope, including roofs, façades, walls, windows, and skylights. Unlike conventional solar panels mounted on rooftops, BIPV replaces traditional building materials while simultaneously generating electricity.

This dual functionality offers multiple benefits: on-site renewable energy generation, reduced reliance on external power sources, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced architectural aesthetics. BIPV systems are particularly attractive in urban environments and modern construction projects where visual appeal and sustainability are equally important.

Market Dynamics Driving Growth

The rising demand for modern and sustainable architecture is a key driver of the UK building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market. Architects and developers increasingly favor solutions that seamlessly blend renewable energy technologies into building designs without compromising aesthetics. BIPV enables clean energy generation while preserving or even enhancing the visual identity of residential and commercial structures.

Supportive government policies are also strengthening market growth. In December 2024, the UK government introduced a revised National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) aimed at streamlining planning processes and encouraging sustainable development. The updated framework simplifies approvals for new housing and infrastructure projects, indirectly supporting the integration of renewable technologies such as BIPV into construction plans.

In the residential sector, BIPV systems such as solar roof tiles and shingles are gaining popularity. These systems closely resemble conventional roofing materials, allowing homeowners to maintain architectural consistency while benefiting from renewable electricity generation. Similarly, BIPV façades and solar windows are increasingly adopted in both new buildings and renovation projects.

Cost Challenges Limiting Market Adoption

Despite its strong growth potential, the UK building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market faces challenges related to high initial investment costs. BIPV systems remain significantly more expensive than traditional construction materials and standard rooftop solar installations.

In Europe, including the UK, BIPV system costs typically range between €200/m² and €625/m², depending on design complexity and material selection. Photovoltaic modules alone account for 43% to 77% of total system costs, while balance-of-system components such as inverters, wiring, and energy storage contribute an additional 10% to 16%. Soft costs, including system design, permitting, construction, and inspections, further increase upfront expenditure.

Customized architectural designs can push prices even higher, creating a financial barrier for developers and homeowners. Although BIPV systems offer long-term energy savings and environmental benefits, the high initial capital requirement continues to restrain wider adoption across the UK construction sector.

Market Segmentation Overview

The UK building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market is segmented by technology, application, and end-use.

By technology, the market is categorized into crystalline silicon, thin film, and others. While crystalline silicon held the largest market share in 2024, the thin film segment is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 15.5% during the forecast period. Thin film BIPV systems are gaining traction due to their lightweight nature, flexibility, and ability to blend seamlessly with modern building designs. These characteristics make them ideal for façades, skylights, and curtain walls.

Based on application, the market is divided into roofs, walls, glass, façades, and others. The roofs segment is anticipated to grow at the fastest CAGR of 15.7%, driven by the large surface area available for solar integration and the practicality of replacing conventional roofing materials with energy-generating alternatives. Roof-integrated BIPV systems provide weather protection while producing electricity, making them highly attractive for residential and commercial buildings.

By end-use, the market is segmented into residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. The residential segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.6%, supported by increasing homeowner interest in energy-efficient housing and government-backed retrofit programs. Initiatives such as the UK Green Homes Grant and local authority energy-efficiency schemes are encouraging the adoption of renewable technologies, including BIPV, particularly in urban residential developments where roof space is limited.

Competitive Landscape

The UK building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market is moderately competitive, with key players focusing on innovation, customization, and partnerships with architects and construction firms. Major companies operating in the market include AGC Glass Europe, BIPVco Limited, Spirit Energy, Hanergy Thin Film Power Group Europe, Ertex Solar, Onyx Solar, Viridian Solar Ltd, Polysolar, ROMAG, and Solex Energy Ltd.

These companies are investing in advanced materials, design flexibility, and improved system efficiency to strengthen their market position and address cost-related challenges.

Future Outlook

The UK building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) market is expected to witness sustained growth over the next decade, driven by rising demand for sustainable construction, supportive planning policies, and advancements in solar technologies. As material costs decline and awareness of long-term benefits increases, BIPV is likely to become a standard feature in modern UK buildings.

With its ability to combine renewable energy generation with architectural design, BIPV represents a critical solution for achieving the UK's carbon reduction and energy efficiency targets.

Vought said the center was undergoing a ""comprehensive review"" and that any ""vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location.""
This isn't the first time the Trump administration has found itself at odds with the science community.
""Having less accurate forecasts and being more in the dark about what is coming puts lives and property at risk,"" he says.","The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development cannot impose dramatically different conditions for homelessness programs for now, according to an oral ruling Friday by U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy in Rhode Island.

McElroy granted a preliminary injunction to a group of states, cities and nonprofits who said a last minute overhaul of how to spend $4 billion on homelessness programs was unlawful. She also agreed with their argument that it likely would push many people back onto the streets in the middle of winter, causing irreparable harm.

""Continuity of housing and stability for vulnerable populations is clearly in the public interest,"" said McElroy, ordering HUD to maintain its previous funding formula.

The National Alliance to End Homelessness, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement the order ""means that more than 170,000 people – families, seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities — have respite from the government's assault.""

HUD has sought to dramatically slash funding for permanent housing and encourage more transitional housing that mandates work and treatment for addiction or mental illness. The overhaul — announced last month — also would allow the agency to deny money to local groups that don't comply with the Trump administration's agenda on things like DEI, the restriction of transgender rights and immigration enforcement.

""HUD will continue working to provide homelessness assistance funding to grantees nationwide,"" said HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett in a statement to NPR. ""The Department remains committed to program reforms intended to assist our nation's most vulnerable citizens and will continue to do so in accordance with the law.""

'Chaos seems to be the point'

McElroy expressed frustration with a series of HUD actions in recent weeks. Just hours before a Dec. 8 hearing, the agency withdrew its new funding notice, saying it would make changes to address critics' concerns. But on Friday, HUD's attorney said the new version would not be ready until the end of the day.

""The timing seems to be strategic,"" McElroy said, asserting there was no reason the document could not have been ready before the hearing. ""The constant churn and chaos seems to be the point.""

In defending the agency, attorney John Bailey said HUD was simply trying to change its policies to reflect President Donald Trump's executive orders, which he called ""legal directives."" The judge interjected repeatedly to explain that he was conflating things, noting Congress — not the president — makes laws.

'It's kind of shocking'

HUD's changes were announced in November with little notice and only weeks before local homeless service providers must apply for new funding.

""Our agencies are just scrambling right now to try to respond,"" said Pam Johnson with Minnesota Community Action Partnership, whose members provide housing and other services for homeless people. ""It also just reverses 40 years of bipartisan work on proven solutions to homelessness. So it's really, it's kind of shocking.""

For decades, U.S. policy favored permanent housing with optional treatment for addiction or mental illness Years of research has found the strategy is effective at keeping people off the streets.

But many conservatives argue it's failed to stop record rates of homelessness.

""What is the root cause of homelessness? Mental illness, drug addiction, drug abuse,"" HUD Secretary Scottt Turner said recently on Fox Business Network. ""During the Biden administration, it was just warehousing. It was a homeless industrial complex.""

Turner and others who support the changes say the goal is to push people towards self-sufficiency.

But local advocates say mental health and substance abuse are not the main factors driving homelessness.

""It's poverty. Poverty, low income and significant lack of affordable housing,"" says Julie Embree, who heads the Toledo Lucas County Homelessness Board in Ohio.

Many in permanent housing have disabilities that make it hard to work full time, she said. Embree agrees with Trump administration goals like efficiency and saving money, but says pushing people back into homelessness, where they're more likely to land in jail, the courts or a hospital, is not cost-effective.

""One emergency room visit is just as expensive as a month of sustaining this [permanent housing] program,"" she said.

In Los Angeles, Stephanie Klasky-Gamer with LA Family Housing said there is a need for more transitional housing, but not at the expense of long-term housing. And the idea that programs could simply switch from one to the other is not only unrealistic, it's illegal.

""You cannot take a building that has a 75-year deed restriction and just — ding! — call it interim housing,"" she said.

Those challenging HUD say providers who own such properties – or states who've invested millions of dollars in permanent housing projects — face ""significant financial jeopardy"" if their funding is not renewed.

In addition to the legal challenges, members of Congress from both parties have questioned HUD's sudden shift on homelessness. Advocates have lobbied lawmakers to step in and, at the least, push for more time to prepare for such a massive overhaul.

President Donald Trump said the administration has reached agreements with nine more drugmakers to bring their U.S. drug prices more in line with what other wealthy countries pay.

Fourteen companies in total have now reached what the administration calls most-favored-nation pricing deals. The companies that took part in Friday's announcement were: Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.

They agreed to charge the U.S. government no more for new drugs than the prices paid by other well-off countries. The agreements will allow state Medicaid programs to access lower prices from the nine companies. In a statement, the White House said the change will result ""in billions of dollars in savings.""

The drugmakers also agreed to invest at least $150 billion in manufacturing operations in the U.S. The president is seeking to increase domestic production of pharmaceuticals.

In addition, the companies agreed to make some of their most popular drugs available at lower prices to consumers who pay out of pocket through a government website called TrumpRx.com. The TrumpRx website is expected to launch in early 2026, and would take consumers to pharmaceutical companies' direct-to-consumer websites to fulfill orders.

For example, Merck will reduce the price of Januvia, a medication for Type 2 diabetes, from $330 to $100 for patients purchasing directly through TrumpRx, the White House said. Amgen will reduce the price of Repatha, a cholesterol-lowering drug, from $573 to $239 when purchased through TrumpRx.

In exchange for these concessions, the companies will be exempt from possible administration tariffs for three years.

The extent of savings for consumers under the agreements is unclear. Medicaid and its beneficiaries already pay some of the lowest prices for drugs. And people with health insurance could spend less on copays for their medicines than paying cash for them through the drugmakers.

Separately, Trump said during the press event that he would like to get health insurers to lower their prices, too.

""I'm going to call a meeting of the insurance companies,"" he said. ""I'm going to see if they [will] get their price down, to put it very bluntly.""

America's new top health diplomat is Bethany Kozma.

The job she took on this week — leading the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Global Affairs — does not have a high profile. And Kozma herself is not a familiar name in the world of public health.

But it is a position with power — and Kozma has a record of public statements and activism on health issues, equating abortion with ""murder"" and campaigning against gender-affirming care.

The office sometimes is referred to as the ""diplomatic voice"" of HHS. As director, Kozma will have considerable influence over how the U.S. shapes health policy in other countries in the wake of the Trump administration's foreign aid cuts and withdrawal from the World Health Organization.

Kozma declined to be interviewed for this story. She doesn't appear to have a background in global health based on publicly available information online. The HHS website offers few details about her professional profile. In response to questions about her qualifications and vision for the role, HHS responded with this statement.

""The Office of Global Affairs (OGA) advances the Trump administration's agenda and priorities by bringing common sense, transparency and gold-standard science to global partners. Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, OGA is committed to strengthening the United States' position as the global gold-standard for public health and ensuring Americans are protected at home and abroad.""

Who is Bethany Kozma?

Kozma began her career in public service during the George W. Bush administration, working at the White House Homeland Security Council. During the Obama years, she re-entered public life as an activist.

In a 2016 commentary for The Daily Signal, a conservative news website founded by the Heritage Foundation, she argued against the Obama administration's guidance that public schools should allow children to use the bathroom that comports with their identity.

""This radical agenda of subjective 'gender fluidity' and unrestricted shower and bathroom access actually endangers all,"" she stated, noting that ""predators"" could abuse the policy.

In 2017, she joined the Trump administration as senior adviser for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in the United States Agency for International Development, eventually being promoted to deputy chief of staff. In videos obtained and released by ProPublica, Kozma recalls calling the U.S. a ""pro-life"" country in a closed-door U.N. meeting about women's rights in 2018, when access to abortion still was protected nationally by Roe v. Wade.

In August 2020, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., and four other Democratic senators issued a letter labeling Kozma and several other political appointees at USAID as ""prejudiced"" and called for them to be removed from their posts. Kozma has ""spoken extensively and derisively of trans people and trans issues,"" the senators wrote.

During the Biden administration, she also was involved in Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's ""blueprint"" for a new Republican administration. She played a prominent role in Project 2025 training videos, obtained and published by ProPublica.

In one nearly 50-minute training video focused on left-wing language, she called for a Republican administration to ""eradicate 'climate change' references from absolutely everywhere,"" and said that concerns over climate change are efforts at ""population control."" She also called gender-affirming care ""absolutely infuriating"" and said ""the idea that gender is fluid is evil."" Overall, she argued that changing language around these policies should be a priority for political appointees.

Kozma joined the second Trump administration as a chief adviser at the HHS Office of Global Affairs. In September, she spoke at a U.N. event commemorating the 30th anniversary of the declaration that denying women's rights is a human rights violation.

""While many may celebrate so-called successes gained for women over the last 30 years, one must ask what defines true success for women?"" she began, adding that ""biological reality is rooted in scientific truth and is confirmed by the universal truths that we are endowed by our creator who made us 'male and female.'""

Those views can be divisive but have garnered some support for Kozma's promotion.

""Bethany is an excellent pick for global affairs at HHS,"" says Roger Servino, vice president of domestic policy at The Heritage Foundation. ""She was an early champion of protecting children from gender ideology back when the medical establishment was able to silence voices of reason and dissent and she is perfectly placed to help push back on global health bodies trying to impose left wing pseudoscience on the American people and the world.""

What will her goals be at the Office of Global Affairs?

Kozma is taking over as director of the HHS Office of Global Affairs at a time of drastic change for global health.

In previous administrations, a main focus of the office was dealing with the World Health Organization. Typically, the director, who usually has a background in public health, is involved in negotiations on sharing data for pathogen surveillance or developing vaccine policy, for example.

After President Trump withdrew the U.S. from WHO, the administration has started a new strategy: striking deals with individual countries to give health aid in exchange for their meeting certain policy prescriptions. Kozma has been involved in some of those negotiations, but the details aren't quite finalized.

Some reproductive rights advocates believe Kozma will use her new position to insert anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ policies into these agreements.

""[Kozma] is vehemently anti-trans, anti-LGBTQI+, anti-abortion,"" says Keifer Buckingham, managing director at the Council on Global Equality, a coalition of advocacy organizations that focuses on LGBTQ issues. ""For those of us who want to ensure that the provision of U.S. foreign assistance and health doesn't discriminate against people based on who they are, [Kozma's appointment] raises a lot of red flags.""

One particular worry is about the Helms Amendment, a U.S. policy that prohibits foreign aid being used to fund abortion services.

""There's been speculation that there's an intention by the U.S. government to expand the Helms Amendment beyond abortion to include LGBTQ's as well,"" says Musoba Kitui, director of Ipas Africa Alliance, a non-profit that works to provide access to abortion and contraception. He's concerned that health groups that serve those populations could lose funding. That speculation is backed up by reporting from The Daily Signal that the administration is planning to prohibit U.S. aid funding for ""gender ideology and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.""

Given LGBTQ people are often at higher risk for diseases like HIV, such policies could make these communities even more vulnerable, says Kitui.

""We could see more marginalization, inequality, spikes of infection,"" he says. While many African governments signing these deals understand those dynamics, Kitui says they may still agree to more restrictive conditions as aid cuts have ""starved health systems to a point of desperation.""

The White House plans to break up a key weather and climate research center in Colorado, a move experts say could jeopardize the accuracy of forecasting and prediction systems.

It's the latest climate-related move by President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, cut funding for climate research and removed climate and weather scientists from their posts across the federal government. During his first term, Trump famously contradicted the nation's weather forecasting service by redrawing Hurricane Dorian's path on a map with a Sharpie.

White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, in a post Tuesday on X, announced the plan to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, calling it ""one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country."" NCAR was founded more than six decades ago to provide universities with expertise and resources for collaborative research on global weather, water and climate challenges.

Vought said the center was undergoing a ""comprehensive review"" and that any ""vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location.""

Antonio Busalacchi, who heads the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a nonprofit consortium of 129 U.S. universities that oversees the Boulder facility, told NPR he received no prior notice before the announcement and believes the decision ""is entirely political.""

NCAR's job is to study both climate and weather, and Busalacchi says the two cannot be understood separately.

""Our job is to state what the science is, and it's for others to interpret what the significance of that science is,"" he says. ""We're very careful not to cross over that line to advocacy or policy prescription.""

Plan faces a political backlash

Vought's announcement drew an immediate response from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, who said in a statement that if the White House goes ahead with the plan, ""public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.""

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includes Boulder, have suggested that the proposed NCAR closure amounts to political brinkmanship by the White House in response to Colorado's refusal to release Tina Peters. Peters, a former Mesa County clerk, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for illegally accessing voting machines after the 2020 election. A Republican, Peters was recently pardoned by Trump, a largely symbolic action since she has neither been charged nor convicted in federal court.

""The judgement is that this is very much about Tina Peters,"" Bennet told local media in Colorado. ""And that the president attempted to get his way through intimidation and he hasn't gotten his way and he is trying to punish Colorado as a result.""

In a joint statement, Bennett, Neguse and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper called the administration's plan ""deeply dangerous and blatantly retaliatory.""

NPR reached out to Vought's Office of Management and Budget but received no response. The White House press office did not answer specific questions, including one asking if ""breaking up"" NCAR meant it would be closed. But in a statement, the White House said, ""NCAR's activities veer far from strong or useful science,"" adding that the center was being dismantled ""to eliminate Green New Scam research activities.""

American Meteorological Society President David Stensrud says he has used NCAR weather models throughout his career.

""I think the work that I and others have done have led to the improvements that we see [in] … weather predictions,"" he says. ""Losing that [will cause] a great deal of hurt in terms of our ability to continue to improve forecasts and the future.""

The 'beating heart' of climate and weather science

Among NCAR's many contributions, in the 1960s, it developed dropsondes — tube-shaped instruments released from aircraft, including hurricane hunters, to measure temperature, pressure, humidity and wind. In the 1980s, the center helped develop and refine technology to monitor wind shear at airports.

Busalacchi says these efforts have contributed to decades without passenger plane crashes caused by wind shear or downbursts.

""We've had zero loss of life from these weather events that can be directly attributed to our research. And that's what we're talking about losing"" if NCAR shuts down, he says.

NCAR, which employs about 830 people, is also known for developing and maintaining tools such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), which is used around the world to predict everything from thunderstorms to large-scale systems, including hurricanes and frontal systems. NCAR's Community Earth Systems Model (CESM) is also widely used by scientists, including Jason Furtado, an associate professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.

Furtado says he and his colleagues have used the model to run experiments ""to look for where in the atmosphere and ocean we get long-range signals for extreme cold air outbreaks"" such as the February 2021 event that hit the midsection of the country, resulting in sub-zero temperatures for days and the total breakdown of the electrical grid in central Texas. ""We've used [CESM] and come up with some really important research,"" Furtado says.

He calls NCAR ""a world-envied research center for atmospheric science"" and ""a beating heart for the atmospheric science community."" He says his research and that of many other scientists would simply not be possible without the Boulder center. ""In some way every atmospheric scientist has a connection to NCAR, whether they've directly been to the building or they have not,"" he says.

Ken Davis, a professor of atmospheric and climate science at Penn State, did research at NCAR from the time he was a graduate student until after his postdoc. He says NCAR plays a critical role in providing its members with cutting-edge computing resources, observational resources and scientific expertise ""which no university can provide on its own.""

""If any investigator anywhere in the country wants to request a research aircraft … NCAR will take a look at that proposal and say, 'Yeah, we can do that,' "" Davis says. ""As a university investigator, I can show up with an instrumented C-130 [aircraft] to do a whole bunch of airborne research, which would be totally impossible without this facility to support the community.""

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has found itself at odds with the science community. In April, the administration dismissed scientists working on the country's flagship climate report and then removed the report from a government website.

In 2019, Trump landed himself in a scandal known as ""Sharpiegate,"" in which he contradicted official National Weather Service forecasts for Hurricane Dorian by insisting the storm directly threatened Alabama. He later displayed an Oval Office map showing an altered storm path that appeared to have been drawn with a black marker. Earlier this year, the Senate approved the nomination of Neil Jacobs, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) official cited for misconduct related to the episode, to lead the agency.

In its 2026 budget plan, the White House has also proposed cutting NOAA's budget by about 27% and eliminating NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's core climate and weather research branch. The administration also has rolled back National Science Foundation funding for climate science.

Ultimately, closing NCAR wouldn't have an immediate impact on weather forecasting, Furtado says. Instead, he says, it would slowly erode the scientific community's ability to make further progress on understanding weather and climate.

""We can either accept the facts and work on ways to mitigate and adapt, or ignore the data and not be ready for the changing world we have,"" Furtado says.

""Having less accurate forecasts and being more in the dark about what is coming puts lives and property at risk,"" he says.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/68d8357/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F17%2Fd3%2F1ce718c34a4b8280ba0dcbfedb26%2Fla-rain.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 17:59:06.981094

The episode, which released on Monday, caught fire on social media after Talarico delivered a pointed reframing of conservative rhetoric about welfare spending. In a sharp challenge to long-standing political talking points about “welfare queens”—a term traditionally used to disparage low-income individuals receiving government benefits—Talarico flipped the script, arguing that the nation’s actual dependency on public resources flows upward, not downward.

“The biggest welfare queens in this country are the giant corporations that don’t pay a penny in federal taxes,” he said. He also extended his critique to include wealthy executives, adding “the biggest welfare queens are the CEOs who get a tax deduction for flying on a private jet.”

Corporate tax avoidance as hidden welfare

Talarico’s argument strikes at a real issue: Some of America’s largest corporations have legally structured their tax arrangements to minimize or eliminate federal income tax liability. This practice has drawn scrutiny from policymakers across the political spectrum and sparked ongoing debates about tax code reform. ​ So, rather than accepting that welfare is primarily a lower-income issue, he argues the problem is systemic and benefits the wealthy.

Talarico said his background as a middle school language arts teacher at Rhodes Middle School in San Antonio informed many of his policy positions.

“I was a public school teacher, so I saw how when kids showed up hungry, they couldn’t learn,” he told local ABC affiliate KSAT in October. “Even my brightest students, even my hardest working students couldn’t succeed. Couldn’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps when they didn’t have boots.” ​

To illustrate the point, he invoked a metaphor about teaching someone to fish: “If you’re gonna take your friend out on a boat for the day to teach him how to fish, you wanna make sure he had breakfast that morning. You wanna make sure he’s not sick, because that allows him to learn how to fish again,” he said. ​

A platform around corporate accountability

Since his election to the Texas House in 2018 at age 28, Talarico has positioned himself as a champion of legislation targeting corporate and pharmaceutical industry practices. He was instrumental in passing legislation capping insulin copays at $25 per month in Texas and enabling the importation of lower-cost medications from Canada.

His Senate campaign messaging appears to hinge on this core idea: that fairness and personal responsibility should apply equally to billionaires and working people.

“We don’t want dependency. We want to reward hard work. And I think that should apply to those billionaires, not just working people,” he said during the recent taping.

Notably, the company reported solid prospects from data centers, which drive higher energy demand. FCEL says its sales and marketing focus is centered around data center operations and engaging with data center operators and infrastructure finance providers to make it clear that FuelCell is equipped to power their energy-intensive applications.

As AI demand accelerates, the company expects to increase production, creating a clear path to profitability. Believing that once it reaches an annualized production rate of 100 megawatts, it will translate into positive adjusted EBITDA.

About FuelCell Stock

Danbury, Connecticut-based FuelCell is a leader in developing stationary fuel cell platforms for sustainable, efficient power production. The company designs, manufactures, installs, operates, and services megawatt-scale systems powered by molten carbonate technology, generating ultra-clean electricity with minimal emissions.

These versatile platforms enable carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and water production, plus long-duration energy storage solutions customized for utilities, industries, and municipalities. Founded in 1969, FuelCell Energy advances reliable fuel cell innovations to support global clean energy needs and environmental goals. The company has a market capitalization of $269.34 million.

The stock has been volatile on Wall Street amid broader market volatility. Adding to the pressure is the new tax legislation, also called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The new tax regime significantly curbs the clean hydrogen production credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), requiring facilities to begin construction by January 1, 2028, to remain eligible.

Over the past 52 weeks, FuelCell’s stock has dropped by 10.6%. However, over the past six months, it has gained 37.17%. The stock had reached a 52-week high of $13.98 in January, but is down 40% from that level. It reached a 52-week low of $3.58 in May and is up 133% from that level.

FuelCell’s stock is trading at a lower valuation than its peers. Its price-to-sales ratio of 1.36x is lower than the industry average of 1.81x.

FuelCell’s Q4 Results Were Better Than Expected

On Dec. 18, FuelCell reported its fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2025 (the period that ended on Oct. 31). The company’s quarterly revenue increased 12% year-over-year (YOY) to $55.02 million, which is higher than the $43.96 million that Wall Street analysts had expected.

The top line growth was driven by product revenue increasing 18% from the prior year’s period to $30.03 million. This was based on the company recording $30 million in revenue from its extended service contract with Gyeonggi Green Energy Co., Ltd. (GGE), covering the supply and activation of 10 fuel cell units for GGE’s 58.8 MW power facility in Hwaseong-si, South Korea.

FuelCell reported that it has streamlined its product lineup, increased efficiency, and incorporated absorption chilling to manage thermal loads, which is essential for high-compute environments.​ The company has also become seemingly more cost-efficient, as its bottom line losses are declining.

Its adjusted EBITDA loss was $17.68 million, down by 30% YOY. FuelCell’s adjusted net loss per share for Q4 was $0.83, down 55% from the prior-year period’s per-share loss of $1.85, and lower than the $1.03 per-share loss that Street analysts had expected.

The company announced that it took “proactive measures” to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its liquidity. As of Oct. 31, FuelCell had $278.10 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. It also had a total backlog of $1.19 billion, $30.41 million higher than it was a year ago.

What Do Analysts Think About FuelCell Stock?

Wall Street analysts have a mixed view about FuelCell Energy’s bottom-line trajectory. For the current fiscal year (fiscal 2026), analysts expect the company’s loss per share to reduce by 29.3% YOY to $3.12, followed by losses deepening by 42.6% to $4.45 per share in the following fiscal year.

After the Q4 earnings report, Street analysts have not noticeably changed their stance on FuelCell’s stock. Experts at Canaccord Genuity recently reiterated their “Hold” rating and $12 price target. Despite acknowledging FuelCell's upside potential, Canaccord Genuity analysts noted that the company must demonstrate that its data center initiatives will deliver “tangible outcomes.”

Meanwhile, TD Cowen analysts reaffirmed their “Hold” rating but raised the price target from $7 to $9. This indicates that while sentiment remains tepid, it may be improving in the near future.

Wall Street analysts are taking a cautious stance on FuelCell’s stock now, with a consensus “Hold” rating overall. Of the nine analysts rating the stock, one analyst gave a “Strong Buy” rating, while six analysts are playing it safe with a “Hold” rating, and two analysts gave a “Strong Sell” rating. The consensus price target of $7.84 represents an 6% downside from current levels. However, the Street-high Canaccord Genuity-given price target of $12 indicates a 43.9% upside from current levels.

Key Takeaways

Data center demand is expected to keep FuelCell’s operations robustly buoyed. However, the company continues to report losses and needs to scale its operations to achieve profitability. Therefore, it might be wise to observe the stock for now.",,N,,2025-12-20 21:58:57.618529

Telematics use data gathered from sensors embedded in a vehicle to monitor its operations. When collected and interpreted correctly, that data can be used to improve fleet safety, boost operational efficiency, and enable predictive maintenance that reduces (if not eliminates) unexpected downtime. Those are real benefits, with some analysts showing up to 30% savings in repair costs even before you factor in the fuel savings from EVs that, according to MAN CEO Alexander Vlaskamp, will cover the added cost of a BEV in less than three years.

As you can imagine, that’s a big business – and the global market for vehicle telematic platforms is projected to reach an impressive $127 billion in the next decade, and the rush is on to get OEMs like Ford (through Ford Pro) and Volvo (who has a deal with Geotab) to integrate digital solutions into their vehicles.

We originally covered these topics back in February, ahead of the ACT Expo. You can read that original article, below, and let us know what you think of the OEMs’ telematics’

Advertisement - scroll for more content

Last month, Geotab signed a deal with Volvo Group to integrate the manufacturer’s vehicle data API into Geotab’s telematics platform. It’s the latest in a recent onslaught of such deals between telematics providers and OEMs that begs the question: what’s in it for the OEMs?

Almost all modern cars and trucks are “connected” in some way. Ford, for example, began fitting the FordPass Connect modem on all its vehicles in the 2020 model year, and the vehicle (and driver) data gathered powers the Ford Pro fleet management platform and enables offerings like the company’s E-Switch Assist, which enables Ford fleet managers to identify which of its ICE-powered F-150 and Transit assets are ready to make the switch to EV.

“Smart tools informed by data like E-Switch Assist are opening up many new conversations with our commercial customers large and small about EV readiness; we’re already using E-Switch Assist regularly in consultations to help organizations determine if electric trucks and vans are right for them,” says Nate McDonald, EV strategy and cross vehicle brand manager at Ford Pro. “The importance of these tools and technologies goes beyond selling a customer a new vehicle—it changes mindsets about whether electric vehicles will work for their business while potentially saving them time and money.”

So, it makes sense for manufacturers to build that connectivity into their vehicles and makes even more sense to use that data connection to populate a fleet management dashboard that makes it painless for fleet managers to monitor their assets within a trusted ecosystem. Think Android vs. iPhone, and the pain that would go into switching from one to the other after a decade or so of constant interaction – because that’s how the OEMs are looking at it.

Why, then, would an OEM open up that data stream to a third party like Geotab?

The answer, presumably, is that that data sharing is a two-way street: the manufacturer’s are opening up their APIs to Geotab, and Geotab is sharing at least some of the data from other manufacturers with their industry partners.

And Geotab has a lot of partners:

In 2019, Geotab began working with Ford to integrate Ford’s telematics data into its fleet management platform

In 2020, Geotab began integrating with GM and its OnStar telematics in North American markets

In 2022, Geotab began partnering with Stellantis’ Free2move car sharing brand, providing full telematics integration into the MyGeotab platform in North America

In April of 2024, Geotab partnered with Mobilisights to integrate data from Stellantis’ European brands, including Opel, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Citroën, and Peugeot

In September of 2024, Geotab announced a new partnership with VW Group Info Services aimed at improving the company’s data integration across its brands

A deal with Rivian, VW’s partner in a $5 billion joint software venture, followed soon after

All of those players are convinced that the data coming from their vehicles can produce enough value to seriously impact fleet ROI.

Fleet managers seem convinced, too. In a recent McKinsey survey, nearly 57% of EV buyers said they were willing to switch brands in order to get better connectivity features. And, if you’ve ever worked in “a Ford shop” or “a Chevy shop” you already know what a huge that deal that number might be to an OEM.

McKinsey connectivity survey

In that point of view, working with a trusted, universal platform like Geotab who doesn’t have a dog in the vehicle sales fight makes sense. If the Ford Transit the fleet buyer is looking at plays well with their fleet auditing software and systems and the Nissan NV doesn’t – well, it doesn’t really matter if Nissan’s fleetail guy is giving you a better deal at that point. It’s just too painful to operate a second dashboard for one subset of assets.

The man-hours saved with a universal and brand agnostic fleet management platform may not be the easiest to trace all the way to the bottom line, but they’re there.

Additionally, the Geotab dashboard can be configured to collect and even analyze data that’s specifically relevant to EVs. Information like charging history, and regenerative braking efficiency, and overall battery health – data that, over thousands of vehicles, can give fleet managers real insight into how long the new electric vehicles they’re considering will last compared to the gas and diesel vehicles they have experience with.

Geotab research shows that EV batteries could last 20 years or more if they degrade at an average rate of 1.8% per year, as we have observed.

According to our data, the simple answer is that the vast majority of batteries will outlast the usable life of the vehicle and will never need to be replaced. If an average EV battery degrades at 1.8% per year, it will still have over 80% state of health after 12 years, generally beyond the usual life of a fleet vehicle.

Telematics integrations can also help optimize a fleet’s charging schedules, both by scheduling EV charging for lower priced, off-peak hours and by identifying the most dependable high-speed charging stations along regular routes to minimize down time for both vehicles and drivers.

Finally, these data-driven platforms can provide fleet managers tools for tracking and reporting things like carbon emissions and overall energy consumption, which can streamline ESG reporting processes and make it easier for the worker bees to get regulators, administrators, and managers the sort of charts, tables, and graphs they love.

Something like that, anyway.

The White House has supported the general effort in Congress to streamline the federal permitting process, which frequently adds years to the time it takes to build projects. But Trump has dismissed the issue of affordability as a “hoax” — despite polls showing the issue is a top concern of voters — and the White House’s engagement with Congress on the legislation has been mostly limited to providing technical advice.

Proponents view boosting the production and delivery of all sources of domestic energy as necessary for tackling the affordability crisis. Data released Thursday showed consumers’ power prices have climbed by 7.4 percent over the previous 12 months, while their natural gas costs are up 6.9 percent — both well above overall inflation.

Room for any legislative compromise is narrow, however. One reason is that House conservatives oppose including language that would protect renewable energy, while Democrats fear that Trump wouldn’t abide by any congressional limits on his power to block solar and wind projects.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a close Trump ally, said the president should embrace a potential compromise that relaxes environmental statutes but allows renewable energy projects that are under development to complete their permitting.

“If we do something big and bipartisan, it is pretty easy to argue that it is going to be good for affordability,” Cramer told POLITICO. “There’s room for everybody to brag about it if we do it successfully. And if we don’t, it gets blamed on us. But it would require leadership from the administration. We can’t do it without them.”

Green power supporters, meanwhile, would have to accept the reality that a permitting overhaul means faster approval for oil and gas.

“The path to permitting has always required bipartisanship, and this was always going to be about the adults in the room,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). “People need to let go of the idea that this bill is going to be an opportunity to either vanquish clean energy, or vanquish fossil energy.”

That task got even harder after House GOP leaders made concessions to appease foes of offshore wind before passing their permitting bill, known as the SPEED Act.

“Everybody says permitting reform has to happen, and it should be technology neutral,” said Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.). “And if it’s something that 300 members out of 435 want something done, it shouldn’t be up to four or five to derail that.”

To get the votes of hardliners in their party, GOP leaders weakened a part of the bill that was intended to curb the power of presidents to revoke permits. The change would allow the Trump administration to continue to try to block previously approved offshore wind projects. That move prompted one clean energy industry group to yank its support for the bill — and irked Democrats who said Congress should be clearing away red tape for all kinds of energy.

“It’s unfortunate the far right feels that they want to get everything,” said Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.). “They don’t want to compromise. Then you get nothing.”

But Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), the architect of the bill, argued that the measure’s bipartisan support — 11 Democrats voted for it — created momentum for the Senate to act.

“We got the best vote we could get passed out of the House,” Westerman said Thursday. “We said our goal was to have a bipartisan permitting bill in the Senate before the end of the year and we did it. We’ve sent them a really good piece of legislation.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright told POLITICO this week that he has been in conversations with lawmakers and personally supports the SPEED Act, and that the Trump administration “wants to get bipartisan permitting reform done.”

He said finding a compromise on limiting executive branch interference in the permitting process would require a “balance.”

Passage of the SPEED Act was the centerpiece of a legislative package pushed by House Republicans, which included several of their long-held priorities they contend are needed to expand U.S. energy output. That bill would limit the scope of permitting reviews and sharply restrict legal challenges under the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental protection law that Republicans and some Democrats believe has been misused by environmental groups and state governments to block projects.

Now, Democrats and some moderate House Republicans who were unhappy with the late concessions to the hardliners said they hope the Senate will negotiate a more bipartisan product that strengthens protections for clean energy.

“I certainly am going to be a strong advocate with the Senate that any final product that gets back here for us to vote on would be inclusive,” said Rep. Adam Gray (D-Calif.), who voted for the SPEED Act despite concerns that the last-minute changes were “counterproductive.”

“We need to build if we’re going to address our problems, both from an affordability perspective as well as a reliability perspective,” Gray added. “We’ve got to build out clean energy. We’ve got to also leverage our traditional oil and gas.”

If the Senate works out a compromise, it would fall to House Speaker Mike Johnson to steer the bill past the hardliners’ opposition.

Some Democrats were not optimistic.

“Serious permitting reform cannot happen on their [GOP] watch,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.). “It has to happen under Democratic leadership. The Freedom Caucus and the oil and gas folks are just never going to let a true bipartisan solution move. Mike Johnson won’t allow it.”

Even as top Republican leaders have remained mum, GOP lawmakers are well aware of what the issue could mean for them in next year’s elections.

“This is the single biggest thing for affordability,” said Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah). “If you get energy prices down, it’s a big deal.”

The urgency has only grown since several previous failed efforts to relax cumbersome federal permitting rules. That’s raised concerns among industry groups and their members about a supply crunch caused in part by rising power demand from the AI boom.

Among the groups calling for Congress to act to update permitting laws are the American Petroleum Institute, Clean Energy Buyers Association, National Association of Manufacturers and the Data Center Coalition.

“I don’t think I’ve seen the support for permitting reform come from so many different angles,” said Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a key negotiator. “You just can’t build fast enough. It’s hitting every aspect. It’s just a much larger support group.”

The permitting debate is also complicated by the fact that many projects must go through a thicket of state and local approvals, on top of the federal ones. Projects of all types are increasingly facing public opposition from landowners.

GOP policy proposals have tended to focus on easing the requirements of environmental laws while Democrats have focused their effort on smoothing approvals for interstate power lines that could send clean energy long distances. Meanwhile, the hardening partisanship of Trump’s second term has made it harder to meet in the middle.

“It’s no secret that there’s not necessarily a ton of trust between Democrats in Congress and the administration,” said Rep. Josh Harder (D-Calif.), who co-chairs the new bipartisan Build America Caucus.

Much of the distrust has centered on Trump’s assault on renewable energy projects, including the administration’s efforts to revoke already-issued permits and stall once-routine approvals.

Democrats say Trump’s blocking of solar and wind projects — the fastest-growing sources on the electricity grid — risks putting more pressure on power prices, and they are seeking to impose restrictions on presidential meddling in the permitting process in any deal with Republicans.

“Democrats would be insane to offer up a bill to President Trump without the clean energy guardrails that we’ve been trying to put in,” Huffman said. “You’re simply giving them more authority and tools to kill off clean energy in its current form.”

Republican hardliners are adamant, though, the Congress must not hamper Trump’s authority to block renewables, particularly offshore wind. They want to speed up the federal permitting process only for fossil fuels.

“The president is probably the only person alive who hates these wind turbines more than I do,” said Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew, whose home state of New Jersey has been a focus for offshore wind farms. He added, “We don’t have to have wind turbines in order to get the permitting [reform] for oil and gas.”

Permitting proponents like Westerman and Capito have proposed a neutral approach that would hasten approvals for all energy sources, regardless of the type of technology.

That message is also meant to appeal to Democrats who are increasingly embracing an “all of the above” approach instead of only embracing climate-friendly sources, in order to capitalize on Trump’s anti-renewables bias.

“In order for permitting reform to happen, it has to be a bipartisan ‘all of the above’ approach,” said Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.). “We need to put making life more affordable for Americans ahead of politics, and that’s going to require a culture change on both sides of the aisle.”

Even as the House GOP passed the SPEED Act, more challenges await when the issue moves to the Senate in the new year.

That effort would require at least seven Democratic votes — along with universal Republican support.

Along with changes to the NEPA process, including by limiting legal challenges against projects, a broader deal between the Senate and House would also probably modify the Clean Water Act to smooth oil and gas pipeline project approvals — a key Republican demand that Democrats have resisted in the past. And it would have to include measures to facilitate the development of interstate transmission lines needed to help bring clean energy onto the nation’s power grid — a top priority of Democrats that House Republicans have bristled at.

“It’s going to be hard,” Capito said. “So it won’t be as big [of a deal] as we would want, but I still think we’ll get there.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F1c%2F52%2Fc08273be4a1590330dcf1d377582%2Freferendum-public-utility-91823.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 16:59:36.031774

The report said statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have also declined sharply from 1990 through 2022.","North Carolinians are breathing the cleanest air in decades, according to new state data from the Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ).

The NCDEQ released its updated Air Quality Trends in North Carolina report on Friday. The report attributes the decline in air pollution emissions to efforts by state leaders, regulatory agencies, electric utilities, industry and the public to address air quality concerns over the last 50 years. The report said carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in particular reached all-time lows in 2022, the latest year for which data is available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“Even as our population and economy continue to grow, North Carolina’s air quality keeps getting better and better,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “By controlling air pollution, we are giving every North Carolinian a cleaner, healthier future.”

“Our air quality continues to improve thanks to tireless efforts by our dedicated staff, partners and a wide variety of stakeholders who have come together to implement sound environmental policies,” said Mike Abraczinskas, Director of the Division of Air Quality.

The report said statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have also declined sharply from 1990 through 2022. Specifically, the report said emissions fell in the following categories:

95% for sulfur dioxide (SO2).

74% for carbon monoxide (CO).

71% for nitrogen oxides (NOx).

48% for fine particles (PM2.5).

67% for volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

The state said the measured concentrations of those pollutants have been below every federal health-based standard for more than a decade, with average concentrations of SO2 95% below the federal standard and nitrogen dioxide 89% below the standard. According to data from the state, CO, NOx and VOC emissions have declined by 81%, 72% and 85%, respectively, from 1990 through 2022, from those on-road sources of air pollution.

The state added it expects to see futher reductions from the transportation sector in the coming years due to increasing adoption of electric vehicles.

NCDEQ in their report state that cars, trucks and other vehicles on North Carolina roads emit far less pollution than older vehicles, which they said is attributed to improved engine and fuel standards and more advanced emissions controls.

More of the state’s power now comes from clean sources such as solar, wind and nuclear energy, and NCDEQ said the state’s transition away from coal for power generation has been a major driver of these changes.

Two analyses of national energy data found that electricity price hikes are expected pretty much across the board.

MoneyGeek, which used data from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association for its report, found homes that rely on electric heating can expect to pay 10% more this winter, on average.

Another analysis by This Old House (using U.S. Energy Information Administration data) drilled into the price hikes by state. The report estimated the biggest electricity bill increases this winter will be in:

Maryland ($38 increase)

West Virginia ($38 increase)

Alabama ($35 increase)

Virginia ($34 increase)

Connecticut ($33 increase)

Delaware ($32 increase)

Tennessee ($32 increase)

Hawaii ($30 increase)

Kentucky ($30 increase)

South Carolina ($30 increase)

When it comes to natural gas-heated homes, there’s some better news. Roughly half of homes that rely on it for a heat source shouldn’t see a major change this winter, as the price of natural gas is pretty flat year-over-year, according to This Old House.

One region, however, is an exception. Homes in the Midwest that rely on natural gas for heat could see bills creep up by about $3 to $8 per month, MoneyGeek predicts.

The states expected to see those smaller increases in natural gas heating bills are: Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Ohio, Kansas, Indiana, Wisconsin, Nebraska, North Dakota, Iowa and South Dakota. Every other state is projected to see natural gas heating costs stay flat or even decrease, according to This Old House.

That doesn’t mean bills will be cheap – just marginally cheaper. States in the Northeast face the highest bills overall thanks to their cold weather and older homes that cost more to heat. Homes in Massachusetts and Connecticut have heating costs that top $1,000 over the winter, on average, estimates This Old House. Rhode Island, Alaska and New York aren’t far behind.

It took almost all year, but last month Gov. Josh Shapiro and the General Assembly finally agreed on a state budget. After 135 days of deadlock, it’s understandable that the predominant response to the deal and consequent resumption of funding critical government services has been one of relief. It’s to be expected that leaders are anxious to put the ordeal behind them. But as 2025 comes to a close, it is indisputable that Pennsylvania needs to both confront serious climate issues and reckon with the scale of the challenges we face with respect to energy affordability and reliability.

We at the Pennsylvania Environmental Council (PEC) supported Pennsylvania’s entry into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) program because we believed that it would help to lessen some of the Commonwealth’s energy challenges. These challenges include new, power-hungry data centers and a backlog of new electric generating projects waiting to connect to the regional grid, which remain primary drivers of rising electric bills. We face long-term fuel and operational costs, and foreign markets holding our exports to increasingly higher standards of sustainability. RGGI could have been a powerful tool to provide the means to help meet these challenges, and others we’ve only barely begun to consider. It also could have helped with the worsening funding crisis for public transit systems statewide, another priority left unaddressed in budget negotiations.

Failing to meet looming energy challenges puts Pennsylvania at risk of continually rising electricity costs and loss of jobs and economic opportunities to other states — particularly those tied to emerging technologies. As only one example, PJM’s own market monitor has indicated that existing ratepayers have already paid $16.6 billion in increased electricity prices for the 2026-27 capacity auction due to existing and forecast data center demand alone.

So, what now?

Realistically, the benefits of RGGI’s cap-and-invest structure won’t be realized with any one policy. But multiple legislative and regulatory proposals are on the table in Harrisburg that can help move the needle on energy affordability, reliability, and availability. It’s more important than ever that these measures advance with due urgency.

At the top of the list is PRESS, a long-overdue expansion of Pennsylvania’s antiquated Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, which PEC has advocated for nearly two decades. PRESS will further diversify the mix of energy sources our power generation system relies on while also reducing carbon pollution. Other elements of the Governor’s Lightning package, including updating our state’s energy efficiency program, securing community energy, and improving the siting process for new generation build, are also essential. Add to this two good ideas that passed key House committee votes last month: one helping clear a path for deployment of next-generation nuclear power, and another providing tax credits to help manufacturers save money and cut emissions through energy-efficiency upgrades. Other proposals hold promise for creating storage capacity, modernizing transmission systems, exploring new energy technologies like advanced geothermal, and building the state’s energy workforce.

All of these goals are within reach in 2026. But given rising demands, costs, and emissions inherent in how we currently operate, business as usual won’t meet Pennsylvania’s energy challenges and maintain our place as an innovative energy powerhouse. Government must lead by providing the right policies and incentives to ensure that Pennsylvania thrives. A sound energy policy can check all of the boxes. Let’s build the technologies of the future here, get more electrons on the grid, reduce emissions, grow our workforce, and put investment into making our systems and products better. 2026 must be the year we do what it takes to secure a prosperous clean energy future.

Fewer inspections, weaker enforcement and less oversight: Deep cuts to state budgets and at the Environmental Protection Agency are preventing regulators from fully protecting the public from pollution, according to a report released today by the Environmental Integrity Project.

The financial crisis at these agencies is occurring amid the expansion of the fossil fuel, plastics and petrochemical industries, said EIP Executive Director Jen Duggan.

When states have fewer resources, Duggan said, “those protections, those rights that every American has under our environmental laws, are not being realized.”

President Trump’s budget proposal would decimate 2026 spending at the EPA by 55 percent, or $4.2 billion, according to the report. House Republicans are recommending cutting it by a quarter, while the Senate Appropriations Committee voted for a reduction of just 5 percent.

If enacted, these reductions would exacerbate the EPA’s financial plight. Over the last 15 years, the agency’s budget has been slashed by 40 percent, Duggan said, and its workforce by 18 percent. Since Trump began his second term, more than 3,000 EPA workers have retired or have been terminated as part of the administration’s gutting of the agency.

The upshot of these cuts is that states have to pick up the slack, which is central to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s vision for the agency. In March, on the day he announced “the biggest deregulatory action in history,” Zeldin said he intended to “give power back to the states.”

However, the Trump administration has proposed eliminating most EPA grants to the states, undercutting their agencies’ ability to wield that power.

Texas lawmakers have cut by a third the budget for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality over the last decade, accounting for inflation, the EIP report says. The agency has also struggled to retain employees; 30 percent of its workforce has less than two years of experience, and half have less than five years.

Kathryn Guerra worked for nearly four years at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where she helped small businesses and local governments comply with regulations. Most recently, Guerra worked in the EPA Region 6 office overseeing environmental justice efforts, which the Trump administration eliminated this year.

She’s now the TCEQ campaign director for Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group.

The funding cuts to TCEQ described in the report “render the agency largely ineffective,” Guerra said, “and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness.”

According to TCEQ’s biennial report to the Texas legislature, it takes an average of 351 days to process one enforcement case. The agency’s most recent enforcement report shows a backlog of 1,400 enforcement cases, Guerra said.

“Ultimately it means communities don’t get relief from the environmental harms those polluters are causing,” she said.

States with the deepest budget cuts to environmental agencies from 2010–2024, according to the report, are:

Mississippi—71 percent

South Dakota—61 percent

Alabama—49 percent

Texas—33 percent

Montana—32 percent

North Carolina is among the states whose budgets have contracted in the past 15 years. While the EIP report said the state Department of Environmental Quality’s budget had declined 32 percent from 2010-2014, an agency restructuring in 2015 makes quantifying the depth of the reductions difficult.

“These cuts have real impacts on the people of our state,” said Drew Ball, director of Southeast Campaigns for the Natural Resources Defense Council, on a press call about the report.

Ball also serves as a Buncombe County Commissioner in an area wrecked by Hurricane Helene in 2024.

“When a family in eastern North Carolina notices their tap water turning cloudy after a heavy rain, there are fewer staff who can investigate,” he went on. “There are fewer inspectors available to respond when hurricanes send flood waters through low lying areas, mixing industrial pollution, animal waste and storm water, the staff responsible for tracking and responding to those threats are being asked to do far more with far less.”

During the 2008 recession, North Carolina lawmakers cut DEQ’s budget, part of a statewide belt-tightening. However, the Republican-led legislature has not fully restored those reductions in more economically robust times and during an era of increased population growth.

From 2020 to 2024, census data show the state’s population has grown by more than 5 percent. But over the same period, when accounting for inflation, DEQ’s budget decreased.

In 2019, the DEQ budget was $97.4 million, according to state documents, equivalent to $123.7 million today.

The 2023 DEQ budget totalled $108.7 million, or $115.8 million in today’s money. That’s a 6 percent decrease compared with four years earlier.

Some of the agency’s functions rely on permitting fees. In at least one instance, a healthier environment has resulted in unexpected financial consequences. As state and federal regulations have made the air cleaner, Title V facilities, the largest air pollution sources, have decreased their emissions, according to a 2023 DEQ report to the legislature.

This has translated to a drop in “billable tons”—54 percent over a decade—that generate a portion of the agency’s revenue. Yet the state’s 300 Title V facilities still must be inspected and their permits renewed, even as the number of staff has decreased by 19 percent.

In 2024, the legislature increased the permit fee to help close the gap.

North Carolina had the largest staffing cuts at environmental agencies from 2010 to 2024, according to the report, though the same caveat related to the 2015 restructuring applies.

States with the next largest staffing cuts, 2010-2024, are:

Connecticut—26 percent

Arizona—25 percent

Louisiana—24 percent

Missouri and Kansas—20 percent

Adding to the budgetary crisis, it’s also been difficult for North Carolina DEQ to retain or hire employees. At its peak three years ago, the agency had vacancy rates that exceeded 20 percent. DEQ officials said at the time that agency wages, whose boundaries are set by the legislature, can’t compete with the private sector.

“Many families today live with waste in roadside ditches, wells that are too contaminated to drink from and constant fear about what the next storm will carry into their yards,” Ball said. “Yet the very agency responsible for protecting these families is facing a growing burden, with shrinking staff, shrinking budgets and shrinking political support, and now the federal government is proposing the deepest cuts to EPA in 40 years. That’s a recipe for disaster in states like ours.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1442150/story_image/AP25140723348491.jpg?1749501039,N,,2025-12-20 15:59:18.412771

To offset those concerns, the company pledged to shield existing customers from the cost of the expansion but only through 2031.
“Large load” customers, such as data centers, will pay for the expansion through the rates they are charged, the company said, but there remains a risk that the data centers do not come.
So Georgia Power addressed that by signing a “stipulated agreement” to allocate costs based on the current revenue forecasts that assume the demand will be there.
“If you proceed,” she said, “you will absolutely not be decent to the tens of thousands of Georgia Power customers on fixed or low incomes.”","ATLANTA — State regulators granted Georgia Power the authority for an historic expansion of its capacity to generate electricity in a unanimous vote Friday.

The decision by the five elected members of the Public Service Commission, all Republicans, allows the privately-owned monopoly to build five gas-powered plants and supporting infrastructure while contracting for additional power from other suppliers.

Critics said the expansion, equivalent to five times the power output of the Hoover Dam, could cost up to $60 billion, saddling generations of Georgians with the bill.

The company asked for and got permission to add nearly 10 gigawatts of generating capacity, close to a 50% increase in its capacity. It said its forecasts showed voracious future demand from tech companies that will be building server warehouses to power the internet and artificial intelligence.

In a statement after the vote, Kim Greene, chairman, president, and CEO of Georgia Power, called the demand “projected unprecedented growth,” noting that the company had filed customer contracts with the commission this year for three gigawatts in new demand.

Critics contended that the forecast revenue, based on “trade secret” information that the public cannot see, was overly optimistic. If the demand does not materialize, they said, Georgia Power’s other customers would be left with the bill for the construction of that unneeded capacity.

To offset those concerns, the company pledged to shield existing customers from the cost of the expansion but only through 2031. Thereafter, the agreement allows for amendments to hit the brakes if demand does not materialize.

“Large load” customers, such as data centers, will pay for the expansion through the rates they are charged, the company said, but there remains a risk that the data centers do not come.

So Georgia Power addressed that by signing a “stipulated agreement” to allocate costs based on the current revenue forecasts that assume the demand will be there.

This “downward pressure” on rates will equal $8.50 a month for the typical residential customer, the company said.

Lawyers for opponents, including environmental organizations and renewable energy advocates, said there were undisclosed assumptions in Georgia Power’s calculations that they contended could create a countervailing “upward pressure” on residential bills.

They wanted the company to enter its calculations into the public record, so the commission could more easily hold it to account for its pledge in the future.

Lawyers for the Southern Environmental Law Center filed motions calling for the disclosure and for a 30-day delay on the vote.

“The point of this motion is not about whether it’s a good deal or a bad deal,” said Jennifer Whitfield, one of the lawyers. “It’s about … Georgia Power showing its work for the conclusions that are in the agreement so that we can enforce that agreement down the road.”

Her colleague, Bob Sherrier, added later: “We have a problem with the stipulation putting a number on the downward pressure but not a number on the upward pressure.”

Jason Shaw, chairman of the commission, denied the request, saying his agency already had all the necessary information from Georgia Power.

Then the commissioners voted for the expansion, with audience members shouting “shame,” “disgusting” and “sell out!”

Before the vote, members of the public got time to speak.

Some extolled the benefits of reliable power, saying big companies will not bring jobs to Georgia if the state cannot stay ahead of demand.

“It’s about being proactive rather than reacting too late,” said Susanne Reynolds, director of the Development Authority of Early County in southwest Georgia.

But most were furious about the expansion because of the potential cost for customers and the impact on the environment of burning more fossil fuel.

They also were unhappy with the timing of the vote, less than two weeks before January.

That is when two new commissioners, both Democrats, will take over the seats of the two Republicans they beat decisively in an election last month

Julie Jabaley said she would work hard to unseat the remaining three Republicans.

She was among the protesters escorted out of a similar hearing last week after they were told they had violated the commission’s rules on “decorum,” a word that Jabaley mocked.

“If you vote on this proposal today as is, you demonstrate an utter lack of respect for thousands of petitioners who have tried to decorously convince you that there’s a better way to fulfill your mission that consumers receive safe and reasonably priced services,” she said.

Jabaley said she wanted “clean, smart energy for the future” and was concerned about the cost of the expansion.

“If you proceed,” she said, “you will absolutely not be decent to the tens of thousands of Georgia Power customers on fixed or low incomes.”","https://www.augustachronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/02/NAUG/86481029007-naug-data-center-opposition-0930202502-kg.JPG?crop=2787,1568,x0,y0&width=2787&height=1568&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-20 19:58:59.919346

Energy sector companies should begin preparing for potential SPEED Act implementation while maintaining flexibility regarding timeline and scope uncertainties.
The SPEED Act passage in the House represents just the beginning of what could be a transformative period for American energy infrastructure development.","American energy infrastructure sits at a critical juncture where decades of regulatory complexity collide with unprecedented demand for domestic resource development. The intersection of environmental oversight, economic necessity, and national security considerations has created a permitting landscape that industry leaders characterise as fundamentally broken. Against this backdrop, federal lawmakers are attempting to recalibrate the balance between environmental protection and energy project development through comprehensive legislative reform targeting the foundational frameworks that govern major infrastructure decisions.

The current regulatory environment reflects layers of environmental review processes that evolved over more than five decades, creating what many stakeholders view as duplicative and time-intensive approval mechanisms. These systems, originally designed to ensure thorough environmental consideration, now face scrutiny for their role in delaying critical energy projects across multiple sectors. Furthermore, the growing consensus among diverse industry coalitions suggests that modernising these frameworks has become essential for maintaining America's competitive position in global energy markets while addressing domestic supply challenges.

Understanding Federal Permitting Reform: Why the SPEED Act Matters

What Is the SPEED Act and Its Core Objectives?

The Standardising Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, formally designated as H.R. 4776, represents a comprehensive legislative effort to restructure federal environmental review processes. According to Congress.gov's official bill summary, the legislation limits the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and modifies the environmental review of major federal actions under NEPA to generally limit the number of federal actions that trigger NEPA review and to expedite the review process.

The bill emerged through bipartisan collaboration between Representative Bruce Westerman (R-Arkansas), who serves as House Natural Resources Committee Chairman, and Representative Jared Golden (D-Maine). This cross-party sponsorship reflects the legislation's attempt to address concerns that transcend traditional political boundaries, particularly in regions where energy infrastructure development directly impacts local economies.

Core provisions of the SPEED Act focus on modernising NEPA review processes through several key mechanisms:

Reducing duplicative environmental assessments across federal agencies

Establishing more definitive timelines for project review completion

Limiting litigation opportunities that extend project approval cycles

Streamlining coordination between federal and state regulatory authorities

The American Petroleum Institute's President and CEO Mike Sommers characterised the legislation as a critical step toward modernising a federal permitting system, emphasising that by modernising NEPA and reducing duplicative reviews and litigation, this bill restores certainty and helps unlock the infrastructure needed to deliver affordable, reliable energy and meet growing demand.

How Does Current Federal Permitting Create Infrastructure Bottlenecks?

The existing federal permitting framework creates substantial operational challenges across multiple energy sectors through prolonged review cycles and regulatory uncertainty. For instance, industry representatives consistently identify these delays as primary obstacles to meeting domestic energy demand and maintaining competitive positioning in international markets, often requiring detailed mining permitting insights to navigate complex approval processes.

Current System Limitations:

Multi-agency coordination complexity requiring separate approvals from numerous federal departments

Overlapping review requirements between federal, state, and local jurisdictions

Extended litigation periods following initial approvals

Uncertain timeline expectations preventing effective project planning and capital allocation

Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association President Ed Longanecker emphasised that comprehensive permitting reform represents a strategic imperative for the country and industry. Without such reform, America's energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad, or ensure long-term affordability for consumers.

Independent Petroleum Association of America President and CEO Edith Naegele characterised the SPEED Act as a much-needed answer to years of independent oil and natural gas producers' concerns regarding energy infrastructure permitting. This perspective reflects widespread industry frustration with existing approval processes that many stakeholders view as outdated relative to current technological capabilities and economic realities.

National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito highlighted that permitting certainty remains essential to keeping investment, jobs, and energy production in the United States. He emphasised that a durable, effective permitting framework provides the foundation for the nation's economic strength, global competitiveness, and energy dominance.

The cumulative impact of these delays extends beyond individual project timelines to affect broader strategic planning across energy sectors. Companies must account for regulatory uncertainty in their capital deployment decisions, often leading to delayed investments or project relocations to jurisdictions with more predictable approval processes.

Legislative Journey and Political Dynamics

What Were the Voting Patterns in the House?

The SPEED Act passage in the House occurred on December 19, 2025, with a final vote tally of 221-196, demonstrating notable bipartisan support despite overall partisan divisions on environmental policy. The voting breakdown reveals interesting cross-party dynamics that suggest regional and economic factors influenced individual representatives' decisions beyond traditional party-line considerations.

Voting Breakdown Count Republicans in favour 210 Republicans against 1 Democrats in favour 11 Democrats against 195 Total Passage Margin 25 votes

The 11 Democratic supporters represent a significant bipartisan element in legislation that primarily aligns with Republican energy policy priorities. These crossover votes likely reflect constituents' economic interests in districts where energy infrastructure development provides substantial employment and tax revenue benefits.

The single Republican opposition vote suggests near-unanimous party support for permitting reform, indicating strong consensus within Republican caucus leadership regarding the legislation's strategic importance. This level of party unity often facilitates more effective advocacy during Senate consideration and potential conference committee negotiations.

Why Did This Bill Achieve Bipartisan Support Despite Political Divisions?

Several factors contributed to the SPEED Act's ability to attract Democratic support in a politically polarised environment. Regional economic considerations, national security implications, and practical infrastructure needs appear to have influenced representatives from districts with significant energy sector employment.

Key Factors Enabling Bipartisan Support:

Regional economic dependencies on energy infrastructure projects

National security framing emphasising domestic energy production capacity

Renewable energy sector benefits from streamlined permitting processes

Pragmatic recognition of infrastructure development necessities

American Exploration & Production Council CEO Anne Bradbury characterised the vote as a turning point to fix America's broken permitting system and lower energy costs for every American. She specifically credited Chairman Bruce Westerman and Representative Jared Golden's SPEED Act as a bipartisan breakthrough to responsibly streamline environmental reviews and end permitting lawfare that stifles all forms of energy development and drives up costs for American families.

Energy Workforce and Technology Council President Tim Tarpley reframed the discussion beyond economic considerations, stating that passing permitting reform represents not just an economic need, but a critical national security issue. This security-focused messaging likely resonated with representatives concerned about domestic energy independence and supply chain resilience, particularly given the strategic importance of critical minerals and energy security considerations.

The inclusion of renewable energy advocacy through organisations like Turn Forward, which focuses on American offshore wind power development, helped broaden the coalition supporting permitting reform. Hillary Bright, Turn Forward's Executive Director, emphasised that permitting delays remain one of the greatest obstacles to advancing U.S. energy projects essential to meeting unprecedented demand on the nation's electrical grid.

Representative Golden's participation as co-sponsor reflects Maine's interests in offshore wind development, where federal permitting delays significantly impact project timelines and economic benefits to coastal communities. This demonstrates how specific regional energy opportunities can create bipartisan incentives for regulatory reform.

Industry Impact Analysis Across Energy Sectors

How Will Oil and Gas Operations Benefit from NEPA Reforms?

Oil and gas sector stakeholders anticipate significant operational improvements from SPEED Act implementation, particularly regarding infrastructure development timelines and regulatory certainty. The current permitting environment creates substantial planning challenges for companies seeking to develop pipeline networks, processing facilities, and upstream production capacity.

Anticipated Oil and Gas Benefits:

Pipeline development acceleration through reduced inter-agency coordination delays

Drilling permit processing improvements enabling more responsive resource development

Infrastructure expansion opportunities in key production basins

Reduced regulatory compliance costs through streamlined approval processes

The American Petroleum Institute's support for the legislation reflects industry-wide recognition that current permitting processes significantly impact project economics and development timelines. By modernising NEPA and reducing duplicative reviews and litigation, the reforms could unlock infrastructure needed to deliver affordable, reliable energy and meet growing demand.

Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association's endorsement emphasises the strategic importance of permitting reform for maintaining America's energy sector competitiveness. The association represents nearly 3,000 members whose operations depend on efficient regulatory processes for project development and expansion activities.

Independent petroleum producers, represented by IPAA, face particular challenges from extended permitting processes due to their typically smaller operational scale and limited resources for navigating complex regulatory requirements. Streamlined approvals could enable these companies to respond more effectively to market opportunities and contribute to domestic production capacity.

What Does This Mean for Renewable Energy Development?

Renewable energy sectors stand to benefit substantially from SPEED Act provisions, despite some environmental groups' opposition to the legislation. The current federal permitting framework creates similar delays for renewable projects as for traditional energy infrastructure, often extending development timelines by multiple years.

Renewable Energy Sector Benefits:

Offshore wind project timeline acceleration through streamlined federal approvals

Solar and onshore wind permitting efficiency improvements

Grid interconnection approval acceleration enabling faster project completion

Transmission line development facilitation supporting renewable energy integration

Turn Forward's advocacy for the SPEED Act demonstrates renewable energy sector recognition that permitting delays represent fundamental obstacles to meeting America's growing electrical grid demands. Offshore wind projects, which require extensive federal coordination due to their location in federal waters, could experience particularly significant timeline improvements.

Hillary Bright emphasised that America faces skyrocketing energy demand and that offshore wind projects offer a proven way to provide utility-scale power to densely populated areas where resource diversity helps avoid grid disruptions and rising utility costs. The organisation advocates for bringing more viable, scalable American energy sources online through regulatory efficiency.

The renewable energy sector's support for permitting reform reflects practical recognition that environmental review streamlining benefits all energy infrastructure development, regardless of technology type. Solar, wind, and transmission projects currently face many of the same regulatory bottlenecks as traditional energy infrastructure.

How Could Mining and Critical Minerals Extraction Change?

Critical minerals extraction represents another sector where SPEED Act implementation could significantly impact domestic supply chain security and economic competitiveness. Current federal permitting processes for mining operations often extend development timelines well beyond those seen in other major mining jurisdictions globally.

Potential Mining Sector Impacts:

Domestic rare earth element project acceleration supporting technology supply chains

Lithium extraction permitting improvements enabling battery material production

Copper and base metals development streamlining supporting infrastructure construction

Strategic mineral security enhancement through domestic production capacity

The United States currently depends heavily on foreign sources for many critical minerals essential to renewable energy technologies, electric vehicles, and defence applications. Consequently, streamlined permitting processes could enable domestic projects to compete more effectively with international suppliers operating under different regulatory frameworks.

Mining projects typically require extensive environmental review due to their potential impacts on local ecosystems and water resources. However, SPEED Act provisions could reduce approval timelines while maintaining essential environmental safeguards through more efficient review processes, as demonstrated by evolving trends in the mining industry evolution.

Economic and Investment Implications

What Are the Projected Economic Benefits of Faster Permitting?

Economic analysis of permitting reform suggests substantial potential benefits across multiple sectors, though precise quantification depends on implementation details and industry response patterns. Accelerated project approval timelines could unlock significant capital investment that currently remains delayed due to regulatory uncertainty.

Projected Economic Impact Areas:

Job creation acceleration across energy infrastructure sectors

Infrastructure investment mobilisation through reduced regulatory risk

Regional economic development enhancement in energy-producing areas

Consumer energy cost reduction through increased domestic supply

The cumulative impact of faster permitting extends beyond individual projects to affect broader economic development patterns. Regions with significant energy resources could experience accelerated economic growth through more rapid project development and associated employment creation.

Investment capital currently held back due to permitting uncertainty represents a substantial potential economic catalyst. Private sector companies often delay major capital commitments until regulatory approval certainty increases, meaning permitting reform could trigger significant near-term investment deployment.

Regional Economic Multiplier Effects:

Direct employment in energy infrastructure construction and operation

Indirect economic benefits through local supplier networks and service providers

Induced economic activity from increased worker income and spending

Tax revenue enhancement for local and state governments

How Might This Affect Energy Infrastructure Investment Flows?

Investment patterns across energy infrastructure sectors could shift significantly following SPEED Act implementation, with potentially substantial implications for capital allocation and project development priorities. Reduced regulatory timelines and increased approval certainty typically encourage higher levels of private sector investment.

Investment Flow Considerations:

Private capital deployment acceleration in previously delayed projects

Public-private partnership opportunities expansion in transmission and renewable sectors

Foreign direct investment enhancement through improved regulatory predictability

Risk profile improvements attracting institutional investor participation

Energy infrastructure projects require substantial upfront capital investments with long-term payback periods, making regulatory uncertainty particularly challenging for project economics. In addition, streamlined permitting processes could improve project risk profiles sufficiently to attract additional institutional investment from pension funds, insurance companies, and other large-scale capital sources.

The transmission sector represents a particularly significant opportunity for investment acceleration, as grid modernisation and expansion require extensive federal coordination but offer substantial economic returns through improved system efficiency and renewable energy integration capabilities. Savvy investors recognise that comprehensive investment strategy insights are crucial when evaluating these emerging opportunities.

Senate Prospects and Implementation Challenges

What Are the Realistic Chances of Senate Passage?

The SPEED Act faces a more complex political environment in the Senate, where energy policy legislation typically requires broader bipartisan support for successful passage. Current Senate composition and historical voting patterns on energy infrastructure issues suggest the bill's prospects depend heavily on amendments and modifications during committee consideration.

Senate Consideration Factors:

Committee assignment and markup scheduling priorities

Key senator positioning on energy permitting reform

Amendment potential addressing environmental concerns

Timeline coordination with other legislative priorities

National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito emphasised that as the Senate takes up this legislation, Congress must work collaboratively to deliver the strongest possible permitting reform that provides real certainty, avoids unintended consequences, and supports investment across the full spectrum of America's energy economy.

The Senate's deliberative process typically involves more extensive stakeholder consultation and amendment consideration than House procedures. This could result in modifications addressing environmental groups' concerns while maintaining the legislation's core permitting reform objectives.

What Implementation Challenges Could Emerge?

Successful SPEED Act implementation would require substantial coordination across multiple federal agencies and adaptation of existing regulatory frameworks. The complexity of current environmental review processes suggests implementation challenges could emerge in several areas.

Potential Implementation Obstacles:

Federal agency resource allocation requirements for expedited reviews

State-federal coordination mechanisms development

Legal challenge management from opposition groups

Environmental compliance framework maintenance under accelerated timelines

Federal agencies currently managing NEPA reviews would need additional resources and modified procedures to implement accelerated approval processes while maintaining environmental protection standards. This could require significant training, system development, and organisational restructuring.

Interagency coordination represents another substantial implementation challenge, as many energy projects require approvals from multiple federal departments with different priorities and procedures. Streamlining these processes while maintaining appropriate oversight could prove technically and administratively complex.

Environmental and Community Considerations

How Do Environmental Groups View These Changes?

Environmental organisations have raised substantial concerns about SPEED Act provisions, arguing that accelerated permitting processes could compromise environmental protection and community consultation processes. Opposition groups worry that streamlined reviews might overlook important ecological and social impacts.

The Sierra Club, described as the most enduring and influential grassroots environmental organisation in the United States, has criticised the SPEED Act and coordinated opposition through a letter sent by more than 150 environmental and community groups to Congress opposing the legislation.

Environmental Group Concerns:

Environmental review thoroughness reduction under accelerated timelines

Community consultation process limitations

Cumulative impact assessment potential oversight

Long-term environmental monitoring framework adequacy

Opposition groups argue that current NEPA requirements serve essential functions in identifying and mitigating potential environmental impacts that might otherwise be overlooked in rapid development processes. They contend that thorough environmental review ultimately saves costs and prevents problems rather than creating unnecessary delays.

What Safeguards Remain Under the Reformed Framework?

Despite environmental groups' concerns, SPEED Act provisions maintain important environmental protection requirements while streamlining review processes. The legislation aims to improve efficiency rather than eliminate environmental consideration entirely.

Maintained Environmental Protections:

Environmental assessment requirements preservation with modified timelines

Scientific review standards continuation under expedited processes

Public participation opportunities maintenance in streamlined formats

Monitoring and compliance enforcement mechanisms retention

The challenge lies in balancing environmental protection thoroughness with development timeline efficiency. Successful implementation would require maintaining rigorous environmental standards while eliminating duplicative or unnecessarily prolonged review processes.

Strategic Scenarios for Energy Market Evolution

Scenario 1: Rapid Implementation and Industry Response

Under this scenario, SPEED Act implementation proceeds smoothly with minimal legal challenges, enabling rapid acceleration of energy infrastructure development across multiple sectors. Industry response could trigger significant near-term investment and project development activity.

Rapid Implementation Outcomes:

Project pipeline acceleration across oil, gas, and renewable sectors

Market competition intensification through increased development capacity

Regional energy hub emergence in areas with favourable resource and regulatory combinations

Supply chain localisation opportunities through domestic project expansion

This scenario could result in substantial economic benefits through job creation, increased energy production capacity, and enhanced supply chain resilience. However, it might also strain regulatory agency resources and create implementation challenges requiring careful management.

Scenario 2: Legal Challenges and Delayed Implementation

Alternative scenario development involves extensive legal challenges from environmental groups and other stakeholders, creating implementation delays and regulatory uncertainty that limit near-term benefits while prolonging current permitting challenges.

Delayed Implementation Impacts:

Court battle timeline extension affecting industry planning

Investment uncertainty continuation during legal proceedings

Alternative state-level approaches development by individual states

International competitiveness implications from continued delays

Extended legal challenges could undermine the legislation's intended benefits while creating additional uncertainty for industry planning and investment decisions. This scenario might prompt some companies to pursue alternative development strategies or consider international opportunities.

Scenario 3: Modified Senate Version and Compromise Framework

A middle-ground scenario involves Senate modifications addressing environmental concerns while maintaining core permitting reform objectives. This compromise approach might achieve broader bipartisan support while balancing development and environmental priorities.

Compromise Framework Elements:

Environmental safeguard enhancements addressing opposition concerns

Implementation timeline adjustments allowing gradual system adaptation

Stakeholder consultation expansion improving community engagement

Monitoring requirement strengthening ensuring environmental compliance

This scenario could provide the most durable long-term solution by building broader stakeholder consensus while achieving meaningful permitting improvements. However, compromise provisions might reduce some of the legislation's intended efficiency benefits.

Long-term Strategic Implications

How Could This Reshape America's Energy Landscape by 2030?

SPEED Act implementation could fundamentally alter America's energy development trajectory over the next decade, potentially accelerating domestic production capacity across multiple sectors while enhancing supply chain resilience and international competitiveness.

2030 Energy Landscape Projections:

Domestic energy production capacity substantial expansion across sectors

Energy independence enhancement through reduced import dependencies

Global energy market positioning strengthening through competitive advantages

Technology deployment acceleration enabling innovation and efficiency improvements

The cumulative impact of accelerated permitting could position the United States as a more dominant global energy supplier while reducing consumer costs through increased domestic production capacity. This transformation could affect international trade balances and geopolitical relationships significantly.

What Are the Broader Economic Competitiveness Considerations?

Beyond immediate energy sector impacts, SPEED Act implementation could enhance broader American economic competitiveness through reduced energy costs, improved supply chain reliability, and strengthened manufacturing capacity dependent on affordable energy inputs.

Competitiveness Enhancement Areas:

Manufacturing sector revival through competitive energy costs

Critical supply chain reshoring enabling domestic production capacity

Innovation ecosystem development supporting advanced energy technologies

International trade balance improvements through energy exports

Manufacturing industries that depend heavily on energy inputs could benefit substantially from increased domestic energy production and associated cost reductions. This could encourage reshoring of manufacturing operations previously relocated to countries with lower energy costs.

The SPEED Act's journey through the Senate represents a critical phase requiring stakeholder attention to committee assignments, amendment proposals, and broader legislative scheduling priorities. Multiple factors will influence the bill's ultimate prospects and final form, particularly in light of potential developments from an executive order on mining permits that could complement these legislative efforts.

Critical Monitoring Priorities:

Senate committee scheduling and markup timeline development

Industry coalition building efforts supporting passage

Environmental group legal strategy development for potential challenges

State government positioning regarding federal permitting reforms

Hillary Bright emphasised that the Senate now has a critical opportunity to advance permitting reform and deliver the certainty needed to unlock investment and accelerate large-scale energy development. This perspective reflects widespread industry recognition that Senate action represents the legislation's most significant remaining hurdle.

How Can Businesses Prepare for Potential Changes?

Energy sector companies should begin preparing for potential SPEED Act implementation while maintaining flexibility regarding timeline and scope uncertainties. Strategic preparation could enable more effective response to regulatory changes when they occur.

Business Preparation Strategies:

Project pipeline optimisation for potential acceleration opportunities

Regulatory compliance framework updates anticipating new requirements

Stakeholder engagement plan modifications addressing streamlined processes

Investment timing considerations based on implementation scenarios

Companies with projects currently in permitting processes should evaluate potential benefits from SPEED Act provisions while maintaining compliance with existing requirements. This dual-track approach could position organisations to capitalise on regulatory improvements without compromising current approval progress.

The American energy infrastructure landscape stands at a potential turning point where decades of regulatory complexity may give way to more streamlined development processes. Success in navigating this transition will require careful attention to legislative developments, strategic preparation for multiple scenarios, and continued engagement with evolving regulatory frameworks. The ultimate impact will depend on implementation effectiveness, stakeholder adaptation, and the broader economic and political environment surrounding energy policy development. The SPEED Act passage in the House represents just the beginning of what could be a transformative period for American energy infrastructure development.

Some of that momentum is now slowing, and the market is speaking loudly. Earlier this year, Ram made headlines by backing away from a pure battery-electric Ram 1500 REV and instead putting its full weight behind the extended-range electric Ramcharger. At the time, critics questioned the move.

Now, those critics are getting their answer—straight from Dearborn.

Ford has effectively killed the all-electric F-150 Lightning as we know it and is pivoting to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) strategy for its next-generation electric pickup. In other words, Ford is following the same path Ram already chose.

The writing has been on the wall for a while. Sales of large, fully electric trucks have not met early expectations, especially when real-world towing, cold weather, and long-distance use come into play. Ford has already stopped producing the current F-150 Lightning, repurposing the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center to build gas-powered F-Series trucks. What was once described as a temporary shift is now permanent.

Instead of doubling down on a pure EV, Ford is rethinking its entire strategy.

The next-generation F-150 Lightning will no longer be a battery-only truck. When it returns, it will be built on an EREV architecture—an electric drivetrain backed by a gasoline engine that works strictly as a generator. The wheels are still driven by electric motors, but the onboard engine eliminates the biggest complaint EV truck owners have voiced: range anxiety.

Ford estimates the upcoming Lightning EREV will deliver more than 700 miles of total driving range. That figure alone explains why the company is willing to absorb a massive financial hit—roughly $19.5 billion—after already launching and developing the Lightning EV program.

This is where Ram’s earlier decision starts to look less controversial and more forward-thinking.

Stellantis initially planned to offer two electric Ram 1500 models: a full battery-electric REV and the extended-range Ramcharger. As the EV truck market softened, Ram delayed and eventually canceled the pure EV, choosing to focus exclusively on the EREV solution. That decision now appears aligned with where customer demand is actually headed.

Ford CEO Jim Farley summed up the reasoning bluntly, saying, “Rather than spend billions more on these large EVs that we had planned that have no path to profitability, we’re going to pour our investments into higher margin areas — more American-built trucks, more American-built vans, hybrids across our lineup, and even affordable EVs built in Kentucky. And we’re going to go into the energy storage business in the Midwest, make our country stronger,” Farley said to Fox News.

That statement signals a broader industry shift. It’s no longer EV-at-any-cost. It’s about building trucks that people can afford, use, and rely on—especially in America’s heartland, where towing, hauling, and long distances are part of everyday life.

Volkswagen’s Scout brand has also announced plans for extended-range electric trucks and SUVs, further reinforcing that EREV technology is becoming the new bridge between internal combustion and full electrification.

Meanwhile, Ram is preparing to bring its EREV truck to market first. The 2026 Ram 1500 REV—formerly known as the Ramcharger—is engineered to calm range anxiety without sacrificing performance. It pairs a liquid-cooled 92 kWh battery with a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 that functions solely as a generator. Total system output checks in at 647 horsepower and 610 lb.-ft. of torque, good for a 0–60 mph run in about 4.5 seconds.

Ram is targeting up to 690 miles of total range, along with a towing capacity of up to 14,000 lbs and a payload rating of 2,625 lbs. It also supports bi-directional charging, allowing owners to power homes, job sites, or equipment directly from the truck.

Ford hasn’t released detailed specs yet for its Lightning EREV, nor has it confirmed a launch date. What it has confirmed is direction—and that direction mirrors Ram’s playbook almost step for step.

The pure electric half-ton pickup may not be dead forever, but for now, the market has spoken. Extended-range electric trucks are emerging as the most practical solution for American truck buyers. Ram got there first. Ford just admitted it was right.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/F-150-Lightning_Platinum_on-road_03-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 13:59:06.665666

In Mexico, experts believe the country’s battery storage capacity could expand significantly in the coming years.

Enrique Garduño, the CEO of the energy equipment company Skysense, said that Mexico will likely experience “the storage boom in 2027, 2028, and 2029,” driven by regulatory updates, rapid renewable energy growth, and the maturation of storage technologies. Skysense currently runs almost 200 MWh of storage capacity and expects to roll out an additional 300 MWh by 2026. Garduño explained that “It’s a very open government that is genuinely listening to the private sector.” In addition, “We are buying, installing and selling storage systems at less than half the price of three or four years ago.”

Skysense has partnered with China’s BYD Energy Storage to expand its capacity, and BYD’s “MC Cube-T BESS” platform will power the technology. The firm’s North America Vice President of Sales, Oscar Su, stated, “Expanding into a high-potential region such as Latin America is a key step for us… We bring nearly 30 years of battery R&D and the world’s largest power battery production capacity.”

Meanwhile, there are high hopes for India’s battery storage sector, but more needs to be done to attract investment. The South Asian country has seen record-low bids to develop its battery storage systems, with a lack of economic viability as well as safety risks potentially deterring investors. India is aiming to double its renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, but without a rapid growth in its battery storage capacity, it will be unable to provide a reliable power supply without continuing to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

There has been a battery storage boom in certain parts of the world, as governments and energy companies invest in expanding capacity to support a green transition. However, some parts of the world are lagging, which could cause the shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives to be slower than anticipated unless greater investment is made in the sector.

Opened in 1980 near Lake Michigan in Kenosha County, it became Wisconsin’s largest generating plant, burning enough Wyoming coal, some 13,000 tons a day, to provide electricity for up to 1 million homes.

But over time, the plant became too expensive to operate. The owner, We Energies, shut it down after 38 years, in 2018.

We Energies customers, however, are still on the hook.

A portion of their monthly bills will continue to pay for Pleasant Prairie until 2039 — 21 years after the plant stopped producing electricity.

In fact, residential and business utility customers throughout Wisconsin owe nearly $1 billion on “stranded assets” — power plants like Pleasant Prairie that have been or will soon be shut down, a Wisconsin Watch investigation found.

That total will likely grow over the next five years with additional coal plants scheduled to cease operations.

Customers must pay not only for the debt taken on to build and upgrade the plants themselves, but also an essentially guaranteed rate of return for their utility company owners, long after the plants stop generating revenue themselves.

“We really have a hard time with utilities profiting off of dead power plants for decades,” said Todd Stuart, executive director of the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group.

The $1 billion tab looms as Wisconsin utility companies aim to generate unprecedented amounts of electricity for at least seven major high-tech data centers that are proposed, approved or under construction. By one estimate, just two of the data centers, which are being built to support the growth of artificial intelligence, would use more electricity than all Wisconsin homes combined.

All of which raises an important question in Wisconsin, where electricity rates have exceeded the Midwest average for 20 years.

What happens to residents and other ratepayers if AI and data centers don’t pan out as planned, creating a new generation of stranded assets?

How much do Wisconsin ratepayers owe on stranded assets?

Of the five major investor-owned utilities operating in Wisconsin, two — We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service Corp. — have stranded assets on the books. Both companies are subsidiaries of Milwaukee-based WEC Energy Group.

As of December 2024, when the company released its most recent annual report, We Energies estimated a remaining value of more than $700 million across three power plants with recently retired units: Pleasant Prairie, Oak Creek and Presque Isle, a plant on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

Wisconsin Public Service Corp.’s December 2024 report listed roughly $30 million in remaining value on recently retired units at two power plants.

In total, utilities owned by WEC Energy Group will likely have over $1 billion in recently retired assets by the end of 2026.

The company also noted a remaining value of just under $250 million for its share of units at Columbia Generating Station slated to retire in 2029, alongside a remaining value of roughly $650 million for units at Oak Creek scheduled to retire next year.

Its customers will pay off that total, plus a rate of return, for years to come.

The company estimates that closing the Pleasant Prairie plant alone saved $2.5 billion, largely by avoiding future operating and maintenance costs and additional capital investments.

Both Wisconsin Power and Light and Madison Gas and Electric also own portions of the Columbia Energy Center, and Wisconsin Power and Light also operates a unit at the Edgewater Generating Station scheduled for retirement before the end of the decade. Neither company provided estimates of the values of those facilities at time of retirement. Andrew Stoddard, a spokesman for Alliant Energy, Wisconsin Power and Light’s parent company, argued against treating plants scheduled for retirement with value on the books as future stranded assets.

How stranded assets occurred: overcommitting to coal

In 1907, Wisconsin became one of the first states to regulate public utilities. The idea was that having competing companies installing separate gas or electric lines was inefficient, but giving companies regional monopolies would require regulation.

Utility companies get permission to build or expand power plants and to raise rates from the three-member state Public Service Commission. The commissioners, appointed by the governor, are charged with protecting ratepayers as well as utility company investors.

Stranded assets have occurred across the nation, partly because of the cost of complying with pollution control regulations. But another factor is that, while other utilities around the country moved to alternative sources of energy, Wisconsin utilities and, in turn, the PSC overbet on how long coal-fired plants would operate efficiently:

In the years before We Energies pulled the plug on Pleasant Prairie, the plant had mostly gone dark in spring and fall. Not only had coal become more expensive than natural gas and renewables, but energy consumption stayed flat. By 2016, two years before Pleasant Prairie’s closure, natural gas eclipsed coal for electricity generation nationally.

In 2011, We Energies invested nearly $1 billion into its coal-fired Oak Creek plant south of Milwaukee to keep it running for 30 more years. The plant, which began operating in 1965 and later became one of the largest in the country, is now scheduled to completely retire in 2026 — with $650 million on the books still owed. That will cost individual ratepayers nearly $30 per year for the next 17 years, according to RMI, a think tank specializing in clean energy policy. The majority of the debt tied to those units stems from “environmental controls we were required to install to meet federal and state rules,” WEC Energy Group spokesperson Brendan Conway said.

In 2013, to settle pollution violations, Alliant Energy announced an investment of more than $800 million in the Columbia Energy Center plant in Portage, north of Madison. But by 2021, Alliant announced plans to begin closing the plant, though now it is expected to operate until at least 2029.

Various factors encourage construction and upgrades of power plants.

Building a plant can create upwards of 1,000 construction jobs, popular with politicians. Moreover, the Public Service Commission, being a quasi-judicial body, is governed by precedent. For example, if the PSC determined it was prudent to allow construction of a utility plant, that finding would argue in favor of approving a later expansion of that plant.

The PSC allowed utility companies “to overbuild the system,” said Tom Content, executive director of the Wisconsin Citizens Utility Board, a nonprofit advocate for utility customers. “I think the mistake was that we allowed so much investment, and continuing to double down on coal when it was becoming less economic.”

Utilities “profit off of everything they build or acquire,” Stuart said, “and so there is a strong motivation to put steel in the ground and perhaps to even overbuild.”

Conway, the WEC Energy Group spokesperson, argued that the utilities’ plans to retire plants amount to a net positive for customers.

“We began our power generation reshaping plan about a decade ago,” he wrote in an email. “That includes closing older, less-efficient power plants and building new renewable energy facilities and clean, efficient natural gas plants. This plan reduces emissions and is expected to provide customers significant savings — hundreds of millions of dollars — over the life of the plan.”

Guaranteed profits add to ratepayer burden

The built-in profits that utility companies enjoy, typically 9.8%, add to the stranded assets tab.

When the Public Service Commission approves construction of a new power plant, it allows the utility company to levy electricity rates high enough to recover its investment plus the specified rate of return — even after a plant becomes a stranded asset.

“We give them this license to have a monopoly, but the challenge is there’s no incentive for them to do the least-cost option,” Content said. “So, in terms of building new plants, there’s an incentive to build more … and there’s incentive to build too much.”

When the Pleasant Prairie plant was shut down in 2018, the PSC ruled that ratepayers would continue to pay We Energies to cover the cost of the plant itself, plus the nearly 10% profit. The plant’s remaining value, initially pegged at nearly $1 billion, remained at roughly $500 million as of December 2024.

Eliminating profits on closed plants would save ratepayers $300 million on debt payments due to be made into the early 2040s, according to Content’s group.

New ‘stranded assets’ threat: data centers

As artificial intelligence pervades society, it’s hard to fathom how much more electricity will have to be generated to power all of the data centers under construction or being proposed in Wisconsin.

We Energies alone wants to add enough energy to power more than 2 million homes. That effort is largely to serve one Microsoft data center under construction in Mount Pleasant, between Milwaukee and Racine, and a data center approved north of Milwaukee in Port Washington to serve OpenAI and Oracle AI programs. Microsoft calls the Mount Pleasant facility “the world’s most powerful data center.”

Data centers are also proposed for Beaver Dam, Dane County, Janesville, Kenosha and Menomonie.

The energy demand raises the risk of more stranded assets, should the data centers turn out to be a bubble rather than boom.

“The great fear is, you build all these power plants and transmission lines and then one of these data centers only is there for a couple years, or isn’t as big as promised, and then everybody’s left holding the bag,” Stuart said.

In an October Marquette Law School poll, 55% of those surveyed said the costs of data centers outweigh the benefits. Environmental groups have called for a pause on all data center approvals. Democratic and Republican leaders are calling for data centers to pay their own way and not rely on utility ratepayers or taxpayers to pay for their electricity needs.

Opposition in one community led nearly 10,000 people to become members of the Stop the Menomonie Data Center group on Facebook. In Janesville, voters are trying to require referendums for data centers. In Port Washington, opposition to the data center there led to three arrests during a city council meeting.

Utilities are scheduled in early 2026 to request permission from the Public Service Commission to build new power plants or expand existing plants to accommodate data centers.

Some states, such as Minnesota, have adopted laws prohibiting the costs of stranded assets from data centers being passed onto ratepayers.

Wisconsin has no such laws.

Shifting cost burden to utility companies

Currently, ratepayers are on the hook for paying off the full debt of stranded assets — unless a financial tool called securitization reduces the burden on ratepayers.

Securitization is similar to refinancing a mortgage. With the state’s permission, utilities can convert a stranded asset — which isn’t typically a tradeable financial product — into a specialized bond.

Utility customers must still pay back the bond. But the interest rate on the bond is lower than the utility’s standard profit margin, meaning customers save money.

A 2024 National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners report noted that utilities’ shareholders may prefer a “status quo” scenario in which customers pay stranded asset debts and the standard rate of return. Persuading utilities to agree to securitization can require incentives from regulators or lawmakers, the report added.

In some states, utilities can securitize the remaining value of an entire power plant. Michigan utility Consumers Energy, for instance, securitized two coal generating units retired in 2023, saving its customers more than $120 million.

In Wisconsin, however, utilities can securitize only the cost of pollution control equipment on power plants — added to older coal plants during the Obama administration, when utilities opted to retrofit existing plants rather than switching to new power sources.

In 2023, two Republican state senators, Robert Cowles of Green Bay and Duey Stroebel of Saukville, introduced legislation to allow the Public Service Commission to order securitization and allow securitization to be used to refinance all debt on stranded assets. The bill attracted some Democratic cosponsors, but was opposed by the Wisconsin Utilities Association and did not get a hearing.

Democratic Gov. Tony Evers proposed additional securitization in his 2025-27 budget, but the Legislature’s Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee later scrapped the provision.

Even Wisconsin’s narrow approach to securitization is optional, however, and most utilities have chosen not to use it.

We Energies was the first Wisconsin utility to do so, opting in 2020 to securitize the costs of pollution control equipment at the Pleasant Prairie plant. Wisconsin’s Public Service Commission approved the request, saving an estimated $40 million. “We will continue to explore that option in the future,” Conway said.

But the PSC expressed “disappointment” in 2024 when We Energies “was not willing to pursue securitization” to save customers $117.5 million on its soon-to-retire Oak Creek coal plant. The utility noted state law doesn’t require securitization.

Stuart said that if utilities won’t agree to more securitization, they should accept a lower profit rate once an asset becomes stranded.

“It would be nice to ease that burden,” he said. “Just to say, hey, consumers got to suck it up and deal with it, that doesn’t sound right. The issue of stranded assets, like cost overruns, is certainly ripe for investigation.”

Comprehensive planning required elsewhere — but not Wisconsin

Avoiding future stranded assets could require a level of planning impossible under Wisconsin’s current regulatory structure.

When the state’s utilities propose new power plants, PSC rules require the commission to consider each new plant alone, rather than in the context of other proposed new plants and the state’s future energy needs. Operating without what is known as an integrated resource plan, or IRP, opened the PSC to overbuilding and creating more stranded assets. IRPs are touted as an orderly way to plan for future energy needs.

“There’s no real comprehensive look in Wisconsin,” Stuart said. “We’re one of the few regulated states that really doesn’t have a comprehensive plan for our utilities.

”We’ve been doing some of these projects kind of piecemeal, without looking at the bigger picture.”

Structured planning tools like IRPs date back to the 1980s, when concerns about cost overruns, fuel price volatility and overbuilding prompted regulators to step in. Minnesota and Michigan require utilities to file IRPs, as do a majority of states nationwide.

Evers proposed IRPs in his 2025-27 state budget, but Republican lawmakers removed that provision because it was a nonfiscal policy issue.

Northern States Power Company, which operates in Wisconsin and four other Midwestern states, is required by both Michigan and Minnesota to develop IRPs. “Because of these rules, we create a multi-state IRP every few years,” said Chris Ouellette, a spokesperson for Xcel Energy, the utility’s parent company.

Madison Gas and Electric, which only operates in Wisconsin, argued that its current planning process is superior to the IRP requirements in neighboring states. “A formal IRP mandate would add process without improving outcomes,” spokesperson Steve Schultz said. “Wisconsin’s current framework allows us to move quickly, maintain industry-leading reliability and protect customer costs during a period of rapid change.”

How to influence decisions relating to stranded assets

The devil will be in the details on whether the Public Service Commission adopts strong policies to prevent the expected wave of new power plant capacity from becoming stranded assets, consumer advocates say.

The current members, all appointed by Evers, are: chairperson Summer Strand, Kristy Nieto and Marcus Hawkins.

The public can comment on pending cases before the PSC via its website, by mail or at a public hearing. The commission posts notices of its public hearings, which can be streamed via YouTube.

Among the upcoming hearings on requests by utilities to generate more electricity for data centers:

Feb. 12: We Energies’ request to service data centers in Mount Pleasant and Port Washington. We Energies says the fees it proposes, known as tariffs, will prevent costs from being shifted from the data centers to other customers. The “party” hearing is not for public comment, but for interaction between PSC staff and parties in the case, such as We Energies and public interest groups.

Feb. 26: Another party hearing for a case in which Alliant Energy also said its proposed tariffs won’t benefit the data center in Beaver Dam at the expense of other customers.

To keep abreast of case developments, the PSC offers email notifications for document filings and meetings of the commission.

The PSC would not provide an official to be interviewed for this article. It issued a statement noting that utilities can opt to do securitization to ease the financial burden on ratepayers, adding:

“Beyond that, the commission has a limited set of tools provided under state law to protect customers from costs that arise from early power plant retirements. It would be up to the state Legislature to make changes to state law that would provide the commission with additional tools.”

On Nov. 6, state Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin, D-Whitefish Bay, and Rep. Angela Stroud, D-Ashland, announced wide-ranging data center legislation. One provision of their proposal aims to ensure that data centers don’t push electricity costs onto other ratepayers.

The world has been consumed by the need to decarbonize the energy industry, as it produces the vast majority of emissions that have devastated the environment. Germany has announced that the Boldecker Land wind repowering project is moving ahead following Enova Value being selected to lead the project. The repowering of the project will add approximately 68 MW to the national grid.

The revival of the Boldevker Wind Farm is well and truly underway

Germany has selected Enova to repower the Boldecker Wind farm with 68 MW of new wind turbines. The project will rely on the astonishing wind turbine manufacturing expertise of the Nordex Group, which has become the cornerstone of the international wind power market. The plan is to replace the ten Vestas V80 machines with ten of Nordex’s state-of-the-art N163 turbines across the municipalities of Barwedel and Jembke in the Gifhorn district of Lower Saxony.

Once the repowering project is complete, the Boldecker Wind Farm will generate enough electricity to power up to 43,000 German households. Enova acquired the rights to develop the site when it purchased the existing site from a private equity fund in 2024, and has been working alongside developer Altus to repower the site with the efficient Nordex wind turbines.

Construction on the Boldecker site is set to kick off in Q2 of 2026, with a full-scale commissioning targeted for 2027. Notably, the project was granted approval under Germany’s Federal Immission Control Act only nine months after the plans were submitted, exemplifying Germany’s efficiency when it comes to approving relevant renewable energy projects.

“(This milestone reflects) excellent cooperation – especially with our partner Altus, with whom we started repowering planning immediately after purchasing the wind farm, and the municipalities.” – Fabian Tews, lead project management at Enova

Enova is building its repowering portfolio in Germany through several other projects

Enova was selected to repower the Boldecker site, no doubt due to the success of the nearby 15.3MW Jembke wind farm. The project was recently connected to the national grid and provides the basis for more repowering projects in Germany for Enova. The company has also been selected to repower the Neuferchau wind farm in Saxony-Anhalt.

The site located in Altmarkkreis Salzwedel will see the existing eight NEG Micon 1000 machines, which were installed over 20 years ago in 2001, being replaced by five Vestas V172 turbines. The new turbines will increase electricity generation significantly, producing approximately five times more power than the current fleet of turbines.

Germany’s proclivity for the wind power sector has become evident in recent years

Germany has become the go-to destination for the wind energy market as the nation boasts one of the largest wind power portfolios anywhere in the world. The 21 MW Heinsberg-Boverath wind project in North Rhine–Westphalia has been advancing thanks to the new onshore turbines that the site will feature once completed. The embrace of the renewable energy sector is seen as a byproduct of the need to decarbonize the international energy market over the coming years.

The future of Germany’s energy market will be powered by wind energy

Enova has become a major player in the German energy market and boasts an impressive wind energy portfolio equating to 900MW of wind capacity, and it is not done yet. The firm plans to invest a further two billion euros in wind energy projects over the next two years. Astonishing advancements in wind power technology have shaken up the market, and the expectations are that Germany, along with several other European nations, will continue to foster a welcoming environment for the international energy companies with wind energy plans.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/78.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 17:58:51.735447

The American Affordability Act is a blueprint for the next step in our fight for what we are united to deliver: lower costs and easier, better lives,” Neal said.","A Connecticut member of Congress has joined others in introducing a measure they say is intended to take on “the cost-of-living crisis squeezing families nationwide,” to “expand affordable housing, lower energy bills, cut taxes for working families, help student loan borrowers, and protect households from skyrocketing healthcare premiums.”

U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1, a House Social Security Subcommittee ranking member, said he and Tax Subcommittee Ranking Member Mike Thompson, Calif.-4, and Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member Richard E. Neal, MA-1, introduced the American Affordability Act of 2025.

Larson said the measure includes the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act and Revitalizing Downtowns and Main Streets Act, as the goal is to “expand affordable housing options,” and his Hydrogen Production and Investment Tax Credit Act “to spur the development of clean energy.”

“Americans across the country are getting squeezed by high costs everywhere they look, from energy bills to health care premiums, groceries, and rent,” said Larson, in a statement. “Trump’s cost-raising tariffs, cancellation of clean energy projects, and devastating health care cuts have only made it more difficult for families to make ends meet. While President Trump calls affordability a ‘hoax’ and pushes tax breaks for his billionaire friends, my Democratic colleagues and I are coming together with a real plan that takes on this cost-of-living crisis and cuts taxes for working families, not the wealthy.”

A message seeking comment was sent to the White House.

Larson is facing a primary as other Democrats seek the congressional seat he holds.

CT plans to spend millions from emergency fund. Why some of it might bring a fight.

Thompson said he see that families “are doing everything right” and are “still falling behind as costs keep rising.“

“The American Affordability Act is about real relief for families: affordable housing, lower energy bills, more affordable childcare and healthcare, and bigger paychecks,” Thompson said. “This bill delivers targeted tax relief and smart investments that help families make ends meet and restores the promise that hard work should be enough to get ahead in our country.”

Neal said, President Trump “projects and dismisses affordability fears as a ‘hoax,’” but “Democrats have been and always will be at the front of the fight to lower costs for everyday workers and families.

“Tax Ranking Member Mike Thompson knows that whether it’s tackling the housing crisis, making childcare more affordable, or lowering health and energy costs, we have so much work to do to ease the minds of the American people and foster opportunity. The American Affordability Act is a blueprint for the next step in our fight for what we are united to deliver: lower costs and easier, better lives,” Neal said.

The American Affordability Act seeks, per the lawmakers, to:

Expand Access to Affordable Housing: “Creates the first-ever monthly Renter Tax Credit for individuals and families paying more than 30% of their income on rent and creates a First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit to help low- and middle-income earners; creates a new tax credit to bridge the gap between the cost of building or repairing a home and the home’s value once it is built, powering the development of 500,000 affordable, single-family homes over the next ten years

Incentivizes the conversion of vacant office spaces and other commercial properties into new housing, reserving at least 20% of new units for low-income residents.”

CT kicks in $6 million to clean up ex-UConn campus for massive redevelopment

Also, it aims to increase “the homeowner capital gains tax exemption to encourage more home sales and reduce the cost to buy a home, doubling the threshold to $500,000 for single filers and $1 million for joint filers.”

Lower Energy Costs: “Creates a new 30% tax credit for long-range electric transmission to lower the cost of grid modernization projects, taking steps to prevent mass power outages and lower ratepayer bills; restores tax credits for homeowners to install home energy efficiency upgrades, solar panels, geothermal, and other cost-reducing power sources; spurs the development of American-made clean energy by providing a tax credit to companies that reduce carbon emissions by producing “green” and “blue” hydrogen and fuel cells, [and] authorizes tax credits to purchase new and used electric vehicles and electric bikes.”

Worried about health insurance costs? There may be cheaper options — but with trade-offs

Stop Healthcare Price Hikes: “Permanently extends expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits, protecting 112,000 Connecticut residents from sky-high premium hikes; prevents insurance providers from dropping vaccine coverage due to [new] restrictions, including coverage for MMR, COVID-19 and Hepatitis B shots.”

Cuts Taxes for Families and Workers: “Restores the expanded Child Tax Credit for working parents, providing monthly payments of $300 for each child over the age of six and $360 for each child under the age of six; extends the Earned Income Tax Credit for adults without children and expands eligibility to cover working young adults; permanently extends tax cuts for tipped workers, and expands “no tax on tips” to include automatic gratuities; and expands the $250 teacher expense tax deduction to include early childhood educators.

CT families file discrimination complaints against hospitals over halt to trans care

Make Childcare More Affordable: “Increases the maximum dependent care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) contribution from $7,500 to $10,000, automatically adjusting the contribution limit for inflation; creates a new $5,000 refundable tax credit to cover startup costs needed to open family childcare centers; makes the adoption tax credit fully refundable, opening the door for more low-income families to pursue adoption; and creates a new tax credit to support working family caregivers.”

New student loan rule could dissuade people from advanced nursing degrees

Help Student Loan Borrowers: “Doubles the student loan interest tax deduction for married couples, to $2,500 per person and makes any forgiven student loans tax-free; expands eligibility for the American Opportunity Tax Credit, to support students during the first six years of their higher education with up to $2,000 per year; excludes Pell Grants from income, ensuring aid received through this program is tax-free for students.”

It is still difficult to convince utilities in certain areas of the country to invest in battery storage.
California, Texas, and Arizona alone account for around 80 percent of all U.S. battery storage capacity.
In addition to the United States, battery storage capacity is expanding in various other markets, as governments better understand the benefits of boosting renewable energy reliability.
In Mexico, experts believe the country’s battery storage capacity could expand significantly in the coming years.","The uptake of utility-scale battery storage has grown significantly in recent years as more countries switch to renewables. Battery storage ensures that grids powered by less reliable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, can continue to deliver a stable supply of clean energy through the day and night.

The battery storage boom of recent years has been driven largely by the falling costs of lithium-ion batteries, which have made it possible for utilities worldwide to invest in more batteries. The cost of batteries has fallen by around 90 percent in the last 15 years, as commercial production has expanded. China is currently the world’s biggest battery producer, but several other regions are developing their manufacturing capacity, such as Europe, India, and the United States.

Energy storage additions worldwide are expected to break another record this year, driven by China and the U.S. Global annual energy storage deployment (excluding pumped hydropower plants) is expected to reach 92 GW in 2025, which is 23 percent higher than in 2024. China will contribute more than 50 percent of this capacity increase, while the U.S. will account for around 14 percent. The U.S. contribution of energy storage is impressive, given the difficult year faced by the wind and solar energy industries under the Trump administration. BloombergNEF expects cumulative energy storage capacity in 2035 to reach 2 terawatts, at eight times higher than the level in 2025.

In the United States, battery expansion has been met with mixed success. It is still difficult to convince utilities in certain areas of the country to invest in battery storage. Meanwhile, policymakers are often lukewarm about the technology due to safety concerns. Some local governments have even banned big batteries over safety fears. For example, compared to the speed of renewable energy expansion, the pace at which batteries are being rolled out in the Southeast remains slow.

However, in California, which previously asked residents to reduce their power usage during times of peak demand, battery storage capacity has risen by roughly 30 times since 2018, contributing to greater grid stability. California, Texas, and Arizona alone account for around 80 percent of all U.S. battery storage capacity. Now, across the U.S., storage capacity outnumbers gas power in the queues for future grid additions by a factor of 6.5, according to data compiled by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Several U.S. energy companies that have invested in battery power have been developing their capacity for several years, betting on the future demand in various regions. The storage developer Eolian “began developing projects around major metro areas in the western U.S. starting in 2016 and putting the queue positions in that then became operational in 2025,” the firm’s CEO, Aaron Zubaty, said. This includes the 200-MW coastal battery site at a substation in Portland, Oregon. Moves like this have helped the United States to achieve its 35 GW of battery storage by 2025 goal, despite widespread scepticism.

In addition to the United States, battery storage capacity is expanding in various other markets, as governments better understand the benefits of boosting renewable energy reliability. In Mexico, experts believe the country’s battery storage capacity could expand significantly in the coming years.

Enrique Garduño, the CEO of the energy equipment company Skysense, said that Mexico will likely experience “the storage boom in 2027, 2028, and 2029,” driven by regulatory updates, rapid renewable energy growth, and the maturation of storage technologies. Skysense currently runs almost 200 MWh of storage capacity and expects to roll out an additional 300 MWh by 2026. Garduño explained that “It’s a very open government that is genuinely listening to the private sector.” In addition, “We are buying, installing and selling storage systems at less than half the price of three or four years ago.”

Skysense has partnered with China’s BYD Energy Storage to expand its capacity, and BYD’s “MC Cube-T BESS” platform will power the technology. The firm’s North America Vice President of Sales, Oscar Su, stated, “Expanding into a high-potential region such as Latin America is a key step for us… We bring nearly 30 years of battery R&D and the world’s largest power battery production capacity.”

Meanwhile, there are high hopes for India’s battery storage sector, but more needs to be done to attract investment. The South Asian country has seen record-low bids to develop its battery storage systems, with a lack of economic viability as well as safety risks potentially deterring investors. India is aiming to double its renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, but without a rapid growth in its battery storage capacity, it will be unable to provide a reliable power supply without continuing to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

There has been a battery storage boom in certain parts of the world, as governments and energy companies invest in expanding capacity to support a green transition. However, some parts of the world are lagging, which could cause the shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives to be slower than anticipated unless greater investment is made in the sector.

For a movement so often framed by loss—and confronting a particularly difficult moment—conservation is relearning how to talk about itself. This shift may signal something deeper than messaging: a recalibration of what persuades people to care, to fund, and to act, especially as the world edges toward 2030 amid ecological strain, political volatility, and thinning public trust.

A few months ago, I put out an invitation to the conservation sector: share how you are navigating this moment, which many have described as a period of crisis. That invitation resurfaced recently when Crystal DiMiceli referenced it during a fireside chat with me at the Emerging Wildlife Conservation Leaders’ 20th anniversary event in Washington, D.C.

DiMiceli asked what lessons are emerging so far. One of the most consistent responses has centered on communication: “Less crisis, more agency.”

Not because the crisis has abated, but because alarm on its own no longer mobilizes as reliably as it once did. If anything, it exhausts. Years of grim headlines have revealed an uncomfortable truth: when people are offered only catastrophe, many disengage. They stop reading, stop caring, and, in some cases, stop believing that anything meaningful can still be done.

What seems to be gaining ground instead is a focus on success—often partial, sometimes fragile, but demonstrable. Not triumphalism, but optimism grounded in evidence. Conservation framed as something people actively do, rather than something that merely happens to nature.

This reframing has another effect: it broadens the constituency. When conservation is presented solely as the protection of pristine places or distant species, it can feel remote, even exclusionary. When it is tied to livelihoods, rights, health, and local resilience, it becomes more immediate and more widely owned.

What makes conservation efforts take root and scale

That shift necessarily includes Indigenous peoples and local communities, long treated by mainstream conservation as stakeholders and only belatedly recognized as rights-holders and decision-makers. Initiatives that scale tend to share a simple, if demanding, feature: genuine local leadership. Not consultation after the fact, but ownership from the outset. Programs designed externally may pilot well for a time; they are far less likely to be sustained long-term or adapted elsewhere. Those rooted in place often spread precisely because they are not generic.

Scale, in this sense, is not synonymous with size. It more often emerges from accumulation: many small successes building momentum over time. The idea sounds modest, but it reflects how change actually spreads. Adaptation depends less on grand design than on transparency, data, narrative clarity, and continuous learning. Successful initiatives can point to visible benefits—for example, more fish on the reef, steadier incomes, or safer water—and explain how those outcomes were achieved. They show their work: documenting evidence, acknowledging failures, and describing what was adjusted along the way. That openness builds credibility locally and makes the work easier for outsiders, including funders, partners, and peers, to understand and adapt.

The importance of diversified funding has surfaced repeatedly as well. Conservation efforts tethered to a single donor, funding stream, or specific political moment tend to be brittle. Initiatives supported by a mix of philanthropy, public finance, community enterprise, and earned income are more likely to absorb shocks. In an increasingly volatile funding environment, that diversity functions less as a luxury than as a necessary form of resilience.

The next five years will test whether the sector can meaningfully internalize these lessons. Integrating people and nature is no longer rhetorical garnish; it increasingly shapes whether conservation efforts are perceived as legitimate or extractive. Rebuilding trust through transparency may, in some contexts, matter as much as the number of hectares protected. Narratives are beginning to shift toward agency, though doing so responsibly requires resisting the temptation to overstate what is possible. Technology, deployed with care, can help by lowering monitoring costs, improving access to data, and linking local efforts to wider audiences. Rights and environmental justice will shape outcomes whether or not they are acknowledged. Treating them as secondary concerns is not a neutral stance; it carries consequences that are often both predictable and expensive.

When human well-being and conservation align

One model that illustrates how these threads can come together is Health in Harmony’s “health for forests” approach in Borneo. Rather than asking communities to stop logging because forests matter globally—an argument common in external conservation narratives and one that can feel abstract—the organization begins with a more proximate question: What do you need? Frequently, the answer is access to affordable, reliable health care.

Health in Harmony responds by providing tiered health services, sometimes at no cost, in indirect exchange for verifiable conservation actions such as monitoring forest boundaries or restoring degraded land. The exchange sets clear expectations, but the deeper dynamic is relational rather than transactional. By working from community-identified needs, this approach clarifies how human well-being and forest health reinforce one another. Conservation actions that benefit the forest also support the social and economic stability that communities prioritize. That alignment—rather than the exchange mechanism alone—is what makes the model durable, especially as the sector works toward a target to conserve and restore 30 percent of the planet by 2030.

What journalism reveals about agency and accountability

In this context, the parallels with journalism are hard to miss. Journalism’s core role remains remarkably consistent: to check abuses of power, inform the public, and expand what people consider possible. The conditions under which that work is carried out, however, have grown more demanding. Disinformation spreads faster than corrections. Resources are shrinking across much of the media landscape. Civic space is narrowing in many of the places where environmental stakes are highest.

Still, journalism remains a public good that underpins nearly every other intervention, in conservation and beyond. Without credible information, policies misfire, markets distort, and communities are sidelined. Accountability begins with facts that can be trusted. So, often, does hope.

At Mongabay, our response has been to move closer to the ground: establishing autonomous regional bureaus, expanding multilingual reporting, and deepening partnerships with local journalists. We have tried to pair investigative reporting with solutions coverage, on the premise that exposing wrongdoing matters but so does documenting what works. Not as advocacy, and certainly not as cheerleading, but as evidence. Tracking how information is used—who it reaches, how it circulates, and what it influences—adds another layer of accountability.

This thinking sits behind a phrase that can sound suspect until unpacked: optimism is a strategy. It is not blind positivity. It is deliberate: a form of realism that recognizes despair as paralyzing and treats hope, when grounded in evidence, as a catalyst for action. Hope untethered from facts quickly curdles. But when anchored in proof, it sustains effort. Jane Goodall long articulated this idea, often describing her role as that of a messenger of hope.

There is no shortage of examples. Mountain gorillas have recovered against the odds. Species like the black-footed ferret, kākāpō, and saiga antelope have returned where sustained conservation effort has been possible. Entire island ecosystems have rebounded following the removal of invasive species. Forest loss has slowed in places once written off entirely. These stories are not just inspiring; they are instructional. They offer concrete lessons about what made recovery possible and how similar conditions might be adapted elsewhere.

Telling these stories has become a more intentional part of journalism’s contribution. I was told more than once that Mongabay was among the most depressing sites on the internet, chronicling species loss, forest destruction, and the rising toll of environmental defenders killed for their work. The description stung because it was not entirely wrong. We made a conscious decision to expand our solutions reporting—not to dilute the gravity of the crisis, but to pair it with verified accounts of progress. Not ignoring what is broken, but insisting on documenting what is being repaired and how.

That effort has taken shape through series on Indigenous-led conservation, conservation technology, agroecology and regenerative landscapes, and women at the forefront of community conservation, among others.

This evolution has coincided with another trend: news avoidance. Research from the Reuters Institute suggests that about 40 percent of people actively tune out the news. The reasons vary, but two categories of reporting consistently retain their attention: solutions-focused stories and positive news. That finding loops back to the same insight emerging in conservation conversations: agency matters, even for reader engagement.

Narrative, in the end, is not incidental. Facts alone rarely move people. Stories do. The challenge is to tell stories that are honest about the scale of the crisis while remaining faithful to evidence about what works. If people conclude that nothing can be done, they will not try. If they see that effort yields results, even incremental ones, they are more likely to stay or become engaged. Optimism, in that sense, is an antidote to paralysis.

What sustains my optimism

What sustains my own optimism? Mostly evidence. People doing extraordinary things with modest resources. Recovery demonstrated rather than promised. And a level of awareness we simply didn’t have a decade ago. Thanks to satellite monitoring, bioacoustic sensors, community-generated data, and tools that turn raw information into something visible and undeniable, we can now see environmental change in near real time. Ignorance is no longer a plausible excuse—not because people should have known better, but because the world is now measured and monitored in ways that make the trends unmistakable and clarify what actually works. We can see, for example, where territorial rights reduce deforestation, how local stewardship improves biodiversity, and why Indigenous- and community-led governance is essential for durable outcomes. This transparency is widening the constituency for conservation. As governments, businesses, and new sectors gain clearer insight into how ecosystems function—and how their own well-being depends on them—the case for protecting nature grows stronger. This shift is visible in policies linking ecosystems to human health, the surge of interest in nature-based solutions, and the expansion of forest protection beyond NGOs and forestry agencies into finance, agriculture, consumer-goods companies, and more. And then there is time spent in nature itself, a reminder of both what is at stake and what still endures.

That understanding, and the optimism it makes possible, is also why I have been writing more tributes to those we have lost: people who quietly carried conservation forward, often without recognition or institutional backing. Their passing is a loss, but the purpose of remembering them is not elegy alone. It is to show what one person can do and to leave readers not only saddened, but asking a simple, generative question: what might I carry forward?

Hope, grounded in evidence, is not a mood. It is a method. In conservation, as elsewhere, it is increasingly clear that lasting change depends on it.

Instead, the most prominent American voice in Belém was that of the California governor, Gavin Newsom.

During the five days he spent in Brazil, Newsom described Donald Trump as an “invasive species” and condemned his rollback of policies aimed at reducing emissions and expanding renewable energy. Newsom, long considered a presidential hopeful, argued that, as the US retreated, California would step up in its place as a “stable, reliable” climate leader and partner.

Among the talking points he used to demonstrate California’s leadership was its progress on renewable energy – and the battery capacity needed to store that power.

“We’re running the fourth-largest economy in the world [on] 67%, two thirds, clean energy on nine out of 10 days in 2025,” Newsom said. “Outside of China, there’s only one other jurisdiction in the world – California – that has as much battery storage implemented.”

The Golden state has transformed how it powers its main electrical grid in recent years, setting ambitious targets to create an emission-free grid by 2045 and investing heavily in solar, wind and battery storage. And as the federal government abandons climate initiatives, California seems poised to take on an increasingly important global role.

The state appears to have much to celebrate. Since 2019, the state has added 30,800 megawatts of clean energy and battery storage. And while natural gas still remains the top energy source in the state, that’s on the decline: California saw its largest-ever year-to-year drop in natural gas production this year.

Meanwhile, solar and batteries, which allow energy to be stored for later use, providing an alternative to gas, are stepping up to replace it, said Mark Jacobson, a Stanford professor and renewable energy expert: “This is a remarkable shift.”

‘A leader in the clean-energy space’

When touting his achievements as governor, Newsom has frequently pointed to California’s grid. State lawmakers in 2018 passed a bill requiring California to generate 60% of its electricity from renewable and zero-carbon sources by 2030 and 100% by 2045.

So far, California appears to be on track, Jacobson said. Clean energy accounted for 67% of retail electricity sales in 2023, according to the most recently available data. For the first time, clean energy – which the state recognizes renewables such as as solar, wind, small hydro, geothermal, and biomass, as well as large hydroelectric and nuclear – provided 100% of power to the state’s main grid almost every day for at least some of the day in 2025.

Renewables are booming worldwide and are expected to grow more quickly than any major energy source over the next 10 years with more projects in the next five years than in the last 40, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

California is no exception and is in the midst of what the state’s energy commission (CEC) has described as the “biggest transformation of its power grid in a century”. The state is seeing new solar and battery storage projects in “record numbers” and is expected to soon completely eliminate coal from its power supply, according to the CEC.

Key to this growth has been the expansion of battery storage, a crucial tool to retain the energy produced from renewable sources. In 2019, California had 771 megawatts – by October of this year, it had almost 17,000. The state has 2.5 times more battery storage available than it did in 2022.

The batteries have helped the state avoid rolling blackouts and allowed the California Independent System Operator (Caiso), the non-profit that manages the flow of electricity on the state’s main grid, to store solar energy when there is an excess during the day.

“Then we can use that stored energy and release it in the evening hours when the sun is going down,” said Mark Rothleder, Caiso’s senior vice-president and chief operating officer. “Having a mix of resources that are capable of producing when needed is an important addition as we try to make this transition to renewable resources.”

But, he said, solar and wind are intermittent sources, meaning they can only be generated when there is sun or wind and the state’s main grid continues to rely on gas resources that can be utilized as needed.

Natural gas was the single largest resource for electricity production in 2024, but natural gas generation fell by 8% that year, in part because of the growing role of solar and wind power and enhanced battery storage, according to the CEC.

Nuclear power too plays a role – in 2024, it accounted for nearly 10% of the state’s total electricity generation – although not without controversy. California has been a center of anti-nuclear activism for decades, but supporters argue it could be a crucial tool to provide reliable power as the state transitions from fossil fuels.

While natural gas may be on the decline, it’s far from obsolete – and is relied on as a critical backup during times of peak energy usage. California has nearly 200 natural gas plants that provide roughly a third of the state’s electricity generation, said Julia Dowell, a senior campaign organizer with the Sierra Club.

“California is seen as a leader in the clean-energy space,” Dowell said. “But we’re really struggling to figure out how we meet demand in those evening hours when we’re seeing the most electricity demand, and that’s historically when we’ve relied on gas plants.”

A 2025 report from Regenerate California, which Dowell helped author, found that batteries are a less expensive and more reliable alternative to gas plants, and reduce toxic air pollution.

“They can directly compete with gas plants, and they can provide even more benefits because of their ability to ramp up so quickly,” said Heena Singh, with the California Environmental Justice Alliance and a report author. “That’s something that is important in California, where we have all these heatwaves and natural disasters.”

Fending off the Trump administration

California has long been a frequent target of Trump’s White House – and strife has only intensified during his second term.

With Trump back in power, the federal government has been focused on expanding fossil fuels and putting a damper on seemingly any effort to reduce emissions. The White House has proposed offshore lease sales along California’s coast. The president blocked California’s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2030, and his EPA terminated a $7bn program to bring solar energy to low-income communities.

The administration cancelled $679m in funding for offshore wind developments across the US – California was expected to see about $427m for a project to build the first offshore wind terminal on the west coast. Months earlier, California and nearly 20 other states successfully sued after the federal government moved to pause offshore wind development.

More lawsuits are expected. The state attorney general’s office has established an office dedicated to pushing back against the president’s agenda.

Republicans and the Trump administration have also sought to blame the transition to renewable energy for high utility bills – California has some of the most expensive in the nation. But experts attribute those costs to power companies passing the costs of wildfires to customers.

Despite these pressures, California’s energy transition is well under way – and unlikely to reverse course.

“You’re going to see California fiercely litigating every single effort of the federal government to undo the fight against climate change and the fight against clean energy,” said Noah Perch-Ahern, an environmental attorney. “I think that’s going to continue for years.”

Meanwhile, advocates and experts hope to see California continue to expand clean energy with more rooftop solar projects that can reduce demand on the grid, and ultimately phase out gas plants.

“We’re just really hoping that people start to recognize that we don’t need these gas plants,” said Maia Leroy, an author of the Regenerate report, adding that there are significant costs to keeping them running even when the state isn’t using them for power. “It’s time to shut them down. It’s an expensive insurance policy.”

She’s hopeful California will continue to move ahead despite the federal obstacles.

“We made it through the first Trump administration. California survived, and we never once went back on any of our clean-energy goals. And so I don’t foresee that being an issue again this term,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a52e0ac7a3e03ca88697f8b319f8afbb6758a41c/0_0_3326_2662/master/3326.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c173087b932f3d6945853459afbe6063",N,,2025-12-20 10:59:23.995073

There are 27,000 known brownfields, or sites contaminated with pollutants, dotting Michigan. Many of them are locations where factories once stood.

About half are what the state calls “orphan sites,” meaning there’s no responsible party that owns the land and would otherwise have to clean up the pollutants, said Phil Roos, the director of the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

“Sometimes people don’t even want to touch it if they don’t know the nature of the contamination or can’t address it,” Roos said.

That’s why the state is funding restoration projects, offering developers grants of up to $2 million, he said.

The grants cover assessing what the contaminants are, the best ways of removing them and often helping with the first stage of clean up, Roos said.

“Because we have a lot of these sites around the state, we need to de-risk it by providing some funding that will allow whoever’s developing the site to raise capital to do the development, knowing that it’s safe and they don’t have to address those issues any further,” he said.

The grants stem from the state budget for RenewMI which allocates $77 million. RenewMI is the department’s environmental remediation program.

When brownfields are cleaned up, they can be revitalized and turned into new housing developments, parks, commercial establishments or new industrialization.

The Lugnuts Stadium in Lansing, home to a minor league professional baseball team, is on a former brownfield, Roos said.

Since 2019, the state has been funding brownfield cleanup. The department has done 474 redevelopment projects in 50 communities, leading to $184 million in incentives and creating over 20,000 jobs, he said.

Those projects included the Grayling Northern Market and the Grayling Sawmill in 2018. The Grayling Northern Market used to be a planing mill and lumber yard, while the sawmill was a hotel, saloon and stores.

There have been four brownfield clean-up projects since 2020 in Traverse City. The most recent project in 2025 is Grandview Vision.

The site used to be an ice cream factory, and an antique store is on the property next door, according to Environment, Great Lakes and Energy’s website.

Cadillac has also seen four brownfield projects, including one in 2025 to clean up a former dry cleaners, grocery store and retail buildings.

In the past year, there has been an influx of housing developments built on cleaned-up brownfields. Roos said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has made those projects a priority because of the state’s housing shortage.

“We can, in many cases, make it so there’s no threat to public safety and turn them into beautiful places to live,” he said.

However, not every brownfield site is equal, said Mike Witkowski, the director of environmental and regulatory policy at the Michigan Manufacturers Association.

Some “legacy sites” like abandoned gas stations and factories have contaminated an area to the point where the amount of money needed to clean it for residential development is unrealistic, he said.

There are different standards that dictate what brownfield sites can be used for while helping to prevent human exposure to harmful chemical pollutants, he said.

Those especially contaminated sites can still be cleaned up to meet standards for things like new industrial development.

“If you can come through and say, ‘All right, let’s turn this into a parking lot or another industrial setting and keep it at those standards’ – that’s really not only the best way to handle those contaminants, but it’s also the most economically sound for the state and private investment,” Witkowski said.

He said the number of existing brownfields makes it impossible for the state to clean all of them, meaning private developers cleaning up sites is all the more important.

“One of the best things we can do is have a robust and really well-functioning brownfield redevelopment program that allows these new private investment dollars to come in and say, ‘Hey, we want to build here on this site and not only are we going to provide jobs, but we’re also going to help clean up the the contaminants there and make this space usable property again,’” Witkowski said.

The Michigan Manufacturing Association opposes a bill currently in the Michigan Senate that would add additional clean-up standards, and extend liability for developers, saying it would likely discourage private investment into brownfields, he said.

“It really complicates it in a problematic way, which we feel is going to lead to less cleanups and less investment in our industrial sites and really more expansion into green space developments where there’s never been a development or any industry before,” Witkowski said.

He said the current brownfield program as it stands has been sufficiently vetted by the state and environmental engineers. It’s helped the economy grow across the state and has been successfully cleaning up contaminated sites.

“To try and bring that in a little bit or make change is going to hurt the trajectory of our environmental cleanups and economic growth,” Witkowski said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b3499a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/611x321+14+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F73%2F86%2F1c7acc524413a55593fb648f78ec%2Fdetroitriverwalk.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 12:58:58.171226

He talks to George Morahan about the evolution of DockChain and how the company plans to expand to meet demand across the world

Four years ago, Hugh Sheehy and his business partner John Goodbody were approached by University College Dublin (UCD) about developing DockChain, a technology patented by the university that can extend a single electric vehicle charger to multiple cars at low cost.

The technology was invented at UCD by Professor Robert Shorten and his team, who subsequently moved to Imperial College London where Shorten heads the Dyson School of Design Engineering.

At the time, Sheehy and Goodbody were working on another EV business for the British market. But they felt there was greater global potential in commercialising DockChain and co-founded Go Eve to deliver on the technology’s promise.

“It’s not often you get a chance to do something that’s potentially good for the planet and where you can make a little bit of money at the same time,” Sheehy says of his initial thoughts on DockChain, adding that he saw a “big opportunity” in the idea.

DockChain was conceived for home usage to allow people to extend their slower alternating current (AC) chargers, but Sheehy and Goodbody turned their focus to ‘behind-the-fence’ fleet operators, workplaces and local authorities — organisations with a greater need for multiple EV chargers.

The pair first had to confirm if the intellectual property covered faster, more powerful direct current (DC) chargers and if the idea worked as well with DC charging.

“If those two things were true, that was where we felt the market was for the next several years,” Sheehy says over a KitKat at the NovaUCD café.

After establishing Go Eve, Sheehy and Goodbody canvassed the industry to test interest in the idea and tried to build a viable product that could be built at a reasonable cost.

They built the first “crude” prototype with a grant from the UK’s Department for Transport. The software it used was similarly homemade.

Sheehy was assisted by Ammar Malik and Pietro Ferraro, who are now part of Go Eve’s engineering team.

The company raised £3.5 million stg in 2023, which they used to expand their software and hardware teams, buy components and build new versions of the product, pay legal and business costs and attend trade shows around the world to drum up interest.

Go Eve now has a core staff of 10 and around 14-16 full-time equivalents.

In August, DockChain received UL 2202 certification, the North American standard for safety and performance.

It is now in use at “a handful of locations” in the US and EMEA, including SAP’s Citywest offices and the Detroit headquarters of Stellantis, the parent group of Chrysler, Citroën and Opel among other car brands.

The business model is relatively simple — selling DockChain hardware and monthly software subscriptions — but how does the technology work? Well, it uses ‘daisy chain’ architecture to connect charging outlets, or “docks” as Sheehy calls them, at multiple parking spots with a single third-party EV charger.

DockChain uses an open-source charge management system from SAP known as an open charge point protocol (OCPP) to manage all the docks, recognise when cars are connected and authorise the charger to turn on and off.

Go Eve’s cloud software sits over the top, managing the OCPP, handling sequencing and other functionality.

In theory, DockChain can be integrated with any EV charger. Go Eve has agreed deals with several makers including Taiwan’s Zerova, although the firm is in the process of completing compatibility testing with other major manufacturers.

Two cars can charge simultaneously. At the SAP site in Citywest, the DockChain has 10 ten parking spaces — five on the left of the central charging terminal and five on the right.

Employees will arrive at the office, park their cars and plug them into DockChain.

The charger might be in use when they pull up, but their car will charge when it reaches the front of the queue and they’ll get a message on their phone when it’s done.

“Typically you’ll have a car charging, a space empty, a car charged, a car queued, another car queued and the system will just rattle through and charge them all in sequence,” Sheehy says.

In terms of output, a 150kw EV charger will by default share power equally between the two vehicles being charged. But there are variables such as battery size and space capacity that affect the current received by each vehicle.

Recalling the reactions of people in the EV charging industry when he showed the performance numbers for the DockChain at SAP, Sheehy says “they look at us a little bit like ‘that’s not possible.

You can’t charge that many cars with that power. You’d have to have military organisation to make that work.’”

Kilkenny native Sheehy is described on the Go Eve website as “a former oilman who saw the light”. Indeed, after training as a mechanical engineer, he worked as a developmental engineer at Shell for nearly a decade.

Daniel Plainview he is not though. Sheehy quit the industry in the late 1990s and completed an MBA at the prestigious INSEAD business school in France, later moving to Barcelona to work as a consultant.

Sheehy and his young family would settle in Dublin when he joined Google during the global financial crisis.

He went on to hold senior leadership positions with BNP Paribas, ESB and Morgan McKinley prior to starting Go Eve.

He’s not cagey by any means, and he’ll talk about DockChain at length. But when asked about the company’s projections for the coming years, Sheehy elides numbers, chiefly because he thinks his confidence in the product is off-putting.

With that said, Sheehy expects DockChain to become “omnipresent” in the US over the next five to seven years as the country reaches its EV tipping point.

“All startups do this, so it can sound a bit [crazy], but it’s the hockey-stick effect. As we get a couple of marquee customers, the pull from the other side will come,” he predicts.

“At the moment, people have it in their heads that there’s two ways of charging fleets, AC or DC and that’s it… but as we get some marquee customers, that’s going to change to AC, DC and DockChain as well. We will see a big ramp up.”

Having achieved the UL certification, Go Eve is now raising $3.5m to develop its commercial and marketing capabilities and add staff in sales and engineering.

The business is intentionally structured in such a way that it does not require much capital to fill larger orders — manufacturing has been outsourced to third parties in Hertfordshire and Michigan, while installation is handled by local partners.

If an organisation wanted to install DockChain at 1,000 locations over the next 18 months, Sheehy says Go Eve could raise additional capital to expand production, and he anticipates many such orders soon.

He recently spoke to a potential customer in the US who was thinking about installing DockChain at 30 sites in one state as a first step.

Another prospective client apologised to him for having only 480 car dealerships.

“Are there 480 dealerships in Ireland?” Sheehy wondered.",https://businessplus.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/go-eve-LI.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 14:58:53.693768

The Sessions The three sessions followed a similar format, although, as detailed below, the session held in North Dakota differed somewhat.
Other than the opening remarks provided by the Agencies, the purpose of the sessions was for the Agencies to receive verbal comments on the Proposed Rule.
The North Dakota session was organized and presented differently from the others.
Responding to these regional conditions is one of the many issues that are worth tracking as the Proposed Rule goes through the regulatory process.","As part of their proposed rule (Proposed Rule) to revise the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) (collectively, Agencies) hosted three public comment sessions in which they received verbal comments from those in attendance. Two of the sessions were held in person with virtual attendance options – Bismarck, North Dakota on December 12, 2025, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 15 – while the third session, on December 16, was fully virtual. EPA’s website contains additional details on the sessions, including draft agendas that list individuals who pre-registered to speak.

Background

As Nossaman previously detailed here, the Agencies are seeking to revise the definition of WOTUS and, thereby, what features would or would not be regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Because of the significant regulatory burden associated with being subject to CWA jurisdiction and permitting, the definition of WOTUS has been frequently litigated. The U.S. Supreme Court has weighed in on four separate occasions, and the Agencies have revised the definition four times in roughly a decade.

The Proposed Rule generally focuses on limiting federal jurisdiction through narrowing what qualifies as a WOTUS. More information on the rulemaking can be found here.

The Sessions

The three sessions followed a similar format, although, as detailed below, the session held in North Dakota differed somewhat. Representatives from the Agencies opened each session by explaining the need for the Proposed Rule. The Agencies stated there were three objectives served by the Proposed Rule: fully implementing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, 598 U.S. 651 (2023); cutting red tape to reduce costs; and protecting water quality by striking the right balance between state and federal authority. They also highlighted that they were seeking clarity, certainty and durability while requesting information on regional differences and tools to implement any final rule.

Each session lasted between 3 and 3.5 hours. Other than the opening remarks provided by the Agencies, the purpose of the sessions was for the Agencies to receive verbal comments on the Proposed Rule. As a result, the Agencies did not answer any questions from those in attendance. The sessions were recorded for internal use, although the Agencies plan to post transcripts to their respective websites.

The North Dakota session was organized and presented differently from the others. The first half of this session (i.e., pre-break) was hosted by U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) rather than by the Agencies. Senator Cramer, Senator John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong all voiced support for the Proposed Rule and opposition to the existing framework. The commenters during this part of the session included local government officials and business leaders, all of whom voiced their support for the Proposed Rule. It was also unique because no list of commenters was provided. The second half of this session set the stage for the following sessions, as it was led by the Agencies, included a list of pre-registered speakers (both online and in-person) that was provided to the observers and provided an opportunity for other commenters after that.

The Pittsburgh session included the least participation of the three. Like the North Dakota session, it included a mix of online and in-person commenters, providing mixed views on the proposed rule.

The fully remote session was the most well attended, again providing mixed views on the proposed rule.

The Comments

Across the three sessions, there were roughly 75-100 commenters. The comments were split nearly 50-50, with a slight edge over all of the sessions in commenters opposed to the Proposed Rule. However, the North Dakota and Pittsburgh sessions included more supportive comments whereas the remote-only session included more opposition comments. Many commenters requested the comment deadline be extended given the importance of the rule and the various holidays that fall within the comment period.

The following list summarizes the most common points made by commenters and is not intended to be exhaustive:

Comments in support

Common sense rule that can be instituted without the need for experts or lawyers and reduces uncertainty

Consistent with Sackett and other WOTUS precedent

Cuts red tape and lowers costs

Returns jurisdiction back to states, tribes and landowners, all of whom know their land better than bureaucrats

This rule is durable and should stop the back-and-forth of the past decade over WOTUS

Supporters often advocated for a strengthening of the Proposed Rule, listing the need for more clarity on significant terms such as continuous surface connection, relatively permanent and wet season. They also advocated for more clarity/a strengthening of essentially every exception that is listed, with ditches receiving the most attention. Supporters also advocated for tools and other guidance to assist with implementation.

Comments in opposition

Ignores the science on these issues, in particular the impact of wetlands, ditches and other now-excluded areas that impact traditional navigable waters

Features like intermittent streams and ephemeral streams have a substantial impact on navigable waters

Shifts costs away from those responsible onto the public

Especially the case with the loss of protection for wetlands, which provide flood control and other services that protect citizens

Contrary to the intent of the Clean Water Act, which has overwhelming support in public polling

Polls show that people want more protection, not less

Bad for public health

Does not protect tribal rights

A giveaway to polluters/developers/is political in nature

Next Steps

Written comments can be submitted until January 5, 2026, on www.regulations.gov; commenters must mention Docket ID EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

Given the number of commenters on both sides of the Proposed Rule requesting changes to it, it seems likely that the final rule could differ in some meaningful ways from the proposal. One area that the Agencies discussed was ensuring that the Proposed Rule properly reflected local conditions; they expressed a desire to ensure that the definitions and guidelines in the rule were clear enough to easily implement while also being crafted in a way to take into account regional differences in watershed conditions. For example, the commenters from North Dakota were supportive of the fact that prairie potholes did not qualify as WOTUS (although some wanted that more explicitly stated in any final rule) while one from Alaska discussed that this rule did not align with physical watershed conditions in Alaska. Responding to these regional conditions is one of the many issues that are worth tracking as the Proposed Rule goes through the regulatory process.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15042_2153.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 15:59:08.483660

From a rich history and culture, to magnificent art, exquisite food, and wine; all are iconic designs screaming “la dolce vita!” Now we have more reason to love Italy, as an Italian company has introduced colored solar panels into our existence, with colors including red, green, and even orange. One cannot help but be overjoyed over the fact that aesthetic appeal is being integrated into renewable technologies, and now, it’s coming to America!

Integrating aesthetic appeal into renewable technologies

In our modern world, traditional solar panels have slowly but surely become the norm in renewable energy production. However, that does not mean that everyone has become quite accustomed to them, particularly how they look. For most, the traditional solar panel is a headache, because:

They ruin scenic views (visual pollution)

They require too much land

They cannot be installed on all building types

They do not look visually pleasing on most buildings

Fortunately, the world is filled with several innovative minds who come up with pioneering solutions. An Italian company designed high-performance photovoltaic panels, which were initially available in all-black and could be easily installed on exposed roofs and even building facades. Now, the company has taken its popular designs one step further by introducing colored solar panels, integrating aesthetic appeal into renewable technologies.

Colored solar panels are arriving in America

This Italian company is none other than FuturaSun, located in the heart of Veneto. FuturaSun revolutionised the photovoltaic industry with its building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), and what’s more, these revolutionary designs are arriving in America. According to a Solar Business Hub report, FuturaSun already has an annual production capacity of 1 GW through its plants in Taizhou/China.

With so many architects, designers, and engineers shifting their focus to more aesthetically pleasing designs, the colored solar panels are bound to add to America’s innovative renewable energy technologies. The company decided to release colored SILK® Pro panels, which are derived from monocrystalline half-cut multi-busbar cell technology.

A selection of colors to choose from

According to the company’s website, there is a selection of solar panel colors to choose from in addition to the all-black, which include:

SILK® Nova Silver

SILK® Nova Green Duetto

SILK® Pro Orange

SILK® Nova Orange

SILK® Nova Orange Duetto

SILK® Nova Red

To broaden customers’ design choices, they can now also choose the color of the solar panel’s frame, which is available in black, aluminium, or any other color on request. The silver panel’s modules range between 280 Wp and 295 Wp. The orange modules range between 240 Wp and 255 Wp, and the red modules range between 230 Wp and 245 Wp.

Additional benefits of the colored solar panels

Consists of two independent sections to increase power consumption in partial shading

Produces high output even in high temperatures

Well-suited for traditional buildings

Useful for renovations on roofs with tiles and/or brick tiles

Can be used to flank historic architecture and modern architecture

Can be installed on pitched roofs

Can be installed on facades

Enhances design options

15-year product warranty

25-year performance warranty

American homeowners and businessowners thus have something extremely exciting to look forward to, as FuturaSun’s color and pro lines are arriving in the country. Please note that the price of these panels is highly variable and will depend on the project’s location, system components, project size, and the local panel distributor. You can get a more accurate price by contacting a local distributor, which can be found on FuturaSun’s website. As buildings become unique, colorful power-producing machines, it seems people can also become power generators with clothing cut from solar cloth.

Porsche AG unveiled an electric version of its popular Cayenne sport utility vehicle, one of the models developed under an ambitious EV push that the luxury-car maker has since scrapped.

With a starting price of €105,200 ($121,760), the Cayenne Electric will be able to charge wirelessly and provide almost 400 miles of range, beating the longest-range Tesla Model Y offered in Europe.

The car’s debut in November came at an awkward time for Porsche. The German manufacturer is pivoting back to combustion-engine and hybrid models following weak demand for luxury EVs including its Taycan. Porsche reported its first quarterly loss as a listed company last month, and has cut its guidance four times this year in a slump that’s also weighed on parent Volkswagen AG. The poor performance saw the stock drop out of Germany’s benchmark DAX index.

As part of its EV pullback, Porsche shelved a new electric SUV range positioned above the Cayenne and delayed other battery-powered models. The automaker, which has also been hit by weak sales in China and US tariffs, has overhauled its top management and is trying to push through more cost cuts.

Porsche expects an improvement from 2026, when former McLaren Automotive Ltd. boss Michael Leiters takes over from Oliver Blume as chief executive officer. His knack for hybrids may help the company as it retools its portfolio.

In the meantime, Porsche is looking to the new Cayenne to bolster EV sales. Introduced more than two decades ago, the combustion-engine model has consistently ranked among Porsche’s top-selling vehicles and helped the company expand from a sports-car brand into a broader luxury nameplate.

Its new electric sibling is decked out with in-car gadgets including a head-up display and a voice assistant powered by artificial intelligence. It’s the first Porsche that can charge its battery by parking over an inductive floor plate.

A pricier Turbo version, starting at €165,500, delivers the equivalent of up to 1,156 horsepower and can reach 100 kilometers per hour in 2.5 seconds. That’s on a par with Ferrari NV’s Elettrica electric supercar and makes it the most powerful production Porsche ever, the company said.

With 40 stalls and a mixture of 150-kW and 400-kW chargers, it’s one of the largest stations in Illinois. There are CCS1 and NACS connectors available for maximum compatibility.

Additionally, the hub includes a covered canopy and free Wi-Fi. The site benefits from the adjacent BP-branded gas station, which has a convenience store, coffee shop, and restaurants nearby.

For BP Pulse, providing EV charging at major airports like ORD is a strategy. The network has already deployed EV charging hubs at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), near San Francisco International Airport (SFO), near Boston Logan Airport (BOS), near Houston’s Hobby Airport, and Fort Lauderdale (FLL) International Airport. Sites like these are dual-purpose — for ride-hail drivers and local EV drivers.

Sujay Sharma, CEO of bp pulse Americas, said:

“Opening our sixth major airport hub is a significant milestone in our commitment to expanding our EV charging network across the United States. By strategically placing our hubs in high-demand locations like airports, we’re making it easier for drivers to access the fast and reliable charging they need. Locating this hub next to a bp retail site also means EV drivers can benefit from the convenient amenities already offered to customers today.”

Large EV charging hubs are expensive to install. BP Pulse’s latest charging hub at Chicago’s ORD was funded partially through a $500,000 rebate from ComEd (through its Make Ready Rebate program) and partially through a $320,000 grant from the Illinois EPA’s Driving a Cleaner Illinois Program (one of over 300 EV charging projects, with total funding of $50 million).

But before we get to that, what does the new edition of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Index look like?
Isn’t climate pollution a racial justice issue since communities of color and marginalized groups disproportionately feel the effects of corporate pollution?
Indeed, isn’t it most likely to expect an increase in corporate greenhouse gas pollution in the years ahead?
So we might see efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions even in the face of the current administration’s hostility to greenhouse gas regulation.","Since 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required large industrial facilities to report their greenhouse gas emissions. The data, which the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has been collecting since 2011, is essential in efforts to reduce emissions and provides vital information to the public about climate pollution from the largest U.S. polluters. However, the Trump EPA has proposed to put an end to greenhouse gas reporting by major polluters. This move is consistent with the Trump administration’s intent to make climate denial an official U.S. policy and restricts the public from the right to know. Subsequently, it will deprive communities from having access to a critical tool for holding pollutants accountable.

Researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have been using EPA data for many years now to rank the top U.S. polluters and disseminate vital information to the public. They publish their findings annually and have just released the 2025 edition of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Index. In the interview that follows, Michael Ash, professor of economics and public policy and co-director of PERI’s Corporate Toxics Information Project, shares the latest data on the top U.S. climate pollutants and discusses the consequences of the potential end of EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program in the fight against climate change and climate justice.

C.J. Polychroniou: For many years now, the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst has been providing a valuable service to public interest in general and to activists in particular by collecting and releasing information and analysis on corporate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions through its Corporate Toxics Information Project. Last month, the 2025 edition of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Index was published, using the latest data available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The index takes on new significance since the EPA has announced plans to end the program, which amounts to an erosion of the people’s right to know. But before we get to that, what does the new edition of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Index look like? Which corporations are the top climate polluters in the country, and have there been any significant changes in total emissions and rankings from last year?

Michael Ash: The top of the list remains similar; the biggest point emitters of greenhouse gases are the electrical power companies that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. Topping the list are Vistra Energy, Southern Company, and Duke Energy. Their combined 235 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions made up just under 4 percent of all U.S. contributions to climate change that year (including all sources, such as automobiles, airplanes, and home heating, not just industrial emitters). Again, the top of the list are the fossil electricity generators. Next come the major oil refiners and petrochemical processors, such as Exxon Mobil (at the number 7 spot); and that is only accounting for the direct releases from their facilities, not the releases from the fuels that they bring into the economy. (For that, see our companion list of Toxic 100 Suppliers.)

This list has been stable for some years; a company may move up or down by a position or two based on acquisitions or sales of facilities, but the list is entirely recognizable from year to year.

In which states do companies emit the most heat-trapping gas that feeds climate change, and which corporations have the highest share of residents of color living close to their polluting facilities?

We have prepared state-specific lists of greenhouse gas releasers. We stay at the company level, because the company is the crucial decision-making unit, but in each state, we rank companies based on the facilities they own in the state. The big petro states, Texas and Louisiana, top the list, by quite a lot. Fossil electricity generation is widespread; so almost everywhere has a share. A petroleum-processing industry can make individual states stand out. For example California is near the top of the state list (at number 7) because of large refineries; the top five greenhouse-gas-releasing facilities in the state are refineries owned by Marathon Petroleum, Chevron, Valero, and PBF energy, even though the electricity sector as a whole is responsible for more greenhouse gas releases in California.

We think that the state listings are particularly important in this era of diminished local news capacity. This is the type of inquiry that local news sources might pursue in the public interest.

In addition to the absolute impact rankings, we also take a look at the share of people of color living near companies’ pollution-emitting facilities. At first glance, it might seem odd to look at local populations when greenhouse gas emissions are a global problem, but almost all the greenhouse gas emissions we examine are from combustion and, hence, coupled with the release of local pollutants. These local pollutants that come with the greenhouse gases are called co-pollutants, including sulfur oxides, nitrous oxides, and particular matter, as well as a host of toxics. In addition to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, some companies among the Top 100 Greenhouse emitters that have a particularly high share of people of color (people categorized as “minorities” in this study) living near their facilities are the chemical company LyondellBasell (72 on the overall greenhouse emissions list, with people of color composing more than 75 percent of the population within 10 miles of their plants) and BP (50 overall, with people of color composing more than 75 percent of the population near their facilities). Marathon Petroleum (14 overall) and Valero Energy (19 overall) are other high emitters with people of color composing more than 70 percent of the population near their facilities. Forty-one of the companies on the top 100 list have their emissions near populations that are more than 50 percent people of color. The country as a whole is around 40 percent people of color; 63 of the top 100 companies exceed that share in their impact.

These local co-pollutants add to the case for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For those who harbor the view that greenhouse gas emissions are a problem for the future — a shortsighted view in my opinion, but people face a variety of constraints — the health benefits of reducing co-pollutants are local and immediate. We’d see fewer hospitalizations for asthma, less COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], fewer cases of cancer when we stop burning fossil fuels near vulnerable populations. I’m not necessarily a fan of placing dollar values on human life and health, but by reasonable estimates, the health benefits of the co-pollutant reduction alone are as big as the climate benefits. There’s a potential very large improvement in the quality of the air that we all breathe, with special benefit for the vulnerable, such as children, older people, and communities that are heavily exposed to the burden of cumulative pollution.

Isn’t climate pollution a racial justice issue since communities of color and marginalized groups disproportionately feel the effects of corporate pollution?

Climate pollution is a justice issue for a host of reasons, including the disproportionate impact of the local co-pollutants on marginalized groups, but also because climate vulnerability, for example, to extreme weather events, is higher among marginalized groups.

The Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars in clean energy projects nationwide, seeks to revive the coal industry, and contends that the EPA has no legal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Under these new government approaches to pollution and climate change, what incentives would U.S. corporations have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Indeed, isn’t it most likely to expect an increase in corporate greenhouse gas pollution in the years ahead?

The actual and pending regulatory changes at EPA are deeply troubling.

One sign of hope is that some states have enacted and many are considering state-level Climate Superfund Bills. These bills would hold corporations responsible for climate change accountable for costs of adaptation, remediation, and disaster recovery. The bills are modeled on the Superfund legislation (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980) that sought both to recover damages and to finance cleanup from the effects of corporate toxic dumping. New York and Vermont have passed bills, of varying stringency, and legislation has also been introduced in Oregon, California, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, Virginia, and Tennessee. There is plenty of corporate pushback against these Climate Superfund bills, and we should expect to see contentious fights in the coming years. But the main point is that these laws — and the potential for a federal law if there are changes in the control of the federal government — provide significant incentives for corporations to consider future liability in making decisions about greenhouse gas emissions. So we might see efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions even in the face of the current administration’s hostility to greenhouse gas regulation.

Ending the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which has been tracking the climate emissions of major polluters for the last 15 years, constitutes an unmistakable attack on the right-to-know movement. However, do you think that the Trump administration’s intent to stop collecting greenhouse gas data from thousands of facilities across the United States will have an impact on environmental activism? And what effect in particular would the killing of Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program have on PERI’s efforts to continue to provide the public with valuable information and analysis on U.S. corporate pollution?

As you indicated, the EPA is in the process of eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, the regulatory program that makes these crucial right-to-know data available to the public. This fall EPA carried out a “Reconsideration” of the program which would outright eliminate most of the reporting requirements and suspend the remainder until 2034.

We are still assessing the future of the Greenhouse 100 without the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program was extraordinarily valuable because it was mandatory and uniform – it provided a clear look at greenhouse gas pollution from U.S.-based facilities, and it was hard to cherry pick or to greenwash. The problems don’t go away when the reporting goes away, of course, and I expect that environmental activism will continue. It will simply continue with less information, and this important tool won’t be available to the full set of stakeholders, including socially responsible investors, environmental and community activists, state and local regulators, and even companies themselves as they seek to improve their operations and benchmark against comparison companies. It’s a right-to-know disaster and it means that all of us will be operating in the dark.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2150288315-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 09:58:47.113887

Mandates, surcharges, restrictions and regulatory decisions enshrined into law are the reason why energy prices in New York are less affordable than elsewhere. These high energy prices make it harder to live and work in New York.

New York utilities are forced, by law, to charge you with a “delivery fee” which is actually a subsidy for renewable energy companies; the money is collected through your energy bill and passed along to renewable energy companies to artificially lower the cost of producing renewable energy sources, like wind and solar. Not only does that jack up the price you pay but, it also wrecks havoc on the energy market.

As a result of renewable energy subsidies, paid by you, the customer, New York’s nuclear energy producers have become more unprofitable. Since it is too expensive for nuclear energy companies to operate in New York State, the state subsidizes nuclear energy profits. Guess who pays for that? You do.

Moreover, New York has made it harder for energy companies to source affordable power from within the state. We sit on some of the most reliable natural gas reserves in the country, yet Albany Democrats have blocked pipelines, prohibited new development, and forced utilities to import natural gas from Pennsylvania, Ohio and even Canada. Every mile of transportation adds cost. Those costs are passed directly to you.

It gets worse. New York mandates are requiring homes, businesses, and vehicles to become all-electric based upon arbitrary dates and for a purely ideological purpose. Even the delay of those mandates (whether from the governor’s arbitrary benevolence or from a legal challenge) causes unnecessary anxiety and increased costs. Who bears the cost to switch a house, vehicle, or business to all-electric? You.

Additionally, Albany Democrats never accounted for the cost to implement those mandates or the infrastructure needed to supply a statewide massive increase in electricity. We know that peak load times will cause issues with our grid. To meet those peak loads, utilities will need to build new transmission lines, new substations, new storage facilities and new backup capacity, very little of which has been funded by Albany. Is it any surprise that utility companies are asking for rate increases to pass these costs onto you, the consumer?

According to the state Comptroller’s July 2024 audit, New York hasn’t even calculated the full cost of this transition. The audit states plainly that the state has no viable funding plan, no accurate cost estimates and no backup strategy for implementing technology, like long-duration storage, that doesn’t exist yet at scale. Yet, Albany Democrats continue to stand by their deadlines, mandates, and penalties as though these realities don’t matter creating an unaffordable energy crisis in New York.

The government should not be making it harder on its own citizens. New Yorkers deserve honest, transparent, and affordable energy choices. We can and need to fix it. We should focus on removing or reducing the state-mandated surcharges and hidden fees that quietly inflate every electric bill. You deserve to know exactly which portion of your bill goes to state mandated subsidies. We should eliminate unfunded electrification mandates that pressure homeowners, small businesses and local governments to replace heating systems, vehicles and appliances. Rather, we should permit consumer choice.

We must restore access to New York’s own abundant energy resources, like natural gas, and support the responsible permitting of local energy development, expand nuclear generation and strengthen cogeneration, as the reliable backbones of grid stability.

We should subject New York energy, including renewable energy sources, to the free market. Market competition will fuel a better, safer, and lower priced product. My goal is straightforward: an energy policy grounded in engineering and common sense, that strengthens the grid, meets the energy needs of all New Yorkers, and which lowers your energy bills.

Achieving both may seem impossible, but Pennsylvania proves otherwise. Over the last decade, the Keystone State has aptly demonstrated that states do not need to sacrifice energy development in favor of heavy-handed Green New Deal-style restrictions.

Pennsylvania lawmakers arrived at this conclusion on the heels of a four-month budget impasse. The monthslong stalemate ended when Gov. Josh Shapiro and the General Assembly agreed to a significant compromise: The Keystone State would formally resign from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).

RGGI, commonly referred to as “Reggie,” is a multistate cap-and-trade program. Under RGGI, states cap a specific amount of carbon emissions and then auction off emissions allowances to energy producers.

Pennsylvania has had a long and complicated history with RGGI.

In 2019, Gov. Tom Wolf unilaterally entered Pennsylvania without a legislative mandate. However, since only the Pennsylvania General Assembly has the legal authority to tax, the Commonwealth Court ruled that the carbon tax was unconstitutional. Shapiro, despite stating his “real concerns” about RGGI on the campaign trail, sued to stay in the compact. However, thanks to Pennsylvania Republicans who fought tooth and nail during budget negotiations to codify a RGGI exit, that appeal won’t see its day in court.

Like most “green” energy proposals, RGGI would have come with significant costs. One economic model estimated that RGGI would increase Pennsylvanians’ electric bills by 30 percent. Indeed, this model is somewhat dated: RGGI allowances have increased since its publication, so the actual cost is likely higher.

RGGI has already wreaked havoc outside of Pennsylvania. One estimate suggests that RGGI would add more than $1.8 billion in annual costs to the 13 states (including Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia that comprise the regional grid managed by PJM Interconnection.

Considering these costs, Pennsylvania, which generates nearly one-fifth of PJM’s net electricity and leads the nation in electricity exports, couldn’t afford to compromise its robust energy sector.

The Keystone State serves as a great case study against RGGI. In 2025, Pennsylvania’s Independent Fiscal Office (IFO)–an independent nonpartisan agency that analyzes statewide policies–revealed that, between 2019 and 2024, carbon emissions in Pennsylvania decreased by 9 percent while the commonwealth’s electricity generation increased by 5 percent.

Yes, you read that right: Pennsylvania increased production and decreased emissions–all without RGGI.

How did the commonwealth pull this off? Two words: natural gas.

The Marcellus Shale boom propelled Pennsylvania into one of the nation’s largest producers of natural gas — second only to Texas. Since natural gas burns cleaner than coal, Pennsylvania’s emissions dropped precipitously.

Pennsylvania isn’t alone. Natural gas has been a leading national driver in emissions reductions. Between 2005 and 2019, the United States removed about 819 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Of that total, the U.S. Energy Information Administration attributes nearly two-thirds of the reduction to natural gas.

Meanwhile, RGGI states come nowhere close to matching Pennsylvania’s numbers. RGGI states have not so much cut emissions as they have exported them. A 2018 Congressional Research Service report found that electricity generation in non-RGGI states increased by 8 percent during the first years of RGGI auctions.

Due to their decreased in-state generation, RGGI states have relied on electricity-exporting states to make up the difference. A Cato Institute study found that, between 2007 and 2015, RGGI states doubled their electricity imports.

RGGI was, at best, a solution in search of a problem. The cap-and-trade program hampers affordable energy generation, jeopardizes grid reliability, and stalls out economic competition.

Meanwhile, Pennsylvania’s exit from RGGI couldn’t have come at a better time. With abundant and affordable energy readily available, the Keystone State is well-positioned for next-generation technology and industry–namely, artificial intelligence (AI).

Considering the energy needed to power the massive data-processing infrastructure that AI demands, unleashing Pennsylvania energy from the restraints of heavy-handed policies makes the most financial sense. By choosing to focus on market-driven energy solutions rather than cap-and-trade schemes, Pennsylvania has maintained its competitive edge in hosting these future industries and leading the nation in energy innovation.

Pennsylvania offers a clear roadmap. Exiting RGGI will prove to be a smart stride forward into an energy-abundant, innovation-driven future. Pennsylvania has demonstrated that states can have it all: They can lower emissions, increase electricity generation, export power, and build cutting-edge industries–all at once. Most importantly, they don’t need a top-heavy regulatory environment to do so.

States on the fence about their RGGI membership–Virginia in particular–should follow Pennsylvania’s lead.

Wes Moore on Tuesday announced an executive order directing state agencies to identify ways to reduce rising electricity costs, as residents across the state face sharply higher utility bills.

Moore said electricity rates in Maryland have increased by 44 percent since 2020, with some households seeing their bills double between the winter of 2024 and the winter of 2025. The administration attributes the increases to several factors, including growing demand on the energy grid from data centers, aging transmission infrastructure, and the retirement of power plants.

The order, titled ""Building an Affordable and Reliable Energy Future,"" is not a law but a directive outlining priorities for Moore’s administration. It calls on state agencies to accelerate the development of new power generation and strengthen the state’s electric grid.

Among its key provisions, the order seeks to streamline the siting and construction of power plants by identifying locations where facilities can be built more quickly and by offering incentive packages to developers. It also encourages the use of state-owned land and rights-of-way for new battery storage facilities and high-capacity transmission lines, addressing what officials describe as outdated power lines across Maryland.

In addition, the executive order asks the Maryland Public Service Commission to review the billing practices of utilities, including Pepco, as part of a broader look at consumer costs.

Moore emphasized that the order is a starting point rather than an immediate fix.

“These important actions don’t guarantee lower bills next month,” Moore said. “We need our private-sector partners — many of whom are multi-state and multinational conglomerates — to feel the same urgency that we feel.”

Republican leaders criticized the governor’s approach. House Minority Leader Jason Buckel blamed long-standing Democratic energy policies for Maryland’s dependence on imported electricity.

“The radical energy policies pushed by the Democratic supermajority over the last two decades have driven energy producers out of our state,” Buckel said in a statement. “Until we address the issues at the heart of the problem, Marylanders will continue to see their electric bills soar.”

Countries with ample fossil fuels like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Norway, and Qatar will become richer and more influential.
In this still fossil-fuel dominated world, Canada will have great cards to play and now may even be willing to play them.
In an ideal world, energy growth would be a common agenda in North America, faced with challenges from Russia, the Middle East and China.
Asia is a boom market for fossil fuels, and Canada could enrich itself hugely through this trade.","Sometimes policy change is necessitated by reality. The welcome new entente cordiale between Ottawa and Alberta, fast tracking new energy developments, marks a pleasant example.

This is all the more remarkable since Prime Minister Mark Carney, was once a leading voice against fossil fuels; as head of the Bank of England, he led the charge for banks to bankroll the much-ballyhooed transition to renewables. Yet a decade later, he appears to have shifted from a “net-zero” crusader to seeking to become “an energy superpower.”

What changed? This corresponds to the global weakening of climate hysteria. As Matt Ridley noted recently in the Spectator, extreme claims of an imminent collapse of humanity, so promoted by the likes of Greta Thunberg and groups like Extinction Rebellion, have lost their credibility on everything from sea-level rise to imminent mass starvation. To be sure, some media — like the New York Times or John Stewart’s “The Daily Show” — are still predicting massive dislocation in the near future, with Manhattan poised to be soon engulfed by rising waters. But this seems little more than an anti-Trump laugh line.

Nothing better illustrates the climatistas’ decline than the largely ignored COP 30 climate conference in Brazil, which attracted few world leaders. The rejection comes from a growing realization that solar and wind cannot power growing economies, something now widely accepted outside academia, mainstream media, and the NGO complex. As Axios recently reported, Democratic congresspeople have all but abandoned talk about “the Green New Deal,” even amidst their never-ending denunciations of all things Trump.

The shift gained more credibility when the magazine Nature recently retracted a 2024 study predicting economic collapse due to climate change. Reality has started to bite, even in my home state of California, a bastion of climate hysteria. Governor Gavin Newsom, an avid supporter of net zero, earlier this year basically fell on his knees before Big Oil in April, when two companies announced they were shutting their Californian oil refineries as a result of oppressive green regulations. He also kept the state’s last nuclear plant going.

As they shy away from climate catastrophism, resurgent progressives in the U.S. focus rightly on issues like cost of living, medical care, and jobs. They realize very few working class voters — now up for grabs in the next election — actually prioritize climate policy; in a recent Monmouth poll, just one percent of working-class (non-college) voters identify climate change as the biggest concern facing their families. Recent U.S. polling reveals that belief in predominately manmade climate change is now at 45 per cent, according to Pew, and enthusiasm for spending money on climate initiatives has plummeted.

Perhaps even more surprising, politicians in deep-green Europe are beginning to recognize that green obsessions undermine their own industries. Net-zero policies, notes a recent OECD study, have doubled the rate of job losses in high-carbon jobs, which traditionally paid higher salaries to mostly male, non-college educated workers than the retail, tourism and other low-end service jobs that replaced them. Virtually all the places with the highest energy costs are those with the strictest renewable policies — Germany, California, and the U.K. Overall, British, Italian and Germany industrial users pay roughly twice more for electricity than the U.S. or Canada.

So, here’s the reality: oil and gas remain the dominant source of energy, with even coal, a dirtier fuel than natural gas, making a comeback. Despite billions spent by governments — taxpayers — to subsidize renewables, global hydrocarbon use, notes energy expert Robert Bryce, is not only thirty times larger than wind and solar combined, but is also growing faster. In the last decade, the world added 9,000 terawatt-hours per year of energy consumption from wind and solar but 13,000 from fossil fuels.

Adding to the power grid is increasingly important with the rise of artificial intelligence. This appears to be leading to greater fondness among oligarchs and investors faced with a desperate need for reliable, affordable energy, which solar and wind are not. Now, some embrace nuclear power, long verboten among the green activists they so generously funded.

This shift away from tough climate policies will shape global politics for the next decade or more. Countries with ample fossil fuels like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Norway, and Qatar will become richer and more influential. Other, more troubled oil producers, like Russia, Iran and Venezuela are able to survive, in the face of awful governance, only because they still have their share of “black gold.” The developing world, notably Africa and India, will either develop their own resources, or import huge quantities.

In this still fossil-fuel dominated world, Canada will have great cards to play and now may even be willing to play them. These are also Canada’s biggest exports; it is the world’s fourth largest crude exporter. Like the United States, the world’s leading energy producer, Canada’s influence will be tied to its natural resources.

Canada’s embrace of energy production also constitutes a way to work against fossil-fuel-funded malefactors like Iran, Qatar, Venezuela, and Russia. It is also a way to counter China, which emits more GHGs responsible for more than 30 per cent of global carbon emissions as of 2024, twice the American share.

China, which lacks huge oil or gas resources, has seized on Western climate policies as a way to penetrate markets for solar panels and electric vehicles. This leads to praise from some greens, but the Middle Kingdom is not exactly abandoning fossil fuels; indeed, its EV and panel industries rest on power generated by its over 3,000 coal-power plants, which accounted for 64.4 per cent of global emissions in 2023.

In an ideal world, energy growth would be a common agenda in North America, faced with challenges from Russia, the Middle East and China. But Donald Trump’s misplaced idea of national interest makes such cooperation difficult for now. So, Canada will need to find other markets for crude and other commodities, precisely what proposed West Coast LNG and pipelines would address. Asia is a boom market for fossil fuels, and Canada could enrich itself hugely through this trade.

This is the moment for Canada to assert its economic power and tell us Yankees that you can play the “great game” of power politics, too. Carney’s shift also provides an opportunity — after a decade of disappointment — to get the country back on track and reassert itself as one of the world’s great liberal democracies.

The utility has justified that scale by pointing to forecasts of booming electricity demand due to new data-center construction.
In recent weeks, however, even Georgia Power has reduced its data-center demand projections.
Georgia Power can expect to profit handsomely from the commission’s decision.
To avoid passing extra costs onto consumers, Georgia Power would need gigawatts’ worth of data centers to be built and to continue buying electricity for decades.","The Georgia Public Service Commission on Friday approved a controversial plan that will allow the state’s biggest utility to commence one of the largest new fossil-fuel buildouts in the country — a move that critics fear will raise utility bills for most Georgia residents over the coming years.

The last-minute settlement was approved unanimously by the five commissioners, all Republicans. The vote came just weeks before two of those commissioners are set to be replaced by Democrats who won upset victories in the November election by running on the issue of energy affordability.

Back in November, staff at the PSC recommended that the commission allow Georgia Power to build only about one-third of the nearly 10 gigawatts of new gas-fired power plants and batteries the utility had requested. Friday’s decision instead gives it the go-ahead to move forward on building the full total.

The utility has justified that scale by pointing to forecasts of booming electricity demand due to new data-center construction. In recent weeks, however, even Georgia Power has reduced its data-center demand projections. And across the state and the country, concerns are rising that the boom in artificial intelligence that is driving data-center investments may be a bubble about to burst.

That’s why PSC staff deemed the utility’s full buildout plan too risky — and why energy experts and consumer and environmental advocates oppose it. Should Georgia Power build all of that infrastructure while data-center demand fails to materialize, its customers would be forced to pay higher bills for the unnecessary power plants.

“It is a massive financial gamble,” said Jennifer Whitfield, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, one of several groups protesting Georgia Power’s gas-heavy buildout plan. ​“The bottom line is that we don’t need this much energy based on the data that’s been provided.”

The PSC staff expect the plan to raise average household utility bills by about $20 per month, or possibly more if gas prices rise or data-center demand fails to show up, according to testimony from November. Those costs would be layered on top of six rate hikes since late 2022 that have already increased average residential bills by $43 per month, and which helped propel the two incoming Democratic commissioners to victory in November.

Georgia Power can expect to profit handsomely from the commission’s decision. The utility revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week that the plan would allow it to invest $16.3 billion in ​“company-owned projects” — capital investments on which the utility earns a guaranteed rate of return.

To avoid passing extra costs onto consumers, Georgia Power would need gigawatts’ worth of data centers to be built and to continue buying electricity for decades.

Right now, it’s highly uncertain whether those data centers will ever show up.

“[O]nly a fraction of the requested capacity is backed by data center customers that have signed contracts for electric service, and even less have signed contracts covered by the protections contemplated in the Commission’s new rules and regulations,” the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Sierra Club wrote in a briefing filed with the commission. ​“With no data center customer committed to pay for most of the capacity Georgia Power is requesting for the entirety of the assets’ lifetimes, ratepayers will inevitably be on the hook.”

PSC staff in November testified that only about 3.1 gigawatts of Georgia Power’s buildout should be approved right away, based on the number of data centers that have executed contracts with the utility. It also proposed allowing about 4.3 gigawatts more on condition that additional data centers sign definitive contracts by March 2026.

Indeed, PSC staff’s forecasts of demand growth between now and 2031 were far lower than Georgia Power’s: about 6 gigawatts less under a ​“lower large-load materialization assumption,” and about 4 gigawatts less under a ​“greater large-load materialization case.”

Utilities and regulators across the country are struggling to manage similar mismatches between the unprecedented boom in proposed data centers and the increasing uncertainty that those plans will come to fruition.

When the new Democratic commissioners take office next month, it’s unclear whether they’ll be able to adjust the plan or rein in costs.

Foes of the plan are pressing commissioners to use their authority to force Georgia Power to update its load-growth forecasts and report on changing costs for the power plants it plans to build, and to retract approval for spending plans that may no longer be justified by growing demand.

But Whitfield noted that Friday’s vote by the commission authorizes Georgia Power to begin charging customers for the expenses it incurs to build and procure the resources approved by the plan.

“If in the future the commission were to modify its certification order — which it could — Georgia Power would still be able to recover any costs it incurred up to that point,” she said.

It’s also unclear whether the settlement agreement will force Georgia Power to follow through on its public pledges to limit the impact of its data center–driven investments on everyday customers, Whitfield said. Her group filed a motion earlier this week asking the commission to order Georgia Power to provide more information about its plan to use revenue from data centers and other large customers to put ​“downward pressure” on rates for typical residential customers.

“There are so many loopholes in the financial assurances that staff tried to achieve when it entered into this stipulation,” she said. ​“The end result is nearly meaningless for a typical Georgia Power customer … The reality is, we just don’t have any reassurance that all of us aren’t going to be on the financial hook for it.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-976036186-c.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=c5c64e5f78783c1834605b553b906ef8,N,,2025-12-20 17:58:56.399364

The merger between Trump Media & Technology and TAE Technologies could lead to one of the world’s first publicly traded fusion energy companies, the two companies said Thursday.

What is TAE Technologies?

TAE Technologies is a private company based in Foothill Ranch, Calif. It has been raising funds for commercial-scale nuclear fusion, a method of energy production that supporters say could revolutionize access to electricity. Founded in 1998, the company has built and operated five fusion reactors and raised more than $1.3 billion.

Fusion uses the same process that powers the sun to produce potentially limitless energy. Experts say it hasn’t been achieved on a large scale because the process is volatile and expensive. TAE is trying to develop the technology needed to reduce the size, cost and complexity of fusion reactors.

“Our talented team, through its commitment and dedication to science, is poised to solve the immense global challenge of energy scarcity,” TAE Chief Executive Michl Binderbauer said in a statement. “Recent breakthroughs have prepared us to... commercialize our fusion technology.”

What is the political history of Truth Social?

Truth Social was launched in 2022 as Trump created an alternative to mainstream social media, which was increasingly restricting and blocking his posts and profiles, as well as those of his allies and supporters. It began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange through a 2024 merger with a special purpose acquisition company.

While most social media platforms have lifted restrictions on Trump’s posts, he still primarily posts on his own platform.

Though Trump and companies he is associated with control more than a 40% stake in the company, much of his investment is managed by others to avoid a conflict of interest during his term as president. Some analysts suggest his indirect association with a new company in a highly regulated industry could also lead to issues.

TAE will need significant investment and regulation to advance, which makes Trump’s ties a major conflict, Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, told the Associated Press.

“He’s jumping into this industry just like he jumped into cryptocurrency a couple of years ago,” Painter said. “Just as the United States government is gonna get all involved in it. And it’s so obvious that there’s a huge conflict of interest.”

Trump Media shares, which had fallen more than 80% from their 2024 peak, have skyrocketed around 50% since the deal was announced.

The company now has a market value of more than $4.5 billion.

Why are the companies merging?

The parent company of Trump’s social media site, Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology, previously had little to do with energy production. The company agreed to merge with Alphabet-backed TAE Technologies, with the aim of paving the way for easier access to abundant electricity.

The merger aims to help both companies diversify and raise more money.

It is an attempt to combine Trump Media’s “significant access to capital” with TAE’s “leading fusion technology,” the companies said in a release.

They plan to begin construction in 2026 on the first-ever utility-scale fusion power plant.

“Fusion power plants are expected to provide economic, abundant and dependable electricity that would help America win the AI revolution,” the release said.

The boom in popularity of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has created a seemingly insatiable new demand for power.

The Georgia Institute of Technology says modern AI data centers use as much electricity as a small city. As AI models grow, they demand even more power.

What are the terms of the deal?

The all-stock transaction announced this week values each share of TAE Technologies at $53.89, although it is a private company. Trump Media has agreed to provide $200 million in cash to TAE upon closing, expected in mid-2026.

When the merger is complete, TAE and Trump Media shareholders will each own about 50% of the combined company.

The amendment does not apply to onshore wind or solar energy projects, but the bill also did not explicitly address new administration rules that complicate their federal approvals.
Other key provisions include narrowing the scope of what is considered a “major federal action” for triggering NEPA, and establishing a 150-day limit for NEPA claims and challenges.

“It can be a bit arduous … so something like the SPEED Act could help expedite the process.” Eleven Democrats voted for the bill in the House, including chief cosponsor, Rep. Golden.","The U.S. House of Representatives ended its legislative session for 2025 by passing a permitting reform bill aimed to shorten timelines for major federal infrastructure projects and reduce delays caused by what bill sponsors describe as “frivolous” litigation. After passing the House, the bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is expected to take up the measure in 2026.

While the bill, known as the SPEED Act (Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act), has some measure of bipartisan support, it passed the House Dec. 18 by a divided 221-196 vote, with several Democrats objecting to a late-stage amendment that bars it from being applied for offshore wind energy projects, which could face Trump administration delay or cancellation.

The amendment does not apply to onshore wind or solar energy projects, but the bill also did not explicitly address new administration rules that complicate their federal approvals.

The original legislation, introduced by House Natural Resources Committee Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Jared Golden (D-Maine), would have limited the executive branch’s ability to reverse earlier decisions to advance projects following reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Other key provisions include narrowing the scope of what is considered a “major federal action” for triggering NEPA, and establishing a 150-day limit for NEPA claims and challenges.

Environmental advocates were sharply critical of the legislation even while acknowledging that there is room to streamline project reviews. Matthew Davis, former federal environmental scientist and League of Conservation Voters vice president of federal policy, said in a statement that “the extreme amendments to the SPEED Act fueled by misinformation that explicitly attack clean energy reveal the bill for what it always has been: a fossil fuel giveaway that cuts out community input and puts our health and safety at risk.” He added, “Congress should be focused on real solutions to skyrocketing energy prices starting with stopping Trump’s effort to ban clean energy and speeding up the approval of grid improvements and clean energy projects that are cheap and quick to deploy.”

Natural Resources Defense Council President and CEO Manish Bapna said in a statement that although there could be a “conversation to be had” about reforming the review process, the SPEED Act should be a “non-starter” in the Senate.

Construction Industry Support

Construction industry groups generally support the legislation. Associated Builders and Contractors’ vice president of government affairs Kristen Swearingen said the SPEED Act would “provide project sponsors and contractors with greater certainty to plan, invest and deliver even the most complex construction projects—certainty that is essential to meeting the nation’s infrastructure needs.”

Sean O’Neill, senior vice president of government affairs for the American Cement Association (formerly known as the Portland Cement Association), told ENR that the bill would expedite construction of necessary energy, transportation, flood control and other kind of essential infrastructure projects.

He noted that in the cement manufacturing sector, cement is not only a vital material for construction projects, but that also, many cement suppliers are considering reducing carbon emissions at their manufacturing facilities by adding carbon capture and sequestration technologies. Those upgrades can themselves trigger NEPA reviews, he said. “It can be a bit arduous … so something like the SPEED Act could help expedite the process.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill in the House, including chief cosponsor, Rep. Golden. “Being a good steward of our environment doesn’t mean we must tolerate a years long permitting process that is onerous, overly complex and ripe for litigation abuses,"" he said after the passage. ""We need robust power production that does not discriminate between energy sources. These investments will create jobs, support our economy, keep prices down and help us maintain energy independence.”

Trump loyalists Andy Harris (R-Md.), Chris Smith (R-N.J.) and Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), who proposed the amendment, said a legislative fix was essential to allow the administration to continue to be able to cancel offshore wind projects, particularly in Maryland and New York, where many efforts are under development but face hostile opposition from the administration. Many actions to cancel or hamper offshore wind projects have also been met with state lawsuits or renegotiations to allow them to proceed.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/12/19/Westerman-at-hearing_Web.png?height=635&t=1766176712&width=1200,N,,2025-12-20 14:58:44.311835

This plan means more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia’s future,” said Georgia Power’s chief Kim Greene.

“We’re being asked to risk our health and wellbeing so Georgia Power shareholders can get richer.
Without seeing the calculations, she said the public is forced to accept Georgia Power’s promises on faith.","Georgia regulators unanimously approved a massive expansion of the state’s power grid Friday, approving Georgia Power’s request for nearly 10,000 megawatts of new energy capacity despite concerns over transparency and the potential financial risk to ratepayers.

The vote by the Public Service Commission greenlights a plan that relies heavily on new fossil fuel infrastructure, with five new natural gas plants to meet surging demand from the growth of data centers. While supporters argued that the expansion is needed to keep growing the state’s economy, the hearing was dominated by debate over whether the utility has provided enough evidence that an agreement between commission staff and Georgia Power allows at least $8.50 per month in “downward pressure” on residential rates.

Following the vote, Georgia Power celebrated the decision, saying that the new revenue from large customers will directly benefit families.

“We know every dollar counts. This plan means more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia’s future,” said Georgia Power’s chief Kim Greene. “Unlike any other market in the country, we’re doing things differently here in Georgia to capture and serve this projected unprecedented growth. Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that’s a great result for Georgians.”

Commission Chair Jason Shaw said after the hearing that the commission did its “duty” to ensure companies coming to Georgia have power.

“Our job is to deal with growth,” he said.

But opponents of the power expansion criticized commissioners for potentially failing to protect residential customers from the cost of building massive power infrastructure largely to power data centers, which includes the addition of five new methane gas-burning units at plants Bowen, McIntosh and Wansley. Critics have argued that there is no guarantee the forecasted demand will come to fruition.

“Today, commissioners chose to put this $60 billion risk on the backs of everyday Georgians, not Georgia Power. They had the chance to meaningfully protect existing customers, and they did not,” said Bob Sherrier, a staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, in a statement.

Critics also questioned the morality of the decision in light of the utility’s financial performance. Southern Company, Georgia Power’s parent company, reported earning $1.7 billion between July and September of this year, an increase from the same period last year.

“We’re being asked to risk our health and wellbeing so Georgia Power shareholders can get richer. It’s immoral and unjust,” said Codi Norred, executive director of Georgia Interfaith Power and Light.

Abe Scarr, energy and utilities program director for Georgia PIRG, which is a public interest research group, said that if the projected demand from data centers fails to materialize or cover costs, ratepayers will face long-term consequences.

“If the demand doesn’t show up, if data centers fail to cover their costs, and when gas prices spike again, Georgia Power customers will be left holding the bag for decades to come,” Scarr said.

Environmental advocacy organizations filed a motion Wednesday aimed at delaying the decision until Georgia Power provided the data behind its projections, specifically the math supporting a promise that the new industrial usage would help lower residential rates.

“This motion right now is not about whether their math is right or wrong. It’s about showing their work,” said Jennifer Whitfield, an attorney with SELC, to the commission. Without seeing the calculations, she said the public is forced to accept Georgia Power’s promises on faith.

The motion to delay was ultimately denied Friday. Brandon Marzo, representing Georgia Power, dismissed the interveners’ concerns, telling the commissioners that Whitfield was “confused by the facts” and that the necessary information was already available in the record.

Marzo framed the massive capacity request as an urgent response to economic expansion.

“The state is growing, commissioners,” Marzo said. “The load is coming.”

He insisted that the influx of large industrial customers would benefit residential ratepayers by spreading costs over a larger base. He said that Georgia Power’s projected $8.50 monthly savings for the average customer.

Commission staff came to an agreement with Georgia Power but warned that the years 2029 through 2031 would be critical for monitoring progress to ensure that Georgia Power’s promised $8.50 “downward pressure” pledge would materialize.

“It will be the responsibility of this commission to observe, to engage and if needed to act,” said commission attorney Chris Collado.

Environmental and consumer advocacy groups remained skeptical. Sherrier reminded the commission of past promises that ultimately fell short, saying that similar promises were made that the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear expansion would not be passed down to ratepayers. He advocated for the staff’s original recommendation of “conditional certification,” which would have approved resources only after contracts with new customers were signed.

“If they’re wrong and the load doesn’t commit, conditional certification ensures that we don’t have to pay for those resources. We don’t have to pay this round,” Sherrier said.

Curt Thompson of the Sierra Club echoed these concerns, saying that “no amount of alleged downward pressure on rates can ensure that the customer bills won’t go up.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC06778-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 11:59:48.748118

Under the state’s Public Utilities Act, the utility companies are allowed to petition the ICC to recover capital expenses incurred above their projected budgets. The ICC ruled that the full amounts requested — $268.5 million for ComEd and $59.6 million for Ameren Illinois — were not proven by the utilities to be “reasonable and prudent.”

The ICC shaved off $25.4 million from ComEd’s request and $11.2 million from Ameren’s.

That means typical residential customers of ComEd in northern Illinois and Chicago can expect to see their monthly electric bills increase by an average of $3.10 per month, according to a company spokesperson. That is slightly less than the $3.41 increase customers would have seen if the ICC had approved ComEd’s full request.

Ameren’s request was expected to increase rates by $0.39 per month for typical residential customers in central and southern Illinois, if approved in full. With the reduced amount approved, the company expects current electric delivery rates to remain relatively unchanged.

In both cases, the new rates will go into effect in January. Precise impacts on customer bills will depend on service class and energy usage levels.

Accountability

ICC Chairman Doug Scott said in a statement that the decision was intended to hold the utilities accountable for their performance.

“The ICC’s decision today reiterates that unsupported departures from Ameren’s approved grid plan are inconsistent with the goals of the grid planning process, and it is the utility’s responsibility to prove that any adjustments made are reasonable and prudent for maintaining our power system,” Scott said. He released a parallel statement regarding ComEd.

Under Illinois’ Clean Energy Jobs Act, passed in 2021, the ICC has the power to reject utility rate hikes that they deem cost inefficient. Before the passage of the CEJA, rates were set by a formula — a system that critics said lacked adequate consumer protections.

ComEd disagreed that the disallowed costs were unreasonable and imprudent, saying in a statement that the costs were used for necessary system improvements and maintenance.

But Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board praised the ICC for “weeding out wasteful and inappropriate spending.”

CUB pointed to recent rate hikes granted to both companies and argued that utilities should be disallowed from filing reconciliation requests altogether.

“We will always challenge wasteful spending by the utilities,” Moskowitz wrote in a statement earlier this month. “And, while consumer protections have improved, we support ending this reconciliation benefit for utilities. If Ameren blows through its budget in a given year, customers shouldn’t have to pay the excess.”

The commission approved revised grid plans with rate increases for both companies last year. The ICC granted rate increases of $606 million for ComEd and $308.6 million for Ameren, both to be spread through 2027.

For ComEd, the ICC declined to approve recovery of overrun costs related to ComEd’s “mismanaged” customer care and billing rollout last year, finding the costs to be “imprudently incurred.”

Moskowitz agreed that ComEd customers shouldn’t have to pay for the utility’s “incompetence.”

The commission also refused to make ratepayers cover $10.7 million to reimburse Ameren shareholders for contributions to the company’s employee retirement benefit fund.

CUB said Ameren could not prove its shareholders made those contributions. The ICC, which had found the proposal “inconsistent with Commission practice and law” at least three times prior, said in its ruling that it found no reason to come to a different conclusion this time around.

As part of the decision, both utilities will also be required to submit affordability data and cost benefit analyses of related grid plan projects in future reconciliation requests. That rule is intended to help the ICC and other stakeholders analyze the companies’ performance in meeting its goals.

“Governor Hochul remains resolved to providing more affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for New Yorkers.""
“So I need all the champions of this (climate) law,” Hochul said.
The downstate electric grid is now nearly totally reliant on natural gas since the shutdown of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in 2021.
But we’ll see.” Thomas C. Zambito covers energy, transportation and economic growth for the USA TODAY Network’s New York State team.","In mid-November, the Hochul Administration agreed to pause a law that threatens to cut into fossil fuel industry profits by requiring new buildings seven stories or lower to have electric heat and appliances.

The law backed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in 2023 represented a victory for the state’s clean energy advocates, one that would reduce planet-warming carbon emissions in buildings — a leading source of greenhouse gases — keeping them from fouling the air for decades to come.

State Republicans waged a relentless campaign to undermine the idea, casting it as another costly, green energy mandate designed to separate New Yorkers from their gas stoves and furnaces.

So the administration’s November pivot — delaying the law’s January start while a legal challenge from the natural gas industry plays out — was viewed as a betrayal by some of Hochul’s fellow Democrats.

It was the word they repeated over and over during a conference call the day after the announcement. Brooklyn Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes said the governor’s “two-steps-forward, one-step back” approach to climate initiatives wasn’t working. Hochul needed to go on the offensive against a president who entered the White House declaring it was time to “Drill Baby Drill,” others declared.

“Now is the time to stand up and fight for what we know is right, for what science tells us is right,” Assemblywoman Dana Levenberg, a Hudson Valley Democrat said.

“It just doesn’t make sense,” she added. “The all-electric buildings law is forward-looking legislation that makes environmental and economic sense particularly when you consider the higher cost of natural gas delivery versus electricity.”

Hochul’s decision to delay the law’s implementation has turned up the volume on criticism from climate advocates on the left who are questioning the governor’s commitment to the cause and threatening payback if things don’t start to go their way.

Climate advocates condemn the pause as a setback

Days before news of the all-electric buildings pivot broke, Food and Water Action, the political arm of the influential environmental watchdog, announced it was endorsing Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado in his long shot bid to unseat Hochul in June’s Democratic primary, saying he was “willing to stand up to corporate polluters.”

The endorsement came after the Hochul Administration approved a controversial gas pipeline in New York Harbor favored by the Trump Administration.

“It’s very obvious that the kind of play nice, insider politics has gotten the climate movement nothing with this governor,” said Alex Beauchamp, the northeast region director of Food and Water Watch. “It doesn’t mean it can always get you nothing, but it certainly has with her. We’ve seen what happens when you sort of trust that they’ll do the right thing. That is not going to work. She is going to have to feel unrelenting pressure. And that’s what we’re trying to do over the next few months.”

The group has a history of making things uncomfortable for governors.

In its campaign to get Gov. Andrew Cuomo to ban hydraulic fracking more than a decade ago, Food and Water Watch had supporters pepper his office with phone calls in what became known as “Call Cuomo Mondays.” The governor agreed to the ban in December 2014, after a strong showing in the Democratic primary by anti-fracking candidate and Fordham Law professor Zephyr Teachout.

Through a spokesman, Hochul said the decision on the all-electric buildings law was meant to ensure it survives legal challenges.

""The Governor remains committed to the all-electric-buildings law and believes this action will help the State defend it, as well as reduce regulatory uncertainty for developers during this period of litigation,” spokesman Ken Lovett said. “Governor Hochul remains resolved to providing more affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for New Yorkers.""

And the governor, in an interview with the USA TODAY Network in June, said she remains committed to the goals laid out in the Climate Law and Community Protection Act of 2018, which include adding renewables like solar and wind power to the grid and reducing carbon emissions.

But, she noted, surging gas prices, inflation, supply chain disruptions and a Trump Administration hostile to climate initiatives means the state could be facing headwinds over the next four years.

“So I need all the champions of this (climate) law,” Hochul said. “They need to understand that my heart and my vision is to take us to that place to protect our environment and our climate for the future, but I also can’t turn my back on what we need to do now.”

Climate challenges piling up

Hochul frequently invokes affordability to defend decisions unwelcomed by climate advocates. She delayed the start of congestion pricing, a plan to reduce the number of cars entering New York City at 60th Street and below, until the toll was reduced to $9.

It’s a stance that resonates at a time when more than 1 million state ratepayers are behind at least two months on gas and electric bills that are coming in two and three times larger than they’ve been in prior years. Grassroots movements in Rochester and the Hudson Valley are calling for the elimination of privately-run utilities.

But green energy advocates say now’s not the time to shy away from the challenges but to build on the progress already made. They say the transition to a greener economy will make the state less dependent on natural gas solutions and bring prices down. “We need to see a shift in direction from the governor in this coming year,” said Liz Moran, Earthjustice’s New York Policy Advocate.

In the meantime, the obstacles standing in the way of that transition continue to pile up.

The downstate electric grid is now nearly totally reliant on natural gas since the shutdown of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in 2021. A sluggish buildout of renewable energy upstate has the state rethinking climate goals of 70% reliance on renewable sources of power — wind, solar and hydro — by 2030. A state energy plan delivered this week says natural gas and nuclear power will need to stick around for at least the next 15 years to help the state achieve its energy needs.

And the New York Power Authority this month scaled back its outlook for adding more renewables to its portfolio, citing reductions in federal tax credits that have hurt developers.

What ending the 100‑foot gas rule could save ratepayers

The governor’s next test comes this week when she faces a Dec. 19 deadline to sign or veto a bill passed by the state Legislature this year repealing the so-called 100-foot rule. The rule requires utilities to provide gas service to customers who ask for it with the tab picked up by all ratepayers.

Advocate groups peg the annual cost to ratepayers at nearly $600 million.

“This is an outdated mandate that every New Yorker sees on their utility bills that requires them to pay for the expansion of gas pipeline and it comes at a heavy cost,” Moran said.

Republicans aren't buying it

Republicans who’ve been railing against the all-electric bill were not about to heap praise on the governor for delaying what they’ve termed the “gas stove ban.” They viewed her move as a short-term maneuver to deflect conflict over the measure until after the November 2026 election.

“This is a cynical political 'pause' so she can screw New Yorkers with higher prices after the election,” said Rep. Elise Stefanik, a Republican who’s running for governor. “New York needs a full repeal and only a full repeal of the gas stove ban. Not this desperate pause to try to resuscitate her abysmal polling numbers.”

The idea is fairly unpopular with New Yorkers. In a Siena College poll taken in February 2023 when lawmakers were weighing the proposal, some 39% of surveyed voters supported the idea, while 53% opposed it.

The move was welcomed by upstate business leaders.

And in October, several upstate Democrats asked Hochul to hold off on enforcing the law. “A pause is not a rejection of decarbonization goals,” Assemblyman William Conrad, who represents a district in Western New York, wrote. “It is a prudent measure to ensure we do not jeopardize system reliability, impose runaway costs, or force unintended consequences on citizens and businesses.”

Beauchamp believes a backslide on the all-electric law could resonate not only with green energy supporters but voters watching to see if Hochul will stand up to President Trump.

And he said it may not be too late for her to reconsider. He recalls how Cuomo pivoted and embraced a ban on fracking, a process that unleashes natural gas from shale formations using a mix of chemicals water and sand.

“I don’t think Gov. Hochul’s views are all that concrete,” Beauchamp said. “Certainly, on climate issues we’ve kind of seen her waffle both directions. When she feels enough pressure, when she gets that this is a problem for her, she’s certainly been willing to change in the past. So you’d rather have someone who’s with you all the time but I do think that if we have a big enough showing perhaps we can win her back. But we’ll see.”

Solar, wind and other renewables made up only a small share of the mix.
The 2018 Clean Energy Act already required utilities to get half their power from Class I renewables by 2030.
“This election has shown that voters want affordable energy and clean energy is the cheapest,” he said, referring to Sherrill’s victory.
If the bill stalls, Murphy’s 2035 target would remain in place only as an executive order—something a future governor could water down or revoke.","In the final weeks of Gov. Phil Murphy’s tenure, New Jersey climate advocates are trying to do something governors rarely manage on their way out the door: bind their successors to an ambitious climate promise.

A sweeping measure, known as the New Jersey Clean Energy Act of 2024, would write into law Murphy’s goal of running the state on 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, a target he first set by executive order in 2023.

If it passes before the lame-duck session ends in January, the bill would outlast Murphy and would land on the desk of Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who campaigned on lowering utility bills but has not said whether she backs locking the 2035 deadline into statute.

“This is a priority piece of legislation … to codify Governor Murphy’s Executive Order 315, which is the 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 into law,” said Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group. “So that the next governor … and beyond, are required to move the state in that direction.”

The bill would strengthen a clean-electricity standard, requiring all power sold in New Jersey to come from clean sources by 2035. This largely mirrors Murphy’s Executive Order 315 and the state’s newly updated Energy Master Plan. It then directs the Board of Public Utilities to create a new market for “clean electricity certificates,” giving utilities and large buyers a tradable way to prove their supply meets the standard.

Starting in 2030, at least half of the renewable energy certificates used for compliance would have to come from projects inside New Jersey, steering more investment and jobs in-state instead of paying for credits from out-of-state wind and solar.

At the same time, the bill tightens New Jersey’s existing renewable standard, which is a separate rule that governs how much electricity must come from specific renewable sources like solar, wind and small hydropower.

While the broader clean-electricity goal would require a carbon-free grid by 2035, the renewable standard would keep ramping up beyond that: Utilities would have to raise the share of their retail sales coming from so-called Class I renewables, such as solar and wind, to 100 percent by 2045, up from a current requirement of 50 percent by 2030.

There is also a nod to political reality. For the small number of fossil-fuel peaker plants that fire up only on days of high demand, the bill gives an extra decade, until 2045, to fully transition to clean power.

New Jersey’s grid is still dominated by fossil fuels and nuclear power. In 2023, natural gas provided about 49 percent of the state’s electricity, while nuclear plants supplied 42 percent. Solar, wind and other renewables made up only a small share of the mix. Together, gas and nuclear have accounted for more than 90 percent of the state’s generation every year since 2011.

Defining Clean Energy

What makes the measure stand out nationally is not just the date, but the way it defines “clean.”

“It would specifically call out co-pollutants as not allowable … anywhere along the supply chain of energy production,” Potosnak said, noting that, if the bill is passed, New Jersey would have among the strictest definitions of clean energy in the United States.

In practice, it would mean that New Jersey’s long-controversial trash incinerators, currently counted as Class II renewables—with trash incineration producing soot and steam to create electricity—could no longer be used to meet the 100 percent clean-energy mandate.

Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson, a Democrat from Trenton and a co-sponsor of the bill, said the definition is especially important for neighborhoods that already host multiple polluting facilities.

“In the city of Trenton … there is a community that has [a] trash incinerator already there,” she recalled, describing how residents pushed back when companies proposed adding still more industrial infrastructure.

The 2018 Clean Energy Act already required utilities to get half their power from Class I renewables by 2030. The new bill would tighten that trajectory, one that counts nuclear and certain zero-carbon resources toward the 2035 goal but forces the remaining fossil-fuel “residual” to shrink steadily.

Climate and health experts say that shift is urgent in a dense state with some of the worst air quality in the country.

Brian Lestini, a physician and public-health advocate with Clinicians for Climate Action, noted that New Jersey’s average temperatures are rising faster than much of the country, compounding risks from extreme heat and air pollution in urban areas with less tree cover.

“Clean renewable energy like solar and wind, they’re the fastest, the cheapest, and also by far the healthiest to build,” Lestini said, arguing that high bills today reflect a lack, not a surplus, of clean energy.

New Energy Plan, New Headwinds

The lame-duck debate comes as Murphy belatedly released the 2024 Energy Master Plan, the state’s long-term roadmap for meeting his clean-energy goals.

The plan assumes New Jersey can still reach 100 percent clean electricity for its average daily load by 2035, even after the collapse of two massive offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind 1 and 2, that were once central to the state’s strategy. Those projects were canceled in late 2023 amid supply-chain delays and rising interest rates; Ørsted, their Danish developer, later agreed to pay New Jersey $125 million to settle related claims.

Instead, the blueprint leans heavily on solar and battery storage, much of it built on already paved land such as warehouses, parking lots and highway medians.

All of that is unfolding against a turbulent national backdrop. President Donald Trump has effectively frozen approvals for major wind and solar projects on federal lands, while openly attacking offshore wind and praising states that scale it back. State officials and advocates warn that federal hostility creates urgency for New Jersey to do what it can on its own.

The state is also grappling with surging electricity demand from new data centers across the PJM regional grid that serves New Jersey and a dozen other states.

“Most people don’t understand what a data center looks like. They don’t know about what a power grid is,” Reynolds-Jackson said. “But they do know that their utility bills are going up … It may be the difference between putting food on the table or buying medicine.”

In Reynolds-Jackson’s view, the surest way to hold down costs and protect communities from pollution is simple: build more clean energy, and don’t stop.

Can Sherrill Make It Work?

If the Legislature sends the bill to the governor’s desk before Jan. 19, Murphy can still sign it. After that, implementing it would fall largely to Sherrill, who has promised to declare a state of emergency on utility rates in her first year in office.

During the campaign, Sherrill ran on an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy that emphasized affordability and grid reliability but stopped short of endorsing Murphy’s 2035 clean-electricity target.

Advocates say that is not unusual.

“Typically … governors don’t weigh in on legislation. They let the legislative branch do their thing until it gets pretty far along,” Potosnak said.

State Sen. Andrew Zwicker, a Democrat and one of Trenton’s leading clean-energy voices who sponsored the 2035 goal bill, said the biggest challenge for the bill now was timing.

“There is very little time left to reach the floor before the end of the lame-duck session,” Zwicker said. “If it doesn’t make it, it gets reintroduced. We’d push again with the Sherrill administration.”

Potosnak is more determined. The lame duck session, he said, is “a time when really good things can happen quickly,” and he believes voters just gave lawmakers a mandate to act.

“This election has shown that voters want affordable energy and clean energy is the cheapest,” he said, referring to Sherrill’s victory.

If the bill stalls, Murphy’s 2035 target would remain in place only as an executive order—something a future governor could water down or revoke.

“The more important thing than the accountability part towards the government is the signaling to investors,” Mr. Potosnak said. Without clear law, he warned, “they get cold feet and they just stay out … They want predictability. They want reliability.”

Lestini, the physician, comes back to the human bottom line.

“There is a false narrative … that’s basically blaming what we’re seeing in terms of rates on renewable energy,” he said. In reality, he added, the lack of clean supply has left families choosing between “paying their energy bill or buying medications,” a choice he believes no one should have to make.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2244083081.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 09:57:59.418107

That delivery includes nuclear energy, joining coal and natural gas as cornerstones of the nation’s future energy mix.
“This is about meeting real energy demand with real projects,” Governor Gordon said.
As a part of this legislation, the legislature specifically defined large projects as “any qualifying energy project for which the state's participation is at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000.00)”.
Governor Gordon also thanked the Wyoming Legislature for granting the authority to deploy Large Project Energy Matching Funds and Energy Matching Funds (EMF) for recognizing the importance of strategic investment.","Cheyenne, Wyo. - Governor Mark Gordon (R-WY) and the Wyoming Energy Authority (WEA) announced today the award of $100 million in Large Project Energy Matching Funds (LPEMF) to BWXT, supporting an energy project that advances Wyoming’s economy and uranium industry and President Trump’s agenda to strengthen American energy independence by increasing the growing demand for advanced nuclear fuel.

This investment aligns with President Trump’s energy dominance strategy, which recognizes that America’s economic strength, national security, and technological leadership depend on the delivery of reliable, affordable, and dispatchable energy. That delivery includes nuclear energy, joining coal and natural gas as cornerstones of the nation’s future energy mix.

“This is about meeting real energy demand with real projects,” Governor Gordon said. “Energy Matching Funds are not about government picking winners; they are about responding to market signals and investing where private capital, innovation, and demand are already moving.”

During a recent tour of Idaho National Laboratory, U.S. Energy Secretary Wright described the BWXT project as an example of a “nuclear renaissance,” saying “You know, we're at the early age of a nuclear renaissance where we’re talking about all these reactors being built. They're going to run on fuel. Wyoming's been a tremendous energy state, across the spectrum. I would add nuclear fuel to that if I was Wyoming. And I love the great town of Gillette.""

This renaissance is seen in growing public and private-sector investments, improving advanced reactor technology, and rising demand for uranium. Senator John Barrasso’s “Prohibiting Uranium Imports Act of 2024” banned the import of Russian fuel and highlighted Wyoming's dominance in uranium deposits as the state is projected to hold 54% of the market share. The net impact of this uranium production to the Wyoming economy is projected to be approximately $63M in annual GSP.

This project builds on that anticipated production by adding fuel fabrication to Wyoming’s front end fuel cycle supply chain. When completed, this project will bring with it over 200 direct jobs when it reaches full operation with an estimated annual payroll of over $20 million.

In addition, economic modeling shows an additional 194 indirect and induced jobs with new payrolls exceeding $20 million annually. Property taxes on the facilities will also be paid annually and on average over the first ten years of operation, the facility is expected to contribute approximately $100 million in Gross State Product annually.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license required for this facility is a 40 year license. The NRC also grants extensions of these licenses with several facilities now having operated for nearly 70 years. We anticipate this facility to be a multi-decadal facility.

“Today is a powerful day for Gillette and for the future of Wyoming,” Gillette Mayor Shay Lundvall said. “Governor Gordon’s decision to award BWXT significant matching funds is a clear vote of confidence in our people, our community, and our role in America’s energy and technology future. Gillette has always powered this nation, and now we are expanding that legacy. I want to thank Governor Gordon for his vision and leadership, and BWXT for believing in Gillette. This partnership represents momentum, opportunity, and pride and it reinforces that the best days for Gillette and Wyoming are still ahead.”

“This investment by the state of Wyoming supports BWXT’s goal to commercialize TRISO fuel for advanced nuclear reactors,” said Joe Miller, BWXT president of Government Operations. “We want to thank Governor Gordon, Rob Creager and the Wyoming Energy Authority and the people of Campbell County and Gillette who have been so supportive of this project, including the county commissioners and Mayor Lundvall. Together we can help build a stronger future for Wyoming and America.”

Governor Gordon’s decision to invest in BWXT helps advance that national momentum and national security as this facility, when completed, will be the first nuclear fuel fabrication site built in the US in decades and will reduce America’s reliance on foreign fuel.

“A TRISO fuel fabrication plant in Gillette strengthens Wyoming's role in national energy security, supports a reliable and secure fuel supply for advanced reactors, and keeps the United States at the forefront of nuclear innovation. Over the last decades, foreign countries have been controlling the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle, and this project supports President Trump and Secretary Wright’s goals for American energy independence and dominance,” says Rob Creager, Executive Director of the Wyoming Energy Authority. “BWXT choosing Wyoming means new jobs, new investment in the state, and a chance for our workforce to help continue to lead the country in reliable baseload energy.”

The funds being used in this project were appropriated by the Wyoming legislature specifically for large energy projects in 2024. As a part of this legislation, the legislature specifically defined large projects as “any qualifying energy project for which the state's participation is at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000.00)”. The legislation also requires a minimum, 1:1 match for any project. This proposed project is expected to go above and beyond that requirement with BWXT potentially investing more than $400 million for a fully operational and scaled facility.

Wyoming is uniquely positioned to lead this next chapter. Uranium was recently designated as a critical mineral by the United States Geological Survey and is a priority mineral for the state, alongside coal, trona, and bentonite. Wyoming has mined uranium since the 1950s and is home to the country’s largest known reserves, and today’s renewed interest in nuclear energy is creating a value-added supply chain rooted right here at home. Five of the nation’s top uranium-producing mines are located within a 70-mile radius of Gillette, making northeast Wyoming a powerhouse for advanced energy development.

Under President Trump and Governor Gordon’s leadership, Wyoming will continue to embrace and expand this emerging energy ecosystem.

Governor Gordon also thanked the Wyoming Legislature for granting the authority to deploy Large Project Energy Matching Funds and Energy Matching Funds (EMF) for recognizing the importance of strategic investment. Gillette and the Wyoming energy industry are also set to benefit under the EMF. Recently, the Governor approved the use of EMF to assist Basin Electric conduct a front end engineering design study to build a second coal fired unit at the Dry Fork Power Plant.

This forward looking program has kept Wyoming at the forefront and competitive with states like Texas, Tennessee, and many others that are vying for this investment in their states. “A former Legislature made a smart, forward-looking, say-yes-to-Wyoming decision,” Gordon said. “States across the country are competing for these projects every day. Wyoming is in that competition, and it’s one we intend to win.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wyomingnewsnow.tv/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/38/b3866490-87fe-4793-a864-d1942db122ce/6945c7f8e6168.preview.png?crop=376%2C376%2C74%2C0&resize=200%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-20 12:00:03.222189

“If this plan goes through as proposed, it will devastate hundreds of family farms and wipe out more than a century of agricultural tradition in Potter Valley,” said Secretary Rollins. “Water is the lifeblood of farming. Without it, crops fail, businesses close, and rural communities crumble. For generations, farmers here have put this water to good, productive use. But under California’s radical leadership, the needs of hardworking families are being ignored while the needs of fish are treated as more important. That’s simply wrong. This plan would put countless USDA investments at risk and leave families even more vulnerable to drought and wildfire. This is why I’m intervening in the FERC proceedings and urging them to reject the pending application.”

Secretary Rollins also filed comments urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to reject Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E) current application to surrender its FERC license for Potter Valley Project Hydroelectric Project. Secretary Rollins’ comments urge FERC to reject PG&E’s application unless significant deficiencies are addressed. Her notice of intervention guarantees USDA’s ability to actively participate in the proceedings, protect its programs, and advocate for the farmers and communities who depend on the project’s reliable water flows.

Background:

The Department has serious concerns with Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E) current application to surrender its FERC license for Potter Valley Project Hydroelectric Project because of the profoundly negative and irreversible impact on local farmers, ranchers, agricultural producers, communities, and USDA equities. USDA maintains a large number of programs across different mission areas that will be negatively impacted; namely, the National Forest System (NFS), the Risk Management Agency, the Farm Service Agency (FSA), Rural Development, and the Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS).

For perspective, according to the last census of agriculture the counties of Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Humboldt, and Marin have a combined total of over $1.4 billion in sales of agricultural products. That's well over $4.2 billion in extra economic activity due to agriculture if you assume a standard multiplier of $3 to $1 which is standard in the nearby Central Valley.

Recently the Secretary received a letter (PDF, 1.9 MB) from over 920 residents with grave concerns about the proposed surrender and decommissioning plan for the Potter Valley Hydroelectric Project.

The Secretary also penned an op-ed, highlighting concerns.

Over the past couple of years, the use of solar energy has been significantly on the rise as it has become cheaper to install and is more environmentally friendly, with it converting sunlight to electricity. Solar energy is the second biggest reusable energy source as of now, and is expected to become number one in 2026.

Solar For All first started in 2022 under the Biden administration, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act: new environmental laws that would help fight against climate change. In August of 2024, Solar For All had provided monetary grants for 60 recipients including 49 states, six tribes, and the U.S. territories.

The program also helps to cut the costs of the electricity bill, up to 20 percent for over 900,000 homes.

“I think cost is a big factor into why we can or cannot be environmentally friendly. Sometimes you don’t have a choice,” said Amisha Shankar ’26.

Programs like Solar For All are also seen as a good way to remind people to be more aware of their ecological footprint, and to be more environmentally friendly.

“Solar panels are very expensive, and so by having these free forms of energy people are more willing to use it,” added Shankar.

Many in the United States have been affected by the cancellation of the program, such as the southern states. In Texas, Harris County was granted $249 million to help distribute solar and battery power to in-need neighborhoods. This grant provided workforce training for low-income workers and minorities.

The move to cut the program by the EPA was ultimately made by the Trump Administration, as they decided to cut back on federal support for solar and wind energy.

“If we cut programs like this, we’re going to use energy in ways that we’ve always had, which is not sustainable,” said Environmental Science teacher Michael O’Brien.

As renewable energy becomes more common, decisions like these may make it harder for people in the United States to become more eco-friendly, and would ultimately contribute to global warming and climate change as a whole.",https://rcrusadernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0392-e1765946707499.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 05:59:03.979808

The Fairfax transition is the physical manifestation of GM's strategy to move from EV novelty to EV profitability.
Wrapping Up The 1,700 job cuts at GM’s Fairfax Assembly are a stark reminder that the EV revolution is not a guaranteed, smooth transition.","The road to an all-electric future was never going to be a straight line, but recent bumps have felt more like tank traps for legacy automakers. The latest shockwave comes from General Motors, with reports confirming plans to cut approximately 1,700 jobs at its Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas. This move, tied directly to adjusting production schedules for the Chevrolet Bolt EV and other models, is a stark illustration of the friction between aggressive EV ambitions and the cold reality of current market demand.

While the human cost to the workforce is the most immediate and painful aspect of this news, the strategic implications ripple far beyond Kansas City. This isn't just a local retooling hiccup; it's a significant indicator of a broader industry recalibration that is forcing Detroit's giants to tap the brakes on their electric dreams.

The Fairfax Shakeup: Why is This Happening Now?

On the surface, the job cuts at Fairfax are a mechanistic result of product lifecycles. The plant is ceasing production of the current Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, which have been modest successes but are built on older battery architecture. GM is also winding down production of the gasoline-powered Cadillac XT4 at the facility. The primary goal is to retool the plant for the next-generation Bolt, which will be built on GM’s advanced Ultium platform, and to prepare for future Cadillac models.

However, the depth of the cuts—affecting roughly two-thirds of the plant's workforce, according to reports from sources like Automotive News—signals more than just a routine model changeover. It reflects a necessary, albeit painful, pause. The gap between the end of the current Bolt and the start of the next-gen EV is a chasm GM must bridge. Furthermore, softer-than-anticipated demand for existing models has likely exacerbated the need for such drastic staffing adjustments during the transition period.

The Long View: A Strategic Retreat or a Necessary Pivot?

For GM, this move represents a critical pivot from an ""all-in at all costs"" mentality to a more pragmatic, profitability-focused approach. CEO Mary Barra has made it clear that while the destination remains an all-electric future, the path to get there must be economically viable.

Long term, this is likely a smart, if painful, play. By biting the bullet now to retool for the Ultium-based Bolt, GM is investing in a future where it can produce profitable, affordable EVs at scale. The current Bolt was a great proof of concept, but it was never going to be the high-margin, mass-market vehicle GM needs to sustain its business. The Fairfax transition is the physical manifestation of GM's strategy to move from EV novelty to EV profitability. However, it also carries a significant risk: GM is effectively leaving the affordable EV segment vacant until the new Bolt arrives, a gap competitors will be eager to exploit.

The Detroit Narrative: GM Isn’t Alone in Tapping the Brakes

It is crucial to view GM’s actions within the broader context of the American automotive industry. GM is not an outlier; it is part of a clear trend. Its cross-town rival, Ford, has made similar strategic adjustments in recent months.

Facing slower-than-expected adoption rates, Ford has cut production shifts for the F-150 Lightning, its flagship electric truck. Furthermore, Ford has delayed some of its massive battery plant investments and has openly stated it will lean more heavily into hybrid vehicles as a ""bridge"" technology for consumers not yet ready to go fully electric.

Both GM and Ford are responding to the same market signals: high interest rates, charging infrastructure anxiety, and vehicle prices remain significant barriers to mass EV adoption. The initial wave of early adopters has bought their EVs; the next phase of converting the mainstream buyer is proving far more difficult and slower than Detroit’s optimistic projections suggested.

The Global Stage: What This Means for US EV Competitiveness

The optics of GM’s retreat, however temporary, are challenging on the global stage. As US legacy automakers tap the brakes, international competitors are accelerating.

Tesla, despite its own recent stock market fluctuations and price cuts, continues to dominate the US EV market and is aggressively expanding its global footprint with its new plant in Mexico. More menacingly, Chinese automakers like BYD are growing at an astonishing pace, producing high-quality, affordable EVs at a scale that Detroit is currently struggling to match.

The Fairfax situation highlights a critical vulnerability for GM and the US auto industry: the difficulty of transitioning century-old manufacturing behemoths versus the agility of newer, EV-first companies. While GM recalibrates its factories and supply chains, it risks losing valuable market momentum and mindshare. The longer it takes for GM to get its affordable Ultium-based vehicles on the road, the wider the door opens for Tesla to consolidate its lead and for Chinese manufacturers to potentially gain a foothold in North America.

Wrapping Up

The 1,700 job cuts at GM’s Fairfax Assembly are a stark reminder that the EV revolution is not a guaranteed, smooth transition. It is a complex, capital-intensive industrial pivot fraught with market uncertainties. For GM, this is a painful but likely necessary step to align its production reality with current demand while preparing for a more profitable electric future. But in the hyper-competitive global EV landscape, time is a luxury Detroit does not have. The success of this strategic pause depends entirely on how quickly and effectively GM can complete the Fairfax retooling and deliver the next-generation Bolt to a market hungry for affordable electric options.",https://www.torquenews.com/profiles/torquenews/themes/tn/favicon.gif,N,,2025-12-20 11:59:58.831228

Funding for the Training for Residential Energy Contractors program, officially known as the State-Based Home Energy Efficiency Contractor Training Grants, includes $200 million allocated by the U.S. Department of Energy under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The funding is designed to help states and territories lower the costs associated with training, testing and certifying contractors in residential energy efficiency and electrification.

Hawaiʻi’s allocation of nearly $1.12 million is administered by Hawai‘i State Energy Office in support of the state’s mission to reduce electricity costs for residents, enhance home comfort and help Hawai‘i achieve its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045.

“[Training for Residential Energy Contractors] is about empowering Hawai‘i’s local workforce to lead the clean energy transition,” added Hā Sustainability co-founder Hannah Shipman-Peila in the state release. “By equipping contractors with nationally recognized certifications and hands-on training, we’re ensuring that home energy upgrades are delivered by the very people who call these islands home.”

Contractors, electricians, HVAC professionals and other tradespeople are encouraged to learn more and register for training opportunities starting in January 2026.

The Christmas season is upon us, a time of year when many of us reflect on the year that is drawing to a close and on the good times, the sad times, and the challenges ahead. It’s also a time of year when we count our blessings and express gratitude for any good things that have come our way.

While some may realize it more than others, all Americans should be grateful for one thing most of us tend to take for granted – light that appears in the rooms of our homes at the flick of a switch, heat that emanates through our floorboard vents or radiators by merely increasing the number on a dial or a digital pad, cars, SUVs and trucks that start with the turn of a key or the push of a button.

All these modern conveniences are made possible for even low-income Americans thanks to energy that is affordable and widely accessible.

In this increasingly diverse and often divided society in which we live, all Americans are united by access to low-cost, effective energy. We have been blessed for so long by affordable energy that we are sometimes in danger of taking it for granted.

But without the change in presidential administrations that happened last January – and with it the blessings of lowered inflation, a return to free-market principles and, especially, regulatory rollbacks (more on that shortly) – Americans could have been facing a much bleaker winter this Christmas season.

Under the Biden administration, inflation averaged nearly 5%, “hitting 9.1% during the worst inflation crisis in decades,” the White House recently pointed out. In the new Trump administration, inflation has dropped to an average of 2.7%, and “Americans have seen the first overall price decline since 2020.”

Even more impressively, the skyrocketing gas prices experienced under the Biden regime have thankfully been dramatically reversed. Americans “now see the lowest average gas price in more than four years and are on track to spend the lowest amount of their disposable income on gas in the last two decades.”

While energy costs remain relatively low compared to other rising costs, the Trump administration is working to tame electricity prices which began climbing in 2022 under the Biden administration.

One analysis showed that “from March 2022 to June 2025, average monthly energy bills rose from $196 to $265 – a 35 percent jump, or nearly three times overall inflation during that period.” Trump’s reversal of Biden subsidies and incentives that artificially propped up “alternatives” like wind and solar will begin to reap dividends in the coming months and years. The new administration’s fast-track permitting process for new exploration will supercharge our most abundant and reliable legacy resources, driving energy costs down.

But while politicians and pundits seem focused on “prices” as a measure of “affordability,” the long list of regulatory rollbacks in which the Trump administration has engaged will be the real catalyst leading to a more affordable life in the U.S.

Trump’s deregulatory efforts “are saving Americans a collective $180 billion — or $2,100 per family of four,” the White House notes. “For example, President Trump halted burdensome Biden-era efficiency standards that jacked up the price of everyday appliances.”

Earlier this month, in an announcement that did not get the attention it deserved, President Trump unveiled relaxed fuel economy standards “for the more than 15 million new cars and trucks sold in the country every year,” as the Detroit News reported.

“The plan, if finalized, would slash fuel economy requirements through the 2031 model year, to about a fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles of roughly 34.5 miles per gallon, down from roughly 50 miles per gallon under the current rules,” the story noted.

Administration officials rightfully said that “the new standards would increase consumers’ access to a wider range of affordable gas-powered vehicles and help hold down new car prices.”

“Today’s a victory of common sense and affordability,” said Jim Farley, CEO of Ford Motor Company, who joined Trump at that Oval Office announcement. It was great news for everyone who loves their dependable gas-powered cars, SUVs and trucks.

It’s impossible to overstate the scope of the catastrophe that has been averted by dismantling the disastrous energy policies of the previous administration. If the Biden-era subsidies, mandates and penalties had continued, Americans would likely be facing a much bleaker holiday season, not to mention the cold-weather months that follow for much of the country.

The gift of energy policies that promote affordability, accessibility and commonsense emission standards should be high on the wish list of every American family.

While this Christmas may be too soon upon us to expect delivery of such a present, passage of the Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security act (ARC-ES) introduced in October by Rep. Troy Balderson (R-OH) would make the perfect gift from Congress and President Trump to all 340 million Americans in conjunction with America’s 250th birthday on July 4, 2026.

ARC-ES would codify low-cost, accessible energy into law, protecting energy security from the radical political whims of future far-left administrations. In this season of hope, wishing for such a gift in the next six months should not require a Christmas miracle – merely the will of our elected representatives in Washington to do the right thing.

“May your days be merry and bright,” Bing Crosby sings in “White Christmas” – merry because of the holiday, bright thanks to low-cost energy that is there when we need it. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/70/705159_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 10:59:39.409944

The CERTAIN Act would address permit certainty—ensuring federal agencies handle project authorizations and environmental reviews fairly and efficiently, with clear timelines, notice requirements, and accountability. This would facilitate the build out of the energy we need to lower costs, create jobs, and protect our environment. It also emphasizes coordinating between different agencies involved in these processes to avoid unnecessary delays.

""It’s no secret that our surging energy demand is straining our grid and our wallets,” Congressman Peters said. “As we face the growing challenge of powering our nation’s future, we must act quickly and effectively.

“As the representative of a truly all-of-the-above energy district, I hear from oil and gas and renewable energy producers alike that overburdensome permitting processes and lack of permit certainty has plagued investment and delayed innovation. Across the U.S., modernizing how we permit our infrastructure is absolutely vital to meeting our growing energy demand and lowering costs for working families. I’m proud to lead these bipartisan discussions to build upon the work already done in the House to strengthen American jobs, businesses and markets, reduce cost of living, and provide investors greater certainty when allocating capital to current and future energy projects,” said Congressman Evans

“Endless permitting roadblocks hurt communities and drive up energy costs. I’m proud to co-lead the bipartisan CERTAIN Act to bring transparency and accountability to the permitting process and ensure projects that meet their requirements can move forward on time,” said Congressman Garbarino.

Reporting Texas

With America facing mounting pressure to reduce its dependence on foreign rare earth minerals, Texas and the University of Texas are seeking a role in rebuilding a domestic supply chain.

The University of Texas at Austin has held two educational forums in the past five months, seeking a role in driving innovation and dialogue around critical mineral development.

“The central question is, how can we stimulate our own supply of these critical minerals?” JR DeShazo, dean of the LBJ School of Public Affairs, said at one of the forums.

Participants in the events said efforts to build American capacity are vital; the United States currently relies on foreign stockpiles for 12 of the 15 critical rare earth minerals required for technologies such as electric vehicle batteries and smartphones. While trade agreements exist with these countries, the U.S. does not want to depend on them.

The first event was hosted by the Jackson School of Geosciences over Aug. 13–15, followed by another on Nov. 17 at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. Both explored policy, research and technological developments at the forefront of the U.S. critical mineral race and came on the heels of research by UT science teams into developing more environmentally friendly methods of extracting rare earth minerals.

“A few years ago the critical minerals vulnerability of the U.S. was a theoretical exercise; we have seen how this is no longer a theoretical exercise,” said Jose Fernandez, who served as undersecretary of state during the Biden administration.

China poses a significant hurdle in America’s efforts to escape mineral dependence. Despite political and ideological differences — not to mention an ongoing trade war — the U.S. is still dependent on China for many essential rare earth minerals. Experts say that trade agreements and tariff pressure on other nations are unreliable long-term solutions and that the U.S. must develop its own methods for extracting critical rare earth minerals.

China has worked to become resource independent over the past decade. But its example has also become a cautionary tale..

“A reason why the People’s Republic of China has succeeded in rare earth mining and minerals is because they devastated the countryside. There has been an environmental cost,” Fernandez said

“Whether it is dredge mining, deep-sea mining or space mining, we have to do things responsibly,” said Tem Tumurbat, co-founder and managing partner of Nomadic Venture Partners .

The demand for critical minerals in the U.S. is skyrocketing. This demand is fueled by nationwide infrastructure expansions, green energy transitions and national security concerns. A huge demand is also coming from data centers.

The United States does have plenty of treasures underground and until the 1990s the U.S. was the world’s leading producer of rare earth minerals. Since that time, America has cut back on mining and processing.

Only 10 percent of the nation’s rare earth mineral and element supply now comes from domestic extraction, while roughly 78 percent of the supply comes from China. The U.S. has only four operational aluminum smelting plants, two copper refineries and only one aluminum refinery. Most minerals extracted domestically are still shipped overseas for processing before returning to the U.S. supply chain.

Rare earth minerals such as yttrium, samarium and neodymium are essential for the nation’s defense system including the F-35 fighter jets thermal barrier coatings, radar systems, visual displays and turbine blades. These are among the rare earth minerals that China has previously restricted exportation of, along with gallium, which the U.S. depends on China for nearly its entire supply.

Societal and environmental challenges pose significant hurdles to critical mineral mining, experts say.

“No one wants a copper mine in their neighborhood,” said Douglas Wicks, a program director at the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy.

But those minerals are increasingly important, he added.

“Minerals will be a driver for the green transition that is focused on reducing fossil fuels,” Wicks said.

Finding practical solutions amid growing industrial needs is becoming especially urgent in the Lone Star State. UT-Austin’s focus on the topic of rare earth minerals comes at a crucial time for the state, which has emerged as a hub for large-scale semiconductor and chip manufacturing by companies like Samsung, Texas Instruments, Infineon, GlobalWafers, NXP, X-FAB and Applied Materials.

Texas is home to 411 data centers, the second most nationwide, and a new $40 billion investment from Google will fund the construction of three more.

Semiconductor and chip manufacturing rely on such critical minerals as gallium and germanium. Both have seen exportation restrictions from China in past years. By 2030, the projected U.S. AI data center mineral demand is estimated to be 450,000 tons of copper, 175,000 tons of aluminum, 12,500 tons of nickel, 10,000 tons of graphite and 65 tons of gallium.

“The United States cannot actually succeed in the age of AI as a force to be reckoned with without having access to critical ingredients and imports that power our batteries, our devices, EVs, advanced defense equipment and chips,” said Dilawar Syed, an economic policy adviser and associate professor at the LBJ School.

The UT conferences have also focused on the promise of drawing resources from mineral waste. “We need recycling of critical minerals,” Fernandez said.

Currently, in the United States, it takes on average 15–30 years to open a new mining operation, from the idea and location to the start of the extraction.

“In the U.S. to meet demand, we would have to open at least 300 new mines in the next few years,” Tumurbat said.

By contrast, Tumurbat said, the time it takes to obtain permits to begin extracting the waste can be a span of months to a year. But many companies today have mountains of waste sitting on their balance sheets and want to offload them..

“There are billions of tons of material that have been mined historically that have incredible amounts of value, and we just need to develop technology to be able to process them,” Tumurbat said.

The two UT events also looked at a second approach to obtaining critical minerals: deep sea mining.

“It feels like we are at the beginning of a gold rush,” said Anna Scott, the CEO of Mithril Minerals, a Texas-based deep sea mining company “I have always wondered what a gold rush felt like, and I think I know now,” she said.

Deep sea mining involves sending mineral-extracting rovers to the bottom of the seafloor and siphoning up rocks that contain rare earth minerals.

These rocks have generated excitement, because research suggests there is a bountiful supply sitting at the bottom of the ocean. While there are many rare earth minerals the U.S. is in need of obtaining within these rocks, there are serious ecological concerns with getting them out of the sea.

These rocks can contain both light earth elements and heavy rare earth elements such as cerium, yttrium, europium and cobalt, and Scott said they are accessible.

“With any mining and mineral play there are, of course, consequences to this. One of the big consequences is, of course, the ecological consequences,” .

While companies such as Scott’s are trying to come up with ways of extracting these minerals that cause less harm, the unknowns are still troubling, Fernandez said.

“To be honest, no one really knows what the environmental damage will be,” he said.

On April 24, President Donald Trump signed the executive order titled Unleashing America’s Offshore Critical Minerals and Resources. The order aims to accelerate permits given to domestic companies to begin exploration and collection of deep sea minerals.

The order cites “unprecedented economic and national security challenges in securing reliable supplies of critical minerals independent of foreign adversary control.”

A team of researchers from UT is working to address the environmental impact of mineral extraction. The group includes experts from the departments of civil, architectural and environmental engineering; chemical engineering; and chemistry. They have created a mineral extraction method some experts are calling a breakthrough, compared with current industry methods.

Today, rare earth minerals are often extracted through a process called “solvent extraction,”which separates elements from complex ores using chemical solvents. The specific elements desired for extraction will be drawn into a liquid solution. While effective, this process causes substantial chemical and energy waste, as well as pollution.

In contrast, UT researchers’ new separation process involves the use of artificially designed membrane channels that are created to specifically extract certain rare earth ions. These artificial membrane channels replicate how cells naturally move ions therefore allowing only certain minerals to pass through. This mineral extraction technique produces far less waste than current methods, and if successfully applied to commercial use could help lead to a more dependable domestic supply of rare earth minerals. It has yet to be shown whether the transition from laboratory to large-scale business use will be practical or economically feasible, however.

While the experts at the UT events said efforts to secure minerals needed for the nation’s future are a step in the right direction, far more work both at the higher education, state, private sector and federal level is required.

“This is not a problem that will be solved overnight,” Fernandez said.",https://www.reportingtexas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Main-Photo-with-Caption-Completed.png,N,,2025-12-20 12:00:10.356474

For communities sick of rising electricity bills and pollution from power plants, data centers have become an obvious target. Fights against new data centers surged this year as grassroots groups, voters, and local lawmakers demanded more accountability from developers. Already, they’ve managed to block or stall tens of billions of dollars’ worth of potential investment in proposed data centers. And they’re not letting up.

“We expect that opposition is going to keep growing,” says Miquel Vila, an analyst at the research firm Data Center Watch who’s been tracking campaigns against data centers across the US since 2023.

“We expect that opposition is going to keep growing.”

The group’s latest report found that developers either canceled or delayed 20 projects after facing pushback from locals, representing $98 billion in proposed investments in the second quarter of this year. In fact, from late March through June, $24.2 billion in projects were blocked and $73.7 billion delayed. That’s an increase compared to 16 blocked or postponed projects from 2023 through the first quarter of this year, the group notes.

The number of proposed data center projects has grown, which is a big reason why opposition is also picking up steam. Inventory in the four biggest data center markets in North America — Northern Virginia, Chicago, Atlanta, and Phoenix — grew by 43 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of this year, according to commercial real estate company CBRE. But plans for massive new facilities have also sparked battles across the nation.

Data centers eat up a lot of electricity, particularly for more powerful chips used for new AI models. Power demand for data centers is expected to grow by 22 percent by the end of the year compared to last year. A high-density rack of servers in an AI data center might use as much as 80 to 100 homes’ worth of power, or upward of 100 kilowatts, according to Dan Thompson, a principal research analyst at S&P Global. AI also requires a lot of water to keep servers cool and generate electricity and could use as much annually as the indoor needs of 18.5 million US households by 2028 by one estimate.

Google dropped its plans for a new data center in Franklin Township, Indiana, in September after residents raised concerns about how much water and electricity the new data center would use. The Indianapolis City-County Council was reportedly expected to deny the project’s rezoning application. That victory for residents in Indiana isn’t captured in the Data Center Watch report, which is only updated with information through June.

Other data center projects that are moving forward or already operating still face resistance. Elon Musk’s xAI, for example, faces a potential lawsuit from the NAACP and Southern Environmental Law Center over pollution from its data center in Memphis. Peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels have jumped by 79 percent in the area surrounding the data center since it started operating in 2024, according to research from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville requested by Time magazine.

xAI, which is building a second, larger data center in Memphis, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge, but says “We’re moving toward a future where we will harness our cluster’s full power to solve intractable problems,” on its website.

“No community should be forced to sacrifice clean air, clean water, or safe homes so that corporations and billionaires can build energy-hungry facilities,” the NAACP said in guiding principles that it shared with The Verge in September for other grassroots groups working to hold data center developers accountable for their impact on nearby neighborhoods.

Meta is facing a backlash against its largest data center yet planned for Richland Parish, Louisiana. Local utility Entergy broke ground this month on two of three gas plants it’s building to meet that facility’s electricity demands, expected to reach triple the amount of power New Orleans uses in a year. “Entergy LA customers are now set to subsidize Meta’s data center costs,” the Union of Concerned Scientists says in a November blog post, including an estimated $3.2 billion for the three gas-fired plants and a new $550 million transmission line. Entergy, on the other hand, contends that “Meta’s electric payments to Entergy will lower what customers pay for resilience upgrades by approximately 10%,” according to communications manager Brandon Scardigli.

“Our agreement with Entergy was structured to ensure that other customers are not paying for our data center energy use,” Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle says in an email to The Verge. Settle adds that Meta is contributing $15 million to Entergy’s ratepayer support program and more than $200 million for local infrastructure improvements.

“Now, we have a bogey man.”

Rising electricity costs became a flashpoint during November elections in the US this year, helping to propel two Democrats to the governor’s offices in New Jersey and Virginia. New Jersey residents have faced one of the steepest rises in power prices of any state in the nation, while Virginia is home to “data center alley,” through which 70 percent of internet traffic passes.

“Now, we have a bogey man — data centers who are these large energy users who are coming in, and in many states, getting sweetheart deals on wholesale electricity prices, when regular consumers don’t have that type of sway,” Tony Reames, a professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan and former Department of Energy official under President Biden, said to The Verge after the election.

States, both red and blue, are starting to set some limits on those sweetheart deals. After South Dakota lawmakers rejected a bill that would have offered developers sales tax refunds, Applied Digital paused plans for a $16 billion AI campus in the state. Virginia, Maryland, and Minnesota, meanwhile, have introduced legislation attempting to rein in tax incentives for data centers or energy costs for other consumers, the Data Center Watch report says.

Nationally, more than 230 health and environmental groups have called for a moratorium on data center construction. The organizations, led by the nonprofit Food & Water Watch, sent a letter to Congress with their demands in December. They argue that there aren’t enough policies in place to prevent data centers from burdening nearby communities with higher bills and more pollution. President Donald Trump released an “AI Action Plan” in July that aims to speed data center development in part by rolling back environmental regulations.

With midterm elections next year, we’re likely to see more data center fights playing into local politics, Vila expects. “It’s going to be very interesting to track how this opposition impacts the regulatory framework,” he says.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/258090_EOY_2025_CVirginia_DATA_CENTER.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-12-20 05:59:16.701054

“It means that maybe they’re not going up as fast.” Existing customers would pay for part of the construction program that doesn't serve data centers.","ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia's only private electric utility plans to increase power capacity by 50% after state regulators on Friday agreed 5-0 that the plan is needed to meet projected demand from data centers.

It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The construction cost would be $16.3 billion, but staff members say customers will pay $50 billion to $60 billion over coming decades, including interest costs and guaranteed profit for the monopoly utility.

Georgia Power Co. and the Public Service Commission pledge large users will more than pay for their costs, and that spreading fixed costs over more customers, could help significantly cut residents' power bills beginning in 2029.

“Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that’s a great result for Georgians,” Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said in a statement after the vote.

But opponents say the five elected Republicans on the commission are greenlighting a risky bet by the utility to chase data center customers with existing ratepayers left holding the bag if demand doesn't materialize.

“The need for 10,000 megawatts of new capacity resources on the system in the next six years isn’t here,"" said Bob Sherrier, a lawyer representing some opponents. “It just isn't, and it may never be.”

The approval came less than two months after voters rebuked GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the commission in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July.

Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson — the Democrats who will take office Jan. 1 — opposed Friday's vote. But current commissioners refused to delay.

Electric bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize power demands of technology behemoths.

Georgia Power is the largest unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. It says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity — enough to power 4 million Georgia homes — with 80% of that flowing to data centers. The company has 2.7 million customers today, including homes, businesses and industries.

Whether the company’s projections of a huge increase in demand will pan out has been the central argument. Georgia Power and commission staff agreed Dec. 9 to allow the company to build or acquire all the desired capacity, despite staff earlier saying the company's forecast included too much speculative construction.

In return, the company agreed that after the current rate freeze ends in 2028, it would use revenue from new customers to place “downward pressure” on rates through 2031. That would amount to at least $8.50 a month, or $102 a year, for a typical residential customer. That customer currently pays more than $175 a month, including taxes.

""So we’re taking advantage of the upsides from this additional revenue, but allow it to shift the downside and the risk over to the company. And I’m real proud of that,"" Commission Chairman Jason Shaw said after the vote.

But “downward pressure” doesn't guarantee a rate decrease.

""It doesn’t mean your bills are going down,"" said Liz Coyle, executive director of consumer group Georgia Watch. “It means that maybe they’re not going up as fast.”

Existing customers would pay for part of the construction program that doesn't serve data centers. More importantly, opponents fear Georgia Power's pledge of rate relief can't be enforced, or won't hold up over the 40-plus years needed to pay off new natural-gas fired power plants.

In a Monday news conference, Hubbard likened it to a mortgage “to build a massive addition to your home for a new roommate, big tech.”

""If in 10 years, the AI bubble bursts or the data centers move to a cheaper state, then the roommate moves out, but the mortgage doesn’t go away,” he said.

Staff members say the commission must watch demand closely and that if data centers don't use as much power as projected, Georgia Power must drop agreements to purchase wholesale power, close its least efficient generating plants and seek additional customers.

Many opponents oppose any new generation fueled by natural gas, warning carbon emissions will worsen climate change. Some opponents were escorted out of the commission meeting by police after they began chanting “Nay! Nay! Nay! The people say nay!”

“Increased natural gas output for the sake of these silicon billionaire kings seems like a lose-lose,"" opponent Zak Norton told commissioners Friday.

Rodriguez, Kyle Bradley, James Goodwin, Federico Holm, Liam LaMountain, Sarah Kadous, The Regulatory Review",,,,,https://www.theregreview.org/2025/12/20/seminar-predicting-turbidity-protecting-tap-water/,"Scholars analyze how the use of machine learning could reshape EPA drinking water standards.
Recent advances in machine learning (ML) may transform how water utilities meet these compliance obligations.

They argue that WOTUS-ML demonstrates the viability of using machine learning to support regulatory implementation in water law contexts.","Scholars analyze how the use of machine learning could reshape EPA drinking water standards.

New York City operates the largest unfiltered surface water supply in the United States, serving 10 million people under an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Filtration Avoidance Determination (FAD). The determination is a regulatory waiver that allows the city to avoid constructing a filtration plant—saving billions in infrastructure costs—provided it maintains stringent watershed protection standards and demonstrates continuous compliance with federal drinking water regulations.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) may transform how water utilities meet these compliance obligations. Researchers have demonstrated that ML models can forecast tributary turbidity contributions with actionable accuracy, potentially enabling proactive watershed management rather than reactive responses to water quality events. This capability raises fundamental regulatory questions: Should the EPA incorporate predictive ML models into FAD compliance frameworks? What validation standards would apply? And how might algorithmic source attribution shift evidentiary burdens in enforcement proceedings?

The stakes are significant. Portland lost its FAD after detecting naturally occurring pathogens, forcing the city to pursue costly filtration infrastructure. New York City Council oversight hearings in October 2024 emphasized the critical need for New York City Department of Environmental Protection research investment to maintain the city’s FAD status. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo eliminated Chevron deference, raising questions about judicial review of agency technical determinations—including those involving machine learning models.

The regulatory landscape is also evolving rapidly. OMB issued the first government-wide AI policy in March 2024 requiring minimum practices for safety-impacting AI by December 2024. And in January 2024, researchers published a machine learning model that can predict whether the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers—the federal agency responsible for issuing permits for activities affecting navigable waters—would classify a particular water body as falling under federal jurisdiction. The researchers’ model demonstrates that machine learning can predict Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdictional determinations—a precedent for integrating ML into water regulation more broadly.

These developments also carry environmental justice implications. Heavily monitored watersheds, such as the Upper Esopus, benefit from extensive sensor networks and research investment, while under-resourced communities lack comparable infrastructure for predicting and preventing water quality threats.

In this week’s Saturday Seminar, scholars examine the regulatory challenges and opportunities posed by integrating machine learning into drinking water regulation.

In an article published in the JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association, John T. Kemper of the University of Vermont and colleagues demonstrate that machine learning models can forecast turbidity in NYC’s drinking water watershed with actionable accuracy. Kemper and his coauthors combine high-frequency sensor data with U.S. National Water Model output to predict tributary turbidity contributions, enabling water managers to anticipate rather than react to water quality events. They find that their models can provide useful 24-hour forecasts, suggesting ML-based monitoring could enhance real-time watershed management and potentially transform how utilities demonstrate FAD compliance.

In a study published in Science, Simon Greenhill of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues introduce a machine learning model that predicts Clean Water Act jurisdictional determinations with high accuracy. The Greenhill team trains their model on more than 150,000 historical Army Corps of Engineers decisions to classify whether particular waters fall under federal protection. They argue that WOTUS-ML demonstrates the viability of using machine learning to support regulatory implementation in water law contexts. The Greenhill team estimates that under different regulatory interpretations, between one-fourth and two-thirds of U.S. wetlands and streams fall under CWA protection, providing a framework that could serve as precedent for integrating ML into other areas of environmental regulation.

In an article in the Administrative Law Review, Cary Coglianese of The University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, and Daniel E. Walters of Texas A&M Law, examine the implications of Loper Bright for administrative governance. Coglianese and Walters argue that the elimination of Chevron deference creates significant uncertainty for agency technical determinations, including those that may involve machine learning models. They suggest that the decision might best be considered “something of a Rorschach test inside a crystal ball,” where different observers may see different implications. Coglianese and Walters contend that courts reviewing ML-based regulatory decisions will need new frameworks for evaluating agency expertise and interpretive authority, with particular implications for science-intensive determinations such as those underlying EPA drinking water standards.

In an article in the Minnesota Law Review, Joshua D. Blank of UC Irvine School of Law, and Leigh Osofsky of UNC School of Law, examine federal agencies’ use of automated tools to communicate legal guidance to the public. Blank and Osofsky argue that although chatbots, virtual assistants, and AI systems offer administrative efficiency, they may mislead the public about how law applies to their circumstances. Based on an Administrative Conference of the United States-commissioned study, Blank and Osofsky propose policy recommendations emphasizing transparency, appropriate reliance, and equity. They contend that these considerations are directly relevant to how EPA might deploy ML-based compliance tools while maintaining public trust in drinking water regulation.

In an article in Competition Policy International: TechReg Chronicle, Cary Coglianese of The University of Pennsylvania Law School addresses the challenges of regulating machine learning systems that serve diverse applications across contexts. Coglianese argues that ML’s heterogeneity—the fact that the same underlying techniques may produce vastly different tools with different risk profiles—complicates traditional regulatory approaches that assume more uniform technologies. He contends that regulators must develop flexible frameworks capable of addressing context-specific concerns rather than applying one-size-fits-all rules. Coglianese suggests that agencies like EPA should build capacity in data sciences, deploy management-based regulatory strategies, and remain vigilant when considering how to validate ML models for varied environmental applications such as watershed monitoring.

In an article in Science of the Total Environment, Seigi Karasaki and Rachel Morello-Frosch of the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, and Duncan Callaway of the UC Berkeley Energy and Resources Group, examine how machine learning modeling decisions for drinking water quality prediction can produce differential outcomes across demographic groups. The Karasaki team proposes practices for reducing algorithmic bias in water quality applications. They find that model design choices—including which variables to include and how to weight training data—can affect which communities receive accurate predictions. The Karasaki team suggests that modeling choice transparency and bias-vetting practices may be important when applying machine learning to questions of environmental science and justice.

Thank you. Yes, this is my hometown, and I want to give a warm welcome on a cold day to our friends from Ontario who aren't bothered by cold weather, fortunately. And so, I'm delighted to be able to showcase this extraordinary venue — which we'll talk about momentarily — but for Premier Ford to come here, I'm very grateful that you and your team have made the journey here to do something that I think is landmark. It's extraordinary and very exciting as someone who's from this community and knows that we're going to find a way to continue to work together in partnership the way we always have and always will do.

I want to acknowledge Nicolle Butcher, the President and CEO of Ontario Power Generation. Thank you for lending your expertise to the cause. Minister Lecce, the Legislative Assembly from Ontario. Justin Driscoll, our CEO and President of New York Power Authority. Justin and John Koelmel, the Chairman of the New York Power Authority. All my partners in government. I see our incoming mayor is here, I think. Anybody else? And Crystal here? Crystal Peoples-Stokes — Sean Ryan and Crystal Peoples-Stokes, our many Assemblymembers and elected officials who have joined us here today.

It is great to be here to discuss our energy future, and it's especially fitting. We're here at the Buffalo AKG Museum of Art. And why I wanted to come here? Of any place in the state I could do this is what I'm reminded of — not this building, but the building that you'll see — the older looking building is from the 1901 era. And it was built in order to help showcase the fact that Buffalo was basically the epicenter of everything at the time when it came to power, because we were the first city in the world to be electrified. And so, we had electric lights. People were fascinated by this. What do you mean electric lights? How can that be? And people came from all over to see this in the entire exhibition.

So it was certainly a high point, but a reminder that we can continue energy innovation and how to do power innovation as we venture into this next century. Buffalo is known as the City of Light. And actually I'll say the museum was built for the exhibition, it wasn't done in time. So it missed the opening, but we still celebrate it associated with that as well. But this new building is a reminder of the future and a reminder that traditions matter. And there's been a long standing, proud tradition of cooperation between New York and Ontario. This has always been — this is our neighbor.

[...]

Yeah. We've done so much together, and I'll just digress and say I'm a boater on Lake Erie. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world, and we stop at many of the ports in Colborne, Canada, Ontario, and just feel that warm embrace of a shared bond that our region brings to all of us. It's not just sports — go Blue Jays next time. You did very well this year, but also, I know you're rooting for the Buffalo Bills, and you come to hockey games and the baseball games in the summertime as well. But also our cultures, our tourism. You find me in my old life many times up at Niagara-on-the-Lake or strolling around both sides of the falls.

And so it is just — it's a world class region, and we need to continue working together to promote these incredible assets, but also the strength of our friendship and relationship, which is enduring. And I'm also reminded, we just came off of the bicentennial, the celebration of the Erie Canal — something that was an extraordinary feat of engineering and its time, but also it opened up Canada to New York City. And that connection also was one of the catalysts for explosive growth opening in the Midwest Canadian cities, ultimately the St. Lawrence Seaway that came through. So we've always been connected through waterways and energy sources as well.

And our economies are intertwined. The trade, despite some setbacks — won't go into too much detail there, but we want to make sure that our trade relationship remains trustworthy. It's a beneficial relationship, we understand that. And I'll acknowledge that there've been some terrible policies that have come out of Washington coincidentally just in the one year, and they've been hard to accept as someone who doesn't understand why there's a hostility toward Canada overall. But certainly it shakes us to our core as well as people who value our friends in Ontario and Quebec, particularly as they border our great state.

So I don't want those policies to jeopardize the goodwill, the friendship. And we just want to make sure that we continue doing things that show that collaboration. And as these threats out of Washington come, we're going to stand firm and let people know who our friends are who we also care about very deeply. So our partnership between New York and Ontario is rock solid, and as long as I'm Governor, it's going to stay that way.

And so we sat down together. It's about relationships. Premier Ford and I sat down together. It was a meeting of Northeast governors and the Canadian premiers that all bordered this region. We got together in Boston to talk about the threats out of Washington, how destabilizing that is for trade and our relationships overall, but how we can individually step up and ignore that process — those threats, that hostility — and show we truly are friends. And so we talked about economic opportunities. We also had a great conversation about power, and the Premier spoke with great pride about what is occurring in the Darlington area. We are focusing on small modular reactors, and I was very impressed, and so I wanted to learn more.

And I was intrigued with your forward thinking approach to delivering clean energy for the next generation. And so we focused on how we can stay true to our environmental commitments, which I truly believe in, but also our commitment to rate payers to keep utility costs affordable — which is not just a buzzword, it is the reality. We, as leaders, have to focus on reliability, sustainability and affordability all at the same time. So we found a way together, and that is through nuclear energy. And Ontario is already home to — is it 17 of 18 nuclear plants operating in Canada? So, ahead of your time. And Ontario Power Generation is leading the way in deploying North America's first small modular reactors, which I've been very intrigued with — very intrigued with. And the Darlington project, which you'll talk about, is going to be generating 1.2 gigawatts of power. And our conversation also led me to the understanding that OPG is collaborating with the Tennessee Valley Authority as well.

When you said that, I said, “Wait a minute? Why are you cooperating with them? I'm right here.” So that was another thought — that light bulb that went off in my head. Like, why aren't we also taking advantage of your forward-thinking approach when it comes to power?

So today — to cement these conversations just from a few months ago to add some substance to them — OPG signed a memorandum of understanding with NYPA to work together to share information on the best ways to bring advanced nuclear power to the State of New York. And they'll use their expertise, and knowhow and be a great resource in our next chapter in our nuclear story. And the timing is perfect because last summer I charged NYPA — our Executive Director, and our Chairman and others — to find a way to bring advanced nuclear power to Upstate New York. And this will be the first plant in New York State in over a generation.

And I wanted to do this because it's about reliability, affordability, but it's also about the thousands of jobs that are created in the process. And I was excited about that prospect as well. And one gigawatt of nuclear power can power roughly one million homes without adding any carbon to the atmosphere. That's really significant. And it's around the clock. It's every day of the year. It's completely insulated from the threats of rising oil and gas prices.

I believe it can power the industries of tomorrow as we're leaning into, especially here in Upstate New York, Micron — $100 billion investment to make semiconductor chips. The largest private sector investment in American history is going on just down the road in Syracuse. Right up the road in Buffalo, the University of Buffalo, we have $500 million being invested in Empire AI — artificial intelligence for public good. So we need the power source. We want to do all this. Our ambitions are broad, they're exciting, but if we don't power it, it doesn't work. And that's the challenge that we've embraced and we're moving with great speed.

I'm very impatient and I want this to happen. I know there's traditionally been hurdles. Our state has right now three nuclear plants operating. They're all up on Lake Ontario. And one is actually the oldest operating nuclear facility in the United States — going strong and safe since 1969. But it's time for us to bring new nuclear technology into the 21st century. I've spoken, actually, to President Trump about this in the White House and talked about the fact that people aren't embracing nuclear because there's a perception it is a long, arduous process, even a decade to get approvals. And we gleaned that over seven of the 10 years it takes to get nuclear approvals are at the federal level. So he has agreed to find ways to approach that with more urgency.

We are working closely with the federal administration in this particular area, and I want to make sure that everyone knows that we'll bring down the barriers and the costs. That's important. But also, this is not your grandmother's and your grandfather's nuclear. This is advanced. This is state of the art. This is safe. This is safe. And it has automatic safety systems, enhanced containment and rigorous, very rigorous, environmental safeguards.

So since the last six months when I directed NYPA to build a gigawatt of new nuclear capacity, we've moved aggressively to realize that vision. The deadline for request for information passed just last week, and I'm happy to announce that there are 23 developers who've expressed an interest in developing nuclear projects with NYPA. That's extraordinary. That's beyond what I could have imagined. That's a new era for nuclear power in the State of New York. And eight communities have expressed interest in hosting a plant, Also a very positive development. So what we want to do is make sure we also have the workforce to be able to do all this exciting work. And I've announced $40 million over the next four years in new funding for NYPA to launch a specialized nuclear workforce training program with our unions and our universities. So that's how we'll meet the demand by focusing now on the training required so we have the workforce in place.

And we've made some strategic hires at NYPA. Christopher Hanson, the former Chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was hired as a senior consultant to help us navigate that federal licensing. And I'm sorry I took Todd Josifovski, hired as our Senior Vice President of Nuclear Development, formerly the Project Director at Darlington — which you're already underway, so we need some help. Okay? You're good with that?

So he'll make sure that — just as is happening at Darlington, which he’ll talk about, is that the constructional process, very quickly. So the first phase that is being licensed this year will be on track and operational. Our goal is to be within five years, not 10, but five years.

And so, we've been excited about this and bringing a closer relationship. And in a couple minutes, Premier Ford and I will sign a Declaration of Intent to reaffirm and strengthen our historic bonds. We'll show the world that we have no tolerance for policies that are intended to drive us apart. We look forward to working together through this particular opportunity and many, many more as we focus on the sharing of opportunities, and resources, and intellect and expertise that'll help bolster both of our economies, and keep us strong and to keep the lights on.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-12/nuclearenergyhero2.jpg?h=489870a4&itok=XT17D1TD,N,,2025-12-20 06:57:24.638357

He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.

Two-hundred and twenty-one of the 417 voting members approved the bill, called the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development, or SPEED, Act on Thursday. The bill would change the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1969 law requiring federal environmental impact studies, to make the approval process for government projects easier.

Eleven Democrats joined 210 Republicans to support the bill, introduced by Arkansas Republican Bruce Westerman, while one GOP moderate voted against it. Westerman said after the act passed that it would reduce unnecessary permitting delays and make it easier for local governments to complete “economy-stimulating” projects.

“You may not realize it but permitting touches all aspects of life, from the ability to complete roadways and bridges that can prevent traffic jams all the way to the ability to lower the cost of your monthly electricity bill,” the congressman said in a statement.

“This isn’t just legislation for large, federal industries, it’s a bill for you and every other taxpaying Arkansan.”

Some Democrats who voted against the act include party leadership and members of the progressive caucus. The bill favors the Trump administration’s energy agenda, according to the caucus, which opposes fossil fuel industries.

“Environmental protection groups warn that this is a dangerous attempt to gut NEPA, the nation’s bedrock environmental law, turning it into a toothless procedural formality,” the group said in a statement. “The effect of this bill will be to prioritize oil and gas, and SPEED Act does nothing to advance permitting reforms for clean energy that progressives have long championed.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, contrastingly described the bill as part of a “pro-growth” agenda. He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.

“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained. “House Republicans continue to pass commonsense legislation that codifies President Trump’s executive orders and advances a pro-growth agenda to lower energy costs, strengthen national security, unleash American energy production, and get American workers and industry building again.”

Meg O’Neill | Photographer: Nicky Loh/Bloomberg

The surprise exit of Woodside Energy Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Meg O’Neill leaves her successor with a dilemma: should the Australian company continue down the path she set of promoting massive liquefied natural gas projects when forecasts point to a glut and lower prices?

O’Neill had been a forceful advocate for two major projects: Browse — a long-delayed plan to tap vast offshore reserves in Western Australia — and an expansion of the company’s export terminal in Louisiana, which is still under construction. Her stance reflected a company forecast for a 50% jump in global LNG demand over the next decade — one of the most bullish in the industry.

But with O’Neill now set to helm oil major BP Plc in April, Woodside’s incoming CEO will need to decide whether to stay the course as a record wave of global LNG supply is poised to flood the market and drag down prices for the remainder of the decade. Coupled with a surplus of oil, Woodside will face growing questions from investors about why it is doubling down on fossil-fuel expansion at a time when supply is abundant.

“The board and the new CEO can now rethink the value destructive Browse project, which is more expensive than 70% of competing potential new gas supplies around the world, as well as the expansion of Louisiana LNG,” the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, or ACCR, said in a statement on Thursday.

Source: BloombergNEF Global LNG Market Outlook 2030, July 14, 2025

At the core of the debate is the future role of natural gas. O’Neill and other industry leaders argue that gas will help coal-dependent nations transition to a cleaner-burning fossil fuel while providing reliable backup for intermittent renewable power.

However, that outlook isn’t guaranteed. Volatile LNG prices have pushed some emerging nations to rethink their reliance on imports — Pakistan, for instance, is stepping back from LNG as households and businesses turn rapidly to solar. Others, including India and China, are leaning on cheaper coal to bolster energy security and keep costs down.

Global LNG supply is set to jump by more than 50% by 2030 from 2024, far more than demand growth in recent years, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Daan Struyven said in a note on Thursday. “LNG prices will likely have to decline significantly as this oversupply builds to incentivize additional demand,” they said.

That creates some uncertainty over Woodside’s long-term strategy, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “O’Neill’s successor might rewrite Woodside’s gas playbook — a probability that could weigh on sentiment until the future path is clear,” analyst Anthony Chen said in a note.

Still, O’Neill has said that she looks at making decisions that will pan out over decades, and won’t get derailed by short-term market trends. According to a note from Bernstein, she has taken a disciplined approach relative to peers, exiting several green-hydrogen and renewables projects based on weakened demand, and refocused efforts on LNG.

That approach has helped Woodside become a larger player in the global gas market. She has cleared a path for North West Shelf — a sprawling LNG export plant that earlier this year was granted clearance to continue operating until 2070. And she oversaw the approval of the Scarborough offshore field, which is expected begin shipments during the second half of next year.

One of O’Neill’s last acts was restructuring the company’s LNG trading desk, including hiring a new head from Equinor ASA, to better withstand lower prices and market the wave of new supply, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Several contenders for the top job have already been mooted in industry circles. Woodside Chief Operating Officer Daniel Kalms and Chief Commercial Officer Mark Abbotsford are among potential picks, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s deliberations. The senior vice president for M&A, Dan Hamilton, could also be in the running, said another industry source who has worked closely with the company.

For now, Australian Chief Operating Officer Liz Westcott is running Woodside as interim CEO. The company is looking at internal and external candidates and plans to announce a permanent appointment in the first quarter, it said on Thursday.

The new chief will be tasked with lining line up another equity partner for Woodside’s $17.5 billion Louisiana LNG project and keep the company’s foray into Mexico on track as the Trion development moves toward producing oil later this decade.

On top of that, they will have to face increasingly vocal opposition from climate campaigners and the company’s own shareholders. At a meeting in May, protesters repeatedly interrupted O’Neill’s opening address by blowing on whistles, while a year earlier Woodside investors rejected the company’s climate strategy in a non-binding vote.

“Woodside has been persistently unresponsive to shareholder concerns,” the ACCR said. “Investors will be hoping that O’Neill’s departure is a circuit breaker on Woodside’s habit of pursuing high-capex, marginal fossil fuel projects, and is an opportunity to instead start focusing on better capital returns.”

Data centers are hubs for information technology equipment including servers, storage systems, networking equipment and other hardware for storing and distributing data. These facilities act as the infrastructure for web-based services and are used in developing artificial intelligence.

However, these facilities demand large amounts of energy to operate and large amounts of water to cool the machinery inside, with environmental and consumer advocacy watchdogs warning these facilities can herald skyrocketing energy rates while harming drinking water access in nearby communities.

In response, state Sens. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield), Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township) and Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) have introduced three bills to begin regulating the influx of data center facilities aiming to set up shop in Michigan.

Bayer’s Senate Bill 761 would bar entities withdrawing above an average of 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for consumptive use – where the water is lost and is not returned to the system – from obtaining a water withdrawal permit.

Shink’s Senate Bill 762 would create transparency standards on how much water and energy these facilities use, by requiring the Michigan Public Service Commission to publish annual reports regarding the total energy expenditures and water usage of data centers.

Geiss’s Senate Bill 763 would bar water utilities from passing off the infrastructure costs to accommodate a data center onto residential customers.

“We have seen hyperscale data center projects proposed in Saline, Battle Creek, Mason, and many other places throughout Michigan,” Bayer said in a statement. Residents of these communities are rightfully concerned, and by implementing additional guardrails, we can protect our constituents and our natural resources.”

Alongside support from other Senate Democrats, Sen. Jon Bumstead (R-Norton Shores) has also joined the bills as a cosponsor.

The department gave developers until Jan. 19 to provide more information that will help them make a final decision.

Environmental advocates earlier this month alleged that developer Acoma, LLC’s plans, if approved, would allow Project Jupiter to emit as many greenhouse gases annually as New Mexico’s two largest cities combined. The November applications called for the construction of two natural gas generating stations to power the data center project and approximated they would generate about as much electricity as the entire PNM system.

Developers estimated the two gas plants would together put nearly 500 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, an important ingredient in contributing to ozone, in the air. One of the generating stations — referred to as a “microgrid,” which describes developments that generate their own electricity without drawing from a larger power company’s grid — was listed at 249.97 tons per year and the other at 248.9. Developers sought an individual permit for the microgrids, even though they will support the same development.

Critics said the developers behind Project Jupiter appeared to be evading state regulations, which classify projects with at least 250 tons per year of nitrogen oxides as “major sources” of hazardous air pollutants and subject them to arduous monitoring.

A development “that is 1.1 tons away from the 250” threshold is “not practically enforceable,” NMED officials on Wednesday wrote to Project Jupiter’s developers of one of the proposed microgrids. Air in the surrounding area will also be impacted by the nearby microgrid that is planned to produce essentially the same amount of nitrogen oxides, they wrote.

Maslyn Locke, a New Mexico Environmental Law Center senior attorney who is representing nearby residents in a lawsuit against the Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners, said she was encouraged by the NMED decision.

“This reminder that the rules still apply is a good thing,” Locke said. “Of course, it’s not going to stop everything. It’s just giving us a little more time to wrap our heads around it.”

This week, Locke’s organization sent NMED a list of demands, including that the department widely distribute materials related to the project in both English and Spanish.

BorderPlex Digital Assets, the company behind Project Jupiter, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ford recalls electric, hybrid vehicles

The Detroit automaker said that the recall includes certain 2022-2026 F-150 Lightning BEV, 2024-2026 Mustang Mach-E, and 2025-2026 Maverick vehicles. Ford's number for this recall is 25C69.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the integrated park module may fail to lock into the park position when the driver shifts into park.

A loss of this parking function can allow the vehicle to rollaway, increasing the risk of a crash.

What you can do:

Ford said that it will implement a park module software update for free.

Vehicle owners may contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332 for additional information.

Interim letters, notifying owners of the safety risk, are expected to be mailed in February. Additional letters will be sent once the final remedy is available, anticipated in February 2026, as well.

Did you know the child tax credit increased? Let’s break down how recent tax law impacted this valuable tax credit.

The Child Tax Credit is a federal income tax credit available to certain families with children. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill, also known as the Working Families Tax Cut, some of the amounts and qualification rules have changed.

Starting with your 2025 tax return, the maximum credit increases from $2,000 to $2,200 for each qualifying child. And from 2026 forward, that amount will be adjusted annually for inflation, helping the credit keep up with the cost of living.Now, what about qualifications?

Before these changes, there were seven rules that determined whether a child was eligible. Now, there are eight. To qualify, a child generally must meet the following requirements.

One: The child must have been 16 or younger at the end of the tax year.

Two: The child must be your child, stepchild, adopted child, foster child, or a sibling.

Three: The child must be claimed as a dependent on your tax return.

Four: The child must not have provided more than half of their own support during the tax year.

Five: The child must have lived with you for more than half of the tax year.

Six: If the child is married and files a joint return, they only qualify if that joint return is filed solely to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax payments.

Seven: The child must be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or a U.S. resident alien.

And eight: The child and at least one person claiming the credit are now required to have work-eligible Social Security numbers.

So, what’s staying the same?

The Child Tax Credit remains partially refundable. The refundable portion, called the Additional Child Tax Credit, can be worth up to $1,700 per qualifying child for 2025.

Depending on your situation, that part can increase your refund, while the nonrefundable portion can at best reduce your tax bill to $0.

Income limits have also stayed the same. You can claim the full credit if your income is $200,000 or less for single filers, or $400,000 or less if married filing jointly. Once your income goes above those amounts, the credit gradually decreases by $50 for every $1,000 of income above the limit.

Recent tax law changes bring several new tax laws for 2025 and beyond. Understanding how they affect you doesn’t have to be stressful. Filers could see up to $1,000 refund increase or lower balance due, based on recent tax law changes.

Two-hundred and twenty-one of the 417 voting members approved the bill, called the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development, or SPEED, Act on Thursday.
The bill would change the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1969 law requiring federal environmental impact studies, to make the approval process for government projects easier.
He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.
“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained.","The House of Representatives has passed a bill aimed at easing the federal environmental review process.

The bill would change the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1969 law requiring federal environmental impact studies, to make the approval process for government projects easier.

Eleven Democrats joined 210 Republicans to support the bill, introduced by Arkansas Republican Bruce Westerman, while one GOP moderate voted against it. Westerman said after the act passed that it would reduce unnecessary permitting delays and make it easier for local governments to complete “economy-stimulating” projects.

“You may not realize it but permitting touches all aspects of life, from the ability to complete roadways and bridges that can prevent traffic jams all the way to the ability to lower the cost of your monthly electricity bill,” the congressman said in a statement.

“This isn’t just legislation for large, federal industries, it’s a bill for you and every other taxpaying Arkansan.”

Some Democrats who voted against the act include party leadership and members of the progressive caucus. The bill favors the Trump administration’s energy agenda, according to the caucus, which opposes fossil fuel industries.

“Environmental protection groups warn that this is a dangerous attempt to gut NEPA, the nation’s bedrock environmental law, turning it into a toothless procedural formality,” the group said in a statement. “The effect of this bill will be to prioritize oil and gas, and SPEED Act does nothing to advance permitting reforms for clean energy that progressives have long championed.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, contrastingly described the bill as part of a “pro-growth” agenda. He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.

“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained. “House Republicans continue to pass commonsense legislation that codifies President Trump’s executive orders and advances a pro-growth agenda to lower energy costs, strengthen national security, unleash American energy production, and get American workers and industry building again.”

ESS News spoke with leaders from around the energy storage industry to learn more about what they expect for the year ahead.
“The combined impact of collapsing revenues and soaring costs has made battery storage economics unworkable for many developers.
In Texas, the country’s largest battery storage market, revenues crashed in 2024 and 2025.
“It’s people, not just technologies, that have actively reshaped the energy storage industry this year.","2025 was a tumultuous year for the energy storage industry, and it left market forces tugging the industry in different directions. AI and data center-driven energy demand is skyrocketing while electricity prices are hitting highs; battery costs are shifting unevenly, project economics are under strain and a suite of policies set to come into effect in the New Year will cause even more shake-up.

ESS News spoke with leaders from around the energy storage industry to learn more about what they expect for the year ahead.

Rising electricity prices will push storage further into the spotlight as a cost and reliability solution.

“Everything is getting more expensive for families (groceries, household goods, gas) but electricity doesn’t have to be. We’re entering what I see as a twin crisis: the need for a more reliable electricity supply and relief for ratepayers facing rising costs. In 2026, the real test for the energy industry will be whether we can move fast enough to tackle both. Speed to market will be the single biggest driver of energy deployment next year, and energy storage can scale fast and cost effectively.” – Arvin Ganesan, CEO, Fourth Power

Battery prices will continue falling, even as tariffs and policy uncertainty reshape deployment timelines.

“I see battery prices continuing to drop at the start of the year with more energy being stored in smaller containers. While the tariffs are delaying some new projects, existing wind, solar, and grid shortages will need significant quantities of batteries, so no energy is wasted, and customers can still buy low-cost electricity at off hours…[and], President Trump will be forced to allow renewable energy projects to start again as a way to help the sagging economy to get moving before the elections under the pressure from big business for low-cost electricity.” – Steve Feinberg, President, Bluewater Battery Logistics

“The biggest unknown for next year remains how we’ll keep pace with surging electricity demand…Renewables and storage will continue to do the bulk of the heavy lifting. Solar, wind, and batteries are the fastest, cheapest, most scalable way to add firm power. Anyone who thinks otherwise is clinging to an outdated narrative.” – Peter Davidson, CEO and co-founder, Aligned Climate Capital

Storage economics will look better on paper than in practice.

“The combined impact of collapsing revenues and soaring costs has made battery storage economics unworkable for many developers. In Texas, the country’s largest battery storage market, revenues crashed in 2024 and 2025. In California, net annual revenues per kW of battery capacity decreased from $103/kW in 2022 to $78/kW in 2023 and just $53/kW in 2024 due to lower peak hour prices. On top of that, the cost and complexity of building battery storage is rising.” – Michael Thomas, CEO, Cleanview

It’s anyone’s guess whether 2026 will bring widespread cancellations or a late-year surge in battery demand.

“Project cancellations will be a thing of the past. Late in the year, we will see a huge demand for batteries with longer lead times.” – Steve Feinberg, President, Bluewater Battery Logistics

“I think we’re likely to see a lot of battery storage projects canceled in 2026. Projects that penciled at $192/kW in revenue with $100/kWh battery costs in 2023 now face $55/kW in revenue with $130/kWh costs—a fundamental shift that has forced developers to cancel 79 GW of planned capacity nationwide in 2025 [according to Cleanview’s data].” – Michael Thomas, CEO, Cleanview

Workforce constraints may be the limiting factor for storage deployment.

“It’s people, not just technologies, that have actively reshaped the energy storage industry this year. The heart of this shift is human. Communities demand safer options, utilities seek partners they can trust and teams across the country are working together to solve problems. Innovation is a people-first race to deliver storage that makes energy solutions more resilient for everyone. Looking ahead to 2026, the future of advanced battery energy storage will be defined by teams who lead with partnership, purpose and passion.” – Julie Royes, Vice President of Corporate Affairs, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

“As we look ahead to 2026, we will begin to see supply chain and workforce challenges easing for sectors tied to electrification or distribution level but continue to see long lead times for power transformers. The global shortage of skilled labor, especially in high-voltage, high-power transformers, is slowing production and driving up costs across the grid supply chain. We’re hearing from major manufacturers that the best training programs for this work are overseas, which creates real logistical and timeline hurdles for U.S. facilities.” – Charles Murray, CEO and Co-Founder, Switched Source

As the storage market fragments by use case, application-specific storage strategies will gain momentum.

“2026 won’t be the year EVs, grid storage, and data centers converge into a single battery roadmap, but instead, it will be the year each of those markets becomes large enough to justify its own optimized battery designs. What looks like convergence today is really just parallel scale. Automakers, utilities and data centers all care about cost, safety, and reliability, but each weighs those factors differently. Shared platforms will only win where cost reduction clearly outweighs performance tradeoffs. Outside of that, we’ll actually see more application-specific battery designs, not fewer.” – Joe Adiletta, CEO, Volexion

“[California’s] Assembly Bill (AB) 2514 proves early that purpose-driven storage procurement is both possible and effective, and the energy storage industry continues to build on that foundation with broader technology diversity and stronger bankability requirements.” – Giovanni Damato, President, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

Corporate buyers will cautiously diversify storage portfolios beyond lithium-ion.

“Currently, most corporate storage portfolios favor batteries due to their rapid deployment and established supply chains…however, market signals and investment trends indicate that diversification is gradually taking shape. Some sophisticated industrial users are piloting alternative technologies, but widespread portfolio diversity is unlikely to materialize until the 2030s, when these alternatives prove their economic viability at scale. In 2026, batteries are expected to remain the dominant technology in corporate portfolios, with gradual diversification as pilot projects expand, innovation accelerates and new business models emerge.

In the interim, hybrid solutions that combine batteries with other storage types may become more attractive for industries seeking both short-term flexibility and longer-term capacity.” – Matt Kennedy, Global Head of Client Transformation, IDA Ireland

Utilities and grid operators will push for innovation.

“I’d expect to see data centers and electrification drive many innovative strategies from big-name utilities. Looking across the major utilities, we’re seeing some of these strategies emerge. Some have a heavy emphasis on energy storage and utility-owned generation, while others emphasize capital-light measures leveraging more advanced controls and grid-enhancing technologies to make better use of the infrastructure that’s in place. Both have pros and cons and will take years to prove out. Still, it is good to see utility CEOs rising to the occasion with new ideas and cohesive strategies, even if they vary greatly based on regional challenges and regulatory structures.” – Charles Murray, CEO and Co-Founder, Switched Source",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/US.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 09:58:10.848239

Last year, the co-owners withdrew their air permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for the 625 MW fossil gas project.
“We are glad Minnesota Power has withdrawn from NTEC,” said Evan Mulholland, Healthy Communities Program Director at MCEA.
“NTEC would be bad for the climate, too expensive, harmful to public health, and it was proposed in the wrong location.
MCEA encourages Dairyland Power Cooperative and Basin Electric Power Cooperative to abandon their plans to build and operate NTEC.” ###","SUPERIOR, Wis. — Today, in a Minnesota Public Utilities Commission filing by Minnesota Power, the company announced that it will withdraw from the proposed Nemadji Trail Energy Center (NTEC) gas plant project, which it had been developing with Dairyland Power Cooperative (based in Wisconsin) and Basin Electric Power Cooperative (based in North Dakota). Minnesota Power had been a 50% owner and planned to build and operate the plant.

Last year, the co-owners withdrew their air permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for the 625 MW fossil gas project. The withdrawal happened after the City of Superior voted to deny local zoning permits necessary for the project to move forward. Local residents, Dairyland and Minnesota Power customers, Fond du Lac and Red Cliff Tribes, and environmental groups, including Sierra Club, Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MCEA), Healthy Climate Wisconsin, and Clean Wisconsin, have been calling for a full project cancellation for years.

“This is the right step forward to protect air quality in Superior and the surrounding communities. NTEC was outdated almost as soon as it was proposed, and years of delays have underscored what a poor idea this is. There’s no need for another new dirty, expensive gas plant in Wisconsin. All eyes are on Dairyland to cancel plans for NTEC once and for all as we transition to clean energy,” said Elizabeth Ward, Sierra Club Wisconsin Chapter Director.

“We are glad Minnesota Power has withdrawn from NTEC,” said Evan Mulholland, Healthy Communities Program Director at MCEA. “NTEC would be bad for the climate, too expensive, harmful to public health, and it was proposed in the wrong location. MCEA encourages Dairyland Power Cooperative and Basin Electric Power Cooperative to abandon their plans to build and operate NTEC.”

The final regulations omit the rule altogether.
The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.
Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.","On the day before Thanksgiving, the Treasury and IRS issued final regulations for the Section 4501 excise tax on stock repurchases. Enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, Section 4501 imposes a 1% excise tax on repurchases of stock by public U.S. companies, as well as purchases of the stock of foreign publicly traded corporations by their U.S. affiliates.

As previously discussed in Brass Tax, proposed regulations for Section 4501 issued in 2024 intentionally omitted exceptions for several types of transactions that many commentators believed should not be subject to the excise tax. In the final regulations, the Treasury and IRS have backtracked on those omissions, and have included a number of exceptions for transactions that are in form redemptions of stock (or so treated for federal income tax purposes), but are generally not seen as the sort of repurchases that Congress intended the excise tax to target, including:

repurchases of ""plain vanilla"" or ""debt-like"" preferred stock

payment of consideration funded by the target corporation in take-private transactions (which is generally treated as a redemption for U.S. federal income tax purposes)

redemptions of additional forms of ""tier 1 capital,"" such as that issued by cooperative banks and agricultural credit associations

acquisitions and cancellations of stock in certain liquidations and acquisitive reorganizations

exchanges of stock in single-party reorganizations (that is, recapitalizations that qualify as ""E"" reorganizations and changes in identity, form or place of organization that qualify as ""F"" reorganizations)

certain repurchases by investment companies that do not qualify as RICs for federal income tax purposes (repurchases by companies that qualify as RICs or REITs were already exempt)

In addition, the final regulations do not include the controversial ""funding rule"" that appeared in prior IRS guidance, under which a foreign corporation's repurchase of its own stock would have been subject to the excise tax to the extent the repurchase was funded by a U.S. affiliate. The funding rule contained in the 2024 proposed regulations, under which repurchases funded by a U.S. affiliate would have been taxable only if done ""with a principal purpose of avoiding"" the excise tax, already represented a retreat from an earlier, more mechanical version in Notice 2023-2. That more limited funding rule nevertheless attracted significant criticism, including that compliance with the rule would be administratively burdensome and its ""principal purpose"" test could be vague and indeterminate in many cases. The final regulations omit the rule altogether.

Pressure from trade tariffs, the removal of electric vehicle (EV) tax incentives, and the ""K-shaped"" economy phenomenon (K-shaped economy) are the main factors that hit people's purchasing power, as well as ending the trend of the revival of compact sedans that were seen last year.

The figure of 17 million units, which used to be the gold standard for automotive industry success, now seems to be a memory. Analysts at Cox Auto stated that the figure of 16 million is now a ""new peak"" for the US market. Although overall 2025 is projected to rise slightly by 1.8 percent to 16.03 million units compared to 2024, experts see this trend not as a spike, but as a new saturation point amid challenging economic conditions.

Mercedes-Benz and Jeep Lead PHEV Market Amid Declining Interest in Pure Electric Cars

As reported by Autoblog, Saturday, December 20, the deepest slump was felt by the electric vehicle (EV) sector, which has been hailed as the future. Sales of EVs in the fourth quarter are projected to fall sharply by 37 percent compared to last year, with the market share shrinking to only 5.7 percent. This decline is very contrasting when compared to the third quarter, where consumers flocked to buy EVs in pursuit of tax credits of up to US $7,500 before the program ended in September.

The electric vehicle market is expected to plummet by 37 percent: Tesla still holds the reins as the EV market leader with a 46 percent share, followed by Chevrolet and Ford. However, Tesla's electrification is not immune from the economic storm; Elon Musk's manufacturer is expected to experience a sales decline of up to 29.8 percent in this closing quarter. On the other hand, ""bridge"" technology such as hybrid and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) cars continue to show their fangs, with Mercedes-Benz leading the PHEV segment as consumers begin to switch to options that are considered more realistic.

The harsh reality also hit middle-class and working-class communities who are increasingly squeezed by the high cost of vehicle ownership. In addition to the continued soaring new unit prices with an average transaction reaching nearly 50,000 US dollars, insurance costs, spare parts, and maintenance also rose significantly beyond the consumer price index. This condition forces the segment of cheap cars or compact cars to lose their place in the market, making the industry now only rely on premium class consumers who still have purchasing power.

The outlook for 2026 is still difficult to find optimism as Cox Auto predicts sales will fall back to 15.8 million units. Even though sales volumes have shrunk, major automotive manufacturers are predicted to still reap high profits. Their strategy has now shifted pragmatically: selling fewer vehicles but at a much higher price, making new car ownership a luxury that only a few high-end people can enjoy.",https://imgsrv2.voi.id/F5ULD3pDiZlE76ceQymN4EZF5au0EZwPBjnQN04-iwo/rs:fill/w:800/h:450/g:sm/wm:1:nowe:0:0:1/bG9jYWw6Ly8vcHVibGlzaGVycy81NDUwNjQvMjAyNTEyMTkxNzQ2LW1haW4uY3JvcHBlZF8xNzY2MTQxMTkyLmpwZw.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 10:59:15.575311

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Entergy Arkansas yesterday announced Next Generation Arkansas, the company's comprehensive plan to provide electricity that does more for Arkansas by strengthening reliability, expanding energy supply, driving economic growth and keeping power affordable for all customers. The company, and its more than 2,800 employees, are focusing the plan and their efforts in the coming years on helping keep the state and its customers out in front of the emerging electric future developing in the U.S. and globally.

""Next Generation Arkansas is about preparing our state for what's ahead. By strengthening the grid, adding new generation and modernizing how we deliver power, we're making the system more reliable and more affordable while also building a system that enables unprecedented growth over the long term,"" said Laura Landreaux, Entergy Arkansas president and CEO. ""These investments help prevent outages, support new jobs and ensure that Arkansas families and businesses continue to benefit from low, predictable electricity costs as our state grows.""

Next Generation Arkansas is a multi-faceted plan that includes input from state and local leaders and Entergy Arkansas customers across the state to ensure transparency, accountability and open dialogue about affordability and how to best meet their needs. The plan represents the company's response to several power-related issues facing the state:

Recent state growth requiring more power to serve customers;

More extreme weather in recent years affecting customer reliability;

Increasing state competitiveness for job-creating projects; and

Cost pressures requiring new approaches to keep rates low for customers.

To meet this demand, Next Generation Arkansas has been built around four core priorities, detailed below.

1. Better power for Arkansas: Fewer outages, faster repairs

Entergy Arkansas is launching one of the most ambitious reliability improvement plans in recent history designed to make the power grid stronger and more reliable with an initial goal to reduce power outages by at least 30% over the coming years.

In addition to increasing vegetation investments that will keep power lines clear, the company is performing reliability improvement projects across the state and deploying new, advanced technology tools that will help spot problems faster, prevent challenges and improve power quality for decades to come.

The economic growth the company is helping enable is adding new large customers to the grid that helps offset the costs of these improvements for existing customers.

2. More power for Arkansas: Power when and where needed to meet soaring demand

Arkansas was recently ranked the fastest-growing state economy in America for two quarters in a row, the No. 1 state for inbound movers, and the state with the lowest cost of living. Arkansas is already expected to see more than a 35% increase in power needs in the next five years, and with projections showing that figure could more than double, Entergy Arkansas is acting now to build the next generation of power sources to support the state's growth and serve its customers while keeping rates affordable.

To do this, Entergy Arkansas plans to invest in approximately 2,600 MW of new, more fuel-efficient generation resources and repower approximately 1,600 MW of existing generation in the next five years pending approval from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, including:

Investing in new, modern natural gas plants to increase fuel efficiency by up to 40%, which lowers fuel charges on customer bills:

450 MW at the new Ironwood Power Station natural gas plant in Hot Spring County (2028).

750 MW at the new Jefferson Power Station natural gas plant in Jefferson County (2029).

600 MW of solar + 350 MW of battery storage at the Arkansas Cypress facility in Jefferson County (2028), which will provide clean, renewable power that lowers fuel charges on customer bills.

Retrofitting coal-fired generators to burn natural gas and extend their lives.

Investing in upgrades at existing natural gas facilities to increase output more than 150 MW.

Renewing the license to generate 1,800 MW of clean, reliable 24/7 energy produced by the Arkansas Nuclear One power plant and investing in new, more efficient plant equipment that increases the output of the facility.

These investments will ensure Arkansas has a balanced, more cost-efficient, ""all-of-the-above"" energy mix needed to support homes, businesses and new industries.

3. Job power for Arkansas: Helping the state recruit more and better jobs

Arkansas offers a strong pro-business environment, and over the past five years, Entergy Arkansas has partnered with state and community leaders to drive the creation of more than 7,500 jobs and over $13 billion in capital investments. As electricity becomes a key factor in securing new business, the state must continue delivering the power infrastructure and site development needed to compete. When structured strategically, these private investments not only generate tax revenue and quality jobs, but also provide broader benefits for Arkansans, including bill savings and a more reliable grid. The company plans to do this by:

Using the blueprint created by the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025 to work at the speed needed to compete nationally for once-in-a-generation tech and industrial projects.

Bolstering local job impact – Arkansas building Arkansas – by using local contractors and companies around the state whenever possible, reinvesting growth back into our communities through new jobs, state and local tax revenue, and indirect economic impact.

Creating economic impact while implementing the plan – for example, the development of the Ironwood, Jefferson Power Station and Arkansas Cypress power plants would create approximately 1,860 direct jobs as well as significantly more indirect jobs during construction, provide 46 permanent jobs during operation, and that will generate more than $105 million in new local and state tax revenue by 2030.

""We want to commend state leaders for passing the Generating Jobs Act of 2025, which is a landmark legislation and shows what's possible when Arkansas sets a bold vision for its future, and the Arkansas Public Service Commission for approving the new associated rider,"" Landreaux said. ""Because of the state's leadership, Arkansas has the tools to compete for once-in-a-generation opportunities. We are committed to delivering a power system that attracts new jobs, strengthens communities, and keeps our state moving forward for the next generation of Arkansans.""

4. Affordable power for Arkansas: Keeping rates low and predictable

Entergy Arkansas's rates remain 22% below the national average, and the company plans to continue finding ways to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and offer innovative bill solutions to keep power affordable for all customers, even as the company invests in the state's growth including:

Leveraging new policies to help build the power system Arkansas needs while keeping rate stable and predictable.

Using new technologies to help manage the grid and prevent outages at less cost to customers.

Providing customers with ways to lower their bills with new rate structures and by helping them access resources like free home energy checkups, free and discounted energy-saving products, and rebates on energy-efficient equipment purchases.

Continuing to recruit new large industrial customers to help spread the cost of maintaining and upgrading the power grid across a larger customer base and reduce the burden on residents and small businesses.

Working with new large customer partners to scale and accelerate energy affordability initiatives and encourage others to provide community support, as Google has with its $25 million Energy Impact Fund.

All of these efforts will be managed with transparency for customers and with direct oversight from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, Landreaux said.

""Our 2,800 Entergy employees in Arkansas and I understand that this is some of the most important work of our careers, and we feel it personally because we're Arkansans too,"" Landreaux said. ""We're proud to help deliver better power, more jobs and a brighter future for our fellow Arkansans.""

Despite the challenges, 2025 reinforced why independent environmental journalism matters. We produced groundbreaking work on data centers before it was mainstream. We held polluters accountable when enforcement wavered. We documented infrastructure failures and community resilience. We created tools — data dashboards, practical guides, and civic action toolboxes — that became essential resources for residents and advocates.

As we close out this challenging year, here’s how Planet Detroit held the line for Michigan’s environment and communities through the four pillars of our reporting: accountability, service, solutions, and community voices.

Here’s a rundown of the stories we reported on this year.

ACCOUNTABILITY: Exposing threats and holding power accountable

Data centers invade the state

We published this comprehensive look at small-town backlash against data center sprawl in September, ahead of the curve as other outlets scrambled to catch up months later. The story captured rural communities speaking out against Big Tech’s energy-hungry infrastructure. The David-versus-Goliath battles in Washtenaw County foreshadowed a statewide pattern.

Our June piece on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s appointment to the Michigan Public Service Commission warned readers about utility influence on the commission. This concern materialized in December as the MPSC considered fast-tracking DTE’s Saline data center.

Then, this fall, as the data center phenomenon grew, we created a comprehensive guide to data centers in Michigan explaining what they are, how they impact communities, and how residents can engage in the approval process. We also produced a guide to the Michigan Public Service Commission, the state agency that regulates utilities and approves major energy projects, so residents understand how to participate in hearings and make their voices heard.

See all of our data center coverage.

Water infrastructure continues failing Detroit

When a major water main break flooded homes in Southwest Detroit in February, we documented the immediate crisis. But we didn’t stop there.

Our follow-up investigation revealed how climate change is compounding Detroit’s water infrastructure problems. “Weather whiplash” events cause pipes to undergo “thermal shock,” making them brittle and prone to catastrophic failure. The 1930s-era water main that burst, combined with increasingly volatile temperatures, creates a perfect storm for more frequent breaks.

This exemplifies our approach: breaking news coverage that captures immediate human impact, followed by investigative reporting that explains systemic forces at play.

Wyandotte’s water crisis: An investigation

Our deep dive into Wyandotte’s drinking water started with a single state report and evolved into months of accountability journalism that revealed immediate health risks and a decade-long deception.

In May, we reported state regulators found “significant deficiencies” in Wyandotte’s water system. The report revealed something else: Wyandotte had stopped fluoridating its drinking water — yet the city’s website still claimed it was doing so.

Our June reporting found that Wyandotte had quietly discontinued fluoridation in 2015 without alerting residents beyond its annual mandated water quality report, and only removed the misleading claim after our story. The city promised a fluoride plan by October, a full decade later.

We covered packed hearings where residents, dentists, and health experts urged officials to restore fluoridation. But when the vote came in October, commissioners voted 2-2, failing to restore it. “I have my reasons why; I don’t need to make a comment,” one commissioner told us.

This investigation exemplifies sustained accountability journalism: document-based reporting that exposes government failures, persistent follow-up through multiple hearings, and giving voice to residents who deserve transparency.

Holding polluters accountable: 3 fights for environmental justice

EES Coke: Our reporting from an EPA pollution trial — picked up by the Associated Press — tracked this Southwest Detroit polluter through courts and regulatory processes. When the EPA offered pollution exemptions and EES Coke applied, we were the only local newsroom reporting on what it means for residents breathing that air.

Aevitas: After a decade of odor complaints, a June fire finally sparked city action. We documented how the blaze, which took seven hours to control and injured a firefighter, revealed the facility’s impacts on Jefferson Chalmers and Marina District residents. Our analysis showed area odor complaints dropped 90% after Aevitas shut down. City Council passed an enforcement resolution, and a state regulator declared the facility’s air permit “obsolete.”

US Ecology: Our December reporting may mark a significant shift in how hazardous waste facilities are regulated in Detroit. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy ultimately renewed the facility’s permit despite years of community concerns, but added additional oversight aimed at odor control. We’re watching to see if this represents a real turning point in the state’s approach to industrial permitting.

Together, these stories demonstrate our relentless attention to industrial pollution. This sustained coverage holds polluters, regulators, and local officials accountable.

SERVICE: Making civic action easy

We believe journalism shouldn’t just inform people about problems. It should make civic action easy. That’s why we pair accountability reporting with practical tools, guides, and explainers that help residents take the next step. Whether you’re checking if your home has a lead pipe, understanding your energy bill, or learning how to file a complaint about air quality, we’re building the civic infrastructure Detroit and Michigan need.

Civic action boxes: From story to action

Every major accountability story includes a civic action box — a simple tool that answers “What can I do about this?” Whether it’s checking if your home has lead pipes, filing an air quality complaint, understanding your energy bill, or connecting with a community health worker, these boxes eliminate the friction between learning about a problem and taking concrete steps to address it. We don’t just want you informed: we want you equipped.

Data dashboards: Transparency you can use

Government agencies collect vast amounts of environmental and public health data, but accessing it often requires navigating clunky databases, filing public records requests, or decoding technical jargon. Planet Detroit does that work so you don’t have to. Our dashboards translate complex datasets into tools you can actually use to track progress, compare communities, and hold decision-makers accountable.

Michigan Lead Service Line Tracker – See which Michigan water systems have lead pipes and track replacement progress in your community. Built in partnership with Safe Water Engineering, this tool makes it easy to check if your home may have lead pipes and monitor local progress toward removal.

Michigan Air Permit Violations 2018-2024 – Track which facilities are violating their air pollution permits. This dashboard makes enforcement data accessible so communities can hold polluters and regulators accountable.

Guides and explainers paired with accountability stories

Every major investigation came with tools to help readers respond:

Data centers → Community guide to data centers and MPSC explainer

Water infrastructure failures → Lead pipe replacement checker

Air quality crises → Air quality guide and complaint filing instructions

Medical transport crisis → Resources for accessing health care

Community health → How to connect with local support

Electronics recycling → Where and how to properly dispose

Browse all service journalism

These aren’t add-ons to our reporting—they’re core to our mission. Information without action is just noise. We believe residents deserve both the truth about what’s happening and the tools to do something about it.

SOLUTIONS: Community-driven responses to challenges

We don’t just report problems, we spotlight the people and organizations building solutions. In 2025, our solutions journalism showed how communities are responding to environmental and health challenges with innovation, collaboration, and determination.

From food security to healthcare to habitat restoration

When federal SNAP delays left thousands of Michiganders hungry, we identified grassroots Detroit organizations that stepped up. It’s an example of how service journalism and community voices converge to reveal both problems and solutions.

Health care innovation came from unexpected sources. A volunteer-run clinic expanded its services to fill gaps in Detroit’s medical safety net. “It’s just a beautiful thing,” one provider told us.

Environmental restoration efforts took root along the Detroit River, where a local nonprofit began restoring wetland habitat on islands, actively reversing decades of degradation rather than simply documenting decline.

COMMUNITY VOICES: Residents telling their own stories

In 2025, our Neighborhood Reporting Lab continued to build on our belief that the best environmental journalism centers on the voices of people living closest to the issues. We trained Detroit residents to report on the health, climate, and community issues they see in their own neighborhoods, producing more than 30 stories that revealed the texture of environmental life in Detroit that no outsider could capture.

Community residents emerged as powerful storytellers, uplifting example after example of local leadership. Loretta Powell grows vegetables and neighbors together on Detroit’s east side, while Danny Dolley leads watershed restoration efforts in Chandler Park. Jason Ford’s work at Detroit People’s Food Co-op embodies his philosophy: “We gotta build the systems.” Erik Shelley’s journey in the fight for social justice shows him to be “someone you want on your side.”

Urban agriculture stories revealed the practical challenges and creative solutions. One Detroit farmer tackles water access to ensure “the plants will be watered fully and consistently.” Brittney Rooney grows food on Beaverland Farms and in the Brightmoor community. Dazmonique Carr works to improve Detroit’s food access, one produce box at a time.

Innovation took surprising forms. One Detroit woman turned a birthday tradition into a global upcycling movement — The Chip Bag Project even won a state grant. Detroit’s ReVamp clothing swaps make the world more sustainable, one party at a time. Detroit’s Architectural Salvage Warehouse proves that upcycled gems are everywhere.

Culture and sustainability intersect in unexpected places. Dominick Lemonious reimagines the art gallery at Detroit’s “Black Store.” Chi Fan Le brings authentic Chinese cuisine to Detroit’s pop-up scene. Sustain-A-City showed how Detroit reimagines sustainability through art.

Health and wellness stories captured movement and connection. We Walk Detroit builds health and community step by step in city parks — “therapeutic,” participants say. Black students sail the Detroit River with Harry Jones — “water is in my DNA,” he says. Socially Chrissy, Detroit’s bold biking mom, proves no car means no problem.

The Chandler Park Fieldhouse opened as an east side hub for health, hope, and community. Meanwhile, Detroiters described the citywide struggle with truck traffic: “Our streets are sinking.”

These stories don’t just inform, they honor the lived expertise of Detroit residents, celebrate community-led solutions, and build connections between neighbors working on similar challenges. The Neighborhood Reporting Lab proves that environmental journalism is most powerful when communities tell their own stories.

But, there are plenty of things you can do or change to lower your impact on the environment and save some money.

Heather Bolick is the Chief Sustainability and Resiliency Officer for the city of Charlotte. She says some of these changes can also support local businesses.

""Please, real trees instead of artificial. You'll support your local North Carolina economy farmers, and it's much better for the environment,"" Bolick says.

She also explains you can eventually put them back into the environment with composting.

When it comes to matching pajamas, consider reusing them, instead of buying new or making a DIY project.

""How about if you took apart those pajamas and put them back together like sort of a patchwork thing?"" Bolick suggests. ""Because there's some local businesses here in Charlotte, Spring Clean being one of them, that actually does that they take unused materials and like put them back together for for higher and better use.""

Try to reuse gift bags and bows or choose recyclable paper options.

A fun activity for the kids and a way to keep them distracted when they’re out of school: wrap in brown paper and let them color and decorate themselves.

Two-hundred and twenty-one of the 417 voting members approved the bill, called the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development, or SPEED, Act on Thursday.
The bill would change the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1969 law requiring federal environmental impact studies, to make the approval process for government projects easier.
He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.
“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained.","The House of Representatives has passed a bill aimed at easing the federal environmental review process.

Two-hundred and twenty-one of the 417 voting members approved the bill, called the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development, or SPEED, Act on Thursday. The bill would change the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1969 law requiring federal environmental impact studies, to make the approval process for government projects easier.

Eleven Democrats joined 210 Republicans to support the bill, introduced by Arkansas Republican Bruce Westerman, while one GOP moderate voted against it. Westerman said after the act passed that it would reduce unnecessary permitting delays and make it easier for local governments to complete “economy-stimulating” projects.

“You may not realize it but permitting touches all aspects of life, from the ability to complete roadways and bridges that can prevent traffic jams all the way to the ability to lower the cost of your monthly electricity bill,” the congressman said in a statement.

“This isn’t just legislation for large, federal industries, it’s a bill for you and every other taxpaying Arkansan.”

Some Democrats who voted against the act include party leadership and members of the progressive caucus. The bill favors the Trump administration’s energy agenda, according to the caucus, which opposes fossil fuel industries.

“Environmental protection groups warn that this is a dangerous attempt to gut NEPA, the nation’s bedrock environmental law, turning it into a toothless procedural formality,” the group said in a statement. “The effect of this bill will be to prioritize oil and gas, and SPEED Act does nothing to advance permitting reforms for clean energy that progressives have long championed.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, contrastingly described the bill as part of a “pro-growth” agenda. He said the permitting process has “driven up” costs and blocked critical energy and infrastructure projects for far too long.

“The National Environmental Policy Act has been stretched far beyond its original intent, and we are taking away its ability to be weaponized or misused for activist-driven litigation and partisan agendas,” Johnson explained. “House Republicans continue to pass commonsense legislation that codifies President Trump’s executive orders and advances a pro-growth agenda to lower energy costs, strengthen national security, unleash American energy production, and get American workers and industry building again.”

Despite federal rollbacks, LCV’s state affiliates won critical state and local policies across the country to promote clean energy, lower energy costs, reduce pollution, and protect our communities and environment.

In 2025, states from Arizona to Wisconsin advanced clean energy progress, leading the nation forward on climate action and fighting to lower energy bills for families. Through the Clean Energy for All campaign, LCV and our 30 state affiliates played a central role in driving this progress — mobilizing grassroots demand, building strong coalitions, winning equitable policies, and ensuring that benefits reach communities.

Watch some of our state affiliate leaders describe exciting affordable clean energy policy wins in their states:

2. State Democracy Wins

To combat the climate crisis and protect our democracy, we need a government that hears, protects, and reflects the people it represents.

LCV and our 30 state affiliates worked all year to protect and expand access to the voting booth by organizing and advocating for strong pro-democracy policies across the country. With your support, we scored some major victories. We also pushed back against authoritarianism by helping to mobilize millions of people during several nationwide days of nonviolent protests — a show of strength for our growing movement.

3. Accountability: We Can’t Afford This

LCV is known for holding lawmakers publicly accountable for their votes. So when congressional Republicans voted to gut affordable clean energy and raise prices, we launched a nationwide campaign to let their constituents know and to push Republicans to change course.

As energy costs soared across the country, LCV showed up in the home districts of members of Congress who voted for Trump’s Big Ugly Bill to deliver a powerful message from their constituents: We can’t afford this. Our work is helping to shape a national narrative on high energy costs and the economic benefits of affordable clean energy — work we’ll continue in 2026.

Read about how we’re holding congressional Republicans accountable for rising energy prices.

4. Public Lands: Stop the Sell-Off

Our public lands and waters are national treasures that belong to us all. The Trump administration is relentlessly trying to sell them off to polluters, and we’re mobilizing nationwide to stop them.

There are 640 million acres of public lands owned and managed by the federal government, including national parks, monuments, and wilderness areas. These lands enjoy some of the broadest public support of any major issue, and the vast majority of Americans oppose closing or selling them.

In April, LCV and our state affiliates launched a nationwide campaign to protect our irreplaceable public lands and waters from the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks. In August, we held events in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Oregon, and other states with advocates, lawmakers, community leaders, and artists to celebrate and defend the lands we rely on. We continue to put pressure on lawmakers to stop their sell-off for drilling, mining, and logging.

5. Winning Elections

Over the last year, our movement took this message to heart: don’t agonize — organize. In 2025, we applied lessons learned from the 2024 elections and zeroed in on voters’ concerns around affordability, especially utility rates. From ad testing to door-to-door canvassing, we innovated our tactics to reach voters and turn them out for pro-clean energy candidates.

Our strategy succeeded, as our state affiliates ran successful campaigns in important state and local elections nationwide. Their efforts to define the issues and engage voters helped deliver major victories in Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia, and elsewhere, along with other important wins for our environment and democracy, from state Supreme Court races to ballot measures to city council races.

(4) Section 45Q(a)(3) allows a credit of the applicable dollar amount (as determined under section 45Q(b)(1)) per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after February 9, 2018, during the 12-year period beginning on the date the equipment was originally placed in service, and (i) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, (ii) used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, or (iii) utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5).

(5) Section 45Q(f)(2) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate (Secretary), in consultation with the EPA, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of the Interior, to establish regulations for determining adequate security measures for the geological storage of qualified carbon oxide under section 45Q(a) such that the qualified carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere. Section 45Q(f)(2) further provides that the term “geological storage of qualified carbon oxide” includes storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams under such conditions as the Secretary may determine under such regulations.

(6) On June 2, 2020, the Treasury Department and the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-112339-19) in the Federal Register (85 F.R. 34050) under section 45Q. After consideration of all comments received in response to the proposed regulations, on January 15, 2021, the Treasury Department and the IRS, in consultation with the EPA, Department of Energy, and the Department of the Interior, published final regulations in the Federal Register under section 45Q. See T.D. 9944; 86 F.R. 4728, as corrected in 86 F.R. 16530 (March 30, 2021).

(7) Section 1.45Q-3(a) provides that, in general, to qualify for the §45Q credit, a taxpayer must either physically or contractually dispose of captured qualified carbon oxide in secure geological storage in the manner provided in §1.45Q-3(b), or utilize qualified carbon oxide in a manner conforming with section 45Q(f)(5) and §1.45Q-4. Secure geological storage includes, but is not limited to, storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams.

(8) Section 1.45Q-3(b) provides that for purposes of the §45Q credit, qualified carbon oxide is considered disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage such that the qualified carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere if the qualified carbon oxide is (1) injected into a well that (i) complies with applicable Underground Injection Control or other regulations, located onshore or offshore under submerged lands within the territorial jurisdiction of States or federal waters, and (ii) is not used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project, in compliance with applicable requirements under subpart RR; or (2) injected into a well that (i) complies with applicable Underground Injection Control or other regulations, is located onshore or offshore under submerged lands within the territorial jurisdiction of States or Federal waters, and (ii) is used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and stored in compliance with applicable requirements under subpart RR, or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards endorsed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) under CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, Carbon dioxide capture, transportation and geological storage — Carbon dioxide storage using enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) (CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019).

(9) Section 1.45Q-2(h)(5) provides that, in general, carbon oxide that is injected into an oil reservoir that is not a qualified enhanced oil recovery project under section 43(c)(2) of the Code due to circumstances such as the first injection of a tertiary injectant occurring before 1991, or because a petroleum engineer's certification was not timely filed, cannot be treated as qualified carbon oxide, disposed of in secure geological storage, or utilized in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5). Section 1.45Q-2(h)(5) does not apply to an oil reservoir if: (i) the reservoir has permanently ceased oil production; (ii) the operator has obtained an Underground Injection Control Class VI permit; and (iii) the operator complies with subpart RR.

(10) Section 1.45Q-3(d) provides that for qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects in which the taxpayer reported volumes of carbon oxide to the EPA pursuant to subpart RR, the taxpayer may self-certify the volume of qualified carbon oxide claimed for purposes of section 45Q. For qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects in which the taxpayer determined volumes pursuant to CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, a taxpayer may prepare documentation as outlined in CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019 internally, but all such documentation must be provided to a qualified independent engineer or geologist, who then must certify that the documentation provided, including the mass balance calculations as well as information regarding monitoring and containment assurance, is accurate and complete. The qualified independent engineer or geologist certifying a project must be duly registered or certified in any State. The certification must contain an affidavit from the certifying engineer or geologist stating that he or she is independent from the taxpayer (and if an election under section 45Q(f)(3)(B) has been made, the affidavit must state that he or she is independent from both the electing taxpayer and the credit claimant). Certifications must be made annually and under penalties of perjury. For any leaked amount of qualified carbon oxide (as defined in §1.45Q-5(c)) that is determined pursuant to CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, the certification must also include a statement that the quantity was determined in accordance with sound engineering principles. Taxpayers that capture and dispose of qualified carbon oxide giving rise to the §45Q credit must file Form 8933, Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, with a timely filed Federal income tax return or Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, including extensions or amendments to Federal income tax returns, Forms 1065, or on administrative adjustment requests under section 6227 (AARs), as applicable.

.02 EPA Regulations

(1) Under the Safe Drinking Water Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, injection of carbon dioxide into any underground reservoir requires the operator to comply with Underground Injection Control (UIC) program regulations and to obtain the appropriate UIC well permits. The UIC program is designed to protect underground sources of drinking water from underground injection. Under 40 CFR §146.5 (Classification of injection wells), Class VI is an appropriate UIC well permit for wells that are not experimental in nature and that are used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide beneath the lowermost formation containing an underground source of drinking water; for wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have been granted a waiver of the injection depth requirements pursuant to requirements at 40 CFR 146.95; or for wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have received an expansion to the areal extent of an existing Class II enhanced oil recovery or enhanced gas recovery aquifer exemption pursuant to 40 CFR §§ 146.4 and 144.7(d).

(2) Operators that inject carbon dioxide underground are also subject to the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) requirements set forth at 40 CFR Part 98. Under 40 CFR Part 98, facilities that inject carbon dioxide underground for long-term containment of carbon dioxide in subsurface geologic formations are specifically subject to subpart RR (Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide source category). Facilities that are subject to subpart RR, including UIC Class VI wells, are required to report basic information on carbon dioxide received for injection, develop and implement an EPA-approved site-specific Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification Plan, and report the amount of carbon dioxide geologically sequestered using a mass balance approach and annual monitoring activities. Such reports under subpart RR must be prepared on a calendar year basis (Annual Reports).

(3) Annual Reports generally must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for greenhouse gas emissions in the previous calendar year. 40 CFR §98.3(b). Annual Reports are required to be submitted electronically in a format specified by the Administrator of the EPA. 40 CFR §98.5(a). The EPA generally requires Annual Reports to be submitted through the EPA's electronic reporting system, e-GGRT. Historically, the EPA has launched the e-GGRT system in mid-February for a given reporting year. See EPA, “Extending the Reporting Deadline Under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for 2024 Data,” 90 F.R. 13085, 13087 (March 20, 2025). Annual Reports undergo verification by the EPA, and non-confidential data from these reports are published on the EPA's website.

(4) On September 16, 2025, the EPA issued proposed regulations, Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, 90 F.R. 44591, proposing to amend the GHGRP to remove program obligations for most source categories, including the obligations in subpart RR, for reporting years after 2024. The proposed regulations would also revise 40 CFR Part 98 subpart A to extend the Part 98 (including subpart RR) reporting deadline for reporting year 2025 from March 31, 2026, to June 10, 2026. The EPA has proposed that the amendments, if finalized, would become effective within sixty days of publication in the Federal Register. Because the proposed amendments would remove the reporting obligations under subpart RR following reporting year 2024, reporters would cease submitting Annual Reports within sixty days of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. 90 F.R. at 44603.

Part III — Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous

SECTION 1. PURPOSE

This notice provides interim guidance, pending the issuance of forthcoming proposed regulations, relating to the credit for carbon oxide sequestration under section 45Q (§45Q credit) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code)1 in light of the Environmental Protection Agency 's (EPA) proposed regulations to remove reporting obligations regarding the geological sequestration of carbon dioxide imposed under subpart RR of 40 CFR part 98 (subpart RR). See 90 F.R. 44591 (Sept. 16, 2025). Specifically, this notice provides a safe harbor for determining eligibility for the §45Q credit for qualified carbon oxide that is captured and disposed of in secure geological storage (and carbon oxide described in §1.45Q-2(h)(5)) and not used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project during calendar year 2025 (Calendar Year 2025 Secure Geological Storage) in the event the EPA does not launch the electronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool (e-GGRT) for filers to prepare and submit information required under subpart RR for reporting year 2025 by June 10, 2026. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) expect that the forthcoming proposed regulations will propose updated requirements for taxpayers claiming the credit for secure geological storage after the 2025 calendar year. Taxpayers may rely on the safe harbor and guidance described in section 3 of this notice to demonstrate compliance with the subpart RR requirements of §1.45Q-3(b)(1)(ii) or 1.45Q-2(h)(5)(iii), as applicable, and §1.45Q-3(d), for purposes of determining the §45Q credit with respect to 2025 Calendar Year Secure Geological Storage.

SECTION 2. BACKGROUND

.01 Section 45Q

Section 45Q was amended a number of times thereafter, including most recently by §70522 of Public Law 119-21, 139 Stat. 72, 279 (July 4, 2025), commonly known as the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA).2

(2) Section 45Q(a)(1) allows a credit of $20 per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide (i) captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018; (ii) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage; and (iii) neither used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project nor utilized in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5).

(3) Section 45Q(a)(2) allows a credit of $10 per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide (i) captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility before February 9, 2018; and (ii) either (A) used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage; or (B) utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5).

(4) Section 45Q(a)(3) allows a credit of the applicable dollar amount (as determined under section 45Q(b)(1)) per metric ton of qualified carbon oxide captured by the taxpayer using carbon capture equipment which is originally placed in service at a qualified facility on or after February 9, 2018, during the 12-year period beginning on the date the equipment was originally placed in service, and (i) disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, (ii) used by the taxpayer as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage, or (iii) utilized by the taxpayer in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5).

(5) Section 45Q(f)(2) directs the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate (Secretary), in consultation with the EPA, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of the Interior, to establish regulations for determining adequate security measures for the geological storage of qualified carbon oxide under section 45Q(a) such that the qualified carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere. Section 45Q(f)(2) further provides that the term “geological storage of qualified carbon oxide” includes storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams under such conditions as the Secretary may determine under such regulations.

(6) On June 2, 2020, the Treasury Department and the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-112339-19) in the Federal Register (85 F.R. 34050) under section 45Q. After consideration of all comments received in response to the proposed regulations, on January 15, 2021, the Treasury Department and the IRS, in consultation with the EPA, Department of Energy, and the Department of the Interior, published final regulations in the Federal Register under section 45Q. See T.D. 9944; 86 F.R. 4728, as corrected in 86 F.R. 16530 (March 30, 2021).

(7) Section 1.45Q-3(a) provides that, in general, to qualify for the §45Q credit, a taxpayer must either physically or contractually dispose of captured qualified carbon oxide in secure geological storage in the manner provided in §1.45Q-3(b), or utilize qualified carbon oxide in a manner conforming with section 45Q(f)(5) and §1.45Q-4. Secure geological storage includes, but is not limited to, storage at deep saline formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and unminable coal seams.

(8) Section 1.45Q-3(b) provides that for purposes of the §45Q credit, qualified carbon oxide is considered disposed of by the taxpayer in secure geological storage such that the qualified carbon oxide does not escape into the atmosphere if the qualified carbon oxide is (1) injected into a well that (i) complies with applicable Underground Injection Control or other regulations, located onshore or offshore under submerged lands within the territorial jurisdiction of States or federal waters, and (ii) is not used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project, in compliance with applicable requirements under subpart RR; or (2) injected into a well that (i) complies with applicable Underground Injection Control or other regulations, is located onshore or offshore under submerged lands within the territorial jurisdiction of States or Federal waters, and (ii) is used as a tertiary injectant in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project and stored in compliance with applicable requirements under subpart RR, or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards endorsed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) under CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, Carbon dioxide capture, transportation and geological storage — Carbon dioxide storage using enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) (CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019).

(9) Section 1.45Q-2(h)(5) provides that, in general, carbon oxide that is injected into an oil reservoir that is not a qualified enhanced oil recovery project under section 43(c)(2) of the Code due to circumstances such as the first injection of a tertiary injectant occurring before 1991, or because a petroleum engineer's certification was not timely filed, cannot be treated as qualified carbon oxide, disposed of in secure geological storage, or utilized in a manner described in section 45Q(f)(5). Section 1.45Q-2(h)(5) does not apply to an oil reservoir if: (i) the reservoir has permanently ceased oil production; (ii) the operator has obtained an Underground Injection Control Class VI permit; and (iii) the operator complies with subpart RR.

(10) Section 1.45Q-3(d) provides that for qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects in which the taxpayer reported volumes of carbon oxide to the EPA pursuant to subpart RR, the taxpayer may self-certify the volume of qualified carbon oxide claimed for purposes of section 45Q. For qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects in which the taxpayer determined volumes pursuant to CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, a taxpayer may prepare documentation as outlined in CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019 internally, but all such documentation must be provided to a qualified independent engineer or geologist, who then must certify that the documentation provided, including the mass balance calculations as well as information regarding monitoring and containment assurance, is accurate and complete. The qualified independent engineer or geologist certifying a project must be duly registered or certified in any State. The certification must contain an affidavit from the certifying engineer or geologist stating that he or she is independent from the taxpayer (and if an election under section 45Q(f)(3)(B) has been made, the affidavit must state that he or she is independent from both the electing taxpayer and the credit claimant). Certifications must be made annually and under penalties of perjury. For any leaked amount of qualified carbon oxide (as defined in §1.45Q-5(c)) that is determined pursuant to CSA/ANSI ISO 27916:2019, the certification must also include a statement that the quantity was determined in accordance with sound engineering principles. Taxpayers that capture and dispose of qualified carbon oxide giving rise to the §45Q credit must file Form 8933, Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit, with a timely filed Federal income tax return or Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, including extensions or amendments to Federal income tax returns, Forms 1065, or on administrative adjustment requests under section 6227 (AARs), as applicable.

.02 EPA Regulations

(1) Under the Safe Drinking Water Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, injection of carbon dioxide into any underground reservoir requires the operator to comply with Underground Injection Control (UIC) program regulations and to obtain the appropriate UIC well permits. The UIC program is designed to protect underground sources of drinking water from underground injection. Under 40 CFR §146.5 (Classification of injection wells), Class VI is an appropriate UIC well permit for wells that are not experimental in nature and that are used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide beneath the lowermost formation containing an underground source of drinking water; for wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have been granted a waiver of the injection depth requirements pursuant to requirements at 40 CFR 146.95; or for wells used for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide that have received an expansion to the areal extent of an existing Class II enhanced oil recovery or enhanced gas recovery aquifer exemption pursuant to 40 CFR §§ 146.4 and 144.7(d).

(2) Operators that inject carbon dioxide underground are also subject to the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) requirements set forth at 40 CFR Part 98. Under 40 CFR Part 98, facilities that inject carbon dioxide underground for long-term containment of carbon dioxide in subsurface geologic formations are specifically subject to subpart RR (Geologic Sequestration of Carbon Dioxide source category). Facilities that are subject to subpart RR, including UIC Class VI wells, are required to report basic information on carbon dioxide received for injection, develop and implement an EPA-approved site-specific Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification Plan, and report the amount of carbon dioxide geologically sequestered using a mass balance approach and annual monitoring activities. Such reports under subpart RR must be prepared on a calendar year basis (Annual Reports).

(3) Annual Reports generally must be submitted no later than March 31 of each calendar year for greenhouse gas emissions in the previous calendar year. 40 CFR §98.3(b). Annual Reports are required to be submitted electronically in a format specified by the Administrator of the EPA. 40 CFR §98.5(a). The EPA generally requires Annual Reports to be submitted through the EPA's electronic reporting system, e-GGRT. Historically, the EPA has launched the e-GGRT system in mid-February for a given reporting year. See EPA, “Extending the Reporting Deadline Under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for 2024 Data,” 90 F.R. 13085, 13087 (March 20, 2025). Annual Reports undergo verification by the EPA, and non-confidential data from these reports are published on the EPA's website.

(4) On September 16, 2025, the EPA issued proposed regulations, Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, 90 F.R. 44591, proposing to amend the GHGRP to remove program obligations for most source categories, including the obligations in subpart RR, for reporting years after 2024. The proposed regulations would also revise 40 CFR Part 98 subpart A to extend the Part 98 (including subpart RR) reporting deadline for reporting year 2025 from March 31, 2026, to June 10, 2026. The EPA has proposed that the amendments, if finalized, would become effective within sixty days of publication in the Federal Register. Because the proposed amendments would remove the reporting obligations under subpart RR following reporting year 2024, reporters would cease submitting Annual Reports within sixty days of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. 90 F.R. at 44603.

Latest Cohort Is Program’s Biggest Yet, With Broad Geographic Representation

By Justin Daugherty, NLR

Remote and island communities face unique energy challenges—but these challenges also present unique opportunities to increase energy affordability, reliability, and security.

In their efforts to address their energy challenges, 38 coastal, remote, and island communities will receive support as part of the fifth cohort of the Energy Technology Innovation Partnership Project (ETIPP)—a U.S. Department of Energy technical assistance program led by the National Laboratory of the Rockies (NLR), formerly known as NREL.

ETIPP connects selected communities with national energy experts who provide technical analysis, modeling, and decision support to identify energy reliability and affordability solutions best suited to each community’s needs.

Several new Gulf Coast and Great Lakes communities have joined the program this year, adding to the program’s regional expansion in 2024. The communities joining ETIPP’s fifth cohort strengthen the program’s presence across these regions, as well as in Alaska, the Caribbean territories, Hawaii and the Pacific territories, the Northeastern Seaboard, the Pacific Northwest, and the Southeastern Seaboard.

“We’re fortunate to be able to expand the program to so many communities this year,” said NLR’s Tessa Greco, ETIPP program manager. “The growth of the program showcases its value to coastal, remote, and island communities, while interest in the program highlights the energy challenges so many communities face.”

Proposed projects for Cohort 5 aim to strengthen energy systems against extreme weather events, explore options for new local generation, design microgrids to protect against outages, explore energy efficiency options, and more.

Communities in the early stages of energy planning will spend 4–8 months in ETIPP developing a strategic energy plan that clearly defines their energy goals and objectives. Those joining ETIPP with an existing energy plan or well-defined project will begin a 12–24-month process to analyze and validate specific energy solutions.

A team of national laboratory researchers and regional partner organizations will support ETIPP communities along the path, no matter which track they take. Energy experts at four national laboratories—Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the National Laboratory of the Rockies, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories—work with communities to find solutions tailored to local energy challenges. ETIPP communities also receive support from regional partners, who build connections between community members and the national laboratory complex and have the local knowledge to ensure that projects are meeting community needs.

In ETIPP’s first four cohorts, 57 communities analyzed reliable energy solutions, such as assessing localized energy generation and storage options, optimizing existing energy systems, or analyzing energy efficiency and weatherization options for existing infrastructure.

Advocates also called for the renewal of a proposal requiring data centers to power themselves with renewable energy, which stalled in the spring.","Illinois’ electric grids may soon face power shortages and further price increases as fossil fuel plants go offline and data centers fueling the rise of artificial intelligence demand ever-increasing amounts of power.

That’s the conclusion of a new report by three state agencies that foreshadows an upcoming state grid planning process and a potential legislative fight on how lawmakers will regulate power-hungry data centers, if at all.

The projected shortfalls would begin in the Commonwealth Edison service territory in northern Illinois by 2029 and in the Ameren service area that covers most of downstate Illinois by 2031. They’d continue to worsen and make Illinois more reliant on energy imports without action by state policymakers or grid operators.

“The challenges emerge from a combination of factors at the regional and national scale,” the report noted. “Load growth is accelerating, driven by data centers, transportation demand, and industrial expansion. At the same time, many coal, gas, and oil units are planned to retire across both RTOs (regional transmission organizations) due to age, economics, and emissions limits.”

The warning from the Illinois Power Agency, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Commerce Commission came the same week that prices once again rose at a procurement event in the area that serves northern Illinois consumers.

Advocates behind recent renewable energy reforms and the governor who says he will sign them argue the report’s findings prove that a plan passed by lawmakers in October was essential to avoiding a potential crisis.

“The state set up a deliberate process to address findings from this resource adequacy study and ensure Illinois continues to lead the country in delivering a clean, reliable, affordable energy future for all,” Gov. JB Pritzker’s office said in a statement.

Critics, including the state’s manufacturers, say the report makes clear that Illinois’ decarbonization policies were overly ambitious.

“We didn’t need a 222-page report to tell us what we already know — Illinois is facing an energy crisis resulting from the forced closure of dispatchable baseload generation and growing demand,” Mark Denzler, president & CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, said in a statement.

Grid planning and capacity

Warnings of the potential shortfall were contained in the most recent resource adequacy report that state regulators are required to file under the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA, energy overhaul passed in 2021. The report, published Monday, precedes a “mitigation” planning process to be undertaken by the Illinois Power Agency.

One of the marquee measures in CEJA called for taking all of the state’s fossil fuel generators offline by 2045, but the plan also created the less-heralded resource adequacy process to assess whether that timeline is feasible.

While the resource adequacy report didn’t specifically call for walking back CEJA’s mandatory 2045 fossil fuel plant closure timeline, that possibility could be considered as regulators prepare the mitigation plan and embark on another major grid planning process in 2026.

But even if Illinois delays closure dates, it’s going to need new generators, the report noted.

Another measure the governor has pledged to sign, the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, aims to add battery generation to the grid while creating other energy efficiency and planning processes.

CRGA — Illinois’ third major energy and decarbonization bill passed since 2016 — requires the Illinois Commerce Commission to conduct an integrated resource planning process in 2026. The report noted the goal is to “provide a more comprehensive venue for addressing many of the foundational issues” in grid reliability.

“While this study underscores serious challenges, Illinois has already taken steps to address resource adequacy — a problem the entire country is facing,” Solar Powers Illinois, an advocacy group for the state’s solar industry that backed CRGA, said in a statement. The group added that integrated resource planning will be a “a transparent, data-driven process to evaluate supply and demand, identify risks, and secure cost-effective solutions.”

Problems go beyond Illinois

While Illinois will begin that planning effort next year, the issues facing the state’s grids are not unique. The two multistate, federally regulated regional transmission organizations that serve Illinois — PJM Interconnection in northern Illinois and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator everywhere else — face their own challenges with out-of-state plant closures and growing load demands.

At any rate, the report noted, if the grid can’t replace retiring resources in a timely fashion, it would increase grid strain and lead to higher prices at capacity auctions, a cost that would be borne by consumers.

“If regional markets remain short, Illinois will face persistent high capacity prices even if it builds new resources in-state,” the report noted.

PJM serves 67 million customers in 13 states and Washington, D.C., including 4.2 million Commonwealth Edison customers in northern Illinois, making it the largest grid operator in the U.S.

On Wednesday, it announced the results of its most recent auction for “capacity,” which describes payments ratepayers make to power generators to ensure grid reliability. Capacity charges make up roughly 20% of a monthly power bill.

The price per megawatt-day at the most recent PJM auction hit a record of $333.44 for 2027-28, up $4.27 from the previous year but still 11.5 times higher than just three years prior.

The Citizens Utility Board, an Illinois consumer advocacy group, said the news shows the capacity market “is breaking under the weight of data center demand and a dysfunctional interconnection queue.”

PJM’s interconnection queue largely dictates how quickly new generators can come online, and advocates and the governor have long called for reforms. The report noted it has improved since PJM created new processes in 2023.

But it still takes five to seven years to get gas turbines online, while siting and permitting can also cause delays. The report also noted supply chain disruptions, tariffs, and domestic content requirements for tax credit eligibility could also delay wind and solar coming online.

“Without real reforms, in just a few years 67 million electric customers in the PJM footprint could face rolling blackouts and an escalation of power bills that make the current price spikes seem tame,” CUB Executive Director Sarah Moskowitz said in a statement.

Report’s recommendations

As fossil fuel plants in Illinois go offline due to CEJA’s mandates, it could make the state reliant on importing energy from other zones within the regional transmission organizations — even as the RTOs themselves face shortfalls.

Because of that, the state will need new generation “even if Illinois retains a portion of its existing thermal fleet.” To address the potential shortages, Illinois must employ a “diversified resource strategy,” according to the report.

“This includes combining continued growth of new in-state wind and solar supported by IPA procurements and programs, greater use of existing and planned transmission to import power from MISO and PJM when available, and the continued use of fueled thermal generators as reliability assets even as their energy output declines with higher renewable penetration,” the report noted.

Other potential resources cited in the report include “green hydrogen,” nuclear fission reactors, utility-scale solar, onshore wind and four-hour lithium-ion batteries.

The CRGA, which passed the state legislature in October and the governor said he will sign, creates a new incentive structure for energy storage projects similar to how the state funds renewable developments like wind and solar power.

Data centers and advocate response

The advocates behind CRGA say it was passed in large part because lawmakers understood the trends that were outlined in this week’s report. But renewable energy advocates like the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and consumer advocates like the CUB say it’s just as essential to regulate power-hungry data centers.

“The next critical step is to pass commonsense guardrails for data centers — the primary driver of the unprecedented energy demand that is saddling Illinois consumers with rising utility bills while dirty energy companies make record profits,” the Clean Jobs Coalition said in a statement.

The influential coalition, which includes union, faith and environmental groups, said it will work with lawmakers “to ensure data center developers, not Illinois consumers, pay for the disproportionate energy burden big tech is bringing to our power grid.”

Pritzker’s office didn’t directly respond to questions about what data center regulations, if any, the governor and lawmakers will consider in the spring.

Illinois has provided tax incentives for data centers since Pritzker signed bipartisan legislation in 2019. According to the state’s 2024 report, 27 data centers had received incentives totaling $983 million in tax breaks and benefits.

The National Resources Defense Council estimated data centers will drive up costs for PJM consumers by another $163 billion through 2033 and increase monthly bills by about $70 by 2028.

The Citizens Utility Board called on PJM to clean up its interconnection queue while urging states to force data centers to reduce operations or use on-site backup battery systems when electricity is in high demand. Advocates also called for the renewal of a proposal requiring data centers to power themselves with renewable energy, which stalled in the spring.

“Data center companies are among the wealthiest in the world, and it is simply unconscionable that customers should pay unbearably high power costs to foot the bill for data center energy guzzling,” Moskowitz said.

The Manufacturers’ Association have long called for a repeal of CEJA’s closure date to reduce uncertainty. The group called for an “all-of-the-above” approach that includes keeping fossil duels online.

“If skyrocketing power bills were not warning enough, this new report is a flashing red sign that Illinois needs to act immediately,” Denzler said in a statement. “With electricity demand only expected to increase, we simply cannot risk the chaos that would be caused by the premature closure of baseload generation plants as required under current law.”",https://i0.wp.com/capitolnewsillinois.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/240912-TRANSMISSION-LINES-AA-0025.jpg?fit=1140%2C760&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-19 21:59:21.048608

“The SPEED Act would eviscerate NEPA’s protections.” Food and Water Watch outlined several ways the bill would weaken the law.
“The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for,” Salazar said.
Opposition to the SPEED Act came amid criticism of other House actions viewed as favoring extractive industries.
Public Citizen also pointed to the House’s recent passage of the Power Plant Reliability Act and the Reliable Power Act.","The legislation, known as the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or SPEED Act, passed the House with support from Democratic Reps. Jim Costa of California, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Lizzie Fletcher of Texas, Jared Golden of Maine, Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, Adam Gray of California, John Mannion of New York, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, and Marc Veasey of Texas. All Republicans present voted in favor except Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.

The bill is spearheaded by Golden and House Committee on Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman of Arkansas. Critics argue the vote marks a significant bipartisan effort to roll back NEPA, which is often described as the “Magna Carta” of federal environmental laws because it requires environmental review and public participation before major federally permitted projects move forward.

In a statement following the vote, Food and Water Watch legal director Tarah Heinzen said the measure would fundamentally undermine those protections. “For decades, NEPA has ensured logical decision-making and community involvement when the federal government considers projects that could harm people and the environment,” Heinzen said. “The SPEED Act would eviscerate NEPA’s protections.”

Food and Water Watch outlined several ways the bill would weaken the law. According to the group, the SPEED Act would drastically limit the scope of projects subject to environmental review, potentially allowing factory farms, coal plants, and other polluting facilities to build or expand without comprehensive analysis or meaningful public input. The bill would also impose unusually short deadlines for legal challenges and restrict courts’ ability to stop unlawful projects. Opponents say it would further tilt decision making toward corporate interests by limiting agencies’ ability to rely on the best available science when evaluating environmental and health risks.

“Today’s absurd House vote is yet another handout to corporate polluters at the expense of everyday people who have to live with the real-world impacts of toxic pollution from dirty industries like fossil fuels and factory farms,” Heinzen said. “This nonsense must be dead on arrival in the Senate.”

Other environmental advocates echoed that warning and urged senators to block the bill. Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center, said that “renewable energy and climate advocates in the Senate must hold the line against the SPEED Act’s evisceration of our bedrock environmental and community protection law.”

Allie Rosenbluth, US campaign manager for Oil Change International, said the legislation threatens both environmental safeguards and democratic participation. “Our senators must stand up against the SPEED Act’s attempts to undermine democratic decision-making, pollute our communities, and threaten our collective future,” she said.

Advocates for communities living near industrial development warned that the bill would deepen long-standing environmental inequities. James Hiatt of For a Better Bayou said the SPEED Act “protects corporate interests, not the public, and it should be rejected by any senator who claims to stand with the people.”

Anthony Karefa Rogers-Wright, co-coordinator of the Black Alliance for Peace’s Climate, Environment, and Militarism Initiative, framed the legislation as part of a broader pattern of environmental harm imposed on marginalized communities. He warned that the bill “represents yet another assault on the health of frontline, Black, Brown, Indigenous, and poor white communities that have been designated as sacrifice zones by big polluters who bribe lawmakers with big money to continue a culture of extract, slash, burn, and emit at the expense of oppressed and marginalized peoples.”

Rogers-Wright said Congress should pursue a different approach. “Rather than speeding up the approval of dirty projects, Congress should increase funding for federal agencies and grassroots organizations accountable to frontline communities to carry out legally defensible and accurate environmental analyses,” he said, pointing to the Environmental Justice for All Act.

That legislation was also highlighted by Mar Zepeda Salazar, legislative director at Climate Justice Alliance. “The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for,” Salazar said. She added that Congress should instead advance policies that ensure meaningful public engagement, protect public health, respect tribal sovereignty, and honor consultation obligations with federally recognized tribal nations.

“Examples include the Environmental Justice for All Act, which lays out meaningful public engagement, strong public health protections, respect for tribal sovereignty and consultation obligations, and serious investments in agencies and staff,” Salazar said.

Opposition to the SPEED Act came amid criticism of other House actions viewed as favoring extractive industries. Lauren Pagel, policy director at Earthworks, said the House also passed the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, which “will remove already-scarce protections for natural resources and sacred cultural sites in US mining law.”

“Today’s House votes are a step backwards for our nation, but we continue to stand firm for the rights of the people and places on the frontlines of oil, gas, and mining,” Pagel said.

Public Citizen also pointed to the House’s recent passage of the Power Plant Reliability Act and the Reliable Power Act. David Arkush, director of the group’s Climate Program, said the measures moving through Congress “under the guise of ‘bipartisan permitting reform’ are blatant handouts to the fossil fuel and mining industries.”

As the SPEED Act moves to the Senate, environmental groups say the House vote underscores a growing push to weaken environmental review in the name of faster permitting, even as communities across the country face worsening pollution and climate impacts.

And now for your environmental reports:

Indiana Coal Plant Closures in Limbo as Federal Emergency Powers and Coal Ash Extensions Loom

Two coal power plants in Indiana are scheduled to shut down in 2025. These retirements are part of broader trends to phase out older, inefficient coal units in favor of cleaner energy sources. But now, those closures may not be allowed to happen.

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. Department of Energy has begun using emergency powers to keep coal plants running in the name of grid reliability, even when state utilities say they’re no longer needed. Governor Mike Braun has raised concerns about electricity demand and has signaled support for reviewing whether coal plants should stay online longer. Yet grid experts have failed to show clear evidence that these specific plants are needed to prevent blackouts.

Keeping these coal plants open means continued air pollution, climate pollution, and delayed environmental cleanup for Indiana communities.

While these concerns are enough to raise alarm bells, there’s another factor in play. At this same time, the EPA is considering whether to give one of these utilities more time to continue disposing of toxic coal ash. Coal ash is a toxic waste produced by coal plants. One utility is asking regulators for permission to delay cleanup and keep disposing of coal ash in unlined ponds for another five years, just in case the plant is forced to keep running. This practice is linked to contaminating groundwater with harmful heavy metals, like arsenic, mercury, hexavalent chromium, and, lead. Even low level exposure to these is linked to cancer, respiratory issues, and neurological problems. The EPA is considering granting these extensions through 2031, which would make it easier to keep operating a plant that was supposed to close.

This is a major decision involving federal agencies, state leadership, and utility companies that could affect Indiana’s public health, economy, and environment, and set a precedent for coal plant retirements nationwide. Emergency orders undermine utilities’ and states’ clean-energy plans and slow nationwide retirements of outdated fuel production.

The public comment period on the coal ash extension runs through early January 2026. Its outcome could influence how long coal plants can legally operate. Utilities discussions and state regulatory hearings about coal plant reliability and retirement planning will continue into early 2026.

Establishing an informed generation of future environmental stewards starts with a clear approach. Public school teacher and author Kimi Waite is making the case that if we’re serious about solving climate change, we need to start teaching environmental justice in elementary schools—and she’s already proven it works with kindergarteners.

Waite suggests that teaching environmental justice gives students the tools to understand how pollution and racism intersect in their own neighborhoods—and what they can do about it. She points to recent state-level policies to include climate change instruction for all K-12 students as a step in the right direction, but says it needs to go further by explicitly including justice and equity in these lessons.

The current administration has consistently dismantled environmental resources that teachers and students rely on. The White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council was disbanded and the federal mapping tools that helped visualize connections between race, poverty, and pollution exposure were removed from the EPA website earlier this year. These are the sources educators rely on to incorporate environmental justice into conversations about weather, climate, and communities. When the author taught kindergarten in South Los Angeles, her five and six-year-old students used federal mapping tools to research air pollution in their own community. In math class, they created bar charts comparing pollution across neighborhoods of varying income levels. The lesson wasn’t just about science or math—it was about understanding systemic patterns and empowering young people to become what she calls “data detectives.”

Waite emphasizes that climate change can’t be taught without teaching about justice, because climate impacts hit marginalized communities hardest. This means weaving environmental justice across all subjects—art, social studies, math, science, even physical education—so students understand the root causes of the climate crisis, including systemic racism.

As districts figure out how to implement climate education requirements, the question isn’t just whether students learn about climate change—it’s whether they learn to see the connections between environmental harm and inequality, and whether they’re equipped to do something about it. Kimi Waite’s book on this topic, “Teaching Environmental Justice in the Elementary Classroom: Entry Points for Equity Across the K–5 Curriculum” will be published in February 2026.

For Pueblo Communities, Climate Resilience Begins With Language and Land

The Pueblo in New Mexico go a step beyond climate resilience with a practice of climate reverence. Jim E-note, makes the connection between Indigenous language and the ties to land as it seemingly speaks to him.

As quoted in Sierra’s winter magazine (2025) Enote states that language is (quote) “the breath of the wind, the timing of the snowmelt and the silence before the summer monsoons”(endQ)

Water issues are a grave concern nearly everywhere today, be it excess or scarcity! Drought has long been a serious concern in the Southwest U.S.—Enote relied on a tradition of the naming of locations within their territory to discover and recover a spring after a long-used natural spring in his native land ran dry. To him, as a Zuni farmer, he maintains that land and language are inseparable. Not only are expanding populations in cities in the Southwest depleting aquifers but historically there is evidence of extreme droughts that led to relocating ancient settlements to have water access.

Enote’s foundation, “Colorado Plateau,” finances native-led climate solutions in that desert region. It has resulted in greater unity among Pueblo tribes. Harmony among the native farmers and with nature is an encouraging outcome of listening to the land and those most able to interpret its meaning.

Trump Administration Moves to Dismantle National Weather and Climate Research Center

The climate community is in an uproar due to the most recent cuts from the Trump administration. It was just announced through X (formerly Twitter) that the administration is breaking up a 65-year-old research center in Colorado that’s been central to nearly every weather forecast and climate study in America.

The National Center for Atmospheric Research (or NCAR) in Boulder has been studying weather and climate since 1960, and developed some of the more significant technology used in predicting weather patterns. NCAR developed the instrument dropped from planes into hurricanes to help predict where storms will hit and how strong they’ll be. The center also created weather models used to forecast tornadoes, floods, and severe storms.

Now the administration says it’s dismantling the center, accusing it of being “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country.” They say vital functions like weather modeling will move somewhere else, but have not confirmed where or how this will take place. Scientists and lawmakers are deeply concerned by this announcement. Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, called dismantling NCAR “like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet.”

This decision seems to be targeting the Colorado state representatives, including the governor, who have refused to be complicit in other regulatory pressures, and these legislators are fighting back. They say that shutting down the facility would be deeply dangerous, cause massive job loss, and sacrifice America’s safety and standing in weather research globally. The ripples of this closure will compromise college and universities’ abilities to conduct climate research, and prevent NCAR from effectively monitoring air quality, anticipating droughts and extreme precipitation events, or accurately forecasting hurricane intensity.

NCAR works closely with federal partners like NOAA and NASA (both of which have received massive financial hits from the Trump administration over the last 12 months). NCA provides these institutions with scientific tools, computer models and data that help inform decisions regarding public safety, natural resources and environmental management. Dismantling NCAR will continue the degradation of climate research and community preparedness. As Antonio Busalacchi, the president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research says, this attack on NCAR is just another step in the Trump administration’s “attempts to cancel the freedom of scientific thought. … That should provide a shiver down the spine of every U.S. citizen.”

The Georgia Public Service Commission Friday unanimously approved an expansion deal for Georgia Power expected to cost at least $15 billion. In order to meet rising demand the utility is predicting from large customers, mostly data centers, Georgia Power will build gas turbines and batteries and purchase energy, adding nearly 10,000 megawatts of electricity to its grid.

After several rounds of hearings on the controversial proposal and more than an hour of public comments Friday morning, commission Chair Jason Shaw called for a vote. He was met with shouts.

“Nay nay nay! The people say nay!” shouted a group of protesters as they were escorted from the hearing room.

The five commissioners then all voted “aye.”

Under the deal they approved, Georgia Power is promising “downward pressure” of $8.50 per month for the “typical” residential customer, which means someone using 1,000 kwh of electricity a month. That promise, which will apply in 2028 when the utility next brings a rate case before the commission, does not guarantee a rate reduction. Rather, it means that whatever rates the company requests will be offset by that amount.

“We know every dollar counts. This plan means more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia’s future,” wrote Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene in a statement. “Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that’s a great result for Georgians.”

All of this hinges on the data centers: The massive buildout of energy capacity will serve their high electricity needs, and the influx of revenue they’re expected to bring in will pay for the downward pressure on rates. But critics worry that the data centers might not materialize or could relocate in a few years. That could leave ordinary Georgians paying for the new infrastructure for decades.

Commissioner Tim Echols told WABE before the vote that customers will be protected.

“Even if a company does go bankrupt or they scale back what they’re using, we’re going to extract a pound of flesh from them and the ratepayers are gonna get that back,” he said.

Georgia Power, the commission’s staff and the commissioners themselves point to several assurances that data centers and other new, large customers will pay for their own infrastructure. Earlier this year, the commission approved new contract terms that allow the utility to require minimum monthly payments from large customers for 15 years, regardless of how much electricity they actually use and whether they stay in Georgia. The utility has also begun requiring collateral from the new prospective customers.

In hearings last week, Georgia Power said that even after the commission approves the new resources, the utility can delay or cancel projects it doesn’t end up needing. But that will be more difficult now that this deal is approved, said Sierra Club Staff Attorney Isabella Ariza.

“Everything after today, or after the final order stands firm, will be a higher threshold for interveners, for the general public to get any dollar denied from recovery,” she said. “The best bet was to deny the resources now, and the most conservative approach would have been to do that.”

This was the final vote for Echols and Commissioner Fitz Johnson, who both lost elections to Democratic challengers last month. The new commissioners take office in January.","https://imagedelivery.net/NnAlC-9876HVVqBQoPI2BA/www.wabe.org/2025/12/AP25353689042043-e1766182805333.jpg/w=1440,h=810",N,,2025-12-19 20:58:25.780997

Originally published in and reprinted with permission of Common Dreams.

As Congress recesses this week without reauthorizing the Affordable Care Act subsidies needed by millions of Americans, it also quietly gave the oil industry a multimillion dollar tax break by allowing the 9 cent-per-barrel oil tax (on domestic and imported oil) into the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to expire as well on December 31. The OSLTF, administered by the Coast Guard’s National Pollution Funds Center, is the nation’s central financial instrument for oil spill prevention and response, earning about $500 million per year from the nominal excise oil tax—about 0.1% of annual US oil industry revenue.

In our current political climate prioritizing industry over public interest, many feared that Congress and the Trump administration might simply allow the oil spill tax to expire, as a “Return on Investment” for industry contributions made to their political campaigns. Congress did just that. As they increase costs for millions of Americans, the Republican congress and administration are decreasing costs for some of the richest companies in the world.

For decades, Congress and the administration have remained stubbornly resistant to using the OSLTF to fund necessary oil spill prevention measures across the nation, and as tax revenue and spill damage recoveries continued to be collected, the fund balance has now grown to over $10 billion. Since the fund’s use for a single oil spill is limited to $1.5 billion, we have long proposed that a substantial portion of the remaining balance be used to better prevent oil pollution across the nation. Instead of just leaving all of this money in the bank, it should be put to work, while saving enough (perhaps $5 billion) for conventional oil spill response activities.

A transcendent lesson learned in all major oil spills around the world is that once oil is spilled, there is precious little that can be done to limit environmental damage. Historically, an average of 2-6% of total spill volume is actually recovered in major marine oil spills (Deepwater Horizon was about 4%, Exxon Valdez about 8%). These multibillion dollar spill responses may look good for oil company and government public relations, but they are virtually irrelevant in limiting environmental harm. Prevention is key to environmental protection.

As a fundamental cause of the 1989 Exxon Valdez and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disasters was inadequate government oversight, expanding drilling while cutting oversight is as reckless as it gets.

Spill prevention measures across the nation in need of more funding include enhanced Vessel Traffic Systems, escort-rescue tugs to prevent groundings and collisions of tankers and cargo ships in dangerous passages (e.g. the March 2024 cargo ship Dali collision with the Francis Scott Key bridge in Baltimore Harbor), enhanced inspection of oil and liquefied natural gas tankers, and so on. However, the federal government has resisted using the fund for such preventive measures.

With the OSLTF tax expiration approaching this summer, we proposed that the fund’s 9 cent-per-barrel tax on domestic and imported crude oil (less than 0.2% of today’s crude oil price, or less than one cent-per-gallon of gasoline) be fully reauthorized, and that the fund’s use for many oil spill prevention measures be significantly expanded. Congress and the administration were unresponsive, raising suspicions that they intended to allow the oil tax to expire, which they just did.

One proposed use for the fund is to safely cap and decommission the millions of derelict, abandoned oil and gas wells across the nation, both onshore and offshore. Regarding these orphaned and abandoned oil wells, a 2021 scientific paper found that, of the 4,700,000 historic and active oil and gas wells across the US, only 1 in 3 (1,500,000) are considered safely plugged. Leakage from improperly abandoned oil and gas wells causes groundwater and air pollution, ecological damage, risk of explosions, and damage to human health.

Costs for well decommissioning and abandonment have been estimated to range from $10,000-$50,000 to plug old, shallow wells; $300,000 for newer, deeper wells; and up to $1 million for more complex wells. In a 2015 study, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated the cost to securely decommission the thousands of deepwater oil and gas wells in the US Gulf of Mexico (two-thirds of the 5,000 wells in the Gulf of Mexico are in deep water) at $38.2 billion. The GAO study reported that, of the $38.2 billion in decommissioning liabilities, $2.3 billion were not covered by existing financial assurances; and of the remaining $35.9 billion in decommissioning liabilities, the federal government held $2.9 billion in bonds and other assurances, while waiving the remaining $33 billion for companies that passed a “financial strength test.” The GAO expressed concern about such extensive waivers of financial assurances, as this exposes the federal government to substantial future costs.

Clearly, abandoned oil and gas wells present enormous oil pollution risk, public safety hazard, and substantial government financial liability that we as a nation have ignored for too long. We have to do better, and using the OSLTF for this purpose would clearly be in the national interest.

Further, while the Trump administration recently proposed opening virtually the entire US Outer Continental Shelf (more than 1 billion acres of the nation’s offshore waters) to oil and gas drilling, it slashed the budget for the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) by roughly 35%, from $220 million to just $143 million. As a fundamental cause of the 1989 Exxon Valdez and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disasters was inadequate government oversight, expanding drilling while cutting oversight is as reckless as it gets. Thus, an important use for the federal oil spill fund should be to expand BSEE’s budget, as it is largely focused on preventing catastrophic oil spills from the nation’s several thousand offshore oil rigs. There are countless other cost-effective pollution prevention measures as well that need OSLTF funding.

But with Congress and the Trump administration ignoring these real funding needs, and allowing the oil tax to expire (as a gift to their oil industry contributors), the nation remains exposed to unnecessary risk of continued oil pollution, including small chronic releases, as well as major disasters like the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon. So much for “government efficiency.” Hopefully Congress will come to its senses in 2026, and fix what it just broke.",https://peer.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Commentary-1-12-19-25-common-dreams-oil-tax.png,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:44.611202

""Reliability is a top priority for public power utilities around the country,"" said Scott Corwin, president & CEO of the American Public Power Association.

""The Reliable Power Act ensures public power can comply with federal rules and regulations without sacrificing the reliable electricity that powers our homes, businesses, and communities.""

Publicly owned power companies and rural electric co-ops combined produce about 30% of the nation's electricity and routinely rely on bond financing for infrastructure projects.

FERC is an independent agency operating within the Department of Energy and is governed by five commissioners nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

The bill passed by twenty votes with Democrats claiming the DOE already has the authority needed to keep plants open and the new legislation sidelines the Environmental Protection Agency.

""The Reliable Power Act would provide assurance that EPA rules do not undermine grid reliability or resource adequacy,"" said Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of America's Power.

The Trump administration has a record of supporting the fossil fuel industry, while the prior Biden administration leaned into renewables.

""This measure will encourage state regulators to push our grid to more expensive, polluting sources of energy,"" said Rep. Kevin Mullin, D- Calif.

The power industry has consistently voiced concerns about base load capacity and reliability as older, coal-fired power plants are being retired and replaced by natural gas plants, which are cheaper to operate.

About 16% of the country's energy comes from coal-fired power plants. In the late 1990's it accounted for over 50%.

""Under the Biden administration, regulators like the EPA prioritized rules that would have caused the premature retirement of the nation's coal fleet during the same time period when electricity load growth is exploding because of artificial intelligence, data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification of the economy,"" said America's Power.

The House also passed the SPEED Act which takes a swing at reducing permitting red tape tying up the National Environmental Policy Act process. SPEED passed 221-196 with bipartisan support.

""APPA strongly supports the SPEED Act to narrow the scope of environmental reviews and enable public power utilities to build and maintain infrastructure that ensures reliable, affordable electric service.

""It establishes judicial review timelines and requirements to prevent frivolous lawsuits that can lengthen the permitting process by years,"" said APPA.

Earlier this month, S&P Global Ratings tagged the public power and electrical co-op sector with a negative outlook.

The view ""reflects substantial and costly infrastructure financing needs and diminished consumer rate affordability that can erode the benefits of autonomous ratemaking authority, frustrate some utilities' cost recovery, and weaken financial margins and ratings.""

""Not-for-profit utilities' operating and capital costs are swelling as they address load growth, strengthen the climate resilience of network infrastructure, replace aging power plants, and reduce power plants' emissions and generation byproducts,"" said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst David Bodek.

Prices have steadily risen for natural gas throughout 2025, for residents and industry alike, and Louisiana finds itself at the center of the boom. A nation-leading three liquified natural gas export facilities operate along its coast, and five more are in the construction or planning phases.

But more LNG exports will mean higher domestic utility prices, according to a new report from the consumer advocacy group, Public Citizen.

Public Citizen analyzed documents from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and determined natural gas prices are increasing for American households as gas companies in the U.S. export more of the commodity to meet global demand.

From January through September, Americans paid $12 billion more for natural gas than the same period last year. That comes to about $124 per family in higher utility bills, a 22% increase directly related to higher natural gas prices, the report notes.

Natural gas prices for consumers are expected to increase another 16% in 2026, according to Public Citizen, which cited U.S. Energy Information Administration predictions.

Analysts attribute growing global demand for natural gas to political, industrial and environmental factors.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led other countries, mostly European, to seek other sources of the fuel, which is widely preferred as a cleaner alternative to coal.

The rise of artificial intelligence has caused a surge in the construction of data centers that require vast amounts of electricity that is most likely to come from power plants that run on natural gas.

An LSU Center for Energy Studies outlook for 2026 credits much of the state’s growth in natural gas exports to executive orders from the Trump administration that lifted a Biden-era moratorium on expansion of LNG export facilities.

The United States exported 11.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG around the globe in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Louisiana handled around 61% of those shipments.

LNG exports are expected to “more than double by 2037, with nearly all new export capacity located on the Gulf Coast,” according to the LSU report’s analysis of Energy Information Administration predictions.

“As we continue to see more production, more capacity for exports, particularly in the LNG space, that’s going to mean more jobs,” said Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association. “Somebody is going to supply that gas. Louisiana gets to benefit from the investments in the export capacity.”

But with increased exports comes the tradeoff of higher domestic prices for residents, according to the Public Citizen report.

The majority of Louisiana’s electricity, around 70%, is generated from natural gas, according to the most recent numbers from the Energy Information Administration. It costs about 12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity for residential, natural gas-fueled power in Louisiana, compared with the 18-cent national average.

Utilities pass along the increased cost of electricity generation to their customers, often through what’s called a fuel adjustment charge on their utility bills. They also include charges to recoup the costs of any losses or investments such as new power lines or infrastructure upgrades. Although Louisiana has low rates for its electricity, it hasn’t translated to low power bills because of these pass-along costs to customers.

“Whatever amount of gas they’re using to generate the electricity that’s being used in your home, the cost of that gas is being charged directly to you,” said Jesse George, policy lead for the Alliance for Affordable Energy.

In some areas such as New Orleans, an area with older, less energy-efficient homes, residents will feel the higher prices in 2026, George said.

Colder temperatures create more power demand, and natural gas prices tend to increase when utilities need more fuel to increase their generation. The Energy Information Administration predicts a 22% increase in natural gas prices for the winter heating season that runs through March.

Though heightened winter electricity demand in Louisiana typically ends by March, customers could see additional fuel surcharges on their utility bills for months if there is a severe cold snap. The same situation arises during intense summer heat,

“About 20% of households cannot pay their utility bills already,” George said, citing the most recent numbers available from Entergy New Orleans’ disconnection rates. “Couple that with these increased fuel prices, and that certainly will only exacerbate the problems and the challenges that people are facing already.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/louisiana_illuminator_articles_680/34badc06881e5ccc0b921be56370d4b3,N,,2025-12-19 19:59:36.875202

If finalized, the rule would implement the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA, discussed in a prior SPR blog post.

The Agencies note that the Proposed Rule marks a significant departure from the Agencies’ past practice, where “impacts” were considered in defining the scope of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”). The Agencies assert that, as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett, they will now solely define EPA’s jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act based on “‘the Act’s allocation of authority’ between the Federal Government and the States.”

Proposed Regulatory Text

The Proposed Rule would amend 33 CFR 328 (Army Corps) and 40 CFR 120 (EPA) to redefine WOTUS to include:

(1) traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas (40 CFR 120.2(a)(1), 33 CFR 328(a)(1));

(2) most impoundments of WOTUS (proposed 40 CFR 120.2(a)(2), 33 CFR 328(a)(2));

(3) relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments (proposed 40 CFR 120.2(a)(3), 33 CFR 328(a)(3));

(4) wetlands adjacent (i.e., having a continuous surface connection) to traditional navigable waters, impoundments, and tributaries (proposed 40 CFR 120.2(a)(4), 33 CFR 328(a)(4)); and

(5) lakes and ponds that are relatively permanent and have a continuous surface connection to a traditional navigable water, the territorial seas, or a tributary (proposed 40 CFR 120.2(a)(5), 33 CFR 328(a)(5)).

Key Definitions and Interpretations

To implement this new definition of WOTUS, the Proposed Rule defines several new or revised terms:

“Continuous surface connection” is defined to mean ‘‘having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.’’

“Tributary” is defined to mean “a body of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and banks, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow. A tributary does not include a body of water that contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through a feature such as a channelized non-jurisdictional surface water feature, subterranean river, culvert, dam, tunnel, or similar artificial feature, or through a debris pile, boulder field, wetland, or similar natural feature, if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow. When the tributary is part of a water transfer (as that term is applied under 40 CFR 122.3) currently in operation, the tributary would retain jurisdictional status.”

“Relatively permanent” is defined to mean ‘‘standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.’’

Although not defined in the Proposed Rule, the Agencies assert the below terms and phrases contained within this definition are meant to encompass specific meanings.

‘‘At least during the wet season’’ is intended to include “extended periods of predictable, continuous surface hydrology occurring in the same geographic feature year after year in response to the wet season.”

‘‘Standing” bodies of surface water are meant to encompass “lakes, ponds, and similar features that have standing water year-round or at least during the wet season and that are part of the tributary system.”

‘‘Continuously flowing’’ waterbodies are meant to encompass streams, rivers, ditches, and similar features considered under the WOTUS tributaries category.

Removal of “Interstate Waters” as a Standalone Category

The Agencies propose removing “interstate waters” as a separate category of WOTUS (currently included in 40 CFR 120.2(a)(1)(iii) and 33 CFR 328.3(a)(1)(iii)). The Agencies claim such removal is necessary because the “interstate waters” category can encompass bodies of water that are not “relatively permanent, standing, or continuously flowing or that are not themselves connected to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.” Under the Proposed Rule, interstate waters would therefore only be ‘‘waters of the United States’’ if they fall within another jurisdictional category in the WOTUS new definition. Based on similar reasoning, the Proposed Rule would also delete “interstate” from the WOTUS category for lakes and ponds (40 CFR 120.2(a)(5) and 33 CFR 328(a)(5)).

Revised Exclusions and New Groundwater Exclusion

The Proposed Rule revises three of the eight exclusions from WOTUS (Water Treatment Exclusion: 40 CFR 120.2 (b)(1) and 33 CFR 328.3(b)(1); Prior Converted Cropland Exclusion: 40 CFR 120.2(b)(2) and 33 CFR 328.3(b)(2); and Ditch Exclusion: 40 CFR 120.2(b)(3) and 33 CFR 328.3(b)(3)) and adds a new explicit exclusion for “groundwater.” These exclusions would not apply to traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas.

Anticipated Impacts of the Proposed Rule

The Agencies anticipate that the Proposed Rule would result in an increase in non-jurisdictional findings in approved jurisdictional determinations (AJDs) compared to prior regulations and practice, and that fewer waters and wetlands would fall within the scope of the CWA. The Agencies predict that the Section 404 permitting program will be most impacted by the Proposed Rule, with projected reductions in the number of permits and required mitigation relative to the current regulations. However, the Agencies note that States and Tribes may choose to expand their own regulatory programs to include waters excluded from federal jurisdiction.

AJDs and permits issued under a previous WOTUS definitions will still be considered valid and would not necessarily be reopened if the Proposed Rule is adopted, unless requested by the landowner or applicant. Going forward, when making federal jurisdictional determinations regarding WOTUS, the Agencies have stated that they will make non-jurisdictional determinations if the agencies do not have adequate information to demonstrate that a water meets the new WOTUS jurisdictional standards.

Although the Proposed Rule is intended to “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase . . . predictability and consistency,” past revisions to the WOTUS definition have shown that we can expect increased litigation over the boundaries of federal and state jurisdiction and over the interpretation of the new definitions. Technical delineation by wetlands consultants is likely to become more complex and critical, and increased regulation by states and tribes may create new regulatory uncertainty.

Opportunities for Public Comment

In addition to seeking comments on the changes outlined above, the Agencies also request input on topics related to the Proposed Rule but that are not explicitly addressed in the proposed regulatory text. The regulatory community should consider commenting on these additional items to ensure all key issues are addressed during the public comment period. Such items include:

Whether “impacts” should be considered in determining CWA jurisdiction.

Whether to adopt an alternative approach to determining if a body of water meets the definition of “relatively permanent waters,” by using minimum flow volume thresholds, minimum flow duration metrics, or other bright line metrics set by region.

Whether to define ‘‘wet season’’ in the regulatory text, and whether the Agencies should adopt an alternative approach to implementing ‘‘wet season’’ for continuous surface connection by requiring surface water inundation for at least 90 or 270 days.

Whether an entire wetland would be considered ‘‘adjacent’’ if at least part of the wetland demonstrates a continuous surface connection to a jurisdictional water body during the wet season or whether, as proposed, only a portion of the wetland would be considered adjacent.

Whether the Agencies should adopt an alternative approach whereby wetlands, lakes, and ponds would have a ‘‘continuous surface connection’’ only if they abut, e., touch, a jurisdictional water and have a continuous surface water connection to that water, with continuous surface water connection meaning the perennial (year-round) presence of surface water.",https://sprlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog-Post-Graphics-15-12.png,N,,2025-12-19 23:58:22.325862

The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaborate in the fields of renewable energy and green hydrogen in June.

Kyuden International is a subsidiary of Kyushu Electric Power Corp, one of Japan’s regional utility companies, and the project marks its first investment in Egypt.

For AMEA Power, meanwhile, the project is the latest in a track record the developer is establishing quickly in Egypt.

The company commissioned Egypt’s first-ever large-scale BESS a few months ago, a 300MWh system at the 500MW Abydos Solar Project. The financing of that project was also supported with IFC funding.

AMEA Power is also on course to build the country’s first standalone battery storage projects. Capacity Purchase Agreements (CPAs) were signed early this year with the Egyptian government for a 500MWh system in the coastal village of Zafarana and for a 1,000MWh project in Benban on the banks of the Nile River.

Around the time that AMEA Power closed financing on the Abydos project, Norwegian developer Scatec secured US$479.1 million non-recourse financing from three development institutions for its Obelisk solar-plus-storage project in Egypt’s Nagaa Hammadi region.

Obelisk will feature 1.1GW of solar PV capacity, built in two phases, and a 100MW/200MWh BESS, which will be deployed as part of the first phase. Scatec announced equity deals for the project with Norwegian state-run investment fund Norfund and France’s EDF a few days ago.

JA Solar JV opens factory making solar, BESS products

In other news from Egypt, a joint venture (JV) led by vertically integrated Chinese solar PV module manufacturer JA Solar broke ground this week on a new solar PV cell, module and BESS manufacturing facility.

The US$210 million ATUM Solar complex in the Sokhna area of the Suez Canal Economic Zone will comprise three separate manufacturing facilities, our colleagues at PV Tech reported on Wednesday (17 December).

One of these will produce 2GW of solar PV cells annually, 100% for export. The other two will house lines producing 2GW of PV modules annually and 1GWh of energy storage systems, targeting local and regional markets.

The venture, which was formed this summer, is backed by four main bodies: JA Solar, as the technology investor; the Egyptian firm AH; the UAE investor Global South Utilities; and Infinity Capital from Bahrain.

Among the officials attending a groundbreaking ceremony on 15 December were Egypt’s deputy prime minister, Kamel El-Wazir, and Walid Gamal El-Din, chairman of the General Authority for the Suez Canal Economic Zone, both of whom emphasised the project’s role in creating local jobs and reducing Egypt’s reliance on imported clean energy products.

The state saw reductions in the number of residents without health insurance from 2018 to 2023 due to Medicaid expansion and growth in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).","In York County and Virginia Beach, a couple of 40-year-olds with two kids and a combined household income of $150,000 could see their health insurance premiums rise by $4,330 per year if the U.S. Senate and House fail to extend health insurance premium tax credits now set to expire on Dec. 31.

A similarly situated family in relatively affluent Albemarle County is looking at a yearly increase of $6,244 in premiums.

These estimates do not come from Democrats or Republicans. They come from a calculator prepared by KFF, the Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the country’s most reputable health policy organizations.

Experts predict that huge premium increases to households that would lose expired premium tax credits could leave as many as 100,000 Virginians uninsured.

The cost of human suffering by those forced into bankruptcy due to illness or those who forego treatment because they cannot afford to pay is hard to calculate. What is certain is that the increased cost will devastate people of all political persuasions.

This begs the question of why none of Virginia’s Republicans in the House of Representatives would sign a discharge petition to force a vote on a bill to extend the tax credits for three years.

Four Republicans, three from Pennsylvania and one from New York, joined 214 Democrats to force debate on the bill this week, after House Speaker Mike Johnson refused to include premium tax credits in a Republican health-care reform proposal Wednesday. Johnson then abruptly ended a 204-203 House vote that blocked quick consideration of the discharge bill before Congress adjourns for the holiday season on Friday.

Conspicuously missing from the list of GOP members challenging Johnson were two representatives from the Old Dominion.

First Congressional District U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, whose district includes York County, and Second Congressional District U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, whose district includes Virginia Beach, have each made, then broken, promises to go to the mat to control constituents’ health-care costs. Kiggans even co-sponsored a bill that would have extended health insurance premium tax credits for two years. It never came to a vote.

Wittman made no promise on premium tax credits. But like Kiggans, during federal budget negotiations he co-signed a letter to Johnson saying he would not vote for a federal budget that cut access to Medicaid, then, like Kiggans, did so twice.

Since then, Wittman and Kiggans have offered continuous pledges to make health care affordable. With their failure to support a discharge petition to force a vote on premium credits, they have once more betrayed constituents.

Both Republican incumbents risk losing their seats in Congress for ignoring constituents in health-care votes and for failing to hold President Donald Trump accountable for economic policies such as tariffs that have already raised the costs of goods and services for those they represent.

Since November’s Democratic sweep of statewide offices and increased control of both chambers of the state legislature, talk has focused on whether Virginia will redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats as a way to offset Trump’s command to Republican-run states to develop redistricting plans that increase the GOP’s congressional representation. But Wittman and Kiggans would still be in trouble if Virginia left their districts intact.

Health care expenses represent a bipartisan financial crisis. A May 2025 tracking poll by KFF showed “three-quarters of uninsured adults say they have skipped or postponed getting the health care they needed due to cost. Having health insurance, however, does not offer ironclad protection as about four in ten adults with insurance (37 percent) still report not getting health care they needed due to cost.”

Those are the stakes as the clock winds down on Congress’ failure to extend the premium tax credits, if only for a few years to work out kinks and help the middle and upper middle classes protect their families. Instead, Republicans just voted down a Democratic proposal for a three-year extension of premium tax credits in the Senate and refused to even bring it up in the House.

Johnson and other Republican leaders who control the Senate and House continue to hurt their own constituents, including essential middle class voters, in the name of partisan purity. Yes, health-care premium tax credits are a result of former Democratic President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Yes, those credits also pair with former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature health-care reform bill, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). At this point, though, the Republican obsession with destroying the ACA has turned self-destructive.

A 2025 Virginia Joint Commission on Health Care report shows why. The state saw reductions in the number of residents without health insurance from 2018 to 2023 due to Medicaid expansion and growth in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

Helping the middle and upper middle classes afford health insurance with tax credits makes for a healthier mix of incomes and individuals. Some Republicans contend this amounts to welfare for those who do not need it. Such criticism drips with hypocrisy coming from GOP majorities in the Senate and House, whose members — including Virginia’s entire Republican delegation — just voted for a federal budget without health premium tax credit extensions, but with permanent extensions of tax cuts for the country’s richest individuals and corporations.

Dumping premium credits also ignores the hidden cost of emergency room visits by the uninsured it creates. Those visits often go at least partially unpaid and eventually get passed on in the form of higher insurance premiums to those who do have health coverage. One daunting fact that emerged from Virginia’s 2025 health metrics report is that “the percentage of potentially avoidable emergency department visits in Virginia has steadily increased since 2021.”

As time runs out for extending health insurance premium credits, Republicans have offered little that will effectively replace them. As he did in his first administration, Trump has promoted cheap private health insurance policies that do not cover prior existing conditions, have monetary caps on services, and/or require large deductibles before benefits kick in.

Republicans in Virginia, including Wittman, talk about privatization of health care. Often that includes giving money to individuals for health savings accounts that can be used to buy their own insurance policies or other uses. But the subsidies Republican plans mention — $1,000 per year for some people and $1,500 for others – would not be enough to pay the costs of a couple of trips to the emergency room, much less the bill for a single in-patient surgery.

The Senate and House need to extend the health insurance premium tax credits at least temporarily, if for no other reason than this: They sustain Americans’ physical and financial health in a country where for-profit medical services enrich everyone except the patients.

Dismantling the EPA will leave Americans more exposed to environmental hazards, said Boom.
The EPA canceled the grant, the awardees learned, because the agency classified it as taking part in or promoting environmental justice or diversity, equity and inclusion.
Yet the grant was designed to be geographic and had nothing to do with DEI or environmental justice.
“Science is really foundational to EPA in its ability to achieve its mission, and now it’s at risk,” Orme-Zavaleta said.","Over the past year, environmental experts who have dedicated their lives to public service have watched the partisan, unilateral destruction of the agency they once helped run.

“What’s happening at the EPA right now is not business as usual,” said Marc Boom, senior director of public affairs for the Environmental Protection Network (EPN), a group of former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency employees, at a press briefing on Tuesday. “It’s a serial shutdown of the agency’s ability to protect public health.”

Boom and other former EPA staff working with EPN, founded in 2017 to counter deregulatory actions under the first Trump administration, held a briefing to outline what’s at stake for communities across the country if Congress approves drastic cuts in the agency’s budget as part of next year’s appropriations bill.

The Trump administration proposed slashing the EPA’s $9 billion budget by 55 percent, but Congress is considering less drastic cuts as part of the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.

As lawmakers consider the agency’s budget in the coming weeks, EPN experts said, they face a stark choice: protect Americans from environmental harms or leave them without a watchdog when pollution or chemical accidents occur.

Though both chambers proposed cuts, EPN praised the Senate’s bipartisan proposal as more responsible.

The Senate would reduce the agency’s budget by about 5 percent, while maintaining critical capacity for science, health and safety. It would halt the administration’s steps to close the agency’s Office of Research and Development (ORD); protect funding to states for clean water and sewage projects, brownfields restoration and other programs; and direct the agency to maintain core functions.

The House’s proposed 23 percent cut would slash enforcement funding, hobble critical scientific research capacity and eliminate more than 60 percent of state funding that communities rely on to keep their drinking water safe, Boom said.

“Passing the Senate approach would send a clear message that the serial shutdown of EPA must be reined in, that congressional intent must be followed, and that Americans still expect guardians on the job protecting their health and safety,” said Boom, who as a senior advisor at EPA helped launch a pilot program to support communities transitioning from fossil fuel economies.

As of Thursday night, however, the bipartisan Senate spending deal appeared in jeopardy, after Colorado Democrats urged Congress to stop the administration’s efforts to close the nation’s premier climate research center and maintain its funding, according to reporting in The Hill.

And the threat to the EPA in the House bill remains.

Dismantling the EPA will leave Americans more exposed to environmental hazards, said Boom. “That’s more exposure to toxic chemicals that raise cancer risk, more dirty air that worsens asthma and lung disease, more threats to reproductive health and child development.”

The attack on the EPA’s capacity started on President Donald Trump’s first day in office, when he revoked several executive orders issued under the previous administration to strengthen environmental, public health and climate regulations, justifying the actions as necessary to “unleash” American energy.

Trump directed the head of every U.S. agency to “suspend, revise or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome.”

Within weeks, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin vowed that the agency under his leadership would “aggressively pursue an agenda powering the Great American Comeback.”

In March, Zeldin pledged to cut 65 percent of the agency’s total spending. Toward that end, he canceled $20 billion in already allocated Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants and nearly $2 billion in grants designed to improve air and water quality and extreme weather resilience. Zeldin called the roughly 400 terminated grants worth $1.7 billion—authorized by Congress to protect clean air and water and facilitate investments in affordable clean energy—“wasteful federal spending.”

The terminated funding included a $21 million climate resilience grant to the heavily industrialized town of Richmond, California. The EPA canceled the grant, the awardees learned, because the agency classified it as taking part in or promoting environmental justice or diversity, equity and inclusion. Yet the grant was designed to be geographic and had nothing to do with DEI or environmental justice. At the same time, Zeldin offered regulated industries a “pass to pollute” that they could garner by simply sending an email to request an exemption from the Clean Air Act.

In July, Zeldin announced an additional $750 million in savings from “reductions in force” staffing cuts as part of its “comprehensive restructuring efforts.” The cuts targeted ORD, the agency’s scientific research arm, and slashed the positions of more than 3,700 employees as part of an explicit campaign to put civil servants “in trauma,” Boom said, referring to a speech Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought made before Trump’s reelection.

“When inspectors, scientists and engineers disappear, corporate interests will go unchallenged, polluters get passes and communities pay the price,” Boom said. “When EPA steps back, pollution moves forward.”

Nonprofits, tribes, local governments and state attorneys general have filed multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration, alleging that it violated federal law and the Constitution by terminating congressionally allocated funds and firing civil servants without cause.

EPA has the resources needed to accomplish the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, fulfill all statutory obligations and make the best-informed decisions based on the gold standard of science, Brigit Hirsch, EPA press secretary, said in a statement.

“EPA will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer resources and will be better able to deliver on its core mission of protecting human health and the environment while powering the ‘Great American Comeback,’” Hirsch said.

Over the past year, political appointees have sidelined experts and, critics contend, the law to roll back limits on toxic air, water and chemical pollution, set about reorganizing and dismantling ORD, which helps the EPA follow its mission to craft regulations using the “best available scientific information,” and forced out thousands of career staff.

The House bill would make these and any other actions taken by the Trump administration the new baseline, said Jeremy Symons, an EPN senior advisor who was a climate policy advisor at EPA. “It puts Congress’ mark on eliminating almost 4,000 positions at EPA and the reorganizations that Zeldin has called for, including eliminating the Office of Research and Development.”

It took several years for the EPA to rebuild staff reductions made during the first Trump administration, said Zealan Hoover, a former senior advisor to EPA Administrator Michael Regan during the Biden administration.

“The major difference this time around is that the administration has so aggressively gone after and pushed out career staff in positions that were historically insulated from political cycles,” said Hoover, who hired several thousand new staff members to implement Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law programs. The fact that good people are being pushed out and norms broken will harm the ability of a future EPA team to attract the very best scientists and public servants, he said.

The removal of thousands of career staff who have devoted their lives to public service means the incalculable loss of institutional knowledge about the science and law underpinning environmental protections in the country.

“We’re seeing something we’ve never seen before,” said Symons. “This is the first time in EPA’s history of 55 years that we’ve seen a reckless unilateral, partisan attempt to reshape the administration, where Congress has not done its job of passing bipartisan appropriations and holding the administration accountable.”

There’s always been a change in policy focus when a new administration comes in, Symons added. “But there’s a big difference between shifting policy focus and the wholesale demolition that’s happened here that’s been based only on a single elected politician.”

Defunding the EPA at the federal level deprives states of critical funding as well as the expertise and logistical support they need to implement programs that safeguard communities from lead, PFAS, pesticides and other toxic substances that contaminate the air and drinking water.

“Congress has a critical opportunity right now, in the coming weeks, to put a giant stop sign on the attempts to dismantle and modify EPA,” said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, who spent 40 years at the EPA and was a top ORD science advisor and administrator.

“Science is really foundational to EPA in its ability to achieve its mission, and now it’s at risk,” Orme-Zavaleta said.

EPA’s current political leadership has defended closing ORD by saying that it will shift lab and research capabilities to its program offices, she said.

But eliminating ORD jeopardizes scientific integrity by eliminating the firewall between independent science and policy, opening the door to political interference and bias to support desired policy outcomes, Orme-Zavaleta said. “Dismantling EPA’s Office of Research and Development would devastate the agency’s ability to protect us from legacy pollution and emerging threats,” she said.

Congress now has the first real opportunity to put some checks on the serial shutdown of the nation’s environmental watchdog, Boom said, “and to reaffirm that Americans still expect EPA to do its job.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EPA_Protest_Getty.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:48.479278

According to the report, emissions of air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act declined sharply between 1990 and 2022.
DEQ’s Division of Air Quality regularly updates the Air Quality Trends in North Carolina report.","RALEIGH, NC (WWAY) — North Carolinians are breathing the cleanest air in decades, according to a new report from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.

DEQ’s Division of Air Quality released its latest update to the Air Quality Trends in North Carolina report, showing a long-term decline in harmful air pollutants such as ozone and fine particulate matter. State officials say emissions reductions are the result of coordinated efforts by state leaders, regulatory agencies, utilities, industry and the public over the past 50 years.

The report shows statewide emissions of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide reached all-time lows in 2022, the most recent year with available data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“Even as our population and economy continue to grow, North Carolina’s air quality keeps getting better and better,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “By controlling air pollution, we are giving every North Carolinian a cleaner, healthier future.”

Mike Abraczinskas, director of the Division of Air Quality, credited continued collaboration and environmental policy improvements for the progress.

“Our air quality continues to improve thanks to tireless efforts by our dedicated staff, partners and a wide variety of stakeholders who have come together to implement sound environmental policies,” Abraczinskas said.

According to the report, emissions of air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act declined sharply between 1990 and 2022. During that time, emissions fell 95% for sulfur dioxide, 74% for carbon monoxide, 71% for nitrogen oxides, 48% for fine particulate matter, and 67% for volatile organic compounds.

As emissions have declined, measured concentrations of these pollutants have remained below federal health-based standards statewide for more than a decade. Average sulfur dioxide levels are now 95% below the federal standard, while annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are 89% below the standard.

DEQ says North Carolina’s shift away from coal-fired power generation has been a major factor in the improvements. More electricity now comes from cleaner sources such as solar, wind and nuclear energy, along with energy efficiency improvements in homes and buildings.

Vehicle emissions have also dropped significantly. From 1990 through 2022, emissions from cars and trucks declined 81% for carbon monoxide, 72% for nitrogen oxides and 85% for volatile organic compounds due to improved engine standards, cleaner fuels and advanced emissions controls. Officials expect further reductions as electric vehicle adoption increases.

High concentrations of air pollutants are linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, haze, acid rain and climate change. DEQ reports that North Carolina has seen reductions across all major classes of harmful pollutants.

The report also highlights several additional findings, including a sharp drop in high-ozone days statewide. From 2015 through 2024, North Carolina recorded just two days classified as “Code Red” or higher for ozone, compared to 83 such days from 2005 through 2014.

Visibility has also improved in national and state parks. At Great Smoky Mountains National Park, average clear-day visibility increased from 54 miles in 1996 to 119 miles in 2023.

Net greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion declined 38% between 2005 and 2020, even as North Carolina’s population and real gross state product grew by 20% and 23%, respectively. Emissions of hazardous and toxic air pollutants also fell more than 82% from 1993 to 2022.

Randy Weber of Texas has introduced the Packaging and Claims Knowledge (PACK) Act of 2025, a bill that would establish the first voluntary federal standard for environmental claims on packaging under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and remove what the congressman calls “misleading green labels that confuse consumers and undermine real recycling efforts.”

In a release announcing the legislation, Weber says that across the country, a patchwork of state regulations has resulted in unverified claims like “recyclable,” “compostable” and “reusable” to appear on packaging, “often without any connection to real-world recycling or composting systems.” The congressman claims this confusion has made it harder for consumers to know what can actually be recycled and has weakened legitimate environmental initiatives.

RELATED: Handling the truth

Weber says the PACK Act addresses this problem by promoting science-backed, industry-driven standards for environmental labeling. Under the legislation, companies may only make environmental claims if those claims are scientifically verified and recognized by existing recycling or composting programs, ensuring honesty and transparency without imposing new mandates.

“Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,” Weber says. “The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It’s pro-environment, pro-business and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.”

Recycling industry organizations recently have voiced support for the legislation. For example, the American Institute for Packaging and the Environment (AMERIPEN) says its uniform structure would help businesses provide accurate and transparent information across state lines.

“By reducing consumer confusion and enabling informed choices, the PACK Act will promote proper management of packaging materials at end-of-life, diverting them from landfills and advancing a circular economy,” the Springfield, Massachusetts-based organization says.

AMERIPEN highlights key elements of the bill, including:

Mandatory third-party certification for consumer packaging: The PACK Act requires an accredited third-party certification body to authorize recyclable, compostable and reusable claims on consumer packaging, allowing businesses to utilize a variety of qualified independent parties to certify that packaging meets industry standards and follows the FTC’s “Green Guides” to avoid deceptive claims.

Focus on consumer packaging: The certification programs will address how recyclable, compostable and reusable claims can be made for different types, shapes, sizes and colors of consumer packaging, while nonconsumer packaging will not be subject to the third-party certification requirement.

State preemption: AMERIPEN notes that states will be preempted from enacting or enforcing any legal requirement that is not identical to the requirements under the PACK Act.

Regarding state preemption, AMERIPEN says the approach will ensure that a truly national and consistent framework for recyclable, compostable and reusable claims for consumer packaging is achieved to eliminate interstate commerce challenges and, to the extent possible, eliminate consumer confusion and mistrust regarding consumer packaging claims. Additionally, the organization says the legislation would help assure that consumer packaging is “handled correctly.”

Matt Seaholm, President and CEO of the Washington-based Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS), thanked Weber for introducing the bill.

“Plastic packaging is essential to modern life—protecting products, keeping food fresh and ensuring medical supplies arrive safely—yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable and reusable packaging claims,” Seaholm says. “This growing patchwork not only creates regulatory uncertainty but also has the potential to increase costs and contribute to broader affordability concerns.

“As an industry that employs more than 1 million Americans, we appreciate Congressman Weber’s leadership on this important issue that strengthens U.S. manufacturing and consumer confidence.”",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/12/19/adobestock_313602407-web.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:54.735491

Founded three years ago, the Energy Integration Lab (EIL) was created under the broader vision of the University as a Lab and brings together expertise from the Schools of Computing and Engineering, Applied Sciences, and Business, Education and Law.

At the heart of the EIL is a unique living energy laboratory that demonstrates how waste from the University and its partners can be transformed into valuable low-carbon energy. Using technologies such as anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, gasification and micro-gas turbines, the Lab converts agricultural, food and industrial wastes into biogas, bio-oil and biochar, which are then used for electricity generation, heat recovery and in agricultural reuse.

This fully circular approach reduces environmental impact while delivering measurable real-world research outcomes, alongside reducing the University’s waste and energy costs.

Reducing environmental impact and energy costs

The Lab maintains close academic collaborations with institutions including the University of York, University College London, the University of Glasgow, the University of Illinois in the USA, ECUST in China, and Kibabii University in Kenya. Beyond academia, the EIL actively engages with industrial and community partners across the UK, USA, China, Kenya and Nigeria.

Professor John Allport, of the School of Computing and Engineering, commented: “Most of the major challenges facing the world today are complex and require a multidisciplinary approach. By drawing on the combined resources from across the University and our collaborators, we are able to find solutions. Some of these affect us directly on campus and can be used to demonstrate the strength of this approach to our students in a way that they can immediately see and comprehend.”

Professor Grant Campbell, of the School of Applied Sciences, commented: “Integration and local contextualisation are key to synergising and exploiting interactions in energy systems. The University gives us a context to showcase implementation and adoption of our own home-grown research, to address our sustainability and financial goals while also demonstrating our commitment to sustainability to our students and regional partners.”

Dr Matthew Snell, of the School of Business, Education and Law, commented: “One of the strengths of this team is its interdisciplinarity. This provides a basis for combining engineering, biochemical, and environmental expertise with insights into the business models, legal frameworks and political contexts which are a feature of the Lab’s very diverse operating environments.”",https://www.hud.ac.uk/media/assets/photo/news/2025/december/Energy-Integration-Lab-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 04:58:30.464105

This week’s commission vote suspends the competitive bidding requirement that’s meant to ensure ratepayers get the best deal available on new power plants.
Electricity from the power plants is dedicated specifically to Meta’s data center, though it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could, if needed, sell power to other customers.
Critics of Coussan’s directive include the Louisiana Energy Users Group, a trade coalition of 26 large industrial and petrochemical companies.
Young, the Louisiana Energy Users Group lawyer, asked commissioners to consider more flexible criteria that would allow fast-tracking approvals on a case-by-case basis.","Louisiana regulators have adopted a new rule that suspends certain consumer protections if utility companies need to quickly build power plants for certain industrial developments, including data centers, that require massive amounts of electricity.

The rule change also directs these large-scale customers to pay for half the cost of these new power plants, meaning regular ratepayers could be on the hook for the remaining cost.

In a 4-1 vote Wednesday, the Louisiana Public Service Commission adopted the rule, which creates a streamlined approval process that would drastically reduce the time it takes to greenlight utility projects primarily geared toward data centers. The lone dissenting vote came from Commissioner Davante Lewis, D-Baton Rouge, who expressed concerns that the proposal could hurt consumers. Lewis has argued that the commission should focus on making energy less expensive for household customers rather than the wealthiest companies in the world, like Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram that is building the world’s largest artificial intelligence data center in Northeast Louisiana.

Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, R-Lafayette, authored the directive in step with Gov. Jeff Landry’s economic development agenda of courting big businesses with state government grants, tax breaks, expedited permitting and industry-friendly regulations.

Coussan said his directive creates a “lightning speed” path for certain power plant proposals brought before the Public Service Commission, echoing the title of Landry’s Sept. 16 executive order to fast-track state agency permitting. In a phone interview Thursday, he said it lets the commission more easily replicate the quick approval process it used for Entergy Louisiana’s construction of a power plant with three natural gas-powered turbines to run the massive data center Meta is building in Richland Parish, which the commission signed off on in August.

This week’s commission vote suspends the competitive bidding requirement that’s meant to ensure ratepayers get the best deal available on new power plants. Generally, competitive bidding requires multiple contractors to submit estimates of what it would cost them to complete the job. The estimates are then published and voted on at an open meeting.

Government entities opt for open bidding on most public works contracts to make the process transparent, avoid conflicts of interest and help ensure qualified contractors are hired.

The new Public Service Commission rules still require approvals at open meetings, though there would be no need to accept multiple bids.

Coussan said the commissioners would still act as a backstop on any proposals that seem overpriced. Any utility using the “lightning speed” avenue must still demonstrate that the proposal is using the “lowest reasonable cost,” he said.

“This could cut our regulatory process down from, say, two years down to eight months,” Coussan said. “This is not a rule in place that can be exploited.”

He referenced the recently truncated timeline in which the commission waived its normal rules in special consideration of Meta’s needs. The commission approved construction of the Entergy power plant for its Northeast Louisiana facility in August despite intense public opposition to the shortened eight-month timeline, considered very fast in the energy regulatory sphere.

The three gas turbines that Entergy is building for Meta’s AI data center will have the capacity to generate 2,200 megawatts of electricity, more than twice what the entire city of New Orleans uses during peak demand hours. Electricity from the power plants is dedicated specifically to Meta’s data center, though it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could, if needed, sell power to other customers.

Because of this setup, Meta agreed to pay 100% of the cost for all three turbines that would have otherwise been added to the monthly bills of Entergy Louisiana customers.

Critics of Coussan’s directive include the Louisiana Energy Users Group, a trade coalition of 26 large industrial and petrochemical companies. The group’s attorney, Randy Young, said at Wednesday’s meeting that allowing companies with large power needs to cover only half the cost of new power plants is too lenient and places other ratepayers at risk of having to pay for the remaining cost even if they aren’t using the power plants.

“If you need new generation and you wanna waive the [competitive bidding] requirement, commit to paying the full cost of whatever generation you need — not just half of it,” Young told the commission.

Utility companies will only be able to use the commission’s new lightning approval track for projects with forecasted electricity demand that is beyond the utility’s capacity unless the proposed power plants are built. The rule also requires the utility to have a 15-year contract in place to sell the electricity to its new customer, up from the 10 years Coussan initially proposed. He agreed to the change to assuage some of the concerns of critics who said ratepayers would have to bear the electricity costs if the contract isn’t renewed.

Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said the Public Service Commission has long guaranteed utility companies the right to earn an annual profit on their investments, meaning they make money on new power plants and other additions to their infrastructure by passing along the cost to ratepayers. The previous rules are meant to protect consumers from such impacts, she said.

“Competitive bids are not meant to slow the process,” Burke testified. “They are made to ensure we are all getting the most reasonable deal for every ratepayer dollar.”

Coussan said expediting power plant approvals is meant to spur economic growth and bring new jobs to the people of Louisiana.

The Meta data center is expected to create about 500 direct jobs.

“I’m trying to create jobs and create a positive national perception of Louisiana for business,” Coussan said. “We have cheap and abundant energy sources like natural gas and the workers to deliver it.”

The Public Service Commission can only approve use of the new rule with a written endorsement from the Louisiana Economic Development agency that verifies the project’s power needs. It requires utilities to give the commission a 60 days advanced notice if they intend to pursue expedited approval, and the commission has to take a final vote on the proposal within eight months.

Young, the Louisiana Energy Users Group lawyer, asked commissioners to consider more flexible criteria that would allow fast-tracking approvals on a case-by-case basis. Lewis proposed an alternative that he said would provide a similar level of flexibility to balance expedited approvals with consumer protections, but it was sidelined indefinitely after his colleagues heard and approved Coussan’s.

An eight-month timeline to approve a power plant for a data center stands in contrast to the four-year delay and regulatory hurdles the commission placed on Young’s group when they made a similar request for new energy. Young asked commissioners in June 2024 to let his members buy solar energy from an independent, non-utility company. At that time, the group’s members had been waiting over four years for the commission to vote on the request, which most of the state’s utility companies had opposed.

The commission gave Young its approval but with several big caveats — the group is only allowed to buy a maximum of 500 megawatts and the electricity must be transmitted through a utility’s power lines, letting the utility companies approve or deny the third-party agreements and ensuring they still get a cut of the electricity sales.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/La_meta_render-2048x1024.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 18:01:16.531727

Beyond power generation, JERA plans to supply ammonia to a diverse range of users, primarily in the manufacturing and shipping industries.
CF Industries, JERA and Mitsui together decided to proceed with the Blue Point project in April 2025.
Louisiana Economic Development provided a performance-based grant of $6 million to CF Industries to reimburse expenditures related to project development.
Louisiana Economic Development expects the Blue Point project will generate approximately 1,500 construction jobs and 103 permanent full-time jobs when the plant begins operations in 2029.","(The Center Square) – Japanese power generation company JERA, an investment partner with CF Industries in the Blue Point low-carbon ammonia plant under construction near Baton Rouge, has been officially certified as a supplier of low-carbon ammonia by its home country.

Japanese regulators certified JERA to import low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives, such as ammonia, which the company plans to produce at the $4 billion Blue Point plant in Ascension Parish beginning in 2029.

Regulators also approved a subsidy for a 15-year period to cover the difference in the price JERA would pay for coal in Japan versus the cost of ammonia imported by the company from the Blue Point project in Louisiana.

JERA, which generates about 30% of Japan’s electricity, plans to import the ammonia to use as fuel at the Hekinan Thermal Power Station, one of the largest thermal plants in the country, which is transitioning from coal-fired power generation.

JERA's goals for the Hekinan Thermal Power Station include a phased transition from coal to ammonia fuel, which is aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. In an early test of the technology in 2024, JERA said that with a 20% ammonia fuel mix it was able to produce a stable 1 gigawatt of electricity.

JERA intends to begin using a 20% ammonia fuel mix to produce power at the Hekinan Station beginning in the late 2020s.

Beyond power generation, JERA plans to supply ammonia to a diverse range of users, primarily in the manufacturing and shipping industries. JERA said it has signed agreements to charter four ammonia carriers with Japan-based shipping companies NYK Bulkship (Asia) Pte and MOL.

CF industries, based in Northbrook, Illinois, has a 40% stake in the Blue Point project, while JERA and Mitsui, a Japanese trading company, own 35% and 25%, respectively.

Both JERA and Mitsui are engaged in a variety of energy-related businesses in the U.S. Both have acquired natural gas production companies that are now actively drilling in the Haynesville shale basin in Louisiana and Texas. Additionally, JERA has signed long-term deals with four U.S. suppliers for a total of 9 million tons of liquified natural gas annually.

President Donald Trump and then-Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru said in February the two countries would increase exports of U.S. LNG to Japan ""in a mutually beneficial manner.""

Japanese leaders later pledged investments of $550 billion, which was formalized in meetings in July and September. As part of the deal, Japan committed to stable, long-term purchases of U.S. energy totaling $7 billion per year, incentivizing Japanese firms to own upstream production to ensure stable supplies.

CF Industries, JERA and Mitsui together decided to proceed with the Blue Point project in April 2025.

Louisiana Economic Development provided a performance-based grant of $6 million to CF Industries to reimburse expenditures related to project development. The project is using the agency's workforce training program provided by the state, and the Industrial Tax Exemption Program, which offers property tax breaks.

CF Industries expects the project will qualify for 45Q federal tax credits, which provide $85 per metric ton of CO2 permanently sequestered. With plans to capture and store approximately 2.3 million metric tons annually, the company expects the Blue Point project will generate about $200 million in federal tax credits each year.

Louisiana Economic Development expects the Blue Point project will generate approximately 1,500 construction jobs and 103 permanent full-time jobs when the plant begins operations in 2029.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/ba/aba62109-9275-4a8b-bcf4-9f0d7dc1d02c/68e072122534f.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22,N,,2025-12-19 17:00:41.860782

The global energy infrastructure landscape has entered a phase of strategic recalibration, where traditional capital allocation models face unprecedented pressure from competing investment opportunities, regulatory complexity, and evolving market dynamics. Pipeline companies now navigate between two fundamentally different development pathways: domestic pipeline expansion projects that offer predictable returns and shorter development cycles, versus liquefied natural gas export facilities that promise higher revenue potential but demand substantially greater capital commitments and extended project timelines. This strategic tension has reached a critical inflection point, as evidenced by recent high-profile Energy Transfer LNG project suspension and capital reallocation decisions across major energy infrastructure operators.

The fundamental economics of energy infrastructure development have shifted dramatically over the past five years. Pipeline projects typically require capital investments ranging from $500 million to $5 billion per major regional expansion, with development timelines spanning 3-5 years from initial concept to commercial operation. These projects benefit from established regulatory frameworks, proven construction methodologies, and predictable demand patterns through long-term service agreements with anchor customers. Return profiles generally achieve payback periods within 10-15 years, supported by inflation-indexed tariff structures and capacity reservation fees that provide revenue stability regardless of utilization fluctuations.

Conversely, LNG export facility development demands significantly higher capital commitments, often exceeding $10-20 billion for world-scale facilities, with development cycles extending 7-10 years from feasibility studies through commercial operations. These megaprojects face complex regulatory approval processes, technology integration challenges, and exposure to global commodity price volatility that can fundamentally alter project economics during extended development periods. Despite potentially higher absolute returns, the risk-adjusted return profiles often favor pipeline investments when evaluated through modern capital allocation frameworks that emphasize deployment speed, regulatory predictability, and market visibility.

Energy Transfer LNG Project Suspension Reveals Industry-Wide Strategic Realignment

The December 2025 suspension of Energy Transfer LP's Louisiana LNG export project represents more than an isolated corporate decision; it signals a fundamental shift in how major pipeline operators evaluate competing infrastructure investment opportunities. Led by billionaire Kelcy Warren, Energy Transfer's strategic pivot away from the 16.45 million tonnes per annum Louisiana facility toward domestic pipeline expansion reflects broader industry recognition that current market conditions favor domestic infrastructure over export-oriented megaprojects.

The suspension of Energy Transfer's Louisiana project highlights how US Economic Trends directly impact major infrastructure investment decisions. Furthermore, this strategic realignment demonstrates the interconnected nature of domestic energy policy and capital allocation priorities.

Project Component Specification Strategic Significance Planned Capacity 16.45 MTPA Equivalent to ~2.2 bcf/d export capability Location Advantage Louisiana Gulf Coast Direct access to Henry Hub pricing and marine infrastructure Committed Customers Chevron Corp., Shell Plc Major integrated energy companies providing demand certainty Development Status Suspended December 2025 Investment decision deferred indefinitely Alternative Investment Southwest U.S. pipeline expansion Capital reallocation toward domestic infrastructure

The involvement of Chevron Corporation and Shell Plc as committed offtake customers demonstrates that demand-side certainty alone cannot overcome financing and development challenges facing greenfield LNG export projects. These major integrated energy companies possess substantial balance sheet capacity and long-term LNG portfolio requirements, yet their participation proved insufficient to secure project financing at acceptable terms. This outcome reflects broader capital market discipline across the energy sector, where investors increasingly demand shorter payback periods and reduced technology risk exposure.

Engineering partnerships with established contractors including KBR and Technip Energies had positioned the project for technical execution success. KBR brings extensive process engineering expertise in liquefaction train design, while Technip Energies provides specialized subsea engineering capabilities and megaproject delivery experience. However, technical competency cannot address fundamental project economics when capital costs escalate and financing markets restrict availability for long-duration energy infrastructure investments.

The Louisiana facility represented a terminal conversion opportunity, adapting existing gas-import infrastructure constructed before the U.S. shale revolution enabled net LNG export capability. This conversion approach typically reduces capital requirements compared to greenfield facility development, as existing marine terminals, storage capacity, and pipeline connections provide foundation infrastructure. Nevertheless, conversion projects still require substantial investment in liquefaction trains, compression equipment, and regulatory re-permitting for export operations versus historical import functions.

According to Energy Transfer's official announcement, the company stated: ""The suspension of Energy Transfer's LNG project reflects broader difficulties in securing project financing for new export facilities, despite strong global demand fundamentals and committed customer relationships with major energy companies.""

Pipeline Infrastructure Investments Demonstrate Superior Capital Efficiency Metrics

Energy Transfer's simultaneous announcement of expanded Southwest U.S. pipeline development illustrates the comparative advantages driving capital reallocation decisions across the midstream energy sector. Pipeline projects offer fundamentally different risk-return profiles that align more effectively with current capital market preferences and corporate strategic objectives focused on near-term cash flow generation and predictable operational performance.

Capital Efficiency Comparison Analysis:

Investment Category Pipeline Projects LNG Export Facilities Typical Capital Range $500M – $5B per major expansion $10B – $25B+ per facility Development Timeline 3-5 years concept to operation 7-10+ years concept to operation Regulatory Approval Success 60-70% achieve certification 40-50% reach final investment decision Technology Risk Proven, standardised methodologies Complex liquefaction train integration Revenue Predictability 15-20 year service agreements Exposure to global LNG price volatility Expected Payback Period 10-15 years 15-20+ years

The Southwest pipeline expansion addresses specific supply-demand imbalances created by Permian Basin shale gas production growth and increasing industrial consumption across Arizona, Nevada, and California markets. Natural gas production in the Permian Basin has expanded substantially since 2015, creating egress capacity constraints that limit producer access to premium consumption markets. Pipeline utilisation rates in major Southwest corridors currently operate at 75-95% capacity, indicating robust demand fundamentals that support expansion investment decisions.

Pipeline projects benefit from anchor shipper arrangements where major customers contract 50-75% of capacity before construction commencement, providing revenue certainty that facilitates project financing at attractive terms. These long-term service agreements typically include inflation-indexed tariff escalations and minimum volume commitments that protect pipeline operators from demand fluctuations while ensuring customers receive priority capacity access during peak consumption periods.

Industrial demand drivers supporting Southwest pipeline expansion include:

Power generation sector growth: Natural gas-fired electricity generation expansion in Western U.S. markets

Petrochemical industry development: New chemical manufacturing facilities requiring reliable feedstock supply

Industrial heating applications: Manufacturing operations converting from alternative fuels to natural gas

Data centre expansion: Technology sector infrastructure requiring reliable backup power generation capability

The regulatory approval framework for interstate pipeline projects follows established Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) procedures that, while still complex, offer greater predictability than LNG export facility environmental review processes. Pipeline environmental assessments focus primarily on route optimisation, land use impacts, and construction methodologies, whereas LNG facilities undergo comprehensive air quality, marine environment, and cumulative impact evaluations that extend review timelines and increase approval uncertainty.

Global LNG Market Saturation Pressures Challenge New Project Economics

The United States maintains its position as the world's largest LNG exporter, with 2024 exports reaching approximately 13.1 billion cubic feet per day, representing roughly 10-12% of global LNG supply. However, this leadership position faces challenges from expanding global export capacity and increasingly competitive international market dynamics that affect new project development viability across all major LNG-producing regions.

Global LNG export capacity has expanded dramatically, reaching approximately 546 million tonnes per annum in operational facilities worldwide, with additional projects under construction adding 80+ MTPA by 2030. The OPEC Production Outlook influences global energy market dynamics, which in turn affects LNG pricing and project economics. Major LNG exporting nations have accelerated capacity development, including:

Australia: ~90 MTPA operational capacity with additional projects planned

Qatar: ~126 MTPA plus major expansion programmes through 2030

Russia: ~34 MTPA (currently constrained by international sanctions)

Malaysia: ~40 MTPA with targeted Southeast Asian market focus

United States: ~80 MTPA operational across Gulf Coast facilities

This capacity expansion creates competitive pressures on pricing and project economics for new entrants, as global LNG markets demonstrate increasing price sensitivity and buyer preference for diversified supply portfolios. Asian LNG importing nations, particularly Japan, South Korea, and China, have developed sophisticated procurement strategies that leverage multiple suppliers to optimise pricing and reduce supply chain concentration risks.

Financing Environment Challenges

The Energy Transfer LNG project suspension reflects broader capital market constraints affecting energy infrastructure development globally. Despite maintaining access to committed customers and technical expertise, project financing has become significantly more restrictive due to:

Enhanced capital market discipline: Stricter risk-adjusted return requirements for energy infrastructure investments

ESG investment considerations: Environmental, social, and governance criteria affecting institutional investor participation

Rising cost of capital: Higher interest rates and reduced debt availability for long-duration projects

Technology complexity concerns: Investor preference for proven technologies over complex liquefaction processes

Market saturation awareness: Recognition that global LNG capacity growth may exceed demand growth through 2030

Financial institutions have reduced LNG project financing availability by approximately 40-50% compared to 2015-2018 levels, reflecting both market saturation concerns and enhanced risk assessment methodologies. This financing constraint affects even well-positioned projects with strong customer relationships and technical capabilities, as demonstrated by multiple high-profile project deferrals across the global LNG development pipeline.

Strategic Investment Reallocation Impacts Natural Gas Market Dynamics

The reallocation of capital from LNG export development toward domestic pipeline infrastructure creates significant implications for North American natural gas market structure, pricing dynamics, and supply chain optimisation. Energy Transfer's strategic pivot represents part of a broader industry trend that prioritises domestic market development over international export capacity expansion.

Domestic Natural Gas Market Benefits

Pipeline capacity expansion directly supports domestic industrial competitiveness by:

Reducing transportation bottlenecks that constrain gas flow from production regions to consumption centres

Improving price stability through enhanced market connectivity and reduced regional price differentials

Supporting industrial expansion in energy-intensive manufacturing sectors

Enhancing grid reliability for natural gas-fired electricity generation facilities

Enabling energy security through diversified domestic supply chain infrastructure

Regional pipeline capacity constraints have created persistent price differentials between major U.S. natural gas trading hubs. Henry Hub pricing in Louisiana serves as the national benchmark, while regional markets often trade at significant premiums during peak demand periods due to transportation limitations. Southwest pipeline expansion can reduce these differentials by providing alternative transportation routes and increasing market connectivity.

Furthermore, current Oil Price Dynamics demonstrate the interconnected nature of energy markets, where natural gas pricing often correlates with broader hydrocarbon commodity trends. Industrial customers benefit substantially from improved pipeline infrastructure through enhanced supply reliability and more competitive pricing.

Manufacturing operations requiring consistent natural gas supply, including steel production, chemical manufacturing, and cement production, depend on reliable transportation infrastructure to maintain operational continuity and cost competitiveness versus international producers.

Natural Gas Demand Growth Projections

The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects domestic natural gas consumption will continue expanding through 2030, driven by:

Power generation sector: Natural gas-fired electricity generation maintaining market share advantages over coal-fired generation

Industrial applications: Manufacturing sector natural gas consumption growth of 2-3% annually

Commercial and residential: Building heating and commercial applications supporting baseline demand

Transportation: Limited but growing compressed natural gas vehicle adoption in specific market segments

The Natural Gas Intel report highlighted that the Energy Transfer LNG project suspension reflects these shifting market priorities. Additionally, US Natural Gas Forecasts suggest continued domestic demand growth supporting pipeline investment strategies.

Pipeline utilisation rates across major U.S. corridors currently range from 75-95%, indicating robust demand fundamentals that support continued infrastructure investment. The Permian-to-Gulf Coast corridor operates at particularly high utilisation due to shale gas production growth and limited egress capacity relative to production volumes.

Critical Performance Indicators Guide Future Infrastructure Investment Decisions

Energy sector stakeholders require comprehensive analytical frameworks to evaluate competing infrastructure investment opportunities as market conditions continue evolving and capital allocation decisions become increasingly complex. The Energy Transfer LNG project suspension provides valuable lessons for assessing similar strategic choices across the midstream energy sector.

Future Outlook for Natural Gas Infrastructure Development Strategies

The Energy Transfer LNG project suspension reflects broader structural changes in energy infrastructure development that will likely persist through the remainder of this decade. Capital market discipline, regulatory complexity, and global market dynamics have fundamentally altered the risk-return calculations that guide major infrastructure investment decisions across the energy sector.

Pipeline Network Expansion Priorities

Domestic pipeline development will likely receive continued investment preference due to:

Shorter development cycles enabling faster capital deployment and return generation

Established regulatory frameworks reducing approval uncertainty and timeline variability

Domestic demand growth supporting long-term utilisation and revenue stability

Technology maturity minimising execution risk and operational complexity

Capital efficiency advantages requiring lower absolute investment levels per revenue unit

Regional pipeline expansion priorities will focus on addressing specific supply-demand imbalances, including Permian Basin egress capacity, Northeast market access, and Southeast industrial demand growth. These targeted investments offer superior risk-adjusted returns compared to large-scale export infrastructure development.

LNG Export Facility Development Pipeline

New LNG export project development faces continued challenges despite strong global demand fundamentals:

Capital market restrictions limiting financing availability for megaproject development

Environmental review complexity extending regulatory approval timelines beyond historical norms

Global competition intensification as international suppliers expand export capacity

Technology cost escalation affecting project economics and return profiles

Market saturation risks as global capacity growth potentially exceeds demand expansion

Successful LNG projects will likely require enhanced financial structures, including government policy support, strategic customer equity participation, or modular development approaches that reduce capital intensity and development risk.

Policy and Regulatory Evolution

Federal energy policy will continue influencing infrastructure development priorities through:

Environmental review modernisation potentially streamlining approval processes for domestic infrastructure

Energy security considerations supporting domestic pipeline network resilience and capacity expansion

International trade policy affecting LNG export market access and competitive positioning

Climate policy integration influencing long-term natural gas infrastructure investment strategies

The intersection of energy security, economic competitiveness, and environmental objectives will shape regulatory frameworks that affect both pipeline and LNG facility development timelines and approval criteria. Moreover, Tariffs' Impact on Investments demonstrates how trade policy influences energy infrastructure investment decisions.

Investment Market Evolution

Capital allocation trends across the energy infrastructure sector indicate continued preference for:

Shorter payback periods through pipeline and regional infrastructure investments

Predictable cash flow generation via established customer relationships and proven technologies

Domestic market focus reducing exposure to international commodity price volatility and geopolitical risks

Modular expansion capability enabling phased capital deployment and risk management

Operational efficiency optimisation through technology integration and asset portfolio synergies

The Energy Transfer LNG project suspension demonstrates that even well-positioned projects with strong customer commitments and technical capabilities face substantial challenges in current market conditions. This outcome provides valuable guidance for industry stakeholders evaluating similar strategic decisions and capital allocation priorities in the evolving energy infrastructure landscape.

The Detroit automaker will redirect resources toward profitable hybrids and conventional engines alongside smaller, budget-friendly electric models.

It also expects to take a $19.5 billion loss from this strategy after making heavy investments into electrification. These changes to Ford’s EV arrive as the Trump administration loosens efficiency mandates that previously encouraged electrification across the industry. Ford says the economics of pursuing large-format electric production have crumbled amidst disappointing sales volumes, excessive expenses and shifting regulatory frameworks.

Chief executive Jim Farley characterized the pivot as a response to market realities while building a more durable and lucrative business. As circumstances around EV production changed, the automaker was prompted to reallocate investment dollars toward better-returning segments like pickup trucks, commercial vans, hybrid powertrains and stationary power storage operations, Farley explained.

Consequently, the F-150 Lightning will disappear as a pure battery model under the revised plans. Instead, the popular pickup will incorporate a gas-powered range extender combined with electric drive systems, tapping into American demand for hybrids.

Ford also scrapped the development of an upcoming electric cargo van to focus more on conventional and hybrid commercial vehicles instead. General Motors made a similar pivot from pure electric cars to hybrids and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars four months ago. The rival manufacturer announced a $1.6 billion loss as it scaled back its electric ambitions due to softening buyer interest across American markets.

Battery-vehicle uptake in the U.S. significantly trails rates in China, Britain and continental Europe. Industry observers point to comparatively modest public backing for the technology compared to more aggressive incentive programs abroad that encouraged faster adoption rates, particularly in China.

In recent months, Washington has withdrawn numerous supports and requirements that would have accelerated electric adoption. This includes federal tax incentives of up to $7,500 on new qualifying battery, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen-fuel models.

Manufacturers predicted slowing growth once the Trump administration eliminated the subsidies. Farley remarked then that the electric sector would prove far smaller than earlier forecasts suggested during the industry’s optimistic phase several years ago. Recent regulatory rollbacks have also reversed previous efficiency targets that environmental advocates hoped would spur mass adoption across vehicle segments. Prior standards aimed to eliminate over 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by mid-century through stricter requirements.

Farley praised the regulatory retreat during an industry gathering, describing it as sensible policy despite criticism from conservation groups who called it regressive for manufacturing standards and environmental health outcomes. Updated requirements better reflect what buyers actually want, he maintained during public remarks.

These American developments coincide with European Union reconsideration of rules that would effectively prohibit new combustion sales by 2035. Berlin has pushed for modifications citing intense pressure from Asian competitors advancing quickly in battery technology and production capabilities. Brussels officials will announce revised proposals shortly.

As the automotive market evolves in tandem with the shifting policies from Washington, industry players like Massimo Group (NASDAQ: MAMO) will have to be extremely flexible in their strategies in order to retain and even grow their market share.

The project introduces the first publicly accessible Level 3 fast-charging hubs near the downtown metro areas of both cities. The expansion supports fleet electrification and improves public access to high-speed charging.

EV Fast-Charging Hubs Address Urban Gaps

The new PowerUp Point stations allow drivers to charge vehicles to 80% in about 20 minutes. This reduces charging time from hours to minutes. The Kansas City site includes 12 high-power charging ports. The Pittsburgh site includes six ports.

Before the project, Kansas City had only a few public fast chargers. None operated within five miles of downtown. Pittsburgh faced similar limitations. The EV fast-charging hubs now fill a critical infrastructure gap in both markets.

“Our goal is to make EV charging as easy and reliable as filling up a gas tank,” said Josh Green, CEO of Inspiration Mobility Group. “By adding commercial-grade Level 3 fast-charging solutions in both cities, we’re helping accelerate the shift to electric transportation and ensuring fleets and local drivers can charge quickly, reliably, and conveniently.”

Public Access and Fleet Support

Inspiration owns and manages the charging depots. Each site offers 24/7 public access. The hubs support taxi fleets, rideshare drivers, delivery vehicles, local businesses, and everyday EV owners.

“As the nation’s largest taxi fleet operator, we know how critical reliable charging is to keeping drivers on the road and passengers served,” said Bill George, CEO of zTrip. “Partnering with Inspiration not only supports our own EV transition but also strengthens the entire EV community in both cities.”

Platform Integration Enhances Charging Experience

To support public access, Inspiration partnered with Presto. The platform helps drivers locate chargers, initiate charging, and complete payment. The system is designed to scale as demand increases.

“The PowerUp Points are exactly what Presto was built for: shared-use infrastructure that grows with demand and delivers consistent, fast-charging access,” said Ashwin Dias, CEO of Presto.

Downtown Locations and Future Expansion

The Kansas City PowerUp Point operates in the downtown Paseo West district. The Pittsburgh site is located in the historic Manchester neighborhood. Each hub operates year-round with 180-kilowatt-hour chargers. The chargers support CCS connectors and NACS with an adapter.

The public opening marks the next phase of the Inspiration and zTrip partnership. The companies launched their first charging depot for zTrip fleet drivers in November 2024.

“Bolt represents a significant step forward in bringing world-class technology infrastructure to West Texas,” TPL CEO Ty Glover said. “With unmatched supply of both conventional fuel and renewable power, West Texas is a global leader for energy production. We believe West Texas has the attributes necessary to become one of the largest concentrations of AI compute infrastructure globally and combined with TPL’s ownership of nearly one million acres, our collaboration with Bolt is designed to help realize that opportunity.”

Bolt was co-founded as a data and energy infrastructure company by former Google chairman and CEO Eric Schmidt, who currently serves as Bolt’s chairman. TPL will also receive an equity interest, warrants, and the first right of refusal to supply water to Bolt projects.

“Our goal is to create the largest and most efficient data center company in the world by combining abundant energy production, efficient and scalable data infrastructure, and the largest land expansion runway in North America,” Schmidt said. “By partnering with TPL, Bolt will fuel the Fourth Industrial Revolution and protect and augment American leadership in artificial intelligence.”

Florida-based Airspan Networks Relocates Corporate Headquarters to Plano

Airspan Networks, a provider of wireless network solutions, has opened its new corporate headquarters in Plano. The company moves from Boca Raton, Florida, to North Texas into a 25,000-square-foot facility.

“Our new Plano headquarters expands our US-based product development and represents a significant evolution for Airspan,” Airspan CEO Glenn Laxdal said. “We have aligned the company around three solution pillars – in-building wireless networks, Open RAN solutions, and air-to-ground connectivity and we welcome customers from around the world to visit our new facility and see first-hand Airspan’s leadership and innovation.”

After launching in 1992, Airspan’s new HQ will employ around 150 people across its R&D, customer support, sales, and engineering departments.

The skilled trades are at a crossroads: demand is rising, but the workforce isn’t keeping up. A wave of retirements is converging with a surge in energy efficiency projects and an unprecedented push to electrify buildings and vehicles, leaving utilities and energy program implementers scrambling to fill a widening talent gap as the clean energy industry grows and evolves.

Compounding the workforce shortage, decades-old perceptions about “who belongs” on the jobsite still shape access to training and advancement, creating barriers to entry for careers that pay well and power the clean energy transition.

A recent report by Permit Powerfinds that by cutting the red tape in rooftop solar permitting, almost 20 million more families would install solar by 2040.

“No one should be locked out of the clean energy transition, but an unwieldy permitting process can do just that.","The New Jersey State Senate passed revised “smart solar” permitting legislation and the bill now goes to Governor Murphy for his signature.

The Regional Plan Association released a report earlier this year that found that New Jersey has the third-slowest permitting timelines for residential solar projects in the country. The bill (S4100/A5264) intends to speed up the approval process for residential solar and battery systems through use of an automated permitting platform.

The State Assembly previously passed in a votes of 75-0-1 vote earlier this month. Permit Power told pv magazine USA that the bill, which had been conditionally vetoed by Gov. Murphy last month and now passed by the legislature represents mutually agreed upon language and is expected to be signed by the governor.

According to Permit Power, the most substantive change to the Assembly bill was to extend the compliance deadlines in the bill by an additional 6 months.

Other changes were mostly technical and semantic, according to Permit Power. They include directing the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) to issue an RFP for the development of the statewide smart permitting platform, and giving the board of public utilities a consultative role in the RFP process. The bill also now explicitly limits the use of the platform and preparation of materials submitted through the platform to licensed professionals including contractors, engineers, architects.

Once signed into law, the DCA will be required to make an online, automated permitting platform for rooftop solar and battery installs available statewide within a year.

The bill also allows local communities to opt out of using the DCA platform as long as they implement a comparable alternative. These jurisdictions must submit an annual report to the DCA that provides information on the number of permit applications submitted through their automated platform and shows documentation that their platform meets the needed requirements.

Increasing solar installations will save New Jersey ratepayers more than $87 million by 2030 and add more than 560 clean energy jobs, according to a letter signed by 33 organizations in support of the bill that passed in the New Jersey assembly in June.

“In this year of rising utility bills, this is a moment for solutions to provide more clean energy to our electric grid and provide more savings for ratepayers. Smart solar permitting can bring permitting into the 21st century, reduce costs and burdens on towns and cities and get more clean energy onto the electric grid and save ratepayers money,” said State Sen. John McKeon (D-27), the Senate prime sponsor of the legislation.

A recent report by Permit Powerfinds that by cutting the red tape in rooftop solar permitting, almost 20 million more families would install solar by 2040. Reducing bureaucratic barriers, particularly rooftop solar permitting, inspection and interconnection processes, will reduce installation costs in many areas in the United States, the report finds.

Permitting inefficiencies also increase costs for consumers, according to the Greenhouse Institute, adding $3,800 to $4,500 to the cost of a typical rooftop solar system in New Jersey. Nearly one out of five residential solar projects are cancelled before installations, the report finds, with installers citing permitting barriers as the number one reason for the cancellations.

“With energy bills on the rise, one of the most direct ways we can protect communities is by making it easier, faster and more affordable to generate clean energy at home,” said Elowyn Corby, Mid-Atlantic Regional Director for Vote Solar Action Fund. “No one should be locked out of the clean energy transition, but an unwieldy permitting process can do just that. Along with the other members of the statewide NJ Shines Coalition, we’re excited for this bill to accelerate progress toward a resilient and equitable New Jersey that works for everyone.”

This is becoming a difficult moment economically for some—new data today suggests that unemployment has reached its highest level since the pandemic.

Here’s instructions for how to cancel those payments. And conversely if you’re in a place where you can afford to help support this community, it would be graciously welcomed].

It’s the end of the year, and so one should be compiling ten-best lists.

And I turned 65 last week, having spent almost my entire adult life in the climate fight, so it’s one of those moments when I wish I could look back with a certain amount of satisfaction.

But since I owe you honesty, not exuberance, just at the moment I can’t provide much celebration. I was hopeful this edition of The Crucial Years might be about a big victory—on Wednesday the board that controls New York City’s pension funds was considering whether or not to pull tens of billions from Blackrock because of the investment giant’s climate waffling, which would have been a massive display of courage. Sadly, the city comptroller Brad Lander hadn’t gotten the measure on the agenda before the final meeting of his term, and he seems to have run out of time and political juice—the idea was tabled.

And so we’re left staring at a pile of recent defeats, at least in this country (which is an important qualification). I’ll try to end in a more hopeful place, but I fear you’re going to have to work through my angst with me for a few minutes.

The most traumatic item is the Trump administration’s decision to shut down the National Center for Atmospheric Research, born like me in 1960. It was a product of that era’s faith in science, a faith that paid off spectacularly. Take weather forecasting. As Nature reported today

Work at NCAR played a key part in the rise of modern weather and climate forecasting. For instance, the lab pioneered the modern dropwindsonde, a weather instrument that can be released from an aircraft to measure conditions as it plummets through a storm. The technology reshaped the scientific understanding of hurricanes, says James Franklin, an atmospheric scientist and former branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the US National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.

But its most historically significant work has been in understanding the dimensions of the ongoing climate crisis. Nature again

On the global scale, NCAR is known for its climate-modelling work, including the world-leading models that underpin international assessments such as those from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Hundreds of scientists pass through NCAR’s doors each year to collaborate with its researchers. More than 800 people are employed at NCAR, most of whom work at the centre’s three campuses in Boulder, including the iconic Mesa Lab that sits at the base of jagged mountain peaks and was designed by architect I. M. Pei.

There’s no question about why the administration is doing what it’s doing. Project 2025 enforcer Russell Vought explained it quite succinctly—NCAR must go because it is “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country.” This is stupid—it’s like closing the fire department because it’s a source of “fire alarmism”—but it’s by now an entirely recognizable form of stupid. And it’s also sly: it’s like spraypainting over the surveillance cameras so you can rob the bank without anyone watching. But of course nothing changes with the underlying physics. Indeed yesterday, as the announcement came down, NCAR was closed for the day because

the local electrical company planned to cut electricity preemptively to reduce wildfire risk as fierce winds were forecast around Boulder. In 2021, a wildfire ignited just kilometres from NCAR; fuelled by powerful winds, it ripped through suburban homes, killing two people. Many researchers say this is a new normal of increased fire risk in an era of climate change — a topic of study at NCAR.

I am glad people are rallying to fight—there was an emergency press conference today at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, where many of the world’s earth scientists are gathered. Third Act Colorado is working with Indivisible on a weekend rally. This is the scientific equivalent of tearing down the East Wing of the White House, and given the moment a lot more significant.

But I’m saddened to see how little our representatives in DC seem to really care, even the Democratic ones. Sixteen Democratic Senators voted today to confirm Trump (and Elon Musk’s) nominee to head NASA, even though, as Brad Johnson pointed out in his Hill Heat newsletter, the administration is trying to slash science research at the agency in half. The new head, Jared Isaacman, is clearly on board. As he wrote this spring, “Take NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine.” But of course the administration is wrecking that too—they cut off the funding for the gold standard climate research program at Princeton on the grounds that it was “contributing to a phenomenon known as ‘climate anxiety,’ which has increased significantly among America’s youth.”

Too many Democratic leaders are feeling comfortable waving off climate concerns, because of a feeling that it might be a political problem for them. That was exemplified this morning in the New York Times when center-right pundit Matt Yglesias issued a strident call for liberals to “support America’s oil and gas industry.” That he did it hours after that oil and gas industry won its fight to shutter climate research was probably coincidental, but the piece was a woebegone recycling of decades-old bad-faith arguments from a person who has insisted repeatedly that climate change is not an existential risk. Yglesias wants us to follow Obama-era ‘all of the above’ energy policies even though they date from fifteen years ago, when clean energy was more expensive than dirty, and long before we had the batteries that could make solar and wind fully useful. It’s no longer a good argument, but he has not changed his tune one iota—he keeps invoking Obama, as if what was passable policy in 2008 still made sense.

The centerpiece of his argument is that we should support the gas industry because at least it produces less carbon than coal.

It is much cleaner than coal, consumption of which is still high and rising globally. Increased gas production, by displacing coal, has been the single largest driver of American emissions reductions over time. To the extent that foreign countries can be persuaded to rely on American gas exports rather than coal to fill the gaps left by the ongoing build-out of intermittent wind and solar that’s a climate win.

By now anyone following this debate knows that this is a mendacious point. That’s because the switch to gas has reduced American carbon emissions at the cost of increasing American methane emissions. Those who, like Yglesias, followed last year’s debate over pausing permitting for LNG export terminals know that the crucial point was the science showing that in fact American LNG exports were worse than coal. The job is to get others to switch to solar, not coal—and that’s happening everywhere except the U.S., whose appetite for the stuff is apparently the thing still driving up global consumption even as demand drops in China and India.

Having written many many opeds for the Times, I know that they fact-check things like the methane numbers; this should not have eluded them, but in fairness it’s eluded Democrats for decades, because gas has been such a convenient out for those unwilling to stand up to Big Oil. If I sound sore here, it’s because I’ve tried and failed to get this basic point of physics across; it’s just technical enough that senators often forget it, but ostensibly serious people like Yglesias should at least grapple with it.

All of this comes on the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate talks—and tenth anniversary of the Congress and (Democratic) president approving the resumption of U.S. oil exports. I celebrated my 55th in Paris, and I remember being hunched over a laptop at a cafe writing what I think may have been the only oped opposing that resumption. As I said at the time

It’s especially galling that Senate leaders -- Republicans and Democrats -- are apparently talking about trading this gift to Exxon and its ilk for tax breaks for wind and solar providers. It’s hard to imagine a better illustration of politicians who simply don’t understand the physics of climate change. We don’t need more of all kinds of energy -- we need more of the clean stuff and way, way less of the dirty. Physics doesn’t do backroom deals.

And indeed the Senators who said it was no big deal were wrong. America is, as Tony Dutzik pointed out this week, now the biggest oil exporter on earth. He lays out the case nicely

“There is currently little if any incentive for U.S. oil producers to export crude oil even if the ban is lifted,” wrote Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, for example, in December 2015.

A decade later, those breezy assessments have proven to be wildly off-base. “The United States produces more crude oil than any country, ever,” reads a 2024 headline from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), one of the agencies that got it wrong. Not only did lifting the crude export ban lead to a surge in oil production, but it also dramatically reshaped the global energy system, U.S. politics and greenhouse gas emissions.

So, anyway, feeling a little sad today. But I do think this is a low point, because I think around the rest of the world, where Trump (and pundits like Yglesias) have marginally less sway, things are continuing to break the right way. In fact, earlier today the premier journal Science picked its scientific “Breakthrough of the Year” and it turned out to be not some fascinating if arcane new discovery, but instead the prosaic but powerful spread of renewable energy around the planet.

This year, renewables surpassed coal as a source of electricity worldwide, and solar and wind energy grew fast enough to cover the entire increase in global electricity use from January to June, according to energy think tank Ember. In September, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared at the United Nations that his country will cut its carbon emissions by as much as 10% in a decade, not by using less energy, but by doubling down on wind and solar. And solar panel imports in Africa and South Asia have soared, as people in those regions realized rooftop solar can cheaply power lights, cellphones, and fans. To many, the continued growth of renewables now seems unstoppable—a prospect that has led Science to name the renewable energy surge its 2025 Breakthrough of the Year.

The tsunami of tech spilling from China’s factories has changed the country’s energy landscape—and its physical one, too. For decades China’s development was synonymous with coal, which produced choking air pollution and massive carbon emissions, still greater than those of all other developed nations combined. Now, solar panels carpet deserts and the high, sunstruck plateau of Tibet, and wind turbines up to 300 meters tall guard coastlines and hilltops (see photo essay, below). China’s solar power generation grew more than 20-fold over the past decade, and its solar and wind farms now have enough capacity to power the entire United States.

China’s burgeoning exports of green tech are transforming the rest of the world, too. Europe is a longtime customer, but countries in the Global South are also rushing to buy China’s solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines, spurred by market forces and a desire for energy independence. In Pakistan, for example, imports of Chinese solar panels grew fivefold from 2022 to ’24 as the Ukraine war pushed up natural gas prices and the cost of grid power. “For people who were asking, ‘How am I going to keep the lights on in my home,’ it was a very obvious choice,” says Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. In South Africa, old and unreliable coal plants drove a similar dynamic. Ethiopia has embraced solar and wind amid worries that hydropower, the country’s mainstay, will decline as droughts become more frequent.

That’s the fight as we head into 2026. Trump and Big Oil have had the run of things this year, but their idiocy is pushing up against limits: among other things, it turns out that permitting every data center imaginable while cutting off the supply of cheap sun and wind is sending energy prices through the roof, which may be a real issue as midterms loom.

I’m not retiring—I’m here for the fight, and you too I hope

+Sea level rise seems to be accelerating. A new study of dozens of tide gauges around the U.S. shows, as Brady Dennis puts it, that a pretend study carried out by climate skeptics for the Department of Energy earlier this year, “stands in contrast” to reality.

Chris Piecuch, a sea-level scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said he undertook his analysis in response to that Energy Department report, which he and others argue uses cherry-picked data to conclude that “U.S. tide gauge measurements reveal no obvious acceleration beyond the historical average rate of sea level rise.”

Piecuch said that while the rate of rising seas varies from place to place, the full range of available data leads to “a dramatically different conclusion” about what is actually unfolding along the nation’s coastlines.

“If you want to be thorough, you take all the data we have. When you do that, you find pretty unambiguous evidence of sea-level rise over the past century” in much of the country, said Piecuch, the author of the study published Wednesday in the journal AGU Advances.

“It’s not politics. That’s what the data say.”

Meanwhile, Arctic sea ice is at a record low level for the date

and a new study shows what a miserable year it’s been up north, with the highest temperatures ever recorded. As Oliver Millman puts it

From October 2024 to September 2025, temperatures across the entire Arctic region were the hottest in 125 years of modern record keeping, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said, with the last 10 years being the 10 warmest on record in the Arctic.

The Arctic is heating up as much as four times as quickly as the global average, due to the burning of fossil fuels, and this extra heat is warping the world’s refrigerator – a region that acts as a key climate regulator for the rest of the planet.

The maximum extent of sea ice in 2025 was the lowest in the 47-year satellite record, Noaa reported on in its annual Arctic report card. This is the latest landmark in a longer trend, with the region’s oldest, thickest ice declining by more than 95% since the 1980s as the Arctic becomes hotter and rainier.

This year was a record for precipitation in the Arctic. Much of this is not settling as snow – the June snow cover extent over the Arctic today is half of what it was six decades ago.

+The Trump campaign against electric vehicles is causing a $19.5 billion dollar writedown at Ford, which will retool its assembly lines to make more hybrid vehicles and fewer true EVs.

But some industry experts said Ford’s strategy could make it vulnerable in the future if car buyers, including in the United States, became more willing to use electric vehicles.

“Dropping the Lightning might make Ford more China-proof until the day Chinese companies understand American pickup buyers the way Japanese car companies learned to understand American sedan and then S.U.V. buyers,” Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, said in an email. “There are no trade secrets to understanding American vehicle buyers.”

Meanwhile, Uber is pulling back its incentives for EV use

After long advocating for stronger government policies to speed up EV adoption, Uber did a U-turn this spring and stumped for President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” This included Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi appearing in a White House promotional video for the legislation, which the League of Conservation Voters called “the most anti-environmental bill of all time.” The law slashed clean-energy incentives and is expected to slow EV adoption in the US by about 40% compared to previous projections.

Underscoring the stupidity of all this: new numbers from China on the explosive growth in electric trucks there.

The share of electrics in new truck sales, from 8% in 2024 to 28% by August 2025, has more than tripled as prices have fallen. Electric trucks outsold LNG-powered vehicles in China for five consecutive months this year, according to Commercial Vehicle World.

While electric trucks are two to three times more expensive than diesel ones and cost roughly 18% more than LNG trucks, their higher energy efficiency and lower costs can save owners an estimated 10% to 26% over the vehicle’s lifetime, according to research by Chinese scientists.

“When it comes to heavy trucks, the fleet owners in China are very bottom-line driven,” Doleman said.

Major logistics hubs, including in the Yangtze River Delta, have added dedicated charging stations along key freight routes. Cities like Beijing and Shanghai have built heavy-duty charging hubs along highways that can charge trucks in minutes.

Beyond trucks, the rest of transit. Here’s a fascinating essay from Andrew Beebe on the coming frontiers of electrification:

Another of our companies, Pyka, is flying fully electric aircraft to spray crops and take human pilots out of some of agriculture’s dirtiest and most dangerous work. And Lightship is bringing that same leap forward to RVs, a category once thought incompatible with electrification.

And these are just the visible edge. Electrification is reaching deep into the infrastructure of the modern world, in warehouses, ports, farms, delivery fleets, even the shipping lanes between continents. As more sectors make the switch, the compounding benefits for cost, emissions, and resilience are accelerating.

The best example of the dramatic progress on electrification might come from electric ships. A young company called Fleet Zero is demonstrating how to make the transition. The company was founded by former veteran merchant mariners who realized the current shipping industry is not just dirty with pollution, but dangerous and inefficient for the crews. They saw that the future of shipping wasn’t in slow, incremental decarbonization with costly, volatile fuels like ammonia or methanol. The future is full electrification, from engine room to bridge.

Fleet Zero is following the proven short-haul strategy, starting with nearshore, back-and-forth routes—also known as “drayage” of the sea—to build a multi-billion dollar business before scaling to trans-oceanic vessels. The long-term vision is a world where there are no oil slicks, no diesel off-gas, and no need for twelve people to live and breathe in a poorly ventilated engine room.

+Great video from PBS on the rapid spread of plug-in or balcony solar. We started tracking this on this newsletter about a year ago, and I’d say it’s now safe to say it’s getting pretty close to the mainstream.

+Rapid falls in the price of storage batteries are essentially turning solar power into 24 hour supply—the numbers, says Michelle Lewis, are truly remarkable

As Ember global electricity analyst Kostantsa Rangelova put it, after a 40% drop in battery equipment costs in 2024, the industry is now on track for another major fall in 2025. The economics of battery storage, she said, are “unrecognizable,” and the industry is still adjusting to this new reality.

“Solar is no longer just cheap daytime electricity; now it’s anytime dispatchable electricity. This is a game-changer for countries with fast-growing demand and strong solar resources,” Rangelova added.

+I’m a longtime admirer of Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, whose new exhibition, Presence, manages to capture a roiling sun in ways that make audiences gasp. A fine profile in the Guardian includes him taling about how art can work to change our perceptions:

He rejects the idea that nature created inside a gallery is fundamentally different to nature outside: “There is no outside and inside. There is only the world. The gallery is inside of what is outside. You don’t step into a gallery to disappear into the void. You go in to see more clearly; to see things which outside are contaminated and politicised and weaponised.”

He despairs for the world, but Eliasson ultimately calls himself a “prisoner of hope” – a phrase used by the late archbishop Desmond Tutu to describe his unwavering faith that good ultimately prevails. He speaks about Indigenous philosophies that view nature as kin, and the movement to grant legal “personhood” rights to natural features such as mountains, rivers and forests. He is heartened by these shifts away from the anthropocentric worldview: “It’s comforting to know people have the capacity to change how they see things.”

+Sharon Lerner at ProPublica has an important report on the EPA’s new project: doubling the amount of formaldehyde we get to breathe. If that sounds bad, well, it is.

Last week, in a highly unusual move, the Environmental Protection Agency embraced that approach in announcing that it is revising an assessment of the health dangers posed by formaldehyde, a widespread pollutant that causes far more cancer than any other chemical in the air. Working on that effort were two of those former industry insiders, who are now top EPA officials.

The proposed revisions to the assessment, released Wednesday, nearly double the amount of formaldehyde considered safe to inhale compared with the version that was finalized in the last weeks of the Biden administration. Even that older assessment significantly underestimated the dangers posed by formaldehyde, a ProPublica investigation published last year found.

Under previous Republican and Democratic administrations, EPA scientists were instructed to assume that chemicals that cause cancer by damaging DNA — the largest group of carcinogens, which includes formaldehyde — pose a “linear” risk, meaning that even small exposures can be dangerous. The agency adopted the approach almost 40 years ago to protect against the multitude of low-level cancer threats the public faces daily. But the industry’s favored method assumes that certain carcinogens pose no risk at lower levels and that the danger should only be considered once exposure reaches a certain threshold.

The Trump administration has already criticized the use of the linear model for calculating the risk of cancer from radiation and could scrap its use in examining other chemicals.

+Congestion pricing in New York City has proven to be…kind of miraculous. New data from the first six months of the project finds

The first quasi-experimental evidence that New York City’s cordon-based congestion pricing policy produced rapid and substantial air-quality improvements. Within just six months of implementation, daily maximum PM 2.5 in the CRZ declined by 22%, controlling for background concentrations, meteorology, and neighborhood demographics. This magnitude exceeds prior evidence from Stockholm, where congestion pricing reduced air pollution by 5–15% between 2006 and 20105, andLondon’s Ultra Low Emission Zone, which achieved about a 7% decline in PM 2.5 citywide between 2019 and 202210 .

The comparatively larger effects in New York likely reflect both the intensity of travel demand and the greater modal flexibility of its commuters, supported by an extensive transit system and multi-modal system.Importantly, the results show that air-quality improvements werenot confined to the tolled zone. We find no evidence of emissions displacement to neighboring areas; instead, the analysis reveals net reductions across the broader metropolitan region. These findings suggest that congestion pricing acts as a system-wide behavioral intervention rather than a geographically bounded one.

+Clare Fieseler has an almost-poignant and really fascinating account of the guy who’s spent the last years effectively spewing misinformation about offshore wind in an effort to kill the industry in America.

Nowadays, David Stevenson seems to have mixed emotions about his achievements. On two of our most recent phone calls, his tenor had changed.

“​Well, I think it was the right move,” he said in early fall, referring to the Trump administration’s stop-work order pausing the building of Revolution Wind, which was still in effect when we spoke. ​“But it is not something I’m going to dance around the table happy about, because there are people that get hurt by this, that are losing their jobs.”

All his efforts have ​“paid off,” he said. America’s elevated reliance on cheap natural gas — which, when burned, releases fewer carbon emissions than coal — was ​“better policy” for now. He views gas as an essential bridge fuel until nuclear, geothermal, and solar can be built. But he expressed some ​“disappointment” that Trump has increasingly gone after solar and wants to now expand coal production.

help pay for phasing out coal use by creating value out of the emissions that would prevent. The funds would then pay to replace fossil fuel equipment with clean energy gear.

Proponents say transition credits could unlock a windfall of investment for the power hungry Asia-Pacific region and speed up Southeast Asia’s transition to renewable energy.

The Rockefeller Foundation designed the transition credits concept to help finance early retirement of coal plants by paying for replacing fossil fuel gear with renewable energy equipment used to keep generating power at the same sites.

Patrick McCully, an energy transition analyst for Reclaim Finance, wrote in a recent report that transition credits would likely repeat failures of the carbon market,” asserting the credits are a “dead end” because the industry hasn’t addressed false promises, inaccurate carbon calculations and other issues.

Environmental groups are yet again challenging Louisiana regulators in their decision to reissue a previously suspended permit for a liquified natural gas export facility in Cameron Parish.

The Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a lawsuit in Louisiana’s 38th judicial district against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy.

The environmental groups say that the agency “violated its constitutional, statutory and regulatory duties,” as well as the court’s previous judgment when it reissued a permit for the construction of Commonwealth LNG’s export facility on the coast of Cameron Parish.

​​“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.

“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club managing attorney.

Huber said the Department of Conservation and Energy “is attempting to shrug off its responsibility” by relying on studies done by other agencies— the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission— rather than doing its own analysis.

The lawsuit is the latest in back-and-forth between regulators, environmentalists and industry as the liquified natural gas industry pursues its expansion along the Gulf Coast.

Louisiana district judge Penelope Richard ruled in a surprise move in October that the state agency did not adequately consider the effects of climate change and impacts to environmental justice communities nearby the planned facility when it issued its first permit to Commonwealth LNG.

About a month later, the state reissued the permit, citing the need for haste in part to align with the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda.

AUSTIN, Texas, Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --Favor, the only on-demand delivery app by and for Texans, released its 2025 How Texas Orders In report today, highlighting the trends, tastes and memorable orders that defined delivery across the Lone Star State this year. From top dishes, dips and drinks to the most heartwarming and hilarious Delivery Notes, the 2025 report shares how Texans relied on delivery to make the most of every moment this year.

How Texas Orders In:

Tacos and queso held onto their top spots as Texans' most-ordered dish and dip, while coffee overtook Dr Pepper to become the most ordered drink of 2025.

Preference data revealed Texans chose corn tortilla tacos over flour tortilla tacos, sweet tea over unsweet tea, white wine over red wine, and bone-in wings over boneless wings.

Tomatoes, avocados, limes and jalapeños topped H-E-B Now orders – a clear sign Texans were making plenty of guacamole in 2025.

With Favor available in more than 400 Texas cities, the report also spotlights hyper-local moments across the state:

Austin saw Thai orders double during the White Lotus season finale on April 6.

Dallas–Fort Worth led the state in edamame orders.

Houston logged the most ""thank you"" and ""howdy"" messages in Delivery Notes for delivery drivers.

San Antonio had the most requests to add jalapeños.

Rio Grande Valley ordered 14 times more tamales than the average of other Texas cities.

Lubbock experienced a spike in tortilla orders during college football season – but orders dipped after the ban on tossing tortillas on the field.

One of the report's most beloved sections focuses on Delivery Notes, offering a glimpse into how Texans communicate with Runners (that's what Favor delivery drivers are called). ""Don't knock"" remained the most common note left for Runners, but ""don't judge"" notes increased this year, including messages like ""Don't judge the dead plants on my porch"" and ""Don't judge me by how close I live to the store!"".

Delivery Notes also captured how Texans relied on Favor in unexpected moments, from extra hair dye for a San Antonian mid-color to a Coke Zero rescue for an Austinite when a restaurant's soda machine went down.

VIEW A RECORDING OF THE RELEASE WEBINAR

APPALACHIA — A new report released today by ReImagine Appalachia reveals that 67% of the region’s 92,282 projected clean energy jobs – over 61,000 jobs – are now at risk following dramatic policy shifts under the Trump administration. “Tracking the Appalachian Impacts: What’s on the Line as Federal Funding Flatlines” documents how clean energy investments across Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky have flatlined after historic growth, threatening transformative economic opportunities in Appalachian communities.

The comprehensive analysis tracks quarterly data from 2018 through Q3 2025, examining both federal and private investments across three major categories: energy and industry deployment, clean energy manufacturing, and retail purchases of greenhouse gas-reducing technologies. The report shows that investments, which had tripled from 2021 to 2024, peaking at $4.7 billion in Q3 2024, have now stagnated, with energy and industry expenditures plummeting from $1.27 billion in Q3 2024 to just $445 million by Q3 2025.

The report also covers how Trump administration led changes to funding have impacted local projects, including the industrial efficiency projects at the Cleveland-Cliffs Corporation in Middletown, OH, workforce development programming led by Landforce in Pittsburgh, PA, long term delays to a coal to solar project in Nicholas County, WV, and impacts to the development of a battery manufacturing facility led by Sparkz Inc. in cooperation with the United Mine Workers of America in Taylor County, WV.

“The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act brought unprecedented investment and job creation to communities across our region,” said Diana Polson, report co-author. “We documented $9.85 billion in energy and industry investments, $18.8 billion in clean energy manufacturing, and $22.3 billion in retail purchases of clean technologies since 2022. These were transforming our communities, creating good-paying jobs that don’t require college degrees. Now we’re watching those opportunities slip away as federal funding flatlines.”

Rike Rothenstein, report co-author, added: “The data tells a stark story. Clean energy manufacturing grew from nearly nothing in 2018 to substantial investments by 2023, with 72% going to battery manufacturing and 19% to zero-emissions vehicles. But the momentum has stopped. Federal clean energy investments waned dramatically as President Trump took office for his second term, and the proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens to dismantle remaining programs entirely. From a canceled furnace upgrade at Cleveland-Cliffs’ steel plant in Middletown, Ohio, to a stalled solar project on former mine land in Nicholas County, WV, our case studies show how these cuts impact our communities.”

“What’s particularly devastating is that the majority of threatened jobs are in construction and manufacturing, exactly the kind of blue-collar work our communities need,” said Dana Kuhnline, report co-author. “These investments were targeting places like Appalachia that have been left behind. The chaotic efforts to dismantle them will have particularly devastating impacts here, raising residential energy prices, sabotaging job creation, and ceding America’s leadership in clean energy to foreign competitors.”

Key findings from the report include:

Clean energy investments dropped from a peak of $4.7 billion in Q3 2024 to $3.8 billion in Q1 2025, with continued flatlining through Q3 2025

Energy and industry expenditures plummeted 65% from their peak, from $1.27 billion to $445 million

67% of projected clean energy jobs in the region (over 61,000 jobs) are now at risk

Federal funding decreased significantly as the Trump administration took office, reversing gains from historic climate legislation

National data from the Federal Reserve corroborates regional trends, showing private construction spending in manufacturing plateaued at $240 billion in mid-2024 after tripling from 2021

The analysis predicts that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will raise residential energy prices, sabotage job creation, and cede America’s leadership in clean energy and manufacturing to foreign competitors, with Appalachian communities bearing the brunt of these impacts.

“In less than a year, we have seen the historic growth of the clean energy and manufacturing sectors drop to a flat line,” the report concludes. “Our region was set to create 92,282 jobs because of clean energy investments. Now those opportunities are vanishing before our eyes.”",https://reimagineappalachia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/RA-logo-white-background.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:27.137421

Senators debated the “Real Jobs for Michigan” job creation package, which is similar to the 2019 “Good Jobs for Michigan” initiative.","The year began with a significant victory for Michigan’s innovation economy. In January, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a bipartisan package that created a Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit and the Michigan Innovation Fund. The Detroit Regional Chamber has long advocated for these tools to retain high-tech firms and align Michigan with competitor states. The tiered credit system, offering specific benefits for both small and large employers, signaled a strong commitment to fostering a knowledge-based economy.

However, there were immediate headwinds in February as the amended Earned Sick Time Act (ESTA) and new minimum wage mandates took effect. The implementation of these policies created administrative and financial hurdles for small businesses, particularly regarding the specific accrual mandates and lack of exemptions for smaller enterprises. The Chamber successfully negotiated amendments to ESTA that made the sick time mandates flexible for small businesses and compatible with generous employer policies.

By March, the focus shifted to road funding, with House Republicans taking the lead. While the package of bills was a solution to the issues the state’s roads faced, and the Chamber was supportive of it, the Chamber did testify in opposition to one component of the bill that would have eliminated Michigan Economic Growth Authority (MEGA) tax credits.

In April, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) achieved accreditation from the International Economic Development Council, a mark of excellence that bolsters the state’s reputation among site selectors.

The Chamber’s annual Mackinac Policy Conference, held in late May, was the premier forum where state leaders and business executives discussed the “Make It in Michigan” strategy, focusing on talent retention and housing. The Chamber utilized this platform to champion the “Make MI Home” talent attraction initiative, securing widespread support for policies that not only create jobs but ensure Michigan has the workforce to fill them.

As the statutory budget deadline approached in July, tensions in Lansing began to rise. Unlike previous years, a consensus on the state budget remained elusive. The Chamber consistently urged lawmakers to prioritize fiscal prudence and avoid using one-time funds for ongoing expenses, a principle that became a central point of contention as negotiations stalled.

The summer months were dominated by the ripple effects of federal policy and the ongoing budget stalemate. The passage of federal tax changes, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, created a divergence between state and federal tax codes.

Throughout July and August, the legislature failed to meet its self-imposed deadlines for the state budget. The delay created uncertainty for schools, local governments, and businesses as they prepared for the upcoming fiscal year. The Chamber publicly expressed concern regarding the lack of a finalized spending plan, emphasizing that predictability and consistency are cornerstones of a strong business environment.

Lastly, the Michigan Board of Canvassers failed to approve ballot language for a graduated income tax proposal, known as “Invest in MI Kids.” The Chamber, working in collaboration with other business organizations, testified in opposition to the proposed language, arguing that the deceptive language of the proposal was not truthful in what the proposal would actually accomplish. While the Board did not approve the language of the proposal, the proposal is still able to move forward.

The fiscal year 2025-26 budget was finally passed in October, narrowly avoiding a state government shutdown. The final package was a mixed bag for the business community. On a positive note, the budget included $1.1 billion in new road funding, a long-standing priority to improve critical infrastructure.

However, the legislature funded these investments in part by decoupling Michigan from key federal tax provisions, specifically those related to bonus depreciation and expensing. This move effectively results in a tax increase for capital-intensive businesses. This policy is anti-growth, as it penalizes investment in new equipment and technology at a time when modernization is crucial for competitiveness. Additionally, cuts to Going PRO and the MEDC’s budget raised concerns about the state’s continued ability to fund workforce development and business attraction efforts.

The year concluded with mostly talk of legislative activity in November and December. Senators debated the “Real Jobs for Michigan” job creation package, which is similar to the 2019 “Good Jobs for Michigan” initiative.

Health-related legislation was a major focus of the Arkansas General Assembly’s 2025 regular legislative session, and the state will implement many health-related laws in the new year. These actions from lawmakers are intended to address maternal health care, expand access to preventive health services, strengthen the healthcare workforce, and change how some services are covered and delivered under state-regulated health insurance plans.

Arkansas Health Policy Changes

Act 866 requires health plans, as well as Medicaid and the Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me (ARHOME) program, to cover deliveries that occur at a licensed birthing center the same as hospital-based deliveries. Arkansas currently does not have a licensed birthing center, but the law establishes coverage requirements if any are licensed in the state in the future. The law is intended to expand delivery options and support alternative models of maternity care.

Act 627 requires health plans — as well as Medicaid, ARKids First, and ARHOME — to cover breastfeeding and lactation consultant services provided in outpatient settings. This coverage is not subject to annual deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance.

Act 390 requires health plans, as well as Medicaid and ARHOME, to cover lung cancer screening and related follow-up services consistent with American Cancer Society guidelines, without imposing additional cost sharing specific to those services.

Insurance coverage for certain genetic and imaging services will also expand beginning January 1. Act 860 requires insurers to cover genetic testing for inherited cancer-related gene mutations when clinically indicated, as well as specified evidence-based cancer imaging for individuals with an increased risk of cancer.

Act 424 defines breast reconstruction surgery for insurance coverage purposes, requiring insurers to cover all stages of reconstruction following trauma, disease, or mastectomy, as well as reconstruction performed to reduce the risk of future breast disease.

Act 628 requires health plans to cover medically necessary treatment for diseases and conditions caused by severe obesity for adults, including bariatric surgery and related care. The law does not require coverage of injectable glucose-lowering drugs and other medications prescribed for weight loss.

U.S. Health Policy Changes

Several federal health policy changes scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026, will affect coverage affordability, eligibility, and healthcare delivery nationwide.

Changes to federal Health Insurance Marketplace rules will alter how premium tax credits function for some enrollees. The cap on premium tax credit repayments will be removed, increasing the amount that some individuals may be required to repay at tax time if their actual income exceeds projections used to determine subsidy eligibility. This change could increase financial risk for enrollees whose incomes fluctuate during the year.

Eligibility for premium tax credits will also narrow for lawfully present noncitizens. Beginning in January, premium tax credits will no longer be available to lawfully present noncitizens with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level who are ineligible for Medicaid due to immigration status, including lawful permanent residents subject to the five-year Medicaid waiting period for coverage eligibility.

Medicare-related changes will affect both enrollees and providers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will launch the Wasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction (WISeR) Model, a pilot program that introduces new prior authorization requirements in traditional Medicare. The WISeR Model is set to take effect in January in six states: New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, and Washington.

Beginning in 2026, Medicare will apply negotiated drug prices to the first group of Part D drugs selected under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The country has moved beyond hydrogen expansion and nuclear power research by adding up to 60,000,000 solar panels to blanket the country. This mega solar project will work in tandem with another renewable source to expand Australia’s total installed capacity and provide power for hydrogen production, mainly for exports. Find out more below.

Australia goes beyond hydrogen and nuclear power

Australia has made its climate targets exceptionally clear and has set the following targets:

2050 – achieve net-zero

2035 – lowering emissions by 62-70% compared to 2005 levels

2030 – decrease emissions by 43%

To achieve these targets, Australia has been focusing its dedication on renewable energy expansion. It has set goals complementary to its climate targets, such as achieving a green hydrogen capacity of 1 Mt by 2030 and expanding the capacity to 15 Mt by 2050. While some believe that Australia has dabbled in nuclear power, the country, in fact, doesn’t have any commercial nuclear power capacity.

The closest Australia comes to nuclear power is the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation’s research with the OPAL reactor and isotope production for medical applications. It is also an exporter of uranium. The country itself is more focused on its green hydrogen production, and to provide enough clean power, it has added up to 60,000,000 solar panels, among others.

Millions of solar panels blanketing the country

Western Australia becomes home to millions of solar panels to blanket the desert. A multi-phased renewable project will bring new life and clean energy to Western Australia’s Mirning traditional lands in the south-east. This multi-phased mega-project, known as the Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH), is ideally located to harness both the energies from the abundant sun and wind.

WGEH will focus on ammonia and green hydrogen production, powered primarily by solar power in tandem with wind power. According to the WGEH website, the hydrogen will be utilised for:

Clean power production

Shipping fuel supplies

Processing of minerals

Heavy transport

So far, an application for WGEH is being prepared to achieve status as a Commonwealth Major Project. Its “Concept Feasibility Study” has been completed. An in-depth environmental impact review is also underway.

Up to 60,000,000 panels and more

The scale of the WGEH project is mind-boggling. Up to 60,000,000 solar panels will cover between 15,000 and 20,000+ square kilometres across 35 PV farms. To supplement the massive solar production, the project will also consist of 3,000 wind turbines. The proposed project still has a long way to go regarding its planning and development, with construction reportedly to start only in 2029, depending on the final investment status.

In its first phase, the combined renewable power production will be up to 8 GW. Beyond substantial clean energy production, the WGEH project will also have the following advantages:

Indigenous partnership, with the Mirning community holding 10% equity and a permanent board seat

Creation of nearly 3,000 construction jobs and 400 permanent jobs

Increased support for local businesses

Regional industry development, including

desalination facilities, marine offloading facility, regional hubs

Low levels of habitat disruption

It has been six years since the project’s location was selected, and while some may not even live to see the mega-project in full operation status, as some believe it will take 30 years once construction starts, slow and steady does win the race. As stakeholders continue the battle to move the project’s status along, we believe that many look forward to the positive impact the mega-project will have locally and internationally, especially as it contributes to the global mission of achieving net-zero.

“Our air quality continues to improve thanks to tireless efforts by our dedicated staff, partners and a wide variety of stakeholders who have come together to implement sound environmental policies,” said Mike Abraczinskas, Director of the Division of Air Quality.

According to the report, statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have declined sharply from 1990 through 2022. Specifically, emissions fell:

95% for sulfur dioxide (SO2)

74 % for carbon monoxide (CO)

71% for nitrogen oxides (NOx)

48% for fine particles (PM2.5)

67% for volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Not surprisingly, North Carolina’s outdoor air quality has improved as emissions have fallen. Measured concentrations of those air pollutants have been below every federal health-based standard for more than a decade. Average concentrations of SO2, for example, are 95% below the federal standard; annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are 89% below the standard.

North Carolina’s transition away from coal for power generation has been a major driver of these changes. More of the state’s power now comes from clean sources such as solar, wind and nuclear energy. Energy efficiency improvements in homes and buildings also reduce emissions from power plants.

Cars, trucks and other vehicles on North Carolina roads also emit far less pollution than older vehicles, thanks to improved engine and fuel standards and more advanced emissions controls. From 1990 through 2022, CO, NOx, and VOC emissions have declined by 81%, 72% and 85%, respectively, from these on-road sources of air pollution. The state expects to see further reductions from the transportation sector in the coming years due to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles.

High concentrations of air pollutants can harm public and environmental health. Ground-level ozone (formed from VOCs and NOx) and fine particles can worsen asthma and contribute to heart and lung conditions. Pollutants such as SO2 are associated with haze and acid rain. Greenhouse gases contribute to climate change, and various hazardous air pollutants are known carcinogens. North Carolina has seen reductions in emissions of each of these classes of pollutants.

Some additional findings of the updated report:

The number of ozone exceedance days statewide continues to be low. From 2015-2024, North Carolina recorded just two days of “Code Red” or above for ozone in the state, compared to 83 such days from 2005-2014.

Visibility in our national and state parks has improved noticeably in the last three decades, due to reductions in emissions of SO2, NOx and other air pollutants that scatter light. For example, in 2023, visitors could see as far as 119 miles at Great Smoky Mountains National Park during an average clear day, compared with just 54 miles in 1996.

Net greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion have decreased by 38% from 2005 to 2020 due to both a shift in fuel use and increased energy efficiency. During this same period, North Carolina’s population and real Gross State Product grew by 20% and 23%, respectively.

From 1993-2022, combined emissions of federally designated Hazardous Air Pollutants and state-designated Toxic Air Pollutants have fallen by more than 108 million pounds, an 82% drop.",https://files.nc.gov/deq/FAVICON.png?VersionId=xRBsyAOxtvx0Q9TLN3ETIaKdsjhl2HsC,N,,2025-12-19 16:02:52.869670

“FERC required neither and has failed impacted communities in its Southgate decision.” Southgate has been a subject of debate since it was proposed in 2018.","A controversial proposed natural gas pipeline in North Carolina has passed the latest hurdle to move forward, receiving approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

FERC announced Thursday it has approved an amendment to change the route, pipe diameter and gas-carrying capacity for the Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate project. This means Southgate would extend the pipeline from Pittsylvania County, Virginia into Rockingham County, North Carolina.

Opponents to Southgate say the project needed a new application, not an amendment, because the pipeline’s proposed route, size and impact have changed drastically since FERC issued the original Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in 2020.

Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator at Appalachian Voices, said Southgate will harm Virginia and North Carolina waterways and communities.

“The project necessitated, at the very least, an environmental impact statement. Ideally, this totally revamped project should require a new application to fully consider its impacts,” Sims said. “FERC required neither and has failed impacted communities in its Southgate decision.”

Southgate has been a subject of debate since it was proposed in 2018. North Carolina’s DEQ denied a water quality permit for the project in 2020, NC Newsline previously reported.

The controversy has continued in recent months.

Earlier this year, environmental advocates mounted a challenge to the methane gas pipeline. In October, a FERC analysis found the project potentially redundant.

“Right now, people want to see lower electric bills and know their drinking water is safe,” said Steph Gans, assistant director at Clean Water for North Carolina. “This decision does the opposite; it will raise bills and pollute water.”

These concerns come about as a rival pipeline undergoes a permitting process at the same time. The Williams Companies expansion of their Transco pipelines, called the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, expects to receive a decision from FERC on a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in early February.

FERC’s October analysis said the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project could eliminate needs for Southgate, NC Newsline previously reported.

“We conclude the Transco System Alternative would be technically and economically feasible and practical,” FERC staff wrote in the document.

In the meantime, the North Carolina DEQ’s Division of Air Quality issued permit modifications for two compressor stations associated with the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project on Thursday.

Transco plans to upgrade two existing compressor stations along the pipeline — one in Mooresville and one in Lexington.

“The leading preference is that neither [pipeline is] built because of the level of emissions that they would bring, and that’s locking us into decades more of fossil fuel infrastructure,” Sims told NC Newsline. “Neither project serves the communities through which it passes.”

Shawn Day, a spokesperson for MVP Southgate, said the amended project is necessary to meet public demand for natural gas and its construction and operation will not have a significant environmental impact.

He pointed out that in the October environmental assessment, FERC’s “staff analysis here does not consider non-environmental aspects of the project objectives, such as supply diversity and other market issues, which could affect the ultimate viability of the system alternative.”

Representatives for FERC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“We look forward to securing all necessary authorizations to build this important project, to provide homes and businesses across North Carolina with the affordable, reliable and lower-carbon energy needed to power modern life,” Day wrote in an email.

Manufacturing today is hiring—and struggling to fill hundreds of thousands of open roles—despite modest job losses over the past year.

During Hurricane Helene, the Asheville bookstore and co-op Firestorm Books served as a community hub, where people dropped off and picked up supplies. But for almost a week after the storm, the shop could not provide the disaster relief work the staff really wanted to do. Although Firestorm had solar panels, the shop had no way to store that energy for a long period of time, leaving staff unable to offer critical services like refrigerating food or offering a powered space to the community after sunset.

“A lot of people were contributing and donating perishables, but we weren't really able to hold those because we didn't have operational generators,” said Libertie Valance, a Firestorm staff member. “People weren't able to charge power tools. There were a lot of people coordinating things like tree removal from around our space.”

The frustration of having solar panels they couldn't actually use during the blackout led the co-op to look for solutions. After Helene, they reached out to the Footprint Project, a nonprofit that works to build small-scale renewable energy projects in disaster-impacted communities. The organization donated an inverter and 20 kilowatt-hours of battery capacity, while Firestorm secured a zero-interest loan from the Appalachian Solar Finance Fund to complete the installation.

The store can now use power off-grid in case of an emergency.

“That will run our building for about 24 hours without the sun being out,” Valance said.

Devin Williams, a project manager for the Footprint Project, told BPR that this work is part of a larger mission to build disaster-resilient communities through small-scale renewable energy projects. The nonprofit is based in New Orleans and arrived in the region to assist with the response to Hurricane Helene.

“And then there was just a huge need,” Williams noted, describing the devastation in Western North Carolina, “and they opened up a wing in Asheville.”

That local presence has grown into a major state partnership. Footprint is now part of a project funded by the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality to support community resilience hubs, or “beehives”, throughout the region. The State Energy Office received $10.4 million from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for use over the next five years. Of that, $5 million is earmarked for this microgrid initiative, which will install up to 24 stationary systems at critical locations like a fire station in Burnsville.

Data Center Development Typically, data center developers build out DCFs in incremental phases where construction of a new source is accomplished in contemporaneous increments.","Virginia has emerged as the dominant data center market in the world, driven by exponential growth in data storage and processing demand associated with artificial intelligence and cloud computing. With that growth has come increased regulatory scrutiny, particularly with respect to air permitting for backup power systems.

Over the past year, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has issued several guidance and clarification memoranda addressing how existing air regulations apply to data center development and operation:

Clarification #2025-01

Clarification #2025-02

Clarification #2025-03

Guidance Memo APG-578

Although these documents do not have the force of regulation, they provide important insight into DEQ’s permitting and enforcement approach.

Regulation of Emergency Generators

As DEQ explains in Clarification #2025-01, many data centers rely on reciprocating internal combustion engine driven generators (gen-sets) for backup use in the event of a power outage. These gen-sets may be classified as “emergency” units under federal and Virginia air regulations, a classification that carries important regulatory and permitting consequences. Critically, however, the definition of “emergency” differs in meaningful ways between EPA’s federal framework and Virginia’s air regulations, and those differences are central to understanding DEQ’s recent guidance affecting data center development and operation.

At the federal level, EPA’s broader definition of emergency under the New Source Performance Standards focuses primarily on the unavailability of the primary power source.[1] In Virginia, an emergency is more narrowly defined as “a condition that arises from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events where the primary energy or power source is disrupted or disconnected due to conditions beyond the control of an owner of a source” and, relevant here, includes a “failure of the electric grid.”[2] Previously, DEQ took the position that an energy provider’s scheduled power outage did not constitute an “emergency” because sources would have advance notice; therefore, the outage would not be “sudden and reasonably unforeseeable.” This interpretation created practical challenges for data centers that are interconnected with utilities or power plants and rely on generators during known or coordinated outages, even where those generators are serving a traditional backup function.

When a Planned Outage Can be an “Emergency”

Against this backdrop, DEQ issued Guidance Memo APG-578 on September 30, 2025, to revise the meaning of “sudden and reasonably unforeseeable” within the context of scheduled power outages “when they are beyond the control of a [source].” As a result, DEQ will “allow the use of emergency generators for a planned outage if a source is notified about the event within fourteen (14) calendar days or less” and satisfies several additional requirements.

It is important to note that not every planned power outage will constitute an emergency. According to Guidance Memo APG-578, DEQ will assess each situation based on the totality of the circumstances. Therefore, data centers should consider taking the following proactive steps so that, in the case of a planned power outage, their actions satisfy DEQ’s requirements for the agency to find that the circumstances constitute an “emergency.”

Implement monitoring and reporting processes for emergency generator use. Sources must be able to articulate, with supporting documentation, that emergency generator use is necessary in a particular circumstance. Additionally, permitted sources are obligated to communicate estimated and actual operation and fuel combustion data. This may be complicated depending on the size of the source and the number of emergency generators being operated. Sources should develop monitoring and reporting processes that streamline this process to allow for uncomplicated communication.

Develop an action plan for scheduled power outages. Sources are expected to communicate a plan of action in the case of a planned power outage. According to DEQ guidance, sources should prepare to communicate at least 1) estimated time that emergency generators will run, 2) which generators the permittee plans to use, and 3) the proposed generator’s rates of electrical capacity. Sources should proactively develop plans tailored to different situations. This will prepare sources for potential outages and facilitate prompt communication with DEQ.

Data Center Air Permit Guidelines

On January 17, 2025, DEQ issued Clarification #2025-02 to provide clarification regarding the implementation of certain air permit regulations for data center stationary sources. Notably, this memo provided clarification regarding multiple data center facilities (DCF) and data center development, among other issues.

Multiple Data Center Facilities

DEQ has faced various complexities related to siting data centers, especially when a new data center facility is developed in close proximity to one or more existing or proposed data center facilities. In this case, DEQ must determine whether the proposed pattern of development constitutes separate stationary sources (requiring individual permits for each data center) or a single stationary source (requiring only a single permit). Under both Virginia and EPA regulations, data centers must be aggregated into a single stationary source when emitting activities are under common control, within the same industrial category, and located on properties either contiguous or adjacent to one another. Neither Virginia nor EPA has established a specific distance to make data center properties “adjacent” for the purpose of single-source determinations. Previous DEQ guidance suggests that adjacency determinations should be conducted on a case-by-case basis based on “the common sense notion of a plant” and consideration of the physical distance between property boundaries.

Clarification #2025-02 affirmed these general principles and provided more concrete benchmarks for determining whether properties are adjacent. DEQ provided the following benchmarks (based on property boundaries):

Multiple DCFs separated by 0.25 miles or greater are generally not adjacent.

Multiple DCFs separated by less than 0.25 miles but greater than 0.125 miles require consideration based on the “common sense notion of a plant” on a case-by-case basis.

Multiple DCFs separated by less than 0.125 miles are generally adjacent.

Regarding past decisions, the memo states that DEQ does not intend to revisit past adjacency determinations based solely on the new guidance, but it may reevaluate them if circumstances subsequently change, to include property boundary adjustments and ownership transfers.

Data Center Development

Typically, data center developers build out DCFs in incremental phases where construction of a new source is accomplished in contemporaneous increments. These increments may be aggregated for determining certain regulatory requirements, including permitting applicability. For Virgina’s minor new source review program, a period of five years is utilized when determining if incremental changes are contemporaneous.[3]

Construction Activities Before a Permit

New Minor Source Review Air Permit Regulations prohibit the actual construction or operation of any new stationary source or relevant project without first obtaining an air permit.[4] The regulations define “begin actual construction” as the “initiation of permanent physical on-site construction of an emissions unit.” In Clarification #2025-03, DEQ clarifies that the following activities do not fall within the definition of “begin actual construction” and therefore are permitted before obtaining an air permit:

Certain site preparation work such as grading.

Storing and staging equipment on proposed construction sites in the absence construction activities that are integral to the emission unit (g., installing foundations, constructing permanent structures, running electrical wiring, laying underground pipework, etc.).

Construction on aspects of a project that will not support or house emissions units, such as buildings that will house servers or other computer equipment, provided those buildings do not contain backup or emergency generators requiring an air permit.

DEQ has stated that compliance determinations in this context are typically based on observable on-site conditions. As a result, while certain preparatory and non-emissions-unit construction activities may proceed prior to permit issuance, developers must take care to avoid construction activity that could be viewed as permanent and integral to an emissions unit before the required air permit is obtained.

Practical Takeaways for Data Center Owners and Developers

It is critical for data centers to maintain reliable and uninterrupted power, especially in light of growing use and dependence on AI, and the strict requirements under many data center leases and service agreements. Recent DEQ guidance provides insight on how it intends to apply existing air regulations related to the development and operation of data centers. Going forward, data centers should:

Engage DEQ regional air staff early in project planning to confirm permitting pathways and reduce the risk of delays.

Build an outage response process that tracks Guidance Memo APG-578’s notice, documentation, and reporting steps.

Consider DEQ’s adjacency distance ranges when siting multiple DCFs to determine whether it is treated as a single stationary source.

Model emissions over the contemplated development window, recognizing that phased construction within a roughly five-year window may be aggregated for minor new source review purposes.

Consider how the foregoing could affect existing real estate documents such as leases, service agreements, and construction contracts, particularly as it relates to the definition of an “emergency” under force majeure clauses, the remedies available to tenants, and whether a property transfer could trigger an adjacency reevaluation.

Sequence construction properly to avoid inadvertently beginning actual construction before a permit is issued.

The process uses the existing interconnection rights and infrastructure when generating electricity, eliminating the years-long approval process for constructing new U.S. power facilities.

Kopzhanov explains the technique in an on-demand educational webinar, Unlocking Surplus Interconnection Service. Colocating Renewable and Thermal Power Plants, hosted by the IEEE Power & Energy Society. The webinar is available to the public for a fee.

Kopzhanov has been involved with several recent generator replacement interconnection installations. In May the Sherco Solar project in Sherburne County, Minn., replaced a retiring coal plant with approximately 720 megawatts of solar-powered generators, making it the largest solar-generating facility in the region. The first 460 MW of capacity is expected to be operational soon.

Another new project, developed with Middle River, is a battery system installed in April at California’s Hanford Hybrid Energy Center, a natural gas reliability facility. It used existing and incremental interconnection capacity to add the storage system. The surplus renewable energy from the batteries will be used during peak times to reduce the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to a Silicon Valley Clean Energy article about the installation.

“These projects are uniquely positioned to be colocated with existing power plants,” Kopzhanov says. “But, at the same time, they are renewable and sustainable sources of power—which is also helping to decarbonize the environment and meet the emission-reduction goals of the state.”

Influenced by Kazakhstan’s power industry

Born and raised in Taraz, Kazakhstan, Kopzhanov was surrounded by relatives who worked in the power industry. It’s not surprising that he has pursued a career in the field.

Until 1991, when the country was still a Soviet republic, most Kazakhs were required to help build the country’s power and transmission systems, he says. His mother and father are chemical engineers, and his grandfather was involved in the power industry. They told him about how they designed the transformers and overhead power lines. From a young age, he knew he wanted to be an engineer too, he says.

Today the Central Asian country is a major producer of oil, gas, and coal.

Kopzhanov left Kazakhstan in 2008 to pursue a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at Purdue University, in West Lafayette, Ind.

After graduating in 2012, he was hired as an electrical design engineer by Fluor Corp. in Farnborough, England. He oversaw the development of a master plan for a power project there. He also engineered and designed high-voltage switchgears, substations, and transformers.

“Every power plant has its own interconnection rights but, amazingly, most are not fully utilizing them.”

In 2015 he joined ExxonMobil in Houston, working as a project manager. During his six years there, he held managerial positions. Eventually, he was promoted to asset advisor and was responsible for evaluating the feasibility of investing in decarbonization and electrification projects by identifying their risks and opportunities.

He decided he wanted to learn more about the business aspects of running a company, so he left in 2021 to pursue an MBA at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, in Bloomington. During his MBA program, he briefly worked as a consultant for a lithium-ion manufacturing firm, offering advice on the viability of their proposed projects and investments.

“Engineers aren’t typically connected to the business world,” he says, “but having an understanding of what the needs are and tailoring your future goals toward that is extremely important. In my view, that’s how you’ll become a great technical expert. I definitely recommend that engineers have some kind of understanding of the business side.”

He joined Middle River shortly after graduating from Indiana with his MBA in 2023.

The power of membership

Kopzhanov was introduced to IEEE by a colleague at ExxonMobil after he asked the member about an IEEE plaque displayed on his desk. The coworker explained the activities he was involved in, as well as the process for joining. Kopzhanov became a member in 2019, left, and then rejoined in 2023.

“That was one of the best decisions I have made,” he says.

A member of the IEEE Power & Energy Society, he says its publications, webinars, conferences, and networking events keep him current on new developments.

“Being able to follow what’s happening in the industry, especially in the space where you’re working, is something that has benefited me a lot,” he says.

An active IEEE volunteer, he is the founding chair of the Power & Energy Society’s Chicago chapter, which has about 400 members. He is on the chapter’s executive committee, and he helps organize conferences, update the website, and review research papers.

“It’s those little things that have a significant impact,” he says. “Volunteering is a key piece of belonging to IEEE.”",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-man-dressed-in-a-long-sleeve-black-shirt-and-jeans-wearing-a-yellow-fluorescent-jacket-and-sunglasses-stands-in-front-of-a-sol.jpg?id=62609741&width=600,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:30.897178

For the financial community, the Summit and World Nuclear Symposium provide an unparalleled stocktake of the opportunities across the global nuclear value chain.","Nuclear energy had a prime spot at Abu Dhabi Finance Week, underscoring its pivotal role in the evolving global energy and finance landscape. World Nuclear Association's Director General, Dr Sama Bilbao y León, represented and advocated for the nuclear industry to a senior finance and business audience at a standing-room-only CNBC’s New Energy Finance event, and contributed to several private roundtables and conversations.

The discussion, ""Reality of Renewables in an AI World,"" moderated by Steve Sedgwick, featured Dr Bilbao y León alongside Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer of Masdar. The central theme explored how the explosive growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming energy and infrastructure, necessitating a massive reallocation of capital to build the power and data centre capacity to sustain it.

The AI Energy Surge and the Grid Challenge

The consensus was clear: the surge in AI-driven electricity demand has crystallized and brought forward existing energy problems, including grid overload, utility bill affordability, and the fundamental need for ""clean joules."" The world requires substantially more clean energy to grow in an economically sustainable way.

Dr Bilbao y León stressed that the demand isn't just AI; the entire industrial economy needs reliable decarbonization, which nuclear energy is uniquely positioned to offer.

> Grid Overload and Affordability: Strong energy demand growth, 3-4% per annum or higher, is a relatively new challenge for advanced markets but a persistent issue in developing economies.

> Insufficient Existing Solutions: Current policies are heavily reliant on renewable energy (RE), which cannot alone solve the complex challenge of providing a reliable and clean grid, affordable utility bills, and economic development simultaneously.

> Nuclear's Intrinsic Value: Nuclear is experiencing a resurgence because of its core attributes—reliability, longevity, energy density, and its role in the clean energy transition. This leads to crucial second-order benefits like attracting energy-intensive industrial investments, and low land usage and protection of ecosystems. In addition, nuclear energy also helps attaining several policy and societal goals at once, from affordability and access, to lowering emissions and energy security.

Beyond Silver Bullets: Building the Full Clean Energy Toolbox

Dr Bilbao y León asserted that meeting the demand for affordable, 24/7 clean energy to fuel the AI era and global prosperity is a formidable equation. A complex equation that does not have a unique simple solution that fits all.

AI growth, much like economic growth, cannot be powered by renewables and grid-scale storage alone. The challenge is far bigger: it requires us to think in terms of the entire system. Yes, we will need vast amounts of new generation, but that is only one piece of the puzzle. Equally critical is the enormous investment required to modernize and expand the electric grid — an essential backbone of our economy that has been neglected for decades.

At the same time, we must look beyond hardware to the markets that drive the system. Across jurisdictions, work is underway to design market structures that properly value every element of a resilient, low-carbon energy mix: generation, capacity, 24/7 availability, inertia, voltage, frequency, stability, reliability, resilience, and of course carbon reduction. These signals are vital — they incentivize long-term planning and investment not only by utilities, but also by large energy users, ultimately ensuring affordable power for households and businesses alike.

For policymakers, the task is clear: consider the system in its entirety. Develop policies and industrial strategies that send unmistakable signals to the private sector and lay out a credible long-term roadmap. With that foundation, financiers and industry leaders can step forward with confidence, seizing what is, in truth, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build a clean energy system that is resilient, future-proof, and ready to power the AI revolution.

We must acknowledge that there is no single silver bullet for the energy challenge — every tool in the toolbox has a vital role to play. Among them, nuclear power already stands as a proven pillar of reliable, carbon-free electricity. Yet to truly meet the demands of a clean, resilient future, the world will need far more nuclear capacity than what exists today.

Crucially, hyperscalers (large tech companies), operating on a global model, are increasingly interested in nuclear because reactors provide scale to deliver their full economic benefits. They are seeking long-term power availability and grid reliability, evidenced by efficient and promising nuclear partnerships in the US. These tech giants are adopting ""fleet views,"" and making investments that reflect a long-term economic commitment to nuclear power.

World Nuclear Association advocates to move away from incrementalism to scaled nuclear, including both large reactors and innovations like Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and Advanced Reactors (ARs).

National Strategies and the Financial Shift

The discussion moved to national strategies, where the Association highlighted the intersection of economic growth and energy security.

Nuclear partnerships are built to last for decades—possibly even 100 years—offering a compounding benefit as host countries develop nuclear skills and supply chain capacities. This ensures that countries can continue to build and rely on their domestic capabilities and resources to provide reliable, clean power at scale.

Nuclear energy costs are de-correlated from fossil fuel cycles and weather patterns, offering a powerful engine for sustained economic growth without commodity volatility.

We need to demystify nuclear and challenge the notion that nuclear projects are currently too challenging or are the eminent domain of government or that we need NOAK projects before mainstream finance can participate. Dr Bilbao y León argued there is nothing inherently unique in nuclear projects that make them infinitely more difficult to finance or execute than other types. Like any other class of complex capital-intensive infrastructure with high initial investment, long lifecycles, and a positive social and economic development not just because of the energy it generates but also through the jobs it creates and sustains, it is necessary to strike a balance between government instruments and market support.

Building massive, capital-intensive infrastructure with intangible social value is nothing new — and the financial community has long mastered the art of structuring win‑win partnerships to make it happen. Nuclear projects face the same challenges as any other large-scale development: market risk, construction risk, and the hurdle of securing initial funding. These are real risks, but they are not “nuclear risks.”

2025: The Year of Nuclear Finance

The finance sector's commitment to nuclear reached a new level in 2025:

> World Bank Policy Shift: The Association hailed a ""momentous shift"" as the World Bank's changed its lending policies allowing financing for nuclear energy projects, including new developments, securing operating extensions for existing reactors, and grid upgrades. This is a strong signal for other multilateral development banks and the global finance community, and it supports the estimated $150 billion annual investment opportunity required to meet the 2050 tripling goal.

> Africa Energy Week (AEW 2025): Nuclear was positioned as central to unlocking long-term capital for Africa's clean energy transition, with bold statements from both governments and various African development banks and a focus on strong governance and public-private partnerships.

> Asia Development Bank Shift: The multilateral development bank has amended its energy policy, paving the way for it to support developing member countries that choose to pursue nuclear power. Across Asia there are more than 300 reactors under construction, planned and proposed.

> COP30 in Belém: World Nuclear Association announced the expansion of its coalition supporting the tripling of global nuclear energy capacity by 2050, with new financial institutions like Stifel and CIBC joining the Financial Institutions Statement of Support.

To achieve financial readiness, investors need to understand and be comfortable with the benefits, costs, and risks of nuclear projects, and how these flow through the life cycle of the asset. The best way to achieve this is through revenue and finance models that help capture, monetize, and allocate these elements (well-known and fact-based, systemic benefits, costs, and risks) and shows how risks and returns change over time.

To address some of the lack of clarity and understanding around financing nuclear, World Nuclear Association is focusing on the ""financing supply chain,"" launching the Financing Nuclear Briefing Series (FNBS) to improve knowledge and dialogue among governments, multilateral development banks, financiers, and the nuclear industry. The aim is to ensure competitive nuclear projects achieve a timely Final Investment Decision (FID).

Strengthening the Bonds between Finance and Nuclear

As the industry looks ahead to 2026, the focus remains on deepening financial and nuclear engagement, including developing an Investment Guide, co-created by the nuclear and financial communities, which we hope will further deepen collaboration and – ultimately - investment in the scaled nuclear solutions required for the future.

World Nuclear Association’s regular Financing Nuclear Briefing Series will continue to be a major forum for these high-level conversations and another way for the Association to support our members as they navigate the evolving nuclear finance landscape.

In 2026, the Association will once again host the Finance Summit at its unique, global annual gathering of the nuclear industry: World Nuclear Symposium, taking place in London from 9-11 September.

On Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders called for a nationwide halt to data center construction until regulations are put in place.
More data centers = lots more transmission fights.
Only one factor distinguishes data center fights from renewable energy fights: building the former potentially raises energy bills, while the latter will lower energy costs.
Rural counties are already enacting moratoria on solar and wind in tandem with data centers – this is not new.","It’s now clear that 2026 will be big for American energy, but it’s going to be incredibly tense.

Over the past 365 days, we at The Fight have closely monitored numerous conflicts over siting and permitting for renewable energy and battery storage projects. As we’ve done so, the data center boom has come into full view, igniting a tinderbox of resentment over land use, local governance and, well, lots more. The future of the U.S. economy and the energy grid may well ride on the outcomes of the very same city council and board of commissioners meetings I’ve been reporting on every day. It’s a scary yet exciting prospect.

To bring us into the new year, I wanted to try something a little different. Readers ask me all the time for advice with questions like, What should I be thinking about right now? And, How do I get this community to support my project? Or my favorite: When will people finally just shut up and let us build things? To try and answer these questions and more, I wanted to give you the top five trends in energy development (and data centers) I’ll be watching next year.

1. The AI data center backlash is growing faster than you thought.

The best thing going for American renewable energy right now is the AI data center boom. But the backlash against developing these projects is spreading incredibly fast.

Do you remember last week when I told you about a national environmental group calling for data center moratoria across the country? On Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders called for a nationwide halt to data center construction until regulations are put in place. The next day, the Working Families Party – a progressive third party that fields candidates all over the country for all levels of government – called for its candidates to run in opposition to new data center construction.

On the other end of the political spectrum, major figures in the American right wing have become AI skeptics critical of the nascent data center buildout, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. These figures are clearly following the signals amidst the noise; I have watched in recent months as anti-data center fervor has spread across Facebook, with local community pages and groups once focused on solar and wind projects pivoting instead to focus on data centers in development near them.

In other words, I predicted just one month ago, an anti-data center political movement is forming across the country and quickly gaining steam (ironically aided by the internet and algorithms powered by server farms).

2. More data centers = lots more transmission fights.

I often hear from the clean energy sector that the data center boom will be a boon for new projects. Renewable energy is the fastest to scale and construct, the thinking goes, and therefore will be the quickest, easiest, and most cost effective way to meet the projected spike in energy demand.

I’m not convinced yet that this line of thinking is correct. But I’m definitely sure that no matter the fuel type, we can expect a lot more transmission development, and nothing sparks a land use fight more easily than new wires.

Past is prologue here. One must look no further than the years-long fight over the Piedmont Reliability Project, a proposed line that would connect a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania to data centers in Virginia by crossing a large swathe of Maryland agricultural land. I’ve been covering it closely since we put the project in our inaugural list of the most at-risk projects, and the conflict is now a clear blueprint.

In Wisconsin, a billion-dollar transmission project is proving this thesis true. I highly recommend readers pay close attention to Port Washington, where the release of fresh transmission line routes for a massive new data center this week has aided an effort to recall the city’s mayor for supporting the project. And this isn’t even an interstate project like Piedmont.

3. The data center backlash is coming for renewable energy.

While I may not be sure of the renewable energy sector’s longer-term benefits from data center development, I’m far more confident that this Big Tech land use backlash is hitting projects right now.

The short-term issue for renewables developers is that opponents of data centers use arguments and tactics similar to those deployed by anti-solar and anti-wind advocates. Everyone fighting data centers is talking about ending development on farmland, avoiding changes to property values, stopping excess noise and water use, and halting irreparable changes to their ways of life.

Only one factor distinguishes data center fights from renewable energy fights: building the former potentially raises energy bills, while the latter will lower energy costs.

I do fear that as data center fights intensify nationwide, communities will not ban or hyper-regulate the server farms in particular, but rather will pass general bans that also block the energy projects that could potentially power them. Rural counties are already enacting moratoria on solar and wind in tandem with data centers – this is not new. But the problem will worsen as conflicts spread, and it will be incumbent upon the myriad environmentalists boosting data center opponents to not accidentally aid those fighting zero-carbon energy.

4. Trump will start slowly approving renewables.

This week, the Bureau of Land Management approved its first solar project in months: the Libra facility in Nevada. When this happened, I received a flood of enthusiastic and optimistic emails and texts from sources.

We do not yet know whether the Libra approval is a signal of a thaw inside the Trump administration. The Interior Department’s freeze on renewables permitting decisions continues mostly unabated, and I have seen nothing to indicate that more decisions like this are coming down the pike. What we do know is that ahead of a difficult midterm election, the Trump administration faces outsized pressure to do more to address “affordability,” Democrats plan to go after Republicans for effectively repealing the Inflation Reduction Act and halting permits for solar and wind projects, and there’s a grand bargain to be made in Congress over permitting reform that rides on an end to the permitting freeze.

I anticipate that ahead of the election and further permitting talks in Congress, the Trump administration will mildly ease its chokehold on solar and wind permits because that is the most logical option in front of them. I do not think this will change the circumstances for more than a small handful of projects sited on federal lands that were already deep in the permitting process when Trump took power.

5. Battery fire fears continue to spread after Moss Landing.

It’s impossible to conclude a conversation about next year’s project fights without ending on the theme that defined 2025: battery fire fears are ablaze, and they’ll only intensify as data centers demand excess energy storage capacity.

The January Moss Landing fire incident was a defining moment for an energy sector struggling to grapple with the effects of the Internet age. Despite bearing little resemblance to the litany of BESS proposals across the country, that one hunk of burning battery wreckage in California inspired countless communities nationwide to ban new battery storage outright.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjYwNDMyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDc3MTExNn0.-Kfl9GMkRehgQAV-dfIJuJYPzWbFcJusbz9hIEI1SoM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-12-19 16:02:16.930472

“Load growth is accelerating, driven by data centers, transportation demand, and industrial expansion.
The report, published Monday, precedes a “mitigation” planning process to be undertaken by the Illinois Power Agency.
Illinois has provided tax incentives for data centers since Pritzker signed bipartisan legislation in 2019.
According to the state’s 2024 report, 27 data centers had received incentives totaling $983 million in tax breaks and benefits.","Illinois’ electric grids may soon face power shortages and further price increases as fossil fuel plants go offline and data centers fueling the rise of artificial intelligence demand ever-increasing amounts of power.

That’s the conclusion of a new report by three state agencies that foreshadows an upcoming state grid planning process and a potential legislative fight on how lawmakers will regulate power-hungry data centers, if at all.

The projected shortfalls would begin in the Commonwealth Edison service territory in northern Illinois by 2029 and in the Ameren service area that covers most of downstate Illinois by 2031. They’d continue to worsen and make Illinois more reliant on energy imports without action by state policymakers or grid operators.

“The challenges emerge from a combination of factors at the regional and national scale,” the report noted. “Load growth is accelerating, driven by data centers, transportation demand, and industrial expansion. At the same time, many coal, gas, and oil units are planned to retire across both RTOs (regional transmission organizations) due to age, economics, and emissions limits.”

The warning from the Illinois Power Agency, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Commerce Commission came the same week that prices once again rose at a procurement event in the area that serves northern Illinois consumers.

Read the report: 2025 Resource Adequacy Study.

Advocates behind recent renewable energy reforms and the governor who says he will sign them argue the report’s findings prove that a plan passed by lawmakers in October was essential to avoiding a potential crisis.

“The state set up a deliberate process to address findings from this resource adequacy study and ensure Illinois continues to lead the country in delivering a clean, reliable, affordable energy future for all,” Gov. JB Pritzker’s office said in a statement.

Critics, including the state’s manufacturers, say the report makes clear that Illinois’ decarbonization policies were overly ambitious.

“We didn’t need a 222-page report to tell us what we already know — Illinois is facing an energy crisis resulting from the forced closure of dispatchable baseload generation and growing demand,” Mark Denzler, president & CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, said in a statement.

Grid planning and capacity

Warnings of the potential shortfall were contained in the most recent resource adequacy report that state regulators are required to file under the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA, energy overhaul passed in 2021. The report, published Monday, precedes a “mitigation” planning process to be undertaken by the Illinois Power Agency.

One of the marquee measures in CEJA called for taking all of the state’s fossil fuel generators offline by 2045, but the plan also created the less-heralded resource adequacy process to assess whether that timeline is feasible.

While the resource adequacy report didn’t specifically call for walking back CEJA’s mandatory 2045 fossil fuel plant closure timeline, that possibility could be considered as regulators prepare the mitigation plan and embark on another major grid planning process in 2026.

But even if Illinois delays closure dates, it’s going to need new generators, the report noted.

Another measure the governor has pledged to sign, the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, aims to add battery generation to the grid while creating other energy efficiency and planning processes.

CRGA — Illinois’ third major energy and decarbonization bill passed since 2016 — requires the Illinois Commerce Commission to conduct an integrated resource planning process in 2026. The report noted the goal is to “provide a more comprehensive venue for addressing many of the foundational issues” in grid reliability.

“While this study underscores serious challenges, Illinois has already taken steps to address resource adequacy — a problem the entire country is facing,” Solar Powers Illinois, an advocacy group for the state’s solar industry that backed CRGA, said in a statement. The group added that integrated resource planning will be a “a transparent, data-driven process to evaluate supply and demand, identify risks, and secure cost-effective solutions.”

Problems go beyond Illinois

While Illinois will begin that planning effort next year, the issues facing the state’s grids are not unique. The two multistate, federally regulated regional transmission organizations that serve Illinois — PJM Interconnection in northern Illinois and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator everywhere else — face their own challenges with out-of-state plant closures and growing load demands.

At any rate, the report noted, if the grid can’t replace retiring resources in a timely fashion, it would increase grid strain and lead to higher prices at capacity auctions, a cost that would be borne by consumers.

“If regional markets remain short, Illinois will face persistent high capacity prices even if it builds new resources in-state,” the report noted.

PJM serves 67 million customers in 13 states and Washington, D.C., including 4.2 million Commonwealth Edison customers in northern Illinois, making it the largest grid operator in the U.S.

On Wednesday, it announced the results of its most recent auction for “capacity,” which describes payments ratepayers make to power generators to ensure grid reliability. Capacity charges make up roughly 20% of a monthly power bill.

The price per megawatt-day at the most recent PJM auction hit a record of $333.44 for 2027-28, up $4.27 from the previous year but still 11.5 times higher than just three years prior.

The Citizens Utility Board, an Illinois consumer advocacy group, said the news shows the capacity market “is breaking under the weight of data center demand and a dysfunctional interconnection queue.”

PJM’s interconnection queue largely dictates how quickly new generators can come online, and advocates and the governor have long called for reforms. The report noted it has improved since PJM created new processes in 2023.

But it still takes five to seven years to get gas turbines online, while siting and permitting can also cause delays. The report also noted supply chain disruptions, tariffs, and domestic content requirements for tax credit eligibility could also delay wind and solar coming online.

“Without real reforms, in just a few years 67 million electric customers in the PJM footprint could face rolling blackouts and an escalation of power bills that make the current price spikes seem tame,” Moskowitz said in a statement.

Report's recommendations

As fossil fuel plants in Illinois go offline due to CEJA’s mandates, it could make the state reliant on importing energy from other zones within the regional transmission organizations — even as the RTOs themselves face shortfalls.

Because of that, the state will need new generation “even if Illinois retains a portion of its existing thermal fleet.” To address the potential shortages, Illinois must employ a “diversified resource strategy,” according to the report.

“This includes combining continued growth of new in-state wind and solar supported by IPA procurements and programs, greater use of existing and planned transmission to import power from MISO and PJM when available, and the continued use of fueled thermal generators as reliability assets even as their energy output declines with higher renewable penetration,” the report noted.

Other potential resources cited in the report include “green hydrogen,” nuclear fission reactors, utility-scale solar, onshore wind and four-hour lithium-ion batteries.

The CRGA, which passed the state legislature in October and the governor said he will sign, creates a new incentive structure for energy storage projects similar to how the state funds renewable developments like wind and solar power.

Data centers and advocate response

The advocates behind CRGA say it was passed in large part because lawmakers understood the trends that were outlined in this week’s report. But renewable energy advocates like the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and consumer advocates like the CUB say it’s just as essential to regulate power-hungry data centers.

“The next critical step is to pass commonsense guardrails for data centers — the primary driver of the unprecedented energy demand that is saddling Illinois consumers with rising utility bills while dirty energy companies make record profits,” the Clean Jobs Coalition said in a statement.

The influential coalition, which includes union, faith and environmental groups, said it will work with lawmakers “to ensure data center developers, not Illinois consumers, pay for the disproportionate energy burden big tech is bringing to our power grid.”

Pritzker’s office didn’t directly respond to questions about what data center regulations, if any, the governor and lawmakers will consider in the spring.

Illinois has provided tax incentives for data centers since Pritzker signed bipartisan legislation in 2019. According to the state’s 2024 report, 27 data centers had received incentives totaling $983 million in tax breaks and benefits.

The National Resources Defense Council estimated data centers will drive up costs for PJM consumers by another $163 billion through 2033 and increase monthly bills by about $70 by 2028.

The Citizens Utility Board called on PJM to clean up its interconnection queue while urging states to force data centers to reduce operations or use on-site backup battery systems when electricity is in high demand. Advocates also called for the renewal of a proposal requiring data centers to power themselves with renewable energy, which stalled in the spring.

“Data center companies are among the wealthiest in the world, and it is simply unconscionable that customers should pay unbearably high power costs to foot the bill for data center energy guzzling,” Moskowitz said.

The Manufacturers’ Association have long called for a repeal of CEJA’s closure date to reduce uncertainty. The group called for an “all-of-the-above” approach that includes keeping fossil duels online.

“If skyrocketing power bills were not warning enough, this new report is a flashing red sign that Illinois needs to act immediately,” Denzler said in a statement. “With electricity demand only expected to increase, we simply cannot risk the chaos that would be caused by the premature closure of baseload generation plants as required under current law.”

That is why the Upper Basin states have put forward serious measures to stabilize the river, including significant commitments to water conservation.","On a cold winter morning in 1922, the delegates who negotiated the original Colorado River Compact left their respective capitals for Bishop’s Lodge just outside Santa Fe. Gathered in a room, they pored over maps and hydrologic data in an effort to craft an agreement that would keep the American West growing and end the perpetual fighting surrounding the river’s use.

They knew the stakes: The river tied the region together, but the water that flowed through it had already been promised to more people than it could sustain. People relied on the river to build their lives, but the water was not always reliable.

A century later, the Colorado River is even more important to the surrounding region — but the demands on it are greater, too. More than 40 million people rely on this river. Families, farms, tribes and cities depend on it for the water security that drives their communities and economies — as do the fish, wildlife and ecosystems that call it home.

The river built the West — and the river will shape its future.

That is why the current round of negotiations for the Colorado River carries such weight. Just like that group gathered back in 1922 in Santa Fe, each of the seven Basin states has sent commissioners who understand the scale of the task before them. It’s no secret that their work is difficult and often thankless. We respect their efforts and want them to succeed.

As the senior senators from Utah and New Mexico, we both believe that the best outcome remains a seven-state agreement that keeps the system stable while respecting the law that governs it. Reaching that outcome requires understanding how the river functions in the places where it begins.

Our states sit in the part of the Basin where water use rises and falls with the river itself. Communities in the Upper Basin plan for the water that arrives, not the water they wish for. When there is less snowpack, water use falls. When streams shrink, fields and habitats dry. Families adjust, towns adapt and communities make do.

Recent commentary has overlooked that reality. Some officials have questioned the sincerity of Upper Basin proposals. Others have accused the Upper Basin states of taking “extreme” positions or refusing to make reductions. These arguments ignore our contributions. They distract from the legal framework that governs the Basin and from the hard, practical decisions required to reach a lasting agreement.

The path forward begins with the commitments states already made and Congress has already approved. It also includes managing the Colorado River within its actual limits, guided by obligations that are clear and enforceable.

The Upper Basin has met its delivery obligations under the 1922 Compact. The Upper Basin has used less water than the Lower Basin — not because its needs are smaller, but in part because hydrology forces that reality: when less water flows into the system, Upper Basin use typically declines. In contrast, the Lower Basin has typically drawn its full apportionment, even in dry years, while the Upper Basin has absorbed the risk of an unpredictable river.

That is why the Upper Basin states have put forward serious measures to stabilize the river, including significant commitments to water conservation. All seven states face rising demand, but for this negotiation, it is existential. Utah’s population is projected to double by 2065. New Mexico faces steep declines in its available water resources in the decades ahead. Families who will call these communities home have a direct stake in this negotiation. Any agreement must take their future into account.

Congress also has a central role to play. No investment in Basin infrastructure or conservation programs can move forward without congressional appropriations. And no agreement among states requiring additional authority can take effect without Congress’s approval. When Congress approved the original Compact, members believed it would avoid years of litigation and delay. We still believe that is true. We support a seven-state deal. We want a stable, reliable river system. We want to allow Basin states to plan for the future, instead of navigating crisis after crisis.

The commissioners now at the table have an extraordinarily difficult task, and they deserve the chance to succeed. Congress stands ready to do its part. If we approach this negotiation with respect for our neighbors, for the law, the river’s natural limits, and for the communities that depend on it, a fair agreement is within reach.

Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,'' said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill's chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

""Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,'' Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,"" said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. ""Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,'' said Jason Grumet, the group's CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment .... has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, ""we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill's co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure ""gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win'' on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,'' said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,"" Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy ... expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.""

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,"" said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,"" he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.

The company secured $700 million through a convertible senior notes offering in October 2025, oversubscribed by more than 7x, providing capital for White Mesa Mill Phase 2 expansion and Donald Project development with an effective pre-tax yield of just 2.1%.

Energy Fuels is actively producing separated neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, with commercial validation by major manufacturers including POSCO, and plans to commence commercial production of critical heavy rare earth oxides (dysprosium and terbium) by Q4 2026.

The company's asset base spans uranium mines in the US, heavy mineral sands projects in Australia, Madagascar, and Brazil, creating multiple pathways to production across complementary critical mineral commodities.

As of September 30, 2025, Energy Fuels maintained $298.5 million in working capital, with uranium production trending toward 2+ million pounds annually and substantial finished inventory across uranium, vanadium, and rare earth products.

Why Energy Fuels Merits Investor Attention

In an era defined by energy transition, national security concerns, and supply chain resilience, Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU, TSX: EFR) has positioned itself at the intersection of multiple strategic commodity themes. The Denver-based company represents one of the few vertically integrated critical minerals producers in North America, with operating assets spanning uranium production, rare earth element processing, and heavy mineral sands development.

The company's transformation goes beyond uranium production to become what management describes as ""a globally significant critical mineral company based in the US."" This evolution comes as Western governments actively seek to reduce dependence on Chinese rare earth supply chains and rebuild domestic uranium production capacity. What distinguishes Energy Fuels from exploration-stage competitors is its operational status, with the White Mesa Mill processing uranium-bearing materials for over four decades and recently adding commercial rare earth oxide separation capabilities.

Company Overview: A Diversified Critical Minerals Platform

Energy Fuels operates a portfolio spanning three primary commodity groups: uranium and vanadium, rare earth elements, and heavy mineral sands containing titanium and zirconium minerals. The operational foundation rests on the White Mesa Mill, which management characterizes as the only operating conventional uranium mill in the USA and the only US facility able to process monazite for rare earth oxide production.

Current uranium operations include two producing mines: the Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona, potentially the highest-grade uranium mine in US history, and the La Sal Complex in Utah, comprising several mines along an 11-mile trend. These operations generated sales of 240,000 pounds of U3O8 at a realized price of $72.38 per pound during the third quarter of 2025.

The development pipeline includes three large-scale uranium projects with combined resources approaching 70 million pounds: Sheep Mountain in Wyoming (fully permitted), Roca Honda in New Mexico (designated as a ""Fast-41 Covered Project"" by the Trump Administration), and Bullfrog in Utah (pre-permitting stage). The company also maintains the Nichols Ranch in-situ recovery operation in Wyoming on standby.

Strategic Rare Earth Initiative: Capturing Value in Critical Magnets

Energy Fuels' most transformative initiative involves rare earth elements, particularly magnetic rare earths essential for electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, and defense applications. The company's approach centers on processing monazite, a mineral concentrate containing 50-60% total rare earth oxides with higher concentrations of valuable neodymium, praseodymium, and heavy rare earths compared to other feedstocks.

The White Mesa Mill currently operates Phase 1A rare earth processing with capacity to handle up to 10,000 tonnes per annum of monazite, producing up to 1,000 tonnes annually of separated NdPr oxide. The company has achieved commercial validation, with the corporate presentation confirming qualification by POSCO and production of commercial-scale rare earth permanent magnets.

""Energy Fuels' White Mesa Mill is the only U.S. facility with the commercial capacity to process monazite for production of high-purity 'light' and 'heavy' REE oxides.""

The company is actively piloting separation of heavy rare earth oxides, having produced approximately 29 kilograms of dysprosium oxide at 99.9% purity through September 2025, with 1 kilogram of terbium oxide expected in December 2025. Management plans commercial US production of heavy REE oxides as early as Q4 2026 for dysprosium, terbium, and potentially samarium oxides. At October 31, 2025 pricing, NdPr oxide trades at $87,500 per tonne, dysprosium oxide at $850,000 per tonne in Europe, and terbium oxide at $3.6 million per tonne in Europe.

Phase 2 Expansion: Scaling Production Capacity

Energy Fuels' most significant near-term catalyst is the planned Phase 2 expansion of rare earth processing capacity at the White Mesa Mill. The company expects to release a feasibility study for this expansion before year-end 2025, detailing plans for dedicated monazite crack and leach circuits for simultaneous production of REE oxides plus U3O8.

The Phase 2 configuration targets annual production capacity of up to 6,000 tonnes of NdPr oxide, 275 tonnes of dysprosium oxide, 80 tonnes of terbium oxide, and potentially other rare earth oxides based on customer requirements. At current market prices, this production profile would generate approximately $986 million in annual revenue from rare earth oxides alone. The company has initiated permitting for Phase 2 with planned commissioning in 2028.

Financing for this expansion received a significant boost in October 2025 when Energy Fuels successfully closed a $700 million convertible senior notes offering, oversubscribed by more than 7x with favorable terms including a 0.75% annual coupon rate, 32.5% conversion premium ($20.34 per share), and capped call features effectively increasing the conversion price to $30.70 per share. The net proceeds of approximately $625 million are earmarked for White Mesa Mill Phase 2 expansion and Donald Project development.

Securing Monazite Feedstock: The Heavy Mineral Sands Strategy

Energy Fuels' rare earth production strategy relies on securing reliable supplies of monazite concentrate sourced as a byproduct from heavy mineral sands mining operations. The company emphasizes that importing high-grade monazite sand byproduct from HMS mines globally is a lower-cost way to produce separated REE oxides versus primary REE production.

The most advanced HMS-sourced monazite supply comes from the Donald Project in Australia, where Energy Fuels is earning up to a 49% joint venture interest with Astron Corporation while securing 100% of the monazite produced. The Donald Project has received conditional support of A$80 million in development financing from Export Finance Australia, with total project funding estimated at A$520 million. Management expects a final investment decision as early as Q1 2026 with potential monazite deliveries to White Mesa Mill by late 2027. The Donald Project is particularly valuable for its exceptional levels of heavy REE oxides, including dysprosium, terbium, and samarium.

Energy Fuels also controls the Toliara Project in Madagascar, considered one of the best HMS development opportunities globally with additional valuable REE monazite byproduct. The project features a 38-year mine life with significant expansion potential, though recent political unrest requires monitoring. An updated feasibility study is expected before year-end 2025.

The company's third HMS project, Bahia in Brazil, is 100%-owned with sonic drilling underway and a resource estimate expected in 2025. Bahia could potentially supply 3,000-5,000 tonnes per annum of monazite to White Mesa Mill for decades, translating to roughly 300-500 tonnes annually of NdPr oxide plus dysprosium and terbium. Energy Fuels also maintains a current offtake agreement with Chemours Company, expected to deliver 500-2,000+ tonnes per annum of monazite.

Uranium Business: Foundation of Cash Generation

While rare earth elements represent Energy Fuels' highest-growth opportunity, the uranium business provides near-term cash generation supporting company operations. The September 30, 2025 financial update shows uranium sales of 240,000 pounds at an average realized price of $72.38 per pound during Q3 2025, with contract deliveries of 300,000 pounds planned for full-year 2025, increasing to 620,000-880,000 pounds in 2026.

The Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona represents Energy Fuels' highest-grade uranium asset, with management expecting to mine over 2 million pounds of U3O8 in 2026 at costs of approximately $23-30 per pound. The presentation notes substantial potential growth in resources, suggesting multi-year production potential. The La Sal Complex in Utah is actively mining and shipping ore to the mill for processing and sale in 2025 and beyond.

Energy Fuels has secured four long-term uranium sales contracts featuring fixed and market price components, floors and ceilings, and inflation escalation, with deliveries scheduled from 2025 through 2030. The company emphasizes its status as a trusted partner for US nuclear utilities. Cost-of-goods sold on U3O8 sales should trend lower starting in Q1 2026 as low-cost Pinyon Plain ore is processed, suggesting improving margins ahead.

Financial Position & Operational Metrics

Energy Fuels entered the fourth quarter of 2025 from a position of financial strength, reporting $298.5 million in working capital as of September 30, 2025, before adding the approximately $625 million in net proceeds from the October convertible notes offering. Total assets reached $758.3 million as of quarter-end.

Inventory positions as of September 30 included 485,000 pounds of finished U3O8, 1.62 million pounds of uranium in stockpile and work-in-progress, 905,000 pounds of finished vanadium pentoxide, 37,000 kilograms of finished separated NdPr oxide, and 9,000 kilograms of finished high-purity, partially separated mixed rare earth elements. The company calculated its finished product inventory worth approximately $45.3 million at current commodity prices.

Operational guidance indicates uranium production trending toward 2+ million pounds U3O8 per year currently, with potential to scale to 4-6 million pounds annually as development projects advance. For Q4 2025, management expected contract sales of 160,000 pounds of U3O8 with potential for additional spot market sales.

Investment Thesis for Energy Fuels

Phase 2 expansion could deliver $986 million annual REE revenue by 2029 at current prices, with capital funding secured through October 2025 convertible notes offering.

Low-cost Pinyon Plain ore ($23-30/lb production cost) entering mill feed starting Q1 2026 should drive improving COGS against long-term contract prices with floors, ceilings, and inflation escalation through 2030.

Donald FID expected Q1 2026 and Toliara feasibility before year-end 2025 provide multiple pathways to secure 40,000+ tonnes annual monazite feedstock by late 2020s.

US-based rare earth separation and uranium production directly address Department of Defense supply chain priorities, creating potential for government offtake agreements or production incentives.

Combined $900+ million liquidity provides financial runway through multiple development phases without near-term dilution risk given capped call structure.

Exposure to uranium, magnetic rare earths, heavy rare earths, titanium, and zirconium reduces single-commodity price risk while capturing thematic premium across energy transition and defense manufacturing.

Energy Fuels presents a multifaceted investment case centered on domestic critical mineral production at a time of heightened policy support and structural supply chain reconfiguration. The company has successfully transitioned from uranium-only producer to diversified critical minerals platform while maintaining the financial resources to execute its development pipeline through the secured $700 million convertible debt financing.

The investment thesis rests on three pillars: near-term uranium cash generation at improving margins as low-cost Pinyon Plain ore flows through the mill; commercial rare earth oxide production scaling from 1,000 tonnes NdPr annually today to 6,000+ tonnes by 2028-2029, supplemented by high-value heavy rare earth production; and optionality on heavy mineral sands projects that could secure decades of monazite feedstock while generating additional revenue from titanium and zirconium products.

Investors should monitor several key catalysts in coming quarters: Phase 2 feasibility study release before year-end 2025, Donald FID and financing announcement in Q1 2026, Toliara feasibility study and FID timing, heavy rare earth commercial production commencement in Q4 2026, and uranium production trends as Pinyon Plain ramps toward 2+ million pounds annually. The stock's performance will likely track progress on these milestones alongside broader uranium and rare earth price trends, with particular sensitivity to any US government policy initiatives supporting domestic critical mineral supply chains.

TL;DR

Energy Fuels operates the only US facility producing both uranium and separated rare earth oxides, with $900+ million in liquidity to fund White Mesa Mill Phase 2 expansion (6,000 tpa NdPr capacity by 2028) and Donald HMS project development. Uranium production approaches 2 million pounds annually at improving margins, while rare earth business scales from current 1,000 tpa NdPr to add heavy rare earths (Dy/Tb) by Q4 2026. Three HMS projects (Donald, Toliara, Bahia) provide pathway to 40,000+ tpa monazite feedstock securing long-term rare earth production. Strong policy alignment with US government critical mineral supply chain priorities. Key near-term catalysts include Phase 2 feasibility (before YE 2025), Donald FID (Q1 2026), and heavy REE commercialization (Q4 2026).

The decision follows reports that Energy Transfer was planning to make the final investment decision on the Lake Charles LNG project by the end of this year. Lake Charles LNG was fully permitted, it was going to use existing infrastructure, and was expected to benefit from an abundant natural gas supply through existing connections to the Henry Hub and connectivity to Energy Transfer’s vast network of natural gas pipelines, the company said earlier this year.

On top of that, Energy Transfer had struck several offtake deals for future supply from Lake Charles, including with Chevron, which had committed to 3 million tons of LNG from the facility, and Japan’s Kyushu Electric Power Company, for 1 million tons of LNG.

However, Energy Transfer needed more partners to share the financial load with, as noted during its third-quarter earnings call. At the time, Energy Transfer said it was looking for buyers for up to 80% of the project’s equity before the final investment decision was made.

“We are in advanced discussions with MidOcean Energy related to its participation as a 30% equity owner of Lake Charles LNG with a commensurate percentage of LNG offtake,” co-chief executive Thomas Long reported during the company’s earnings call in early November. “We're in discussions with other parties for the remaining equity we intend to sell in order to reduce Energy Transfer's equity interest to 20%.”

The decision to drop the project reflects a growing fear in the industry that there is too much new LNG capacity coming in the near future, which would pressure prices and squeeze profitability. Energy Transfer was also challenged by rising costs, which is quite usual for LNG projects. Reuters quoted one unnamed source as saying that Energy Transfer’s management had also gotten nervous about venturing into a new space, LNG, when the company was, above all, a pipeline player.

It's the latest climate-related move by President Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, cut funding for climate research, and removed climate and weather scientists from their posts across the federal government. During his first term, Trump famously contradicted the nation's weather forecasting service by redrawing a Hurricane Dorian's path on a map with a Sharpie.

White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, in a post Tuesday on X, announced the plan to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, calling it ""one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country."" NCAR was founded more than six decades ago to provide universities with expertise and resources for collaborative research on global weather, water, and climate challenges.

Vought said the center was undergoing a ""comprehensive review"" and that any ""vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location.""

Antonio Busalacchi, who heads the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a nonprofit consortium of 129 U.S. universities that oversees the Boulder facility, told NPR he received no prior notice before the announcement and believes the decision ""is entirely political.""

NCAR's job is to study both climate and weather, and Busalacchi says the two cannot be understood separately. ""Our job is to state what the science is, and it's for others to interpret what the significance of that science is,"" he says. ""We're very careful not to cross over that line to advocacy or policy prescription.""

Plan faces a political backlash

Vought's announcement drew an immediate response from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, who said in a statement that if the White House goes ahead with the plan, ""public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.""

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includes Boulder, have suggested that the proposed NCAR closure amounts to political brinkmanship by the White House in response to Colorado's refusal to release Tina Peters. Peters, a former Mesa County clerk, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for illegally accessing voting machines after the 2020 election. A Republican, Peters was recently pardoned by Trump, a largely symbolic action since she has neither been charged nor convicted in federal court.

""The judgement is that this is very much about Tina Peters,"" Bennet told local media in Colorado. And that the president attempted to get his way through intimidation and he hasn't gotten his way and he is trying to punish Colorado as a result."" In a joint statement, Bennett, Neguse and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper called the administration's plan ""deeply dangerous and blatantly retaliatory.""

NPR reached out to Vought's Office of Management and Budget, but received no response. The White House press office did not answer specific questions, including one asking if ""breaking up"" NCAR meant it would be closed. But in a statement, the White House said ""NCAR's activities veer far from strong or useful science,"" adding that the center was being dismantled ""to eliminate Green New Scam research activities.""

American Meteorological Society President David Stensrud says he has used NCAR weather models throughout his career. ""I think the work that I and others have done have led to the improvements that we see [in] … weather predictions,"" he says. ""Losing that [will cause] a great deal of hurt in terms of our ability to continue to improve forecasts and the future.""

The ""beating heart"" of climate and weather science

Among NCAR's many contributions, in the 1960s, it developed dropsondes — tube-shaped instruments released from aircraft, including hurricane hunters, to measure temperature, pressure, humidity and wind. In the 1980s, the center helped develop and refine technology to monitor wind shear at airports.

Busalacchi says these efforts have contributed to decades without passenger plane crashes caused by wind shear or downbursts. ""We've had zero loss of life from these weather events that can be directly attributed to our research. And that's what we're talking about losing"" if NCAR shuts down, he says.

NCAR, which employs about 830 people, is also known for developing and maintaining tools such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), which is used around the world to predict everything from thunderstorms to large-scale systems, including hurricanes and frontal systems. NCAR's Community Earth Systems Model (CESM) is also widely used by scientists, including Jason Furtado, an associate professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.

Furtado says he and his colleagues have used the model to run experiments ""to look for where in the atmosphere and ocean we get long-range signals for extreme cold air outbreaks"" such as the February 2021 event that hit the midsection of the country, resulting in sub-zero temperatures for days and the total breakdown of the electrical grid in central Texas. ""We've used [CESM] and come up with some really important research,"" Furtado says.

He calls NCAR ""a world-envied research center for atmospheric science"" and ""a beating heart for the atmospheric science community."" He says his research and that of many other scientists would simply not be possible without the Boulder center. ""In some way every atmospheric scientist has a connection to NCAR, whether they've directly been to the building or they have not,"" he says.

Ken Davis, a professor of atmospheric and climate science at Penn State, did research at NCAR from the time he was a graduate student until after his postdoc. He says NCAR plays a critical role in providing its members with cutting-edge computing resources, observational resources and scientific expertise ""which no university can provide on its own.""

""If any investigator anywhere in the country wants to request a research aircraft … NCAR will take a look at that proposal and say, 'Yeah, we can do that,' "" Davis says. ""As a university investigator, I can show up with an instrumented C-130 [aircraft] to do a whole bunch of airborne research, which would be totally impossible without this facility to support the community.""

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has found itself at odds with the science community. In April, the administration dismissed scientists working on the country's flagship climate report and then removed the report from a government website.

In 2019, Trump landed himself in a scandal known as ""Sharpiegate,"" in which he contradicted official National Weather Service forecasts for Hurricane Dorian by insisting the storm directly threatened Alabama. He later displayed an Oval Office map showing an altered storm path that appeared to have been drawn with a black marker. Earlier this year, the Senate approved the nomination of Neil Jacobs, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) official cited for misconduct related to the episode, to lead the agency.

In its 2026 budget plan, the White House has also proposed cutting NOAA's budget by about 27% and eliminating NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's core climate and weather research branch. The administration has also rolled back National Science Foundation funding for climate science.

Ultimately, closing NCAR wouldn't have an immediate impact on weather forecasting, Furtado says. Instead, he says, it would slowly erode the scientific community's ability to make further progress on understanding weather and climate.

""We can either accept the facts and work on ways to mitigate and adapt, or ignore the data and not be ready for the changing world we have,"" Furtado says.

""Having less accurate forecasts and being more in the dark about what is coming puts lives and property at risk,"" he says.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2678x1506+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F31%2F0e%2F43971af04cef9f1ef2d9933421ef%2Fgettyimages-1172289651.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 15:02:08.733624

That comes to about $124 per family in higher utility bills, a 22% increase directly related to higher natural gas prices, the report notes.
Colder temperatures create more power demand, and natural gas prices tend to increase when utilities need more fuel to increase their generation.","Prices have steadily risen for natural gas throughout 2025, for residents and industry alike, and Louisiana finds itself at the center of the boom. A nation-leading three liquified natural gas export facilities operate along its coast, and five more are in the construction or planning phases.

But more LNG exports will mean higher domestic utility prices, according to a new report from the consumer advocacy group, Public Citizen.

Public Citizen analyzed documents from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and determined natural gas prices are increasing for American households as gas companies in the U.S. export more of the commodity to meet global demand.

From January through September, Americans paid $12 billion more for natural gas than the same period last year. That comes to about $124 per family in higher utility bills, a 22% increase directly related to higher natural gas prices, the report notes.

Natural gas prices for consumers are expected to increase another 16% in 2026, according to Public Citizen, which cited U.S. Energy Information Administration predictions.

Analysts attribute growing global demand for natural gas to political, industrial and environmental factors.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led other countries, mostly European, to seek other sources of the fuel, which is widely preferred as a cleaner alternative to coal.

The rise of artificial intelligence has caused a surge in the construction of data centers that require vast amounts of electricity that is most likely to come from power plants that run on natural gas.

An LSU Center for Energy Studies outlook for 2026 credits much of the state’s growth in natural gas exports to executive orders from the Trump administration that lifted a Biden-era moratorium on expansion of LNG export facilities.

The United States exported 11.9 billion cubic feet per day of LNG around the globe in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Louisiana handled around 61% of those shipments.

LNG exports are expected to “more than double by 2037, with nearly all new export capacity located on the Gulf Coast,” according to the LSU report’s analysis of Energy Information Administration predictions.

“As we continue to see more production, more capacity for exports, particularly in the LNG space, that’s going to mean more jobs,” said Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association. “Somebody is going to supply that gas. Louisiana gets to benefit from the investments in the export capacity.”

But with increased exports comes the tradeoff of higher domestic prices for residents, according to the Public Citizen report.

The majority of Louisiana’s electricity, around 70%, is generated from natural gas, according to the most recent numbers from the Energy Information Administration. It costs about 12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity for residential, natural gas-fueled power in Louisiana, compared with the 18-cent national average.

Utilities pass along the increased cost of electricity generation to their customers, often through what’s called a fuel adjustment charge on their utility bills. They also include charges to recoup the costs of any losses or investments such as new power lines or infrastructure upgrades. Although Louisiana has low rates for its electricity, it hasn’t translated to low power bills because of these pass-along costs to customers.

“Whatever amount of gas they’re using to generate the electricity that’s being used in your home, the cost of that gas is being charged directly to you,” said Jesse George, policy lead for the Alliance for Affordable Energy.

In some areas such as New Orleans, an area with older, less energy-efficient homes, residents will feel the higher prices in 2026, George said.

Colder temperatures create more power demand, and natural gas prices tend to increase when utilities need more fuel to increase their generation. The Energy Information Administration predicts a 22% increase in natural gas prices for the winter heating season that runs through March.

Though heightened winter electricity demand in Louisiana typically ends by March, customers could see additional fuel surcharges on their utility bills for months if there is a severe cold snap. The same situation arises during intense summer heat,

“About 20% of households cannot pay their utility bills already,” George said, citing the most recent numbers available from Entergy New Orleans’ disconnection rates. “Couple that with these increased fuel prices, and that certainly will only exacerbate the problems and the challenges that people are facing already.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9287-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 15:01:41.637558

Once operational, this data center will play a vital role in supporting our technologies and accelerating our progress toward personal superintelligence. Today, we’re excited to share updates on the investments we’ve made as a positive member of the Richland Parish community.

Creating Local Economic Impact

When we began construction, we committed to supporting the local economy by partnering with regional businesses and sourcing labor and materials locally. Over the last year alone, we’ve contracted more than $875 million with Louisiana businesses, driving local economic growth and supporting job creation. The buildout of the Richland Parish Data Center is led by three general contractors — Turner Construction Company, DPR Construction, and Mortensen Construction — which have been instrumental in hiring skilled trade workers across our four million square-foot campus and engaging with local businesses.

We’re proud to work with more than 160 Louisiana businesses (84% of which are local to Northeast Louisiana) that support the data center’s construction with electric, paving, utility work and more, as well as dozens of local food vendors who provide daily meals on site. We expect our construction team’s partnerships with local businesses to grow as part of our multi-billion-dollar investment in the State of Louisiana. To date, we have supported 3,700 construction workers and expect to reach a peak workforce of 5,000 by June 2026. Once completed, the data center will support more than 500 operational jobs like electricians, HVAC specialists, server and network techs, safety and security experts, and engineers.

“Meta’s decision to invest here has done more than bring a world-class project to Louisiana — it is activating entire ecosystems. Over the past year, we’ve seen local contractors, technology firms, and service providers across the state expand their teams and capabilities to support this project. That’s what progress looks like. Projects lifting entire communities and sectors, and reinforcing that Louisiana is a place where companies big and small can grow together,” said Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois.

Prioritizing Energy and Water Efficiency

We’re proud to call the communities in which we have data centers home, and beyond supporting jobs and businesses there, we strive to be good neighbors. Across all of our data centers, we work closely with the local electric utility to plan for and meet our energy needs and ensure we pay for the energy and related infrastructure we use so that other customers’ electricity bills don’t increase as a result of our data center. In Louisiana, we worked closely with Entergy to provide additional protection for customers, which projects that the electricity payments for the Richland Parish Data Center will cut both grid upgrade customer costs and storm charges by about 10%, resulting in $650 million in customer savings over 15 years. We are also contributing $15 million to Entergy’s customer assistance program, which provides bill payment assistance to low-income customers. As part of our broader work to add new energy to the local grid we are supporting three new clean energy projects in Louisiana, and additional projects will be announced as the data center gets closer to operation.

We are also driving water efficiency in our data center operations and investing in local water restoration projects that will return 100% of the Richland Parish Data Center’s water consumption to the Boeuf, Tensas, and Lower Mississippi watersheds. In 2025, we expanded our partnerships with Resource Environmental Solutions and Ducks Unlimited to support five water restoration projects restoring degraded wetlands, improving water quality, and enhancing ecosystems.

Investing in the Communities Where We Operate

In the area surrounding the Richland Parish Data Center, we’re expanding our investment to more than $300 million to help improve local infrastructure including roads, water, and wastewater systems. In partnership with the Richland Revitalization Board, we’re also committing $300,000 to support projects in Richland Parish’s three municipalities — Rayville, Delhi, and Mangham — that are focused on improving public parks and restoring the parish’s most iconic establishments.

In addition, we’re supporting senior services at the Richland Voluntary Council on Aging, facility upgrades at the Northeast Louisiana Veteran’s Cemetery, the robotics program at the Delhi Charter School, and mixed reality workforce development at the Richland Parish Schools.

The SPEED Act provides essential “rules of the road” by clarifying that NEPA is a purely procedural statute intended to ensure agencies consider environmental impacts without mandating specific outcomes or conferring substantive rights. It further modernizes the process by allowing the reuse of previous environmental analyses for up to 10 years.

Key provisions of the legislation include:

Codifying judicial rulings that limit environmental reviews to direct, proximately caused impacts rather than speculative, attenuated, or future effects.

Establishing strict deadlines for final agency actions, requiring decisions within 30 days of completing environmental assessments or impact statements.

Limiting the window for judicial challenges to 150 days, down from the current six-year statute of limitations, to provide project sponsors with immediate certainty.

Narrowing the definition of “major federal action” so that the mere allocation of federal funds, grants, or loans does not automatically trigger an exhaustive and unnecessary NEPA review.

Prohibiting agencies from delaying documents to await new research that was not available at the time of the initial application or notice of intent.

The bill passed the House with a vote of 221 to 196. The Chamber extends its gratitude to the members of the Michigan delegation who supported this common-sense reform, recognizing that project certainty is essential for regional economic growth.

The focus now shifts to the U.S. Senate. The Chamber urges Sens. Gary Peters (D-MI) and Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) to support the speedy passage of the SPEED Act, ensuring that the state can efficiently build the necessary infrastructure for the 21st century. Delaying these reforms only serves to hinder economic growth and increase the financial burden on regional businesses and consumers.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/US-Capitol_featured_2.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 17:00:02.441400

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Thursday ordered the PJM Interconnection to develop rules for colocating data centers and other large loads at power plants.

The decision is a “major victory” for companies that own gas-fired and nuclear power plants in PJM, according to analysts with Capstone, a research firm. Some of those companies include Constellation Energy, Public Service Enterprise Group and Vistra.

“We view this order as a strong signal of FERC’s position on the data center vs. affordability narrative, with the commission, rather than impeding AI development, likely to focus on avenues for relief for rising electricity costs, such as changes to capacity accreditation, fast-tracking new, high-capacity resources, and transferring costs from load to renewable generators,” Josh Price, Capstone director, and Hannah Rogers, senior associate, said in a client note.

Trade groups for independent power producers and clean energy welcomed the order.

FERC’s order is a “first step in a process that will require quick action and durable consensus from many stakeholders and highlights the urgency in getting solutions onto the system,” Electric Power Supply Association President and CEO Todd Snitchler said in a statement.

The decision could lead to regulatory certainty for large load customers and safeguards to make sure that colocating loads won’t drive up electric rates for other ratepayers or hurt system reliability, according to Advanced Energy United, a clean energy trade group.

In its decision, FERC directed PJM to create three transmission services that reflect that transmission customers taking service on behalf of colocated loads can and will limit their energy withdrawals from the transmission system under certain conditions, FERC staff said in a presentation on the decision.

The new services are for interim, non-firm transmission; firm contract demand transmission; and non-firm contract demand transmission. FERC gave PJM 60 days to propose those services as part of a “paper hearing” process.

During that process, FERC will consider whether colocated load should be assessed a minimum charge to cover the costs of maintaining the transmission system.

FERC also said PJM must revise its behind-the-meter generation rules and develop a transition process for transitioning to new rules.

To address concerns about power supply in PJM, FERC gave the grid operator until Jan. 19 to file a report on the status of proposals PJM considered in its Critical Issue Fast Path stakeholder process on integrating large loads, including the status of the grid operator’s expedited interconnection process for shovel-ready generation projects.

“Beyond this proceeding, I am concerned about PJM’s ability to procure sufficient resources to reliably serve both new and existing load,” FERC Commissioner Judy Chang said in a concurring statement.

Chang emphasized the limits of FERC’s decision, noting that the colocation model the order envisions may not work in states where the local electric utility must serve retail loads.

“Therefore, the broader challenge of reliably, efficiently, and fairly interconnecting large loads and the generation needed to serve them remains before the commission, the states, and industry,” she said.

In its decision, FERC declined to address jurisdictional issues related to interconnecting retail loads served through colocation arrangements.

During FERC’s open meeting Thursday, Chairman Laura Swett addressed the “narrative” that data centers can increase bills for other ratepayers, describing her family’s stress over paying bills during her childhood.

“I don’t want any American family to feel that anxiety because of anything that we do in this building,” she said, “and I pledge to do everything I can to ensure that our progress does not come at the expense of consumers.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_0oX4uYcdz47KJ2g1j2IbAr43_YpDZMbcgiIo00gUtg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Ib3BlX0NyZWVrX051Y2xlYXJfR2VuZXJhdGluZ19TdGF0aW9uX2Zyb21fRGVsYXdhcmVfUml2ZXJfTWF5XzIwMTJfMS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-19 16:59:50.489327

It's the latest climate-related move by President Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, cut funding for climate research, and removed climate and weather scientists from their posts across the federal government. During his first term, Trump famously contradicted the nation's weather forecasting service by redrawing a Hurricane Dorian's path on a map with a Sharpie.

White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, in a post Tuesday on X, announced the plan to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, calling it ""one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country."" NCAR was founded more than six decades ago to provide universities with expertise and resources for collaborative research on global weather, water, and climate challenges.

Vought said the center was undergoing a ""comprehensive review"" and that any ""vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location.""

Antonio Busalacchi, who heads the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a nonprofit consortium of 129 U.S. universities that oversees the Boulder facility, told NPR he received no prior notice before the announcement and believes the decision ""is entirely political.""

NCAR's job is to study both climate and weather, and Busalacchi says the two cannot be understood separately. ""Our job is to state what the science is, and it's for others to interpret what the significance of that science is,"" he says. ""We're very careful not to cross over that line to advocacy or policy prescription.""

Plan faces a political backlash

Vought's announcement drew an immediate response from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, who said in a statement that if the White House goes ahead with the plan, ""public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.""

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includes Boulder, have suggested that the proposed NCAR closure amounts to political brinkmanship by the White House in response to Colorado's refusal to release Tina Peters. Peters, a former Mesa County clerk, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for illegally accessing voting machines after the 2020 election. A Republican, Peters was recently pardoned by Trump, a largely symbolic action since she has neither been charged nor convicted in federal court.

""The judgement is that this is very much about Tina Peters,"" Bennet told local media in Colorado. And that the president attempted to get his way through intimidation and he hasn't gotten his way and he is trying to punish Colorado as a result."" In a joint statement, Bennett, Neguse and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper called the administration's plan ""deeply dangerous and blatantly retaliatory.""

NPR reached out to Vought's Office of Management and Budget, but received no response. The White House press office did not answer specific questions, including one asking if ""breaking up"" NCAR meant it would be closed. But in a statement, the White House said ""NCAR's activities veer far from strong or useful science,"" adding that the center was being dismantled ""to eliminate Green New Scam research activities.""

American Meteorological Society President David Stensrud says he has used NCAR weather models throughout his career. ""I think the work that I and others have done have led to the improvements that we see [in] … weather predictions,"" he says. ""Losing that [will cause] a great deal of hurt in terms of our ability to continue to improve forecasts and the future.""

The ""beating heart"" of climate and weather science

Among NCAR's many contributions, in the 1960s, it developed dropsondes — tube-shaped instruments released from aircraft, including hurricane hunters, to measure temperature, pressure, humidity and wind. In the 1980s, the center helped develop and refine technology to monitor wind shear at airports.

Busalacchi says these efforts have contributed to decades without passenger plane crashes caused by wind shear or downbursts. ""We've had zero loss of life from these weather events that can be directly attributed to our research. And that's what we're talking about losing"" if NCAR shuts down, he says.

NCAR, which employs about 830 people, is also known for developing and maintaining tools such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), which is used around the world to predict everything from thunderstorms to large-scale systems, including hurricanes and frontal systems. NCAR's Community Earth Systems Model (CESM) is also widely used by scientists, including Jason Furtado, an associate professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.

Furtado says he and his colleagues have used the model to run experiments ""to look for where in the atmosphere and ocean we get long-range signals for extreme cold air outbreaks"" such as the February 2021 event that hit the midsection of the country, resulting in sub-zero temperatures for days and the total breakdown of the electrical grid in central Texas. ""We've used [CESM] and come up with some really important research,"" Furtado says.

He calls NCAR ""a world-envied research center for atmospheric science"" and ""a beating heart for the atmospheric science community."" He says his research and that of many other scientists would simply not be possible without the Boulder center. ""In some way every atmospheric scientist has a connection to NCAR, whether they've directly been to the building or they have not,"" he says.

Ken Davis, a professor of atmospheric and climate science at Penn State, did research at NCAR from the time he was a graduate student until after his postdoc. He says NCAR plays a critical role in providing its members with cutting-edge computing resources, observational resources and scientific expertise ""which no university can provide on its own.""

""If any investigator anywhere in the country wants to request a research aircraft … NCAR will take a look at that proposal and say, 'Yeah, we can do that,' "" Davis says. ""As a university investigator, I can show up with an instrumented C-130 [aircraft] to do a whole bunch of airborne research, which would be totally impossible without this facility to support the community.""

This isn't the first time the Trump administration has found itself at odds with the science community. In April, the administration dismissed scientists working on the country's flagship climate report and then removed the report from a government website.

In 2019, Trump landed himself in a scandal known as ""Sharpiegate,"" in which he contradicted official National Weather Service forecasts for Hurricane Dorian by insisting the storm directly threatened Alabama. He later displayed an Oval Office map showing an altered storm path that appeared to have been drawn with a black marker. Earlier this year, the Senate approved the nomination of Neil Jacobs, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) official cited for misconduct related to the episode, to lead the agency.

In its 2026 budget plan, the White House has also proposed cutting NOAA's budget by about 27% and eliminating NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's core climate and weather research branch. The administration has also rolled back National Science Foundation funding for climate science.

Ultimately, closing NCAR wouldn't have an immediate impact on weather forecasting, Furtado says. Instead, he says, it would slowly erode the scientific community's ability to make further progress on understanding weather and climate.

""We can either accept the facts and work on ways to mitigate and adapt, or ignore the data and not be ready for the changing world we have,"" Furtado says.

""Having less accurate forecasts and being more in the dark about what is coming puts lives and property at risk,"" he says.

How the unstoppable electrification revolution has led us to a solar and wind-powered tipping point

Electrification is expanding fast globally, reaching a 'positive tipping point' as it leads towards cleaner air; its benefits becoming self-propelling.

Electrification’s progress stems from the superior environmental footprint of renewables’ infrastructure compared to fossil fuels, alongside declining costs of solar and wind power and increasing electric car sales.

There is still work to realize a clean and inclusive energy transition; accelerating electrification can get us there with investment, international collaboration and community empowerment.

The electrification of our economy and society using renewable power is happening fast. Worldwide, clean electricity from solar and wind plus battery storage (“solar plus”) is becoming the dominant new energy source and is already the cheapest in most countries.

We call this a “positive tipping point.” It is “positive” because electricity from renewables reduces the need to burn greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels and offers benefits such as cleaner air and energy independence.

It is a “tipping point” because once they have crossed key thresholds of affordability, performance and accessibility, the adoption of these technologies can become self-propelling. The more we adopt, the cheaper and better they become due to increasing returns, such as economies of scale and learning-by-doing.

Decades of steady technological improvement and policy planning have led to this relatively abrupt and accelerating solar plus revolution.

The superior physics and economics of clean electricity

The physics and economics of using clean electricity make it a clear winner over fossil fuels for almost all applications.

The energy lost by burning coal, oil or gas to generate electricity or to drive a motor vehicle – due to thermodynamic inefficiency – wastes, on average, about two-thirds (40-80%) of the total primary energy of these fuels, costing around 4.5 trillion dollars per year

.

We burn 16 billion tons of fossil fuels every single year. By contrast, all the materials required to build global solar-plus infrastructure amount to about 1 billion tons. Solar and wind costs have declined by over 80% in the last decade and battery costs by almost 90% since 2010.

As a result, in 2024, over 90% of all new power generation capacity worldwide came from renewables. Every day, more households, businesses and governments are choosing clean electrons over dirty fossil fuels, not just for the climate but because it’s easier, safer and cheaper.

For example, Pakistan has undergone a massive grassroots wave of electrification as farmers and households take advantage of cheap solar imports from China, also due to another important self-propelling feedback in the system – social contagion: the more people see and hear about solar panels in use, the more likely they are to buy them.

In just six years, this additional solar capacity has exceeded the country’s entire grid generation capacity.

This global picture is, however, skewed: China accounted for 65% of this additional capacity. By contrast, Africa, which has 60% of the world’s best solar resources and where 40% of the population (600 million people) lack access to electricity, received less than 2% of global clean energy investment.

Electric vehicles turbocharge the transition to clean mobility

The electrification revolution is also hitting the roads. Electric vehicles have leapt from 2% to 20% of new car sales in just six years as consumers embrace their lower lifetime costs and superior performance. Sales of two and three-wheeled vehicles are also growing exponentially in parts of Asia.

The transformation is also beginning to affect heavy-duty vehicles, led again by China. Thanks to strong policy support and greatly improved battery performance, electric trucks have taken 46% of new sales this year and 60% is expected in 2026.

Every percentage point of EV market share gained equates to lower petrol, diesel and LNG demand, and to lower political influence of petrostates and oil companies, making bolder policies for climate and nature easier to enact.

In line with positive tipping points theory, small group coalitions are best placed to catalyse global change, as leading markets such as China, the European Union and California collaborate to reduce technology costs and set common standards, thereby motivating others to accelerate their own electrification plans.

An ethical and inclusive transition

The clean energy revolution is underway, but it is not yet truly global or inclusive. Many developing nations are keen to leapfrog directly to clean energy, skipping the polluting fossil-fuel phase, for reasons of energy access, health, economic opportunity, diversity and resilience, as well as for climate stability.

This often means securing access to concessional finance, technology partnerships and skills transfers, investing in clean power generation and grid infrastructure, building industrial hubs around renewable power and ensuring that communities have a voice in the decision-making process.

Clean electrification can directly support these goals. Solar and wind projects are being paired with battery systems and mini-grids to bring power to off-grid communities, creating new jobs, diversifying economies previously reliant on commodity exports and reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels.

The electrification revolution is here but to accelerate it rapidly and to reach its full potential requires significant intervention in the coming years, including:

Investment: Public, private and blended finance need to direct unprecedented capital into renewable energy generation, battery storage and grid infrastructure. Planning and permitting also need to be streamlined in many jurisdictions to enable solar farms, wind parks and transmission lines to be built in months rather than years.

International collaboration: Climate and energy diplomacy needs to focus on partnerships for transferring clean technology and skills. Wealthier countries, development banks and businesses need to help emerging economies leapfrog to clean electrification.

Community empowerment: Whether it is city authorities procuring electric bus fleets or rural villages building and managing solar plus micro-grids, the electrification revolution will be driven by local action. Policies need to incentivize bottom-up adoption and authorities need to bring people with them in the just transition, including reskilling pathways for fossil fuel industry workers.

While “tipping points” often evoke abrupt, harmful shifts such as coral reef die-off or ocean-circulation collapse, they can also drive rapid positive change. Some are already emerging, such as the accelerating adoption of renewables, electric vehicles and heat pumps; others must be activated quickly to support a safe, just and sustainable future.

Colorado has been working to eliminate almost all of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, based on 2005 pollution levels.
Colorado’s push to use solar, wind and batteries instead of coal to generate electricity was the single most effective strategy in eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, Twyman said.
In the coming years, that sector will replace electricity, which generally has been powered by coal, as the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution.
But if Colorado is serious about its goal of eliminating 100% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, hard choices will need to be made.","The Trump administration’s rollback of policies that improve the climate and protect human health are slowing Colorado’s progress in curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and it will be critical for the state to chart its own path to reach its goals, according to state officials who track air pollution and climate change.

Federal repeals of environmental programs and polices are setting the state back about a year in achieving its emissions goals, said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office. Colorado is about two years behind schedule in achieving its 2030 benchmark of reducing emissions by 50% from a 2005 baseline. Before Trump took office in January, the state was about one year off target, he said.

The state was supposed to reduce emissions by 26% by 2025, but has eliminated an estimated 21%, Toor said. It’s projected to reach a 46% reduction by 2030.

“What we are seeing is that we still are on a very good trajectory, and while the federal actions do slow things down a little bit, it’s a relatively small impact,” Toor said.

Toor acknowledged that Trump has been in charge for just 11 months, and it’s hard to forecast what else might happen, including a looming battle over the closing of coal-fired power plants in Colorado.

Colorado’s latest Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report was presented Thursday to the Air Quality Control Commission, a panel appointed by the governor to set rules and regulations to control air pollution.

Overall, Colorado has made progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by creating policies that forced oil and gas companies to lower the amount of methane leaking from wells, a push to use alternative energy sources to power the electrical grid, and regulations that required industrial manufacturers to reduce their pollution.

But the Trump administration’s policies are undoing some of that work.

The Environmental Protection Agency has said it will roll back federal methane rules for the oil and gas industry, although Toor argued those companies still must follow Colorado’s regulations.

The federal government did away with a rule, known as the California waiver, that allowed states to regulate vehicle emissions standards, effectively allowing automakers to produce cars that pollute more. The administration also eliminated funding for solar projects and erased tax incentives that encouraged people to buy electric vehicles.

In Colorado, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled $550 million in funding for clean energy projects, such as $326 million slated for Colorado State University research on reducing methane, a potent planet-warming gas, from oil and gas wells.

All of those moves will hamper Colorado’s efforts to reduce emissions, said Matthew Twyman, a supervisor in the Air Pollution Control Division’s climate change program, during a presentation to the air quality commission Thursday.

Still, the state’s efforts over the past several years are absorbing some of the blow from an administration that denies climate change is real.

“Colorado, in a way, has insulated itself,” Twyman said.

Greenhouse gases such as methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide are released through human action and they trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise and impacting Earth’s climate. They also affect people’s health, especially children, the elderly and those who live with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma.

Colorado has been working to eliminate almost all of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, based on 2005 pollution levels. Progress is marked through complex computer modeling systems, and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s Air Pollution Control Division is required to report its greenhouse gas progress every two years.

Colorado’s push to use solar, wind and batteries instead of coal to generate electricity was the single most effective strategy in eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, Twyman said.

“That’s true statewide, and that trend is about to drop off a cliff,” he said.

One reason for that slide is that only a few coal-fired power plants continue to operate, so the low-hanging fruit has been plucked, Twyman said.

But Xcel Energy has petitioned to keep a coal plant at its Comanche power station in Pueblo open a year longer than planned, saying it needs to meet growing electricity needs. And Toor said there is concern that the federal government will order the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association to keep open its coal-fired plants in Craig, despite plans to shutter its three units by 2028, Toor said.

“It’s not just that it’s going to mean more pollution, but it’s going to be an extra cost for consumers for absolutely no reason,” Toor said. “There’s no need to keep that coal plant open, and it will be very expensive to electric customers across the state.”

But Colorado can control its own destiny.

For example, Gov. Jared Polis is preparing to expand the state’s incentive program for people who buy electric vehicles, said Stefanie Shoup, the deputy director for regulatory affairs at the state’s Air Pollution Control Division. The state earlier this year announced an expansion of its electric vehicle rebate program in the wake of the Republican-controlled Congress eliminating Biden-era tax credits for EV purchases.

Still, the transportation sector — all the cars and trucks on Colorado’s roads — will be a challenge, Twyman said. In the coming years, that sector will replace electricity, which generally has been powered by coal, as the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution.

“It’s very hard to bend 5.5 million people’s choices,” he said. “But it is still bending.”

Agriculture also will move up in the rankings for producing a larger proportion of pollution as other sectors curb emissions, Twyman said. For now, Colorado does not have any policies to regulate emissions from livestock farms or fertilizer applications on crop lands.

“Agriculture is very hard to change,” he said.

But if Colorado is serious about its goal of eliminating 100% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, hard choices will need to be made.

“The easy efforts may be already plucked,” Twyman said. “How you go about decarbonizing is a harder and harder nut to crack.

“The reality is it’s not that easy. It’s not that pretty.”",https://www.timescall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TDP-L-Comanche-coal-RJS-10523.jpg?w=1024&h=727,N,,2025-12-19 18:00:22.508072

The federal lawsuit, filed in the Western District of Washington state, seeks a court order forcing the Department of Transportation to release the funds.","This story comes from our partners at WHYY.

New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania are suing the Trump administration over funding for electric vehicle chargers, as part of a coalition of 17 Democratic attorneys general, and Gov. Josh Shapiro. They are alleging the White House is acting unlawfully by withholding funds approved by Congress.

“Without any notice or explanation, the United States Department of Transportation just quietly refused to approve any new funding under the programs which had already been appropriated by Congress and awarded to the states,” said New Jersey Attorney General Michael Platkin.

“This is consistent with how this administration has treated congressional appropriations. They’re not optional. They’re laws,” said Platkin. And the Constitution says that only under limited circumstances can the president, after money has been appropriated by Congress and passed into law, can he restrict those funds from going to their intended recipients.”

New Jersey is waiting on $16 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program. Both programs are part of the Biden-era bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Congress passed in 2022.

Platkin said the funds would create new jobs and provide EV drivers greater access to the roads.

“At a time, again, when we’re trying to make energy costs go down,” Platkin said. “We’re trying to make people’s lives easier and more affordable. This makes no sense. It’s illegal, but it also just makes no sense.”

The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration’s actions violate the Constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement that the funds would support “EV construction projects in Pennsylvania and … new, good paying jobs.”

“I will not let the federal government break their word at the expense of Pennsylvanians,” Shapiro said.

Pennsylvania was awarded funds to construct three charging stations along I-78 and I-81. The joint project involving Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia was awarded $18.6 million.

The effort was part of former President Joe Biden’s effort to tackle climate change.

This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the effort. “While the Administration is busy finding ways for their Big Oil donors to profit, California will continue to fight for its people, environment, and innovation.”

The Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment.

But President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he’s not a fan of electric vehicles. Trump signed a law that ended EV tax credits and recently weakened fuel efficiency standards, saying that Americans prefer gas-powered vehicles.

The full blog series, in addition to their reference reports, can be found at the Superhot Rock Resource Library.

Prior to the advancement of next-generation technologies, geothermal energy was limited to the few, scarce regions around the world with the three necessary components to develop conventional geothermal systems: shallow heat, abundant fluid, and interconnected rock fractures. Under those limitations, geothermal energy has only ever met less than 1% of the global energy demand. However, continued technological improvements could allow geothermal energy to expand geographically and meet as much as 15% of the global electricity demand growth to 2050. The advancements that created this opportunity have been driven by technological improvements including: 1) faster drilling rates and lower drilling costs, 2) higher production temperatures and flow rates, and 3) the development of longer and deeper wells. A key aspect of where next-generation geothermal will be developed in its early stages depends on the geothermal gradient of the region (i.e., how fast temperatures increase with depth below the Earth’s surface). This is because regions with shallow heat require less drilling to get to the same temperature when compared to regions with deeper heat resources. Continued improvements in these areas will be critical to turning this promise into reality—allowing geothermal energy to provide cost competitive clean firm power anywhere it is needed.

But how does this global potential translate to regional potential? In their 2024 article, Power supply characterization of baseload and flexible enhanced geothermal systems, Aljubran and Horne discuss a new temperature-at-depth model for the contiguous United States and use that model to determine the economics of developing enhanced geothermal systems across the contiguous U.S. This work, which I highlight below, showcases the potential cost competitive development of next-generation geothermal across the U.S.

Enhanced geothermal systems could generate more electricity than 300x the 2023 U.S. power consumption

Aljubran and Horne developed the Stanford Thermal Model to estimate the potential of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) across the contiguous U.S. at depths of up to 7 km. To do this, the Stanford Thermal Model estimates temperature-at-depth across the contiguous U.S. and is built on over 400,000 bottomhole temperature measurements in addition to other variables that are key to creating an accurate model of the subsurface. These additional variables include physical quantities such as depth, elevation, sediment thickness, magnetic and gravities anomalies, radioactive flux, seismicity, electric conductivity, and proximity to faults and volcanoes. All estimates assumed the use of Organic Rankine Cycle power plants across all operating temperatures with a project lifetime of 25 years.

Using this model, Aljubran and Horne estimate that the annual net generation potential for EGS is over 300 times greater than the 2023 U.S. power consumption of 4,014 Terrawatt hours (TWh) (Figure 1). Although, it is important to note that much of that potential is between 6-7 km – indicating the need for improvements in drilling technology to help lower costs at these greater depths. Their results underscore the potential of EGS across the entire contiguous U.S., contingent on continued technological advancements in drilling technology, and highlights the value of detailed geologic mapping to identify regional opportunities.

Figure 1. Average annual EGS generation per unit area for projects spanning 1-7 kilometers in depth

Drilling deeper can lower costs

In addition to the mapping of EGS resource capacity, Aljubran and Horne also used their model to estimate the economic viability of EGS projects across the contiguous U.S. based on capital expenditure (CAPEX), operational expenditure (OPEX), and generation over time, which is represented as levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) across the contiguous U.S. in Figure 2. These estimates assume a discount rate of 7%, which reflects the future costs and energy production that have been converted to their present-day value. Their calculations also assumed an investment tax credit (ITC) of 30%, indicating the importance of federal tax credits to continue advancing early-stage technologies, such as next-generation geothermal. This was also documented in recent research by Ricks and Jenkins, where the ITC was critical to the successful scale-up of EGS technology in their simulations.

In addition to accounting for the LCOE, which takes into account the CAPEX, OPEX, and generation over time, Figure 2 shows how costs differ between using baseline drilling rates and advanced drilling rates. The advanced drilling rates are based on learnings from recent EGS projects, which demonstrated drilling cost reductions of nearly 50% after drilling approximately three wells. Use of advanced drilling rates resulted in an LCOE reduction of nearly 25% on average.

Figure 1. Optimal levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for EGS development across the contiguous U.S. for (a) baseline and (b) advanced drilling rates

Aljubran and Horne found that LCOE was lowest for nearly 90% of the contiguous U.S. by drilling to the deepest point of their studied depth (i.e., 7 km). LCOE was optimized at shallower depths (≤4 km) in a few regions across the western U.S. with high geothermal gradients (e.g., the Snake River Plain or the Great Basin) or where the geothermal gradient becomes more gradual with increasing depth (e.g., western North Dakota). This was attributed to increasing drilling costs with depth that don’t justify the benefit of a higher resource temperature.

What’s next?

Research by Aljubran and Horne illustrate the potential for EGS deployment across the contiguous U.S. Their research shows the large potential for EGS – potentially more than 300x the 2023 U.S. power consumption. It also shows the importance of thorough characterization of local and regional geology to understand resource potential. Additionally, their work determined that in many regions, such as those without exceptionally shallow heat resources, it makes economic sense to drill to deeper depths to maximize heat (i.e., 7 km). This is especially true with continued drilling rate improvements that have been documented in recent EGS projects.

Stay tuned for more from CATF as we continue to push forward bold ideas on how to scale higher enthalpy geothermal as an essential form of clean firm electricity anywhere it is needed.

Centrifuge manufacturing begins

New enrichment capacity expected to come online in 2029

BETHESDA, Md., Dec. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU) announced today that it has begun domestic centrifuge manufacturing to support commercial Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) enrichment activities at its Piketon, Ohio, facility. This strategic move enables the company to capitalize on its many first-mover advantages in U.S.-owned domestic uranium enrichment, and marks one of the most consequential transformations in the company's and the United States' uranium enrichment history. Centrus plans to leverage its multi-billion-dollar uranium enrichment expansion to meet its growing backlog of $2.3 billion in contingent LEU sales to U.S. and international customer contracts, and targets future commercial-scale production of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) as well.

""We are excited to announce the official commencement of our industrial-scale centrifuge manufacturing build for commercial LEU enrichment,"" said Centrus Energy CEO and President Amir Vexler. ""We make this announcement after carefully evaluating the business' internal and external progress as well as its future prospects and many competitive advantages. These include the significant progress in building our supply chain; the advancement across the many available avenues to acquire low-cost of capital to support our build, including imminent DOE funding announcements; and, evaluating the progress in our internal manufacturing capabilities.

""This historic step demonstrates Centrus' commitment to meeting our growing backlog of contingent commercial LEU customer contracts,"" continued Vexler ""Reclaiming American nuclear leadership on the global will catalyze additional private investment and enable further expansion as the market continues to grow. Uranium enrichment in Ohio has a big future, and this is just the beginning.""

Centrus' expansion is underpinned by public and private funding along with commercial contracts, a framework that includes:

Department of Energy funding: Centrus is a finalist for Task Orders from the Department of Energy for both LEU production and HALEU production – which the Department has indicated could be ~$900 million per task order.

Private capital: Centrus raised $1.2 billion via convertible note transactions in November 2024 and August 2025, reported a cash balance of more than $1.6 billion as of September 30, 2025, and recently launched a $1 billion at-the-market offering.

Customer contracts: Centrus has secured $2.3 billion in contracts and commitments from U.S. and international customers aimed at supporting new, U.S. uranium enrichment capacity. These agreements are contingent upon Centrus realizing certain milestones towards building the new capacity. Centrus continues to pursue additional LEU and HALEU sales opportunities.

Third party investment: This represents another potential avenue to secure low cost of capital financing while maximizing capacity. There is continued, growing interest from the market to secure future enrichment offtake by investing in new enrichment capacity.

Direct foreign investment: Centrus announced a proposed partnership with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and POSCO International in August 2025 to explore potential investment in new enrichment capacity in Ohio. The company continues to maximize efforts in this area with Korea and other nations.

National security: Centrus' AC100M centrifuge is the only U.S.-origin enrichment technology that is deployment-ready to fulfill national security missions – for which a U.S. technology is required. In October, the National Nuclear Security Administration announced its intent to contract with Centrus for LEU enrichment for national security. The company stands ready to support these critical national security missions.

The last U.S.-owned, large-scale uranium enrichment plant was built in the 1950s and shut down permanently in 2013, leaving America completely dependent upon foreign, state-owned enterprises that now control almost 100 percent of the world's uranium enrichment capacity. With demand for nuclear power expected to grow in the coming years – and imports of Russian enriched uranium completely banned starting in 2028 – new domestic, U.S.-owned uranium enrichment capacity is urgently needed and in high demand.

The project is expected to support thousands of American jobs, including:

1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operating jobs in Ohio, while retaining 150 existing jobs at the Piketon plant.

Hundreds of new direct jobs at Centrus' centrifuge manufacturing plant in Tennessee and across a nationwide network of suppliers.

Thousands of indirect jobs in Ohio, Tennessee, and across the country.

Next Steps

Centrus has begun manufacturing centrifuges to support its uranium enrichment expansion at its centrifuge manufacturing factory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, relying upon a domestic manufacturing supply chain. Centrus began expanding its manufacturing capacity in Tennessee in late 2024, and has already begun hiring in Tennessee and Ohio to support the project. The first new production capacity is expected to come online in 2029.

Dear Chairs Collins, Murkowski, Cole and Simpson, Vice Chair Murray, and Ranking Members Merkley, DeLauro and Pingree,

We, the members of the National Parks Second Century Action Coalition , urge you to support our national parks and national park staff as you conference the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Interior, Environment and Related Agencies appropriations bill. For months, NPS has been ravaged by resignation programs resulting in a tremendous loss of institutional knowledge, suffered from a hiring freeze for mission critical positions, had seasonal staff offers eliminated then reinstated well below promised levels, delayed grant funding, and had their ability to buy necessary products such as toilet paper for visitor restrooms revoked. Therefore, the Coalition supports the following requests for a conference bill:

Fundinglevels:SupporttheSenateBillFundingLevelsandAvoidOtherCuts

For more than a century, our national parks have remained America’s favorite places, important pieces of our natural and cultural heritage designated for future generations to explore and enjoy. Unfortunately, NPS has long been underfunded. Between 2011 and 2024, NPS lost over 2,000 permanent staff with an additional 4,000 lost since January. Visitor centers are reducing hours, trails and facilities are falling into disrepair, education programs are being cancelled and our nation’s natural and cultural heritage are at risk. We support the Senate bill acknowledges these impacts and largely maintains current funding at $2.859 billion for staffing, operations and public access throughout the National Park System. Unfortunately, the House bill cuts more than $176 million from the operations account. We are disappointed to seecuts in otherNPS accounts,including construction, and hopetheconference committee can avoid them.

ReductionInForce(RIF):ExtendCR/minibusProvisionProhibitingRIF&Restore Staff

Unfortunately, NPS has lost over 24% of its permanent staff since January reducing the agency’s ability to care for our nation’s most iconic places. Our parks’ natural and cultural heritage are already significantly at risk and the visiting experience and local economies that rely on visitors could be impacted. We commend Sec. 120 in the FY26 Continuing Appropriations, Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MCVA and Extensions Act (HR 5371), which prohibits RIFs through January 30th. We urge you to add a provision in conference extending this critically needed prohibition through the rest of the fiscal year. In addition, we request statutory language to restore permanent staff to at least 16,655, the amount of permanent staff in December 2025.

SenatePolicyProvisions:IncludeSenateBill’sProvisionsSupporting NPS

The administrative provision on page 23 of the bill requires that NPS “shall maintain staffing levels by hiring, retaining, and rehiring after separations in order to fulfill the [NPS] mission…” We urge you to retain this language, which would support resource protection, public access, visitor safety, tribal consultation and more. As noted above, specifying a specificstaff number would go even further.

We support the bill language on page 23 that specifies that disaster relief funds in the American Relief Act of December 2024 are obligated as intended by Congress. This law (P.L. 118-158) provided $2.3 billion in critically needed funds for numerous national parks significantly impacted by disasters including Hurricane Helene, which devastated the Blue Ridge Parkway and other southeastern NPS units.

We request inclusion of Sec.130,thatmaintainsnationalparksasfederalland. Though NPS lands cannot be disposed of without congressional authorization, this provision makes clear Congress’ intent that national parks cannot and should not be given away or sold. The administration’s FY26 budget proposed transferring NPS units, and their proposed funding cuts could eliminate hundreds of NPS units.

We applaud and urge inclusion provisions (Secs. 429, 430 and 431) that protect the Land andWaterConservationFund(LWCF). The LWCF is an incredibly effective and important conservation tool that protects national parks and other federal lands, as well as provide opportunities for public access and community recreation.

Sec. 448. We urge inclusion of this provision requiring notification to the appropriations committeesofRIFsandothersignificantworkforceactionswithin45days. This provision would ensure that indiscriminate firings not take place without congressional oversight. An extension of the RIF prohibition in HR 5371, as discussed above, would add substantial weight to this effort.

We also support these provisions that ensure accountability and transparency of appropriations and make it clear that the committee does not want the administration to sequester funds, delay grants, cancel grants with no cause, cancel leases without justification, and more.

Sec.443 requires 5-year construction plans including deferred maintenance. The 5-year plans for NPS have always been published in the annual NPS Budget Justifications but the administration did not publish that document this year.

Sec.444 is a new section requiring quarterly reporting of DOI and other agency disaster estimates. NPS is regularly devastated by costly incidents and transparency is important.

Secs. 446 and 447 would ensure that agencies including NPS must notify grant recipients of cancellations with justifications within a week, and that grants are awarded in a reasonable time frame. This supports routine grants that introduce students to nature, allow people to assist park staff in restoring trails, and otherwise connect people to natural and cultural resources.

Sec. 449 should ensure that funds are obligated as Congress intends. It expands a prior section on “Program Funding Incorporated by Reference” to list all the accounts for which agencies are directed by law to fund programs as specified in the committee report.

Sec.450 helps to safeguard employee compensation and benefits. For NPS, this means that NPS money cannot be robbed to pay for staff transferred to DOI for reorganization purposes as has been the case this year.

Sec. 451 requires 180 days notification with details to the congressional committees of jurisdiction prior to cancelling any building leases. This year, DOI sought to cancel 35 NPS building leases important for visitor services, resource protection, law enforcement, and more. Cancellation of these leases would have crippled many parks’ ability to meet their mission to ensure visitor enjoyment and safety and protect resources.

DisasterRelief:ProvideFundingforDisasters onNPSLand

Given the challenges of passing appropriations bills, we respectfully ask you to consider including emergency disaster funding for recovery from this year’s wildfires and floods in our national parks. This year, the Dragon Bravo fire destroyed infrastructure—including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge—and habitat at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. A wildfire caused significant and costly damage at Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park and flooding destroyed areas of Joshua Tree National Park. Absorbing these costs within a limited budget would be difficult or impossible.

In summary, our national parks and the park staff not only protect unique historic and natural resources but also support the national economy with more than fifteen dollars in economic activity for every dollar invested. National parks are more popular than ever with over 325 million visits a year contributing over $55 billion in economic output and supporting 415,000 jobs. In addition, America’s outdoor recreation economy supports over 5 million American jobs and contributes $1.2 trillion in annual economic output. In 2024, there were over 72.4 million international arrivals to the United States and research indicates that national parks were a huge tourism attraction for those visitors.

The future of our National Park System depends on Congress ensuring they have the funding and personnel to care for them. Therefore, we urge you to produce a conferenced FY26 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies bill that supports our parks.

Thank you for considering our views,",https://protectnps.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-cropped-Artboard-1-1-150x150.png,N,,2025-12-19 16:01:44.008578

In its most recent resource adequacy report, ERCOT modeled battery availability in December 2024, when operating reserves were low, and also during Winter Storms Cora, Enzo and Kingston in 2025.

What it found was that an energy emergency is less likely in January 2026 than in December 2025 because more storage projects will be connected to the grid. The battery systems allow for more availability in the early morning, when it’s harder to meet electricity demand, ERCOT reported.

Like gas turbines, battery systems have operational issues in cold weather. Left untreated when temperatures plunge, batteries become less effective as winter’s cold slows down internal chemical reactions and reduces their ability to discharge electricity.

ERCOT models its winter risk projections accounting for batteries’ lower state of charge but still found that the sheer influx of new energy storage facilities guards the grid against winter emergencies.

Since Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, ERCOT and other regulators have implemented a number of reforms, including requirements for power plants to weatherize for winter. Similar requirements for winter weatherization also now exist for battery systems.

Like all other energy resources, storage systems are subject to ERCOT inspections at least once every three years. The grid operator completed its fourth winter season inspection in April, evaluating more than 3,300 power plants and transmission facilities since the program began in response to Winter Storm Uri.

Some of the critical components within energy storage sites ERCOT identifies as at risk of failing in extreme weather emergencies include thermal management systems, inverters, fire suppression technology exposed to the cold, and heating and air conditioning equipment. If any of these systems fail, it could cause a trip, reduce capacity or prevent batteries from starting up.

The operators are required to show preparation records, or how they’ve implemented and maintained weather emergency measures. They also must conduct walkthroughs during which they show inspectors how they’ve implemented physical protections to the batteries, including waterproofing, wind-proofing and freeze-proofing. These weatherization efforts can assist in mitigating battery degradation or downtime altogether.

Keeping batteries within temperature ranges that minimize deterioration leads to less capacity loss or availability, said Adam Nygaard, vice president of business development at FlexGen, an energy storage integrator. Nygaard said FlexGen’s software tracks the ideal performance of the storage systems by creating a digital twin at each storage site. It allows the company to compare actual outcomes to what’s anticipated. “When we see variations, then we’re able to take action,” Nygaard said.

During Winter Storm Uri, FlexGen users had a 99.3 percent uptime, he said.

Unlike other grids across the country, ERCOT doesn’t pay companies just for being ready to provide energy when needed. Rather, ERCOT pays operators only when energy is actually used.

The cold weather makes it harder for developers to maximize electricity discharge during winter peak periods and means they could miss out on these payments for providing energy in emergencies, said John Murray, principal analyst on renewables at S&P Global Energy. That could significantly impact their revenue.

Often winter events in Texas last multiple days, Murray said. There’s no guarantee that batteries within ERCOT can quickly recharge during winter storms as solar underperforms and ice could lead to wind projects going offline.

“Winter price spikes in ERCOT are shorter, more chaotic and often tied to sudden generator outages,” Murray said.

The volatility of wind resources in winter, paired with the greater chance of thermal outages, are the difficult parts of wintertime within ERCOT, Nygaard said.

And given that ERCOT is isolated from the rest of the U.S. grid, there often aren’t any power imports during winter weather emergencies to recharge Texas’ batteries. Additionally, it’s harder to predict during these months what extra types of energy support may be needed, according to Murray, which complicates revenue modeling and presents business risk for the developers.

Even so, developers are still racing to connect battery projects to ERCOT.

Here is your week in numbers.

BY THE NUMBERS

►$530/MW-day

The capacity price that would have cleared in the PJM Interconnection’s latest auction if it hadn’t set a temporary price cap of $333.44/MW-day — still a record high. The price cap was agreed to as part of the grid operator’s negotiations with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, D, who has threatened to pull his state out of PJM over skyrocketing prices (a feat easier said than done, according to some). The auction results increase pressure on state utility regulators to create new tariff structures to ease concerns about shifting costs from data centers to other utility customers, analysts said.

►20 GWh

The anticipated annual capacity of Ford’s new stationary energy storage business it plans to launch in 2027 after overhauling its electric vehicle strategy. The automaker says it will invest around $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business. It will convert plants in Kentucky and Michigan to produce lithium iron phosphate batteries, including 5 MWh+ battery energy storage systems and 20-foot DC container systems of the type used by data centers, utilities and large-scale industrial and commercial customers. It also plans to manufacture smaller Amp-hour cells for residential energy storage units.

►12.9 GW/36.2 GWh

Storage capacity installed in the U.S. over the first three quarters of 2025, according to the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie. That is already more than the 12.3 GW installed in all of 2024, which was a record. Despite near-term year-over-year declines in the utility-scale and residential segments, the report projects 92.9 GW of storage will be installed in the U.S. over the next five years. “[T]he market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong,” said Allison Feeney, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

►$280M

The cost of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s ongoing “settlement adjustment” of its most recent capacity auction after discovering a software coding error that affected its planning reserve margins. Independent power producers have challenged that adjustment and asked FERC to reverse it, arguing that it amounts to an illegal “rerun” of the auction. MISO rejects that characterization. “MISO is not rerunning or resettling the [auction], nor will it take new bids or establish a new auction clearing price,” it said. Instead, it is applying an “appropriate adjustment” using corrected values consistent with the tariff, it said.

Why data centres are now an air quality issue

Data centres were not a major regulatory concern when much of the Clean Air Act’s stationary source framework was developed in the 1990s.

Today, they sit at the intersection of several regulatory pressure points.

Large numbers of stationary diesel and gas-fired generators, often permitted as emergency backup, are increasingly run for grid support.

Combustion turbines are being deployed for on-site or near-site power.

Facilities are clustering geographically, creating cumulative air quality impacts, and there is growing tension between ‘temporary’ or ‘emergency’ classifications and near-continuous operational realities.

For regulators, this creates uncertainty over how to apply New Source Performance Standards, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, and Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements.

The new EPA webpage is explicitly designed to reduce that uncertainty, but largely by clarifying how existing rules are interpreted rather than by strengthening or modernising them.

Regulator resources

This section centres on stationary engines and turbines, reflecting the reality that power provision, not computing hardware, is the dominant air quality issue for data centres.

It links to existing rules governing NOₓ, SO₂, particulate matter, and hazardous air pollutants from combustion sources, particularly those classified as emergency or non-emergency generators.

For monitoring specialists, this reinforces where regulatory scrutiny will continue to sit: stack emissions, fuel choice, operating hours, and compliance verification.

What is notable is the absence of new guidance on persistent monitoring gaps, such as real-world generator run-time verification or aggregated emissions accounting across multi-building data centre campuses.

Air permitting resources

The air permitting section aggregates historical EPA guidance documents, interpretive letters, and responses to state-level permitting questions.

Its importance lies not in introducing new standards, but in codifying precedent.

Developers and permitting authorities can now more easily see how EPA has historically interpreted its statutory obligations and where flexibility has been allowed.

For environmental monitoring professionals, this suggests continued demand for defensible modelling, emissions inventories, and reporting that supports permit applications and demonstrates compliance under PSD thresholds, rather than a shift toward more stringent or real-time measurement requirements.

Modelling guidance documents: why PSD still matters

The modelling section points users to EPA’s Guideline on Air Quality Models, including the agency’s preferred dispersion models for use in PSD permitting.

Despite repeated references to streamlining, this confirms that air quality modelling remains the primary gatekeeper for data centre development.

Model choice, emissions assumptions, meteorological data, and input quality will continue to determine whether projects trigger major source thresholds.

For those supplying or operating monitoring systems, this sustains demand for high-quality emissions data that can support or validate modelling outcomes.

Cooperative federalism in practice

EPA has strongly emphasised cooperative federalism, presenting the webpage as a tool to help states, Tribes, and developers align more easily on Clean Air Act requirements.

OAR staff have also committed to case-by-case consultation with permitting authorities and individual facilities.

In practice, this points toward greater decentralisation rather than uniform deregulation.

For monitoring professionals, it suggests a more fragmented regulatory landscape in which state-level decisions matter more, monitoring requirements may diverge significantly by jurisdiction, and instrumentation strategies need to be adaptable rather than standardised.

This is particularly relevant in regions where multiple data centres are being developed in close proximity and cumulative impacts are politically contested.

What the EPA is not addressing

The announcement repeatedly notes that many Clean Air Act requirements date back to the 1990s and have not kept pace with technological change.

However, the agency’s response stops short of a substantive update to emissions standards or monitoring expectations.

There is no new guidance on continuous emissions monitoring for generator fleets, no explicit framework for assessing cumulative regional impacts from clustered development, no linkage between air permitting and longer-term decarbonisation trajectories, and no commitment to expanding public or community-facing access to monitoring data.

The emphasis is on permitting efficiency rather than expanding the environmental intelligence base underpinning regulatory decisions.

Implications for environmental monitoring professionals

For those working in air quality and emissions monitoring, the launch of this resource is more about demand signals than new obligations.

Permitting-driven monitoring and modelling support are likely to remain growth areas. Instrumentation that supports generator emissions characterisation will stay relevant for as long as backup power remains fossil-based.

There is likely to be increased emphasis on defensible data that satisfies regulators, rather than denser or more precautionary measurement networks.

At the same time, community groups and Tribes may seek independent monitoring to counterbalance developer-led assessments, creating parallel demand outside formal permitting processes.

The Clean Air Act Resource for Data Centres is best understood as a stabilisation measure.

It reduces regulatory ambiguity at a moment when data centre construction is accelerating, electricity demand is rising, and political pressure to prioritise AI infrastructure is intensifying.

For environmental monitoring professionals, it does not fundamentally change how air quality compliance works.

What it does change is the pace. Projects are likely to move faster, with less tolerance for experimental monitoring regimes or precautionary approaches.

The unresolved question is whether future air quality impacts linked to data centre growth will be easier to prevent, or simply easier to permit.",https://www.envirotech-online.com/assets/file_store/pr_files/66410/thumbnails/images/600w_lee-zeldin-US-EPA.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 13:59:42.333436

This year in energy has been an absolute blur. We started with President Donald Trump’s declaration of a federal energy emergency, saw the gutting of clean-energy tax credits, and finished with an Election Day where affordability took center stage.

Now, with 2025 almost behind us, let’s rewind and revisit the 10 stories that defined this year.

Trump declares an energy emergency

On his first day in office, Trump set course for a total revamp of the American energy landscape. Step one: Citing rising power demand to declare a national emergency on energy, all while freezing funds for clean energy programs. Trump proceeded to use that ​“emergency” to prop up fossil fuels — more on that below.

Interior Department halts — then restarts — Empire Wind construction

The Trump administration’s laser focus on killing offshore wind became impossible to ignore when, in April, it ordered Empire Wind to stop work. The turbines off New York had only been under construction for a few weeks, and the stop-work order was eventually lifted. The story essentially repeated itself a few months later with the nearly complete Revolution Wind project.

The Department of Energy forces coal plants to stay open

In May, the U.S. DOE cited its ​“emergency” to force Michigan’s J.H. Campbell coal plant to run past its retirement date. That order has been extended twice, and so far, the plant has racked up more than $100 million in costs for utility customers. The DOE later ordered other soon-to-retire fossil-fueled plants to keep operating.

The ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” guts clean energy incentives

On the Fourth of July, Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was big but certainly not beautiful for clean energy. The legislation took an axe to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and its tens of billions of dollars in funding for the energy transition.

Nuclear gets a federal boost

At least one carbon-free power source has been exempt from Trump’s hit list. The administration has elevated nuclear power as a solution to rising power demand, including by promoting the restart of some retired nuclear plants. It’s also poured funding into the development of small modular reactors and other next-generation technologies.

Batteries have a stellar year, again

Energy storage was also spared the Trump administration’s wrath, though tariffs and ​“foreign entity of concern” rules will likely weaken the industry. Still, the U.S. installed 12.9 GW during the first three quarters of the year, already beating 2024’s total installed capacity of 12.3 GW.

EVs’ record quarter and collapse

Federal tax credits for EV purchases went out with a bang. In the three months before their expiration at the end of September, the U.S. saw nearly 440,000 new EVs hit the roads, smashing the past quarterly sales record. But now that we’re in a post-incentive world, EV sales have sunk.

Blue-state climate grants slashed

One of the Trump administration’s biggest attacks on clean energy came in October, when the DOE moved to claw back nearly $8 billion in grants for climate and energy projects, largely in states that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. The Justice Department later admitted in a court filing that those states’ politics put them in the administration’s crosshairs.

Data center opposition reaches a fever pitch

Data centers and their potential to use huge amounts of energy became a top concern in 2025, especially in hot spots like Virginia and Texas. State legislatures introduced close to 200 bills regarding data centers this year, with about 50 aimed at incentivizing their development, and others targeting their impact on the environment and on electricity costs for other consumers.

Energy affordability defines state elections

Democrats swept this year’s few statewide elections, many of which centered on rising energy prices. Both New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger campaigned on promises to tackle spiking energy costs, and the two Democrats who won seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission said they’d push to build more clean, cheap energy.

More big energy stories

Ford trades EV ambitions for battery storage

From electrifying its bestselling F-150 to building a massive manufacturing complex in Tennessee, Ford once aspired to lead the EV transition. That all changed this week as the company announced it will incur nearly $20 billion in charges to extricate itself from its EV investments. That Tennessee facility, known as BlueOval City, will build gas-powered trucks in lieu of electric models, and production of the F-150 Lightning will end.

But as Ford backs away from EVs, it’s entering a new market. The automaker will repurpose its Kentucky EV battery facility to build grid-scale batteries instead. As Canary Media’s Julian Spector put it, Ford is essentially copying Tesla’s game plan to expand into storage — but without an EV stronghold to fall back on, it could be a risky move.

Another coal plant restart — and more to follow?

As you read above, the Trump administration’s coal plant restarts are a huge piece of its fossil-fuel-boosting agenda, and we got two more updates on that front this week. On Tuesday, the DOE ordered Unit 2 of TransAlta’s Centralia, Washington, coal power plant to stay open for the next 90 days. TransAlta has been planning since 2011 to shutter the facility, and was prepared to do so this month to comply with a Washington state law prohibiting coal burning that takes effect next year.

A similar situation may soon play out in Indiana, Canary Media’s Kari Lydersen reports. Two coal plants in the state are supposed to close this month, but their owners have told regulators they anticipate orders from the Trump administration will keep the facilities running.

Also this week: The U.S. House passed a bill that will broaden the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s authority to keep power plants online past their scheduled retirements.

“While folks are feeling the impact of higher prices across the board, a rate increase like this obviously hurts low-income customers more than anyone else.","RICHMOND, Va. – This week the State Corporation Commission approved another utility rate hike, this time for gas distribution company Virginia Natural Gas (VNG).

VNG requested the rate increase (its third in the last six years) due to capital costs associated with system growth as well as other investments, including its environmental justice initiatives.

SELC represented Appalachian Voices, The New Virginia Majority, and Virginia Organizing in the SCC proceeding. The groups opposed the requested rate hike and asked that the Commission require VNG to take measures to improve its environmental justice efforts, including by protecting low-income rate payers from disproportionate impacts from rate increases like the one proposed. Additionally, they asked the Commission to investigate the marketing practices driving VNG’s growth.

“Here you have a gas company wanting to increase its delivery charge by more than 25%, and it’s not considering or making meaningful efforts to blunt the impact on low-income communities—communities that everyone knows will be hit the hardest,” said Elizabeth Putfark, associate attorney at SELC. “That’s flatly inconsistent with the Environmental Justice Act. Meanwhile, VNG wants to keep doing the very thing that’s driving up rates—expanding. And it’s fueling that expansion with advertising that misinforms people about the price of gas relative to cleaner, cheaper electric alternatives.”

Ultimately, the Commission approved a lower rate increase than VNG initially proposed, accepting the modified revenue requirement stipulated to by both VNG and SCC staff. As a result, customers will receive a refund, plus interest, for the interim rates they have paid since January 1, 2025. But the Commission stopped short of requiring the Company to take any steps to protect low-income and historically marginalized communities from suffering disproportionate burdens due to the rate hike.

“This decision locks in higher bills for working families while offering them no new protections,” said Carl Poole, New Virginia Majority organizer for Norfolk. “A one-time refund doesn’t fix a system that keeps asking low-income customers to pay more without a safety net.”

“Virginia Organizing is disappointed by the SCC’s decision in the Virginia Natural Gas rate case. Our members are already struggling with their energy bills and cannot afford another increase, even if marginally less than requested by the utility,” said Patrice Smallwood, chairperson of Virginia Organizing’s State Governing Board member of its Norfolk chapter. “We’re also sad to see our environmental justice concerns largely dismissed. Seemingly, utility companies need only make a performance of environmental justice to satisfy the law when substantive action is what is really required.”

“It is disappointing to see yet another utility rate increase approved,” said Appalachian Voices’ Director of State Energy Policy Peter Anderson. “While folks are feeling the impact of higher prices across the board, a rate increase like this obviously hurts low-income customers more than anyone else. We will continue to push for systemic changes that make energy cleaner and more affordable for everyone.”",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SELC_Logo_Horizontal_Social.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 16:03:08.977798

Ferdi De Ville is Professor of European Political Economy at the Ghent Institute for International and European Studies, Department of Political Science, Ghent University. He is one of the promoters of the BE-WISE project.

On 30 December 2025, the rules of the European Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA) for auctions related to the deployment of renewable energy sources enter into force. For Belgium, this will affect the auction for offshore wind energy in the Princess Elisabeth Zone. In this blog post we explain the rules around the innovative resilience criterion in the NZIA that must be applied in this tender.

‘The future of our clean tech industry has to be “Made in Europe”.’ That is how European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen summed it up in her 2023 State of the Union address.

She was responding to concerns that the EU could become as dependent on imports for clean energy technologies as it recently was on Russian natural gas. Import dependency for those technologies would make Europe geopolitically vulnerable and threaten the competitiveness of its industry.

Production of solar panels almost completely disappeared from Europe fifteen years ago and moved to China. In batteries, China has also acquired a dominant position, which in turn gives it a head start in manufacturing electric vehicles.

The wind industry is currently still a European success story. But China is rapidly catching up there too. It accounts for roughly 70% of global installation and manufacturing of wind turbines. China is conquering overseas markets and is now trying to sell its turbines in Europe as well. At the same time, Europe’s wind industry is under pressure from higher prices and interest rates and uncertainty over demand.

To ensure that Europe retains a sufficient industrial base for manufacturing clean energy technologies and to avoid excessive import dependency, the EU adopted the NZIA in June 2024. This law provides that by 2030 the Union must produce 40% of the clean energy technologies it installs itself, and, in doing so, secure a 15% global market share.

To achieve that, the NZIA requires Member States to take into account criteria other than price in their public procurements and auctions for deploying renewable energy sources.

The precise rules that governments must take into account are complex. In this blog post we explain the rules for auctions, which are especially relevant to the Belgian federal government’s offshore wind policy.

New conditions in auctions

Article 26 of the NZIA stipulates that Member States must include various non-price criteria (NPCs) in renewable energy auctions.

They must include pre-qualification criteria relating to corporate social responsibility, cybersecurity and data security, and the ability to complete the project in full and on time. With a pre-qualification criterion, breaching the rule results in exclusion of a bid.

Member States must also take into account the auction’s contribution to the Union’s sustainability and resilience, and may choose to include these as pre-qualification or award criteria. With an award criterion, breaching the condition costs the bidder points in that evaluation category.

The NZIA stipulates that in the coming years Member States must apply these criteria to at least 30% of the amount of renewable energy they auction each year—or at least 6 gigawatts per year if that is lower.

If applying these NPCs in a particular auction would, however, lead to a disproportionate cost increase of more than 15%, or to too few bids, then Member States are not obliged to apply the criteria (the Commission will publish guidance on how to demonstrate such disproportionate cost increases).

By the end of 2027 the European Commission will assess the effects of deploying these criteria, followed by a new evaluation every two years. If that evaluation is positive, the Commission may decide to extend the share of auctions in which the criteria must be applied or raise the required cost increase threshold that can justify an exception.

Although other NPCs can also help strengthen Europe’s clean tech sector, the resilience criterion is the most direct instrument the NZIA uses to counter excessive European import dependency.

Definition of resilience

The NZIA considers European resilience to be at risk when more than 50% of EU supply of a clean energy technology, or a key specific component thereof, comes from a third country. Resilience is also deemed at risk when supply reaches 40% and has increased by an average of at least 10 percentage points for two consecutive years.

Member States must take resilience into account in auctions for clean technologies and components for which these import dependency limits have been exceeded. Each year the European Commission will publish figures on the origin of technologies and components on the European market.

It did so for the first time in June 2025 for 25 end-products and components for which relevant information was available. For six technologies or their main components, there appears to be a dependence of at least 50% on imports from a third country. As shown in Table 1, in all cases this concerns imports from China.

Table 1 End-products and components for which supply dependency from a third country > 50%

Final product or component

Share of supply from China

Photovoltaic (PV) solar panel systems 79% PV modules, cells or similar 94% PV inverters 50% PV wafers or similar 79% Permanent magnets in wind turbines 93% Battery packs, modules or cells 50% Anode active materials in batteries 81%

Excluding end-products and components from China

In May 2025 the European Commission published an implementing regulation clarifying exactly what conditions Member States must impose on bidders for auctions in which the resilience criterion is applied.

If the above-mentioned supply dependency limit has been exceeded for final products of the auctioned clean technology, the implementing regulation stipulates that final products may not come from that third country. For certain technologies, the regulation also sets limits on the use of components, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2 Rules for components where excessive supply dependency exists for the end-product

Final product

Rules on key components

Solar panels

At least four components not from the third country

Inverters, cells and modules not from the third country

Wind turbines

No more than three (four for offshore) components from the third country

Direct-drive drivetrain (incl. generator) and/or geared drivetrain (incl. generator) not from the third country

Electrolyser installations

No more than two components from the third country

The electrolyser stack not from the third country

Heat pumps

No more than one component from the third country

Anticipation in the wind sector

For wind turbines and electrolysers, the supply dependency limit is currently not exceeded. At present, for example, 97% of all wind turbines installed in the EU are also manufactured within the Union.

Nevertheless, in its implementing regulation the Commission decided that the rules from the previous section also apply to final products and components of wind turbines and electrolysers originating from China, for at least 75% of the end-products in a given tender.

In doing so, the Commission clearly aims to anticipate the risk of future conquest of the European market by Chinese wind turbines and electrolysers.

Impact on the Princess Elisabeth Zone

The rules on NPCs in auctions take effect on 30 December 2025. In Belgium, the resilience rule will affect for the first time the auction for the first lot of the Princess Elisabeth Zone (PEZ1).

The launch of that auction was postponed in 2025 by the federal Minister of Energy, Mathieu Bihet, to the first quarter of 2026, which brings it under the NZIA rules.

Belgium is required next year to apply the NZIA NPCs to at least 30% of the renewable energy capacity it auctions. With an envisaged capacity of 700 MW, it seems inevitable that these criteria will be applied in PEZ1.

Concretely, this means the federal government will have to include the following resilience conditions in its tender:

At least 75% of the turbines used must not come from China

In at least 75% of the turbines used, no more than four key components may come from China and the drivetrains must not come from China

No more than 85% of the permanent magnets used in the turbines may come from China

The Belgian government may choose to include these conditions as pre-qualification or award criteria. If it opts for the latter, the weight of these conditions must be at least 5% of the final score, and the combined weight with sustainability conditions must lie between 15% and 30%.

In making these choices, the government must weigh strengthening European resilience against the feasibility and affordability of the project.

The auction for the Princess Elisabeth Zone thus becomes a first test case for applying the NZIA rules.

In a next blog post on the NZIA we will examine the resilience rules in public procurement, for example for the installation of solar panels on a municipal swimming pool. In the final post of this series we will discuss in detail the trade-offs involved in deploying these rules.",https://www.ugent.be/logo.png,N,,2025-12-19 19:00:22.310441

These unique competitive advantages have contributed to billions of dollars in announced clean hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol projects in Louisiana.
Louisiana’s Clean Hydrogen Task Force Recognizing this momentum, the Louisiana Legislature created the Clean Hydrogen Task Force through HCR 64 during the 2024 session.
Its charge was clear and ambitious: evaluate Louisiana’s opportunities for clean hydrogen and recommend strategies to accelerate the state’s clean hydrogen economy.
Hydrogen reinforces Louisiana’s energy economy and clean hydrogen opens new economic pathways tied to emerging global demand for low-emission commodities.","Hydrogen is already a critical input to the U.S. economy, used extensively in refining, ammonia production, and methanol manufacturing industries. These sectors rely on hydrogen at scale to produce transportation fuels, fertilizers, and chemical feedstocks that underpin global energy and agricultural systems. Traditionally, most hydrogen is produced using emissions-intensive processes integrated into existing industrial operations. In recent years, however, clean hydrogen, defined by its lower lifecycle emissions, has gained traction because of its versatility across a wide range of end uses, from high-temperature industrial processes to heavy-duty transportation, as well as its growing role in the international markets. Clean hydrogen brings significant opportunity to attract new industries, support high-quality jobs, improve local air quality, and strengthen U.S. global competitiveness.

These opportunities are especially relevant for Louisiana, where a strong industrial base, existing hydrogen demand and production capacity, and significant geological storage potential create a compelling foundation for clean hydrogen deployment and long-term growth. Louisiana has the ingredients to become one of the country’s most competitive clean hydrogen leaders. Few states have a hydrogen ecosystem as mature as Louisiana’s. Today, the state is already one of the nation’s top hydrogen producers and consumers due to the concentration of refining, ammonia production, and methanol facilities. According to our recent U.S. hydrogen demand assessment, with a total dedicated hydrogen production of almost 2.5MMT, Louisiana ranks #1 nationally in both dedicated hydrogen production and ammonia production capacity, #2 in refining capacity, and #3 in hydrogen production for petroleum refining, while also being one of the nation’s leading methanol-producing states. These industries have spent decades building expertise, workforce depth, and safe infrastructure that translate directly into an advantage for scaling clean hydrogen.

This strong industrial base is paired with another major asset in the state: carbon capture and sequestration. Louisiana leads the nation in Class VI well applications and sits on world-class geology for permanent carbon dioxide storage. Combining a robust hydrogen industry with unparalleled CCS potential positions Louisiana to lead on clean hydrogen production and deployment. These unique competitive advantages have contributed to billions of dollars in announced clean hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol projects in Louisiana.

Louisiana’s Clean Hydrogen Task Force

Recognizing this momentum, the Louisiana Legislature created the Clean Hydrogen Task Force through HCR 64 during the 2024 session. Its charge was clear and ambitious: evaluate Louisiana’s opportunities for clean hydrogen and recommend strategies to accelerate the state’s clean hydrogen economy. The 17-member Task Force was comprised of agencies, utilities, industry, economic development organizations, and nonprofits, including CATF as a member. Over 18 months, the group met regularly, hearing from project developers, academics, and state and federal officials to develop a set of recommendations intended to accelerate clean hydrogen in the state.

Key findings and recommendations

The Task Force voted for unanimous adoption of its report and sent it to Governor Jeff Landry at the beginning of December 2025, with a clear message that hydrogen has potential to grow in Louisiana and its production and deployment should be supported. Hydrogen reinforces Louisiana’s energy economy and clean hydrogen opens new economic pathways tied to emerging global demand for low-emission commodities.

These recommendations fall into three major policy buckets:

State leadership. Sustained state agency coordination on hydrogen and ongoing engagement with the federal government offers benefits to Louisiana as incentives and regulatory frameworks evolve.

Economic development. The state can develop action plans to identify priority end uses, expand workforce training, and prepare for infrastructure build-out aligned with industry needs and demand.

Regulatory clarity. Louisiana can adopt a clear, credible definition of clean hydrogen for market clarity and strengthen regulatory capacity for efficient and safe project reviews and permitting. Aligning this definition with emerging international standards for low-carbon hydrogen would also help position Louisiana to compete in expanding export markets.

CATF sees real opportunity and meaningful impact in moving a few of these recommendations forward that are ready for implementation. In particular, the strategic economic development plan has significant potential to align near-term project announcements with long-term growth opportunities and infrastructure planning, tying together production hubs with local and global offtake. Expanded regulatory capacity would help the state evaluate projects quickly and responsibly.

Looking ahead

As the Legislature prepares for the upcoming session, advancing the Task Force’s recommendations will be critical for translating momentum into action and ensuring Louisiana captures the full breadth of benefits of a growing hydrogen industry. Louisiana has a real chance to lead, but doing so will require clear direction, strong state leadership, and sustained commitment. The state’s competitive advantages are significant: a built-in hydrogen market, deep CCS expertise, existing pipeline and port infrastructure, an experienced workforce, and a growing pipeline of projects. Companies and investors have already proposed billions in projects for clean hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol investments. The question now is whether the state will put the policies into place that enable this opportunity to flourish.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/19100703/louisiana-industry.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 16:00:39.833964

Josh Stein visited Old Fort on Thursday to highlight $270 million in federal funding that will go toward water infrastructure projects in areas hit by Hurricane Helene.

Nearly five-dozen water and septic system projects in 26 western counties will receive funding through the state Department of Environmental Quality. The funds are part of a total of $685 million appropriated by Congress last December to help communities in North Carolina rebuild their water and sewer infrastructure to be more resilient to future flood events.

Old Fort will receive a total of $15 million — including $5 million for sewer repair and $10 million for water line improvements.

Most of the projects will take years to complete. Stein said the increasing frequency of major flood events makes it vital for local communities to rebuild with resiliency in mind.

“We have to be better prepared to withstand these storms when they hit our state,” he said at the event at the McDowell Technical Community College Workforce Education Center. “Projects like this one in Old Fort is just one example of how DEQ is incorporating resilience into that recovery work.”

State Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson and Old Fort Mayor Pam Snypes joined Stein at the event.

“Old Fort is not alone,” Wilson said. “All across the mountains, towns have experienced major damage to their drinking water systems, their wastewater systems, their septic systems. Here, it washed away portions of the water distribution system and the wastewater collection systems in several areas. And it was just kind of amazing to see that extent of devastation.”

Old Fort aims to improve a total of 23,600 linear feet of water lines and 5,500 linear feet of sewer infrastructure. Snypes said the funding will be transformational for the town.

“It’s not going to be a fast process,” Snypes said. “But once it’s completed, the town of Old Fort’s water and sewer system will be one of the best in Western North Carolina.”

Where else the money is going

Among the other recipients highlighted by the governor’s office:

Chimney Rock Village (Rutherford County) will receive $2.7 million for a drinking water system resiliency project, $5 million for a new wastewater treatment plant and sewer resiliency improvements, and $4 million to extend sewer lines to connect homes with septic systems.

Western Piedmont Council of Governments will receive $7.5 million to repair 300 Helene-damaged and failed septic systems in Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Mitchell, Watauga, Wilkes, and Yancey counties.

Town of Burnsville (Yancey County) will receive $8.2 million for drinking water supply and distribution improvements and nearly $4.9 million for Hickory Lane and West Glendale Avenue sewer line improvements.

Town of Clyde (Haywood County) will receive $4.3 million for a drinking water system interconnection with the Towns of Canton and Waynesville, and $5 million for wastewater system resiliency improvements.

Town of Crossnore (Avery County) will receive nearly $5.4 million for drinking water system resiliency improvements and nearly $5 million for wastewater system resiliency improvements.

The full list of recipients can be found here.

Two more deadlines for additional funding are coming up in January and March. Local governments can apply through the state Department of Environmental Quality.

FEMA reimbursement delays

Stein also said he and members of the state’s congressional delegation will continue to push the federal government to pick up the “incredibly slow” pace of FEMA reimbursements for local municipalities that are struggling after having to use their own funds to cover the cost of disaster recovery.

There is currently about $1 billion worth of funding that has been expended by local governments and is currently awaiting FEMA review, Stein said. The requirement by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that all expenses over $100,000 must receive her personal approval has created “an additional layer of red tape,” he noted.

“We have been championing our local governments that put money out the door with the full expectation that FEMA would reimburse them. … What happens is it just immediately builds back up, because it’s taking too long for that review to happen,” Stein said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e6cf2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2F01%2F16b229594d1490f2c23cb66c66f3%2Fimg-7557.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 12:59:34.836934

As technology leaps forward, clear and fair regulations must keep pace to support advancement, help prevent price volatility, and promote competition, ultimately benefiting consumers by keeping electricity costs manageable, FERC said.

“Today’s order is a monumental step towards fortifying America’s national and economic security in the AI revolution, while ensuring we preserve just and reasonable rates for all Americans. I look forward to tackling more of these critical national issues with my colleagues in the New Year,” said Chairman Laura Swett.

Locking Up Power Plants

Thursday’s order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Talen Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, according to the Associated Press.

Utilities argued colocation allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid.

Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.

In addition to the Talen Susquehanna nuclear power plant, energy companies have been buying or locking up existing power plants to serve A.I. data centers, including--

We Need Every Electron

There is no doubt the soaring demand for energy from A.I. data centers is already bringing Pennsylvania’s electric grid perilously close to being unreliable, as the results of the PJM capacity auction this week show.

Tom Rutigliano, Natural Resources Defense Council, said ""Summer 2027 will be the first time in PJM’s history it expects to not have enough power to reliably meet demand because of new data center forecasts and the ongoing risk of fossil fuel [natural gas] generators failing during winter storms. Read more here.

""This auction leaves no doubt that data centers’ demand for electricity continues to far outstrip new supply, and the solution will require concerted action involving PJM, its stakeholders, state and federal partners, and the data center industry itself,” said Stu Bresler, PJM Executive Vice President – Market Services and Strategy, who becomes chief operating officer on Jan. 7. Read more here.

PUC Commissioner Kathryn Zerfuss said-- “So we all know that we have many challenges as it relates to energy supply and demand, and the gap between supply and demand is just growing more and more every day.

“We totally maintain that we have to take advantage of every single molecule and electron we can from all energy sources, whether it's solar, wind, for our electric grid.” Read more here.

The Order

In the order, the Commission finds PJM’s tariff unjust and unreasonable due to a lack of clarity and consistency in the rates, terms, and conditions that apply to interconnection customers serving co-located load and eligible customers taking transmission service on behalf of co-located loads.

PJM’s tariff is unreasonable because it does not account for transmission services where eligible customers can manage energy withdrawals for co-located load.

FERC directs PJM to revise its tariff to require its eligible (transmission) customers serving co-located load to choose from several transmission service options.

“Clarifying new rules will help release the bottleneck of large load investments across the PJM footprint,” said Chairman Swett.

FERC also directs PJM to report, by January 19, 2026, on the status of its proposals to speed up the addition of generating capacity, including--

-- Expedited interconnection process for shovel-ready projects,

-- Changes to PJM’s reliability backstop mechanism for resource shortfalls, and

-- Enhanced load forecasting and demand flexibility measures to identify new capacity needed for system reliability.

""We take credit for cleaning up the lake and are so excited for people to go out and enjoy our beautiful lake,"" Trail said.
That effort led to the creation of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, the organization that later became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.
Those early efforts laid the groundwork for the monitoring and restoration work the Pontchartrain Conservancy focuses on today.
""Our goal is to work with teachers teaching earth sciences to build hyper-local activities so they can teach about the wetlands in south Louisiana,"" Trail said.","Long before she ran Pontchartrain Conservancy, Kristi Trail was a kid on the lakefront, swimming in water most people learned to avoid because of its pollution. Even so, that early connection to the lake shapes the work that led to her 2025 Inspirit Award.

Trail has served as the executive director of the Pontchartrain Conservancy for nine years. The award recognizes her work protecting the water, land and communities across the 16 parishes in the Pontchartrain Basin.

During her tenure, the organization has nearly doubled its staff from 16 to more than 30, reflecting its expanding environmental and education work.

As the organization has grown, Trail keeps returning to the thought that first drew her to this work: how people are able to experience the lake itself.

Trail says that when it comes to lakefront swimming, the northshore has easier access than the southshore which is complicated because of the amount of infrastructure.

That access question, she said, is part of a larger conversation about reconnecting people with the lake — a conversation that often leads to Lincoln Beach, a place many residents haven’t been able to access for decades.

Trail is pleased that the city of New Orleans is working hard to reopen Lincoln Beach, which is expected to be done in 2026, because the space holds a significant place in New Orleans’ history. Established in 1938, it provided a haven for the Black community. For Trail, its reopening represents a step toward restoring not just access, but the relationship people once had with the lake.

""We take credit for cleaning up the lake and are so excited for people to go out and enjoy our beautiful lake,"" Trail said.

Trail remembers the ""Save our Lake"" campaign that started in 1989, when a group of residents and scientists came together to raise concern of the region's environmental challenges. That effort led to the creation of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, the organization that later became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.

Those early efforts laid the groundwork for the monitoring and restoration work the Pontchartrain Conservancy focuses on today. One of Trail’s goals is for the lake to become top of mind again for people in south Louisiana. She believes the organization’s long-term water-quality improvements are helping move it in that direction.

""Sometimes people don't even think about the lake because they don't look at it,"" she said. ""We want to make it beautiful — to make it something people want to look at.""

Since 2001, Pontchartrain Conservancy has released weekly water-quality reports to help residents understand conditions at swimming spots and other recreational areas around the basin.

""The lake is a very dynamic system,"" Trail said. ""It changes on a daily basis, but on a long-term trend, it's good and improving.""

But Trail and her staff are using their resources to educate and inform beyond the shores of Pontchartrain by offering teacher training across the state. The trainings focus on a variety of water issues — from marine debris, the effect of microplastics, water quality, types of flooding and more.

The staff development classes usually take place on Saturdays at the Lighthouse Museum — or in schools across Louisiana. Teachers receive a $100 stipend for participating in the training, plus a kit of supplies to take back to their classrooms.

""Our goal is to work with teachers teaching earth sciences to build hyper-local activities so they can teach about the wetlands in south Louisiana,"" Trail said.

She said the number of students visiting the interactive Lighthouse museum for hands-on programs continues to grow each year.

""Under Kristi's leadership, Pontchartrain Conservancy was awarded an EPA Gulf Guardian Award (given to agencies making positive impacts on the Gulf of Mexico's health) for its work in STEM education in 2024, showing how impactful this work is not just in Louisiana but across the Gulf coast,"" wrote board chair Dickie Brennan in his nomination of Kristi Trail for the Inspirit Award.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/9c/79c21f9e-ea6d-42da-bd68-c5369d7d3bf8/693b3df16cfc2.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C925%2C0%2C176&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-19 13:00:15.541546

“LNG prices will likely have to decline significantly as this oversupply builds to incentivize additional demand,” they said.
“O’Neill’s successor might rewrite Woodside’s gas playbook — a probability that could weigh on sentiment until the future path is clear,” analyst Anthony Chen said in a note.
That approach has helped Woodside become a larger player in the global gas market.
Woodside Chief Operating Officer Daniel Kalms and Chief Commercial Officer Mark Abbotsford are among potential picks, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s deliberations.","The surprise exit of Woodside Energy Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Meg O’Neill leaves her successor with a dilemma: should the Australian company continue down the path she set of promoting massive liquefied natural gas projects when forecasts point to a glut and lower prices?

O’Neill had been a forceful advocate for two major projects: Browse — a long-delayed plan to tap vast offshore reserves in Western Australia — and an expansion of the company’s export terminal in Louisiana, which is still under construction. Her stance reflected a company forecast for a 50% jump in global LNG demand over the next decade — one of the most bullish in the industry.

But with O’Neill now set to helm oil major BP Plc in April, Woodside’s incoming CEO will need to decide whether to stay the course as a record wave of global LNG supply is poised to flood the market and drag down prices for the remainder of the decade. Coupled with a surplus of oil, Woodside will face growing questions from investors about why it is doubling down on fossil-fuel expansion at a time when supply is abundant.

“The board and the new CEO can now rethink the value destructive Browse project, which is more expensive than 70% of competing potential new gas supplies around the world, as well as the expansion of Louisiana LNG,” the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, or ACCR, said in a statement on Thursday.

At the core of the debate is the future role of natural gas. O’Neill and other industry leaders argue that gas will help coal-dependent nations transition to a cleaner-burning fossil fuel while providing reliable backup for intermittent renewable power.

However, that outlook isn’t guaranteed. Volatile LNG prices have pushed some emerging nations to rethink their reliance on imports — Pakistan, for instance, is stepping back from LNG as households and businesses turn rapidly to solar. Others, including India and China, are leaning on cheaper coal to bolster energy security and keep costs down.

Global LNG supply is set to jump by more than 50% by 2030 from 2024, far more than demand growth in recent years, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts including Daan Struyven said in a note on Thursday. “LNG prices will likely have to decline significantly as this oversupply builds to incentivize additional demand,” they said.

That creates some uncertainty over Woodside’s long-term strategy, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “O’Neill’s successor might rewrite Woodside’s gas playbook — a probability that could weigh on sentiment until the future path is clear,” analyst Anthony Chen said in a note.

Still, O’Neill has said that she looks at making decisions that will pan out over decades, and won’t get derailed by short-term market trends. According to a note from Bernstein, she has taken a disciplined approach relative to peers, exiting several green-hydrogen and renewables projects based on weakened demand, and refocused efforts on LNG.

That approach has helped Woodside become a larger player in the global gas market. She has cleared a path for North West Shelf — a sprawling LNG export plant that earlier this year was granted clearance to continue operating until 2070. And she oversaw the approval of the Scarborough offshore field, which is expected begin shipments during the second half of next year.

One of O’Neill’s last acts was restructuring the company’s LNG trading desk, including hiring a new head from Equinor ASA, to better withstand lower prices and market the wave of new supply, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Several contenders for the top job have already been mooted in industry circles. Woodside Chief Operating Officer Daniel Kalms and Chief Commercial Officer Mark Abbotsford are among potential picks, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s deliberations. The senior vice president for M&A, Dan Hamilton, could also be in the running, said another industry source who has worked closely with the company.

For now, Australian Chief Operating Officer Liz Westcott is running Woodside as interim CEO. The company is looking at internal and external candidates and plans to announce a permanent appointment in the first quarter, it said on Thursday.

The new chief will be tasked with lining line up another equity partner for Woodside’s $17.5 billion Louisiana LNG project and keep the company’s foray into Mexico on track as the Trion development moves toward producing oil later this decade.

On top of that, they will have to face increasingly vocal opposition from climate campaigners and the company’s own shareholders. At a meeting in May, protesters repeatedly interrupted O’Neill’s opening address by blowing on whistles, while a year earlier Woodside investors rejected the company’s climate strategy in a non-binding vote.

“Woodside has been persistently unresponsive to shareholder concerns,” the ACCR said. “Investors will be hoping that O’Neill’s departure is a circuit breaker on Woodside’s habit of pursuing high-capex, marginal fossil fuel projects, and is an opportunity to instead start focusing on better capital returns.”

How does a CfD auction work?
CfD contracts are awarded through annual auctions or ‘Allocation Rounds’.","Annual clean power auctions, known as Allocation Rounds, are the primary way the Government unlocks investment in new offshore and onshore wind, solar and tidal energy projects. Successful projects are awarded ‘Contracts for Difference’ (CfDs) to generate clean power.

What is the CfD scheme?

The Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme is the Government’s main mechanism for unlocking investment in low-carbon electricity generation. It’s essentially an auction for power contracts between generators and Government. Since its introduction in 2014, the CfD scheme has been hugely successful in supporting the expansion of homegrown clean energy, driving down costs to consumers and incentivising technological innovation.

In fact, it’s been so successful many countries around the world have subsequently copied it, with the EU in the process of finalising regulations to ensure national-level support schemes across Europe follow the two-way CfD model.

In the UK, the 20-year CfD contracts awarded via the auction are between a low carbon electricity generator (e.g. a developer of a solar farm) and the Government-owned Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC). Developers of new clean energy projects bid in a competitive auction to receive a contract which guarantees a fixed price for the electricity they generate.

Allocation Round 7 (AR7) refers to the seventh allocation round of the CfD scheme. The results for this latest round will be announced by the Government in January and February 2026.

How do CfDs benefit consumers?

The electricity market is highly volatile and the market price can change dramatically, so a mechanism to ensure stability is desirable to both protect consumers and provide a stable revenue stream for investors. CfD contracts address this by agreeing a fixed ‘strike price’, which represents the price the project will receive for each megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity it generates during the contracted period.

This strike price is then measured against the market price of electricity over the course of the contract. When the market price is higher than the strike price, the generator pays back the difference to the consumer via the LCCC. When it is lower, the LCCC tops up the generator via electricity bills.

By fixing prices, CfDs also significantly reduce the risk investors are exposed to. This reduction in risk lowers the costs of financing projects by enabling capital to be borrowed on more favourable terms, making wind farms cheaper than they would be otherwise. This is vital as a huge amount of the costs of renewable energy projects are up-front capital costs (i.e. manufacturing and building the wind farms), with remaining costs over the lifetime of the project much lower than other sources of generation (largely because, unlike nuclear and gas plants which pay for their fuel, the wind is free).

Recent analysis has found that a future UK electricity system, and Europe-wide system, powered by offshore wind is lower cost for billpayers than alternatives, including unabated gas.

How does a CfD auction work?

CfD contracts are awarded through annual auctions or ‘Allocation Rounds’. To enter an auction, developers need to satisfy the eligibility requirements and confirm the size of their project, the year it will start delivering power and, most importantly, a sealed bid stating the price they can provide each MWh of electricity their project produces at – the strike price.

The Government caps the maximum a project can bid by setting the highest price it is willing to offer, known as the ‘Administrative Strike Price’ (ASP), which a developer cannot bid above. The Government then awards contracts to bidders with the lowest strike price(s) until the auction budget has been spent. Crucially, sealed bids keep prices low by ensuring developers cannot see the bids of other projects.

What is the budget?

The budget is set by the Government and acts as a means of controlling the total number of projects that can secure contracts within a given auction. It is a limit on the number of projects that can win a CfD, rather than a fixed cost.

Somewhat confusingly, the budget is not a reflection of how much the projects will actually cost, the impact of the projects on public spending, or the total impact on consumer bills.

The budget is rather dictated by the difference between the strike price and an estimate of the average market price for electricity for renewable energy, known as the ‘reference price’. When the reference price is low, the budget needed to support a given project is higher, and vice-versa.

In reality, however, the actual market price of electricity will vary (and is typically much higher than the ‘reference price’ used to set the budget). Whilst we don’t have a crystal ball, meaning future CfD costs and precise consumer benefits will always be unknown at the time of the auction, the fixed price hedges against this uncertainty.

What is the significance of AR7?

Ahead of AR7, the UK has a record amount of offshore wind capacity eligible to bid in - more than 20 gigawatts - which could attract up to £53 billion in private investment in the UK economy.

This year’s auction has seen significant delays compared to previous years, due to a series of reforms to the CfD process, including the introduction of 20-year contracts.

Besides providing lower-cost clean electricity, a successful AR7 that maximises investment in renewable energy projects will bring many wider benefits to the UK, including:",https://www.renewableuk.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-19 16:00:44.198820

The American energy infrastructure stands at a crossroads where bureaucratic complexity intersects with urgent national economic imperatives. Federal permitting processes designed decades ago now govern energy projects essential for economic competitiveness, national security, and energy independence. This regulatory framework, originally conceived to protect environmental resources, has evolved into a labyrinthine system that can delay critical infrastructure for years. Understanding permitting reform in U.S. energy sector initiatives requires examining both current bottlenecks and proposed solutions.

The Multi-Decade Timeline Problem in Energy Project Approvals

Energy infrastructure development in the United States faces unprecedented delays through federal approval processes. These delays cascade through the economy, affecting everything from regional job creation to national energy security. The permitting bottleneck affects multiple energy sectors simultaneously, creating compound effects on investment confidence and project viability.

Current federal permitting timelines vary significantly across energy sectors, but all face substantial delays compared to private sector project development speeds. Natural gas pipeline projects often require multiple years for federal review, while transmission line approvals can stretch even longer due to complex interstate coordination requirements.

The economic ripple effects extend beyond immediate project costs. Delayed infrastructure investments affect regional economic development, manufacturing competitiveness, and energy price stability. Investment capital allocated for energy projects often sits idle during extended review periods, reducing overall economic productivity.

NEPA's Unintended Consequences on Energy Security

The National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 established environmental review requirements for major federal actions affecting environmental quality. While the legislation achieved important environmental protection goals, its implementation has created unintended barriers to energy infrastructure development critical for contemporary economic needs.

Modern energy projects face environmental review processes designed for a different technological and economic era. The 1970 legislation could not anticipate current challenges like artificial intelligence data center power demands, renewable energy integration requirements, or global supply chain vulnerabilities affecting critical minerals and energy security.

Multiple federal agencies often conduct parallel environmental reviews for the same project, creating duplicative processes that extend timelines without necessarily improving environmental outcomes. These overlapping reviews reflect institutional structures rather than environmental necessity, consuming both public and private resources inefficiently.

What Does the SPEED Act Actually Change in Federal Energy Policy?

Congressional action on permitting reform represents a significant shift in federal energy policy priorities. The Standardising Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, known as H.R. 4776, passed the House of Representatives in December 2025 with bipartisan support, indicating growing recognition that permitting modernisation serves national economic interests.

Standardisation Framework for Environmental Reviews

The legislative approach focuses on process efficiency rather than environmental standard elimination. The framework establishes consistent timelines across federal agencies while maintaining environmental protection requirements. This standardisation aims to create predictable investment timelines for energy infrastructure developers.

Federal agencies would operate under coordinated review schedules, eliminating duplicative environmental assessments that currently extend project timelines. The legislation requires agencies to establish firm deadlines for environmental review completion, providing investment certainty that has been lacking under current processes.

Technology-neutral permitting standards would apply equally across energy sectors, from natural gas infrastructure to renewable energy projects. This approach avoids favouring particular energy technologies while ensuring all projects face consistent regulatory expectations.

Bipartisan Fractures and Political Implementation Challenges

The legislation's House passage demonstrated some bipartisan support, with Republican Chairman Bruce Westerman of Arkansas as primary sponsor and Democratic Representative Jared Golden of Maine as co-sponsor. However, Senate prospects remain uncertain, reflecting ongoing political divisions over federal regulatory roles.

Industry coalition support spans multiple energy sectors, but environmental organisations oppose aspects of the legislation they believe could weaken environmental protections. This opposition creates political pressure on Senate Democrats who must balance environmental constituency concerns with economic development interests.

State-level regulatory interactions complicate federal reform implementation. Energy projects often require both federal and state approvals, meaning federal permitting acceleration provides limited benefits if state processes remain slow. Coordination between federal and state regulators will determine reform effectiveness.

Which Energy Sectors Stand to Benefit Most from Permitting Modernisation?

Permitting reform impacts vary across energy sectors based on current regulatory bottlenecks and infrastructure development needs. Natural gas infrastructure faces some of the most complex federal approval processes, making this sector a primary beneficiary of streamlined reviews.

Natural Gas Infrastructure and Export Capacity Expansion

Natural gas pipeline development requires extensive federal coordination due to interstate transportation routes and environmental crossing requirements. Current approval processes can delay pipeline projects for years, limiting natural gas market access and export capacity expansion.

Ed Longanecker, president of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, emphasised that comprehensive permitting reform represents a strategic imperative for the oil and natural gas industry. Without streamlined approvals, American energy production cannot operate at the pace needed to meet domestic demand or support international allies.

Export facility development faces particularly complex approval processes involving multiple federal agencies. Liquefied natural gas terminals require coordinated environmental reviews covering marine impacts, air quality, and safety considerations. Furthermore, the impact of trade war market impact considerations has made streamlined federal coordination even more critical for accelerating LNG export capacity development.

Regional economic development benefits concentrate in energy-producing areas where pipeline infrastructure creates construction employment and ongoing operational jobs. States like Texas, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia would see significant economic impacts from accelerated natural gas infrastructure development.

Electric Grid Modernisation and Transmission Line Development

Transmission infrastructure represents another major beneficiary of permitting reform due to complex interstate coordination requirements. High-voltage transmission lines often cross multiple state boundaries and federal land holdings, requiring extensive environmental review coordination.

National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors could benefit significantly from streamlined federal approvals. These designated corridors aim to address transmission bottlenecks limiting renewable energy development and grid reliability improvements.

Grid modernisation projects essential for integrating renewable energy sources face current permitting delays that slow clean energy deployment. Transmission infrastructure development enables renewable energy resource areas to connect with population centres requiring clean electricity.

Critical Minerals and Domestic Supply Chain Security

Domestic mining projects face extensive federal permitting requirements that have contributed to American dependence on foreign mineral supplies. Critical minerals essential for battery production, renewable energy technologies, and defence applications often require lengthy environmental reviews.

Strategic mineral independence requires accelerated domestic production capacity, but current permitting timelines discourage mining investment. Reform could balance environmental protection with national security priorities in critical mineral development through comprehensive mining permitting insights.

Supply chain vulnerabilities exposed during recent global disruptions highlight the importance of domestic mineral production capacity. Streamlined permitting could facilitate strategic mineral development while maintaining appropriate environmental safeguards.

How Do Recent FERC and DOE Regulatory Changes Support Reform Goals?

Federal agencies have begun implementing permitting improvements independently of comprehensive legislative reform. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Department of Energy have initiated process improvements that complement broader reform objectives, particularly following recent executive order on permits initiatives.

Agency-Level Implementation of Permitting Acceleration

FERC has modified certain construction authorisation procedures to reduce regulatory delays for natural gas infrastructure projects. These administrative changes demonstrate agency recognition that current processes create unnecessary bottlenecks without improving environmental outcomes.

The Department of Energy has implemented NEPA process improvements for projects under its jurisdiction, including renewable energy developments on federal lands and critical mineral assessments. These changes reflect agency adaptation to contemporary energy development needs.

Interagency coordination improvements have begun addressing duplicative review processes that extend project timelines. Better coordination between agencies reduces redundant environmental assessments while maintaining comprehensive environmental protection.

Judicial Review Limitations and Legal Certainty Measures

Post-approval challenge procedures represent a significant concern for energy infrastructure investors who face legal challenges years after receiving federal approval. Reform measures aim to establish clearer timelines for legal challenges while preserving legitimate environmental review rights.

Federal court jurisdiction consolidation could reduce forum shopping for environmental challenges while ensuring appropriate judicial review continues. Concentrated jurisdiction creates more predictable legal processes for major energy infrastructure projects.

Investment protection through regulatory stability provisions encourages private sector infrastructure investment by reducing post-approval regulatory uncertainty. These protections balance environmental review rights with investment security needs.

What Economic Impacts Can Industry Expect from Comprehensive Reform?

Economic analysis of permitting reform in U.S. energy sector suggests significant investment acceleration and job creation potential across energy-producing regions. Reform benefits would flow through construction employment, operational jobs, and increased tax revenues for federal and state governments.

Investment Flow Acceleration and Capital Deployment

Private sector confidence depends heavily on regulatory predictability, which current permitting processes fail to provide. Streamlined timelines would encourage infrastructure investment by reducing regulatory risk premiums that currently discourage project development.

Infrastructure investment multiplier effects amplify direct construction spending through supply chain purchases, equipment manufacturing, and service sector expansion. Energy infrastructure projects create particularly strong multiplier effects due to high capital requirements and specialised equipment needs.

Regional economic development benefits concentrate in areas with significant energy resources and infrastructure development potential. Rural communities often benefit substantially from energy infrastructure projects through construction employment and long-term tax revenue increases.

Consumer Cost Implications and Energy Affordability

Energy infrastructure development affects consumer costs through improved supply capacity and market competition. Additional pipeline capacity reduces transportation bottlenecks that can create regional price disparities for natural gas and electricity.

Longanecker noted that permitting delays create real economic consequences for American families through higher energy costs and elevated manufacturing expenses. ""Streamlined approvals could reduce these cost pressures through faster infrastructure deployment,"" he emphasised.

Long-term energy affordability benefits from improved infrastructure capacity outweigh short-term implementation costs. Enhanced energy transportation and generation capacity typically reduces consumer costs over infrastructure asset lifespans.

How Does Growing AI and Data Centre Demand Drive Reform Urgency?

Artificial intelligence development and data centre expansion create unprecedented electricity demand growth, adding urgency to energy infrastructure permitting reform. These technologies require reliable baseload power that current grid infrastructure cannot provide without significant expansion.

Exponential Power Consumption Growth from Digital Infrastructure

Data centre electricity consumption projections indicate dramatic increases through 2030, driven by artificial intelligence computational requirements and expanding digital services. This demand growth exceeds current grid capacity in many regions, requiring substantial infrastructure investment.

Natural gas generation provides the reliable baseload power essential for data centre operations, making natural gas infrastructure development critical for supporting digital economy growth. Permitting delays that restrict natural gas capacity could limit American technological competitiveness.

Grid stability challenges arise from concentrated high-demand facilities that stress regional transmission systems. Current permitting processes slow the infrastructure development needed to support these new electricity demands.

Technology Sector Advocacy for Regulatory Modernisation

Corporate energy procurement strategies increasingly focus on reliable electricity supply for data operations, creating technology sector interest in energy infrastructure development. Major technology companies now actively advocate for streamlined energy permitting to secure necessary power supplies.

Longanecker specifically highlighted growing power needs from AI-driven data centres as increasing demand for U.S. natural gas production. This technological demand shift creates new constituencies supporting energy infrastructure development.

International competitiveness concerns arise when regulatory delays limit American capacity to support advanced technology development. Countries with more efficient permitting processes could attract technology investment that requires substantial energy infrastructure.

What Challenges Could Derail Federal Permitting Reform Implementation?

Reform implementation faces significant obstacles despite legislative progress and industry support. Complex federal-state regulatory relationships, environmental organisation opposition, and institutional resistance could limit reform effectiveness.

State-Federal Regulatory Coordination Complexities

Overlapping jurisdiction between federal and state agencies creates coordination challenges that could limit reform benefits. Energy projects often require both federal and state approvals, meaning federal streamlining provides limited advantages if state processes remain slow.

Environmental justice concerns in disadvantaged communities require careful consideration during streamlined review processes. Reform implementation must address community concerns without recreating lengthy review processes that defeat efficiency objectives.

Tribal consultation requirements for projects affecting indigenous lands represent another coordination challenge requiring sensitive handling. These consultations serve important sovereignty recognition purposes while potentially affecting project timelines.

Environmental Group Opposition and Legal Challenge Strategies

Environmental organisations oppose aspects of permitting reform they believe could weaken environmental protection standards. This opposition creates political pressure against reform implementation and potential legal challenges to streamlined processes.

Litigation strategies could target specific aspects of reformed permitting procedures, potentially creating new delays through court challenges. Environmental groups have extensive experience using judicial review to slow energy infrastructure development.

Alternative reform proposals from conservation organisations focus on renewable energy prioritisation rather than technology-neutral streamlining. These alternative approaches compete with comprehensive reform objectives.

How Does U.S. Permitting Reform Compare to International Best Practices?

International comparisons reveal that many countries achieve faster energy infrastructure development through more efficient permitting processes. These examples provide models for potential American reform while highlighting implementation challenges alongside broader mining industry evolution trends.

European Union's Integrated Infrastructure Planning Model

Single-window approval systems in several EU countries consolidate environmental reviews under unified coordination, reducing duplicative processes that delay projects. These systems maintain environmental protection while improving process efficiency.

Cross-border project coordination mechanisms facilitate international energy infrastructure development within EU frameworks. These coordination systems provide models for interstate project management within American federal systems.

Renewable energy priority corridors in European countries demonstrate streamlined approvals for strategic infrastructure. While focused on renewable energy rather than technology-neutral approaches, these systems show streamlining possibilities.

Canada's Impact Assessment Modernisation Framework

Indigenous consultation integration within Canadian environmental assessment represents a model for addressing similar American requirements involving tribal nations. Canada's approach balances consultation requirements with process efficiency.

Provincial-federal coordination mechanisms in Canada provide examples of managing overlapping jurisdictions that parallel American state-federal coordination challenges. These systems demonstrate institutional solutions for multi-level governance.

Timeline certainty provisions in Canadian systems protect investor interests while maintaining environmental review integrity. These investor protection measures could inform American reform implementation approaches.

What Implementation Timeline and Milestones Should Industry Track?

Reform implementation will occur gradually through legislative passage, agency rulemaking, and operational changes. Industry participants should monitor specific milestones that indicate implementation progress and effectiveness.

Short-Term Regulatory Changes and Agency Preparations

FERC rule finalisation schedules will indicate agency readiness to implement streamlined procedures for natural gas and transmission projects. These administrative changes can proceed independently of comprehensive legislative reform.

DOE permitting pilot programs could provide early demonstrations of reformed procedures for renewable energy and critical mineral projects. Pilot results will inform broader implementation approaches and identify necessary adjustments.

Congressional action timelines for comprehensive legislation remain uncertain as the bill moves to Senate consideration. Industry should monitor committee activity and sponsor statements indicating legislative progress.

Long-Term Infrastructure Development Pipeline Acceleration

Project queue processing improvements at federal agencies will provide measurable indicators of reform effectiveness. Reduced backlogs and faster processing times will demonstrate reform benefits for infrastructure development.

Regional transmission planning integration with federal priorities could accelerate grid modernisation projects essential for renewable energy deployment and system reliability improvements. These planning processes operate on multi-year timelines requiring sustained coordination.

Investment commitment timelines and construction milestone tracking will ultimately measure reform success through actual infrastructure development acceleration. Private sector investment responses will indicate whether regulatory improvements achieve intended economic outcomes.

Conclusion: The Path Forward for Energy Infrastructure

The path forward for permitting reform in the U.S. energy sector depends on sustained political support, effective agency implementation, and successful coordination between multiple levels of government. While challenges remain significant, growing recognition of economic and security benefits from streamlined permitting creates momentum for meaningful change.

As Longanecker emphasised, comprehensive permitting reform in U.S. energy sector serves as a strategic imperative that unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures American energy leadership in global markets. The ultimate success of these efforts will depend on translating legislative intent into operational improvements that actually accelerate critical infrastructure development while maintaining appropriate environmental safeguards.

State environmental officials have deemed over 20 of the refinery's pollution events in 2025 as ""extremely hazardous.""

Just days ago, the state required fenceline sensors be installed at the refinery.

After more than 30 pollution incidents this year, over 20 of which the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control deemed ""extremely hazardous,"" another sulfur dioxide incident has occurred at the Delaware City Refinery.

According to Delaware Environmental Release Notification System reports, a large gas compressor ""tripped off line,"" causing around 1,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide to be released Dec. 14. ""The release is ongoing during the flare event,"" the report says.

A Dec. 15 report says a ""compressor failure is causing intermittent flaring at the refinery"" and releasing greater than 100 pounds per hour of sulfur dioxide when flaring. Refinery officials told DNREC the intermittent flaring ended that day, DNREC spokesperson Nikki Lavoie said.

A few days prior, on Dec. 12, in an event that may or may not be related to the sulfur dioxide releases, the refinery's hourly carbon monoxide limit was exceeded for six hours, according to the DERNS report. This event was not deemed ""extremely hazardous,"" like the sulfur dioxide releases, by DNREC.

Refinery officials did not immediately respond to a request for more information sent early Dec. 17.

The refinery is owned by PBF Energy, ""one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and suppliers of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants and other petroleum products in the United States,"" the company website says. The Delaware City refinery processes up to 180,000 barrels of crude oil per day, according to the website.

On Oct. 30, PBF reported its third quarter 2025 income from operations at $285.9 million. The company is run by Matt Lucey, president and CEO.

What are the effects of the pollutants released?

Sulfur dioxide is a gas. Short-term exposures can harm the human respiratory system and make breathing difficult, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. People with asthma, especially children, are most sensitive to these effects, the EPA says.

Carbon monoxide gas reduces the amount of oxygen that can be transported in the blood stream, the EPA says. At high levels that are unlikely to occur outdoors, it can cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death. Elevated levels of carbon monoxide outdoors are most concerning for people with certain types of heart disease, according to the EPA.

Pollution events at the Delaware City Refinery

The Delaware City Refinery has had far more pollution events than any other entity in the state this year.

On March 25, a carbon monoxide boiler at the refinery was shut down for about 10 hours, causing the emission of roughly 262,185 pounds carbon monoxide, 38,145 pounds of sulfur dioxide emissions and other chemicals. DNREC found the refinery to have violated four administrative laws and permit conditions in that incident, which was caused by employee error, according to the notice of violation. This event was not deemed ""extremely hazardous.""

Between May 25 and June 11, an issue with the same carbon monoxide boiler caused the refinery to emit hundreds of tons more sulfur dioxide (about 470 tons total) than it is permitted to release in an entire year, along with a slew of other chemicals. The refinery violated seven administrative laws and permit conditions in that incident, a notice of violation said. This event was deemed ""extremely hazardous.""

While DNREC has issued notices of violations to the refinery for the above events, fines have not been assessed thus far. Numerous other pollution events have occurred at the refinery this year that have not, or at least not yet, been addressed by notices of violations.

On Oct. 17, over 100 pounds of hydrogen sulfide and about 2,500 pounds of sulfur dioxide were released during a 15-minute flaring event at the refinery, DERNS says.

On Nov. 27, the refinery reported a release of butane ""equal to 1,000 pounds"" per hour occurred, caused by a mechanical failure, according to DERNS. However, following an internal investigation, the refinery reported Dec. 12 that the release occurred for 19 hours between Nov. 26 and 27. In that instance, refinery employees used handheld detection devices to determine the source of the leak, the DERNS report says.

Because the butane release ""was significantly more extensive than initially reported,"" a DNREC news release said, the department demanded the refinery install fenceline sensors. There likely was and is no public health concern due to the butane release, but the sensors are needed because ""the incident occurred for a significant period before refinery operators were aware of it"" and ""the public had no opportunity at the time to evaluate potential impacts from the release while it continued,"" the news release said.

The following ""extremely hazardous"" incidents also occurred at the refinery this year but have not been the subject of notices of violations or fines.

In an Aug. 2 incident, about 94 pounds of sulfur dioxide was released due to a ""compressor failure.""

In a June 27 incident, 100 pounds of sulfur dioxide was released ""due to a mechanical failure.""

In a Jan. 25 incident, there was ""a release of (carbon monoxide) over 1,000 parts per minute within a one-hour period.""","https://www.delawareonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/03/PWIL/84015991007-p-03-delaware-refinery.jpg?crop=3399,1912,x0,y177&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-19 12:59:21.383587

While many analyses of the new administration’s policy regime have explored tariffs or immigration separately, none has modeled their combined effects. Using our global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we assessed the long-run economic effects of these policies in tandem—effects both on the U.S. national economy and specific U.S. industries.

There is a long-standing consensus among economists about the adverse aggregate effects of increasing tariffs and reducing labor supply. Over time, tariffs introduce inefficiencies by raising the costs of goods and reducing the competition faced by domestic businesses. Reduced immigration limits the overall number of available workers, raising labor costs for businesses and, ultimately, prices for consumers.

Such adverse aggregate-level outcomes, however, do not necessarily hold for all industries. When it comes to the U.S. oil and gas industry, our analysis shows a clear picture: Trump administration efforts to reduce the number of undocumented workers and raise tariff rates will likely combine to reinforce the domestic competitiveness of U.S. oil and gas, boost domestic oil and gas manufacturing, and expand opportunities for U.S.-based suppliers and workers.

For oil and gas companies, service providers, and manufacturers, the coming years represent an opportunity to grow and visibly consolidate their contribution to domestic energy and economic security. For community and state leaders, the challenge and opportunity is to develop reliable hubs of skilled domestic labor attractive to oil and gas employers. Workforce development, vocational training, and targeted incentives could bolster the number of people entering the workforce and draw investment to geographic areas prepared to respond.

U.S. Oil and Gas Set to Benefit

Our modeling shows the U.S. oil and gas industry is set to expand as a result of these policy changes, leading to significant increases in domestic spending. Annual output is projected to rise by $7.6 billion (+2.1 percent), accompanied by an increase of 3,200 jobs (+2.6 percent). This growth will generate an additional $4.1 billion (+3.1 percent) in annual purchases of U.S.-made goods and services.

The following chart summarizes the net effect of Trump administration policy changes on sales and employment in the oil and gas industry, breaking down the anticipated impacts in terms of immigration policy effects—assumed to result in a reduction of approximately 4.5 percent in the U.S. low-skilled labor supply by 2028—and tariff policy effects.

Our analysis shows that as imported inputs become less cost-competitive, oil and gas companies will be able to expand supplier networks and source more domestically, reducing dependency on overseas markets and supporting American manufacturing.

In this new policy landscape, oil and gas companies have a chance to broaden supplier networks, expand investment in U.S. goods and skills, and diversify their procurement within the United States. For U.S. regions, especially those with advanced manufacturing or skilled labor bases, this is a moment to attract new energy-related investment. Targeted policy tools such as tax credits, infrastructure upgrades, and workforce training programs could ensure these benefits are widely distributed. Economic development officials at the regional, state, or municipal level have an immediate opportunity to identify where these gains are most likely to materialize and ensure that suppliers, workforce programs, and infrastructure are ready to support them.

Local Supply Chain Participation Is Geographically Uneven, But Growing

As the oil and gas industry expands its spending and investment in the US, the next question becomes where those opportunities will take root and how the benefits of growth can be more geographically distributed. Our state-level analysis of 2023 data from the IMPLAN Group shows that most oil and gas manufacturing purchases are concentrated in Texas and California, while service-based spending is distributed more evenly across the United States. As domestic spending increases, there is an opportunity to strengthen and expand supply chains across a wider set of states, creating a more competitive, resilient, and community-connected U.S. oil and gas industry.

Geographically diversifying supply chains would benefit U.S. energy companies in several ways. A broader manufacturing base would lower costs over time by increasing supplier competition, shortening transport distances, and reducing socioeconomic risk through stronger local engagement. Companies that source more broadly within the United States also stand to gain a greater social license to operate, as new investments translate into visible benefits for more communities.

With this significant scope for U.S. manufacturing diversification, local and regional authorities have a clear opportunity to position their workforces and industrial bases to participate in this growing national market. According to recent research, approximately 47 million people (about 14 percent of the U.S. population) live within 1 mile of fossil fuel energy infrastructure. These communities represent a ready network of potential partners and beneficiaries for expanded sourcing by a growing oil and gas industry; energy companies looking to extend their supply bases beyond traditional hubs are likely to find supportive partners among the states and municipalities positioned to host new facilities, train skilled workers, and capture the benefits of policy-driven domestic investment.

Moving Forward

By strengthening its local supply chains and investing in U.S. skills and manufacturing, the energy industry can enhance its resilience, competitiveness, and contribution to national growth. We will be monitoring the emerging policy and market environments to understand what they mean for companies, governments, and communities across the United States, helping our partners turn these insights into actionable strategies for smarter planning, better risk mitigation, and long-term value creation.

P&G was brought in to permanently decommission these wells. This three-month undertaking was an essential step towards allowing the coal power plant conversion initiative to continue after being stalled due to the presence of these unplugged wells.

Throughout 2025, P&G has successfully executed on several opportunities to conduct infrastructure-improvement work, which differs from P&G's typical plug and abandonment jobs done for government and corporate clients. This type of work typically entails plugging wells for the specific purpose of unlocking business value (e.g., enabling new commercial builds to take place, mitigating ongoing costs from non-hazardous wells, etc.). Earlier this year, P&G completed these types of projects for clients that include a major defence/aerospace contractor, as well as a global e-commerce conglomerate.

Ed Longanecker, president of TIPRO, said permitting reform is essential for the U.S. energy sector to meet growing domestic and international demand.
He said prolonged federal reviews have delayed critical infrastructure projects, with broader economic impacts.
Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs,” he said, adding that growing power needs from AI-driven data centers will further increase demand for U.S. natural gas.
“For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is mission critical,” Longanecker said.","(WO) — The Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) welcomed passage of H.R. 4776, known as the SPEED Act, by the U.S. House of Representatives, calling the legislation a critical step toward reforming federal permitting for energy infrastructure.

The bill seeks to streamline environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, a process industry groups say has contributed to years-long delays for oil, natural gas and infrastructure projects. TIPRO has publicly supported the legislation, which now awaits action in the U.S. Senate.

Ed Longanecker, president of TIPRO, said permitting reform is essential for the U.S. energy sector to meet growing domestic and international demand.

“On behalf of our nearly 3,000 members, TIPRO applauds the passage of H.R. 4776 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Comprehensive permitting reform is a strategic imperative for our country and industry. Without it, America’s energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad, or ensure long-term affordability for consumers,” Longanecker said.

He said prolonged federal reviews have delayed critical infrastructure projects, with broader economic impacts.

“For too long, federal infrastructure approvals have languished in bureaucratic limbo, with critical energy projects delayed by years due to duplicative reviews, inconsistent agency coordination, and open-ended legal challenges,” he said.

Longanecker also tied permitting delays to rising energy costs and future demand from data centers and artificial intelligence development.

“Permitting paralysis has real-world consequences. American families feel it at the gas pump. Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs,” he said, adding that growing power needs from AI-driven data centers will further increase demand for U.S. natural gas.

The SPEED Act—formally titled the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act—was introduced in July by House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and co-sponsored by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME). The bill proposes clearer definitions for federal actions under NEPA, firm timelines for environmental reviews and limits on legal challenges after final agency decisions.

“For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is mission critical,” Longanecker said. “It unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures that the United States remains a reliable energy partner to the world.”

TIPRO urged the Senate to take up the legislation, though prospects for passage remain uncertain heading into 2026.",https://www.worldoil.com/media/oqvb2zsj/courthouse-325x180.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 12:01:44.407395

When including those who spent a portion (but not the majority) of their time on solar-related work, total employment rises to 370,556 jobs. With battery storage jobs factored in, the broader solar + storage workforce reached 464,053 workers in 2024.

Breakdown of workforce and sector growth

The largest share of jobs, 178,713, were in installation and project development, nearly two-thirds of all solar employment.

Other segments included manufacturing (32,491 jobs), wholesale trade & distribution (34,625 jobs), and operations & maintenance (21,833 jobs).

Notably, battery/storage employment increased: clean-storage jobs grew 4% year‑over‑year, rising by 3,905 positions to a total of 93,497 workers in 2024.

The census draws from data collected from 42,800 U.S. energy‑sector firms (with roughly 10,900 providing full responses) during late 2024 and early 2025. This gives a comprehensive snapshot across all 50 states.

Why employment held steady and why uncertainty looms

The 2024 job figures come before the full impact of 2025’s major federal policy changes, including the repeal of some tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). IREC notes this year’s census provides a critical baseline to monitor how those changes will affect clean‑energy employment going forward.

Federal incentives and tax credits have long supported solar growth across installation, manufacturing, and distribution segments. As those supports shift, the economic feasibility of new projects may be tested, potentially impacting hiring, project pipelines, and overall market momentum.

Geographic and political patterns

Contrary to perceptions that solar jobs are concentrated in “blue” states, 2024 saw notable workforce growth in several traditionally Republican states:

Ohio — +5%

Georgia — +4.5%

Utah — +3.5%

Texas — +3% (solarpowerworldonline.com)

States with the largest overall solar employment remained California, Florida, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts. For the fourth consecutive year, Nevada led in solar jobs per capita.

Broader context: solar and storage remain among the biggest clean‑energy employers

Even with employment leveling off, solar (and solar + storage) remains one of the largest clean‑energy employers in the United States. The sector still supports more jobs than coal and is second only to energy efficiency among clean-energy fields.

In a 2025 analysis, some industry observers noted that while total renewable‑energy employment in the U.S. remains robust, growth has moderated compared with previous years — reflecting both broader economic headwinds and policy uncertainty.

What’s next: Why 2025 and beyond are critical

With the OBBBA and related policy changes now in effect, 2025 may be a turning point for solar employment. IREC recommends using the 2024 census data as a baseline for tracking job impacts, project slowdowns, or recovery, depending on how the market adjusts.

Key factors to watch:

Whether reduced incentives lead to project cancellations or delays

How storage deployment and new technologies offset disruptions in solar installation work

Regional shifts in solar investment and state-level policy support

Power demand takes off At the same time, the need for new power is growing fast.
Onshore wind: Western states lead Onshore wind continues to do the heavy lifting.
Arkansas recently brought its first utility-scale onshore wind farm online with Cordelio’s Crossover Wind (pictured).
“US wind turbine pricing is experiencing unprecedented uncertainty as conflicting market and regulatory forces interact,” said Garcia da Fonseca.","After a sluggish stretch, US wind is heading into a pivotal moment, with a near-term rebound colliding with rising power demand, tariffs, and stubborn permitting bottlenecks.

US wind power: the next five years

The US is expected to add more than 7 gigawatts (GW) of new wind capacity in 2025, a 36% increase from this year, according to the latest US Wind Energy Monitor report from Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

That matters now because the US power grid is under mounting pressure, just as new generation has become harder to build. Electricity demand is rising for the first time in years, mainly driven by data centers and other large loads, while wind developers are navigating higher turbine costs, tariff uncertainty, and permitting delays. How quickly projects can move from the pipeline to completion over the next few years will shape whether wind can help keep the lights on and power prices in check.

Over the longer term, the outlook is steady but increasingly back‑loaded. The report still sees 46 GW of new wind capacity coming online between 2025 and 2029. What has changed is timing. More projects are now expected to reach completion in the middle of the decade, with 2026 and 2027 shaping up to be especially busy years at 10.7 GW and 12.7 GW, respectively, as projects move through the development pipeline.

That shift helps explain why installations lagged earlier this year. Wind additions in Q3 came in at 932 megawatts (MW), about 23% below forecasts. But activity is picking up fast. Developers have about 3.8 GW queued for Q4 2025 alone, which would account for 52% of the year’s total expected capacity. That kind of late-year rush is typical for wind projects, which tend to reach completion toward the end of the calendar year.

There are also signs of life on the manufacturing side. US turbine order intake rebounded in Q3 to pre–Trump’s big bill act levels, with more than 2 GW of firm commitments, the strongest quarter in the past nine months, and a 79% jump from the previous quarter. But you wouldn’t know it, because turbine makers are increasingly keeping project details close to their chests, and much of the qualifying “start-of-construction” activity is happening off-site through component manufacturing.

Looking further out, the report flags a noticeable slowdown toward the end of the decade. Capacity additions in 2029 are expected to drop sharply following project cancellations and inactive designations, largely due to permitting challenges and broader development constraints.

Power demand takes off

At the same time, the need for new power is growing fast.

After a decade of mostly flat electricity demand, US power demand is now expected to grow by around 3% per year through 2029, compared to just 0.7% over the previous decade. Data centers alone are expected to drive about 59 GW of the roughly 90 GW increase in peak demand. That kind of round-the-clock load makes more wind power a necessity.

“The US power market is facing mounting strain after a decade of flat demand, with utilities committing to 160 GW of large-load additions,” said Leila Garcia da Fonseca, Wood Mackenzie’s director of research. “This represents a significant opportunity for wind energy, which benefits from strengthened economic fundamentals and a compelling business case driven by its competitively low LCOE.”

But she also warned that higher turbine costs and policy uncertainty could slow down progress in the middle of the decade.

Onshore wind: Western states lead

Onshore wind continues to do the heavy lifting. The five-year onshore outlook remains unchanged at 39.8 GW of new capacity, and the 2025–2027 pipeline already has turbine orders in place for every project. More than 60% of that three-year capacity has either been commissioned or is already under construction.

Western states are leading the charge. Wyoming, New Mexico, and neighboring states are expected to account for about 34% of onshore activity over that period. Big projects are driving the numbers, including Pattern Energy’s 3.5 GW SunZia project in New Mexico, which is set to make the company the top wind installer in 2026, and Invenergy’s 998 MW Towner Energy Center in Colorado, the single largest project expected to come online in 2027.

Wind is also spreading into new territory. Arkansas recently brought its first utility-scale onshore wind farm online with Cordelio’s Crossover Wind (pictured).

Repowering older wind farms remains another bright spot. Wood Mackenzie expects 18 repowering projects to add about 2.5 GW of capacity over the next three years.

Offshore wind: progress, but pressure

Offshore wind is a different story. Wood Mackenzie expects offshore installations to slow in Q4 2025 due to harsh winter weather, pushing some capacity into 2026. Still, projects already under construction are making progress. Vineyard Wind connected 15 turbines in Q3 and delivered 200 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity over the first nine months of the year.

“US offshore wind shows diverging momentum,” Garcia da Fonseca said. “Projects under construction with commercial operation dates in 2026 continue to hit key milestones, but post-2027 developments face potential delays amid constrained wind turbine installation vessel capacity, driving delays and contract terminations.”

The offshore sector is also under growing financial strain – and let’s not forget political attack from the Trump administration – with delays and contract terminations weighing on late-decade projects.

Tariffs are making turbines more expensive

Tariffs remain one of the biggest wild cards for the US wind industry. Wood Mackenzie expects tariffs to push turbine costs higher in 2026 before easing in later years. Overall, US onshore wind capital spending is projected to rise by about 5% through 2029.

“US wind turbine pricing is experiencing unprecedented uncertainty as conflicting market and regulatory forces interact,” said Garcia da Fonseca. While domestic manufacturing capacity could eventually bring prices down, tariffs on raw materials and key components are expected to keep costs elevated in the near term.

In a proposed rule published Dec. 3, EPA says it’s “not changing its position that formaldehyde poses unreasonable risk of injury to human health,” nor that high exposure levels may lead to cancer and other adverse health outcomes.

However, the agency is proposing a “threshold” risk approach that would establish an exposure level below which the agency doesn’t anticipate risk. This would negate previous “unreasonable risk” findings for workers under conditions involving inhalation exposure when using formaldehyde in:

Lawn and garden products

Oxidizing/reducing agent; processing aids, not otherwise listed

Recycling

A colorless, strong-smelling gas, formaldehyde can be found in chemicals, plywood and household items such as glue and paper product coatings. It’s also widely known as a preservative in medical labs and morgues, and used as an industrial fungicide, germicide and disinfectant.

,Detroit Environment,2025-12-19 15:26:54+00:00,Detroit Regional Chamber,"Dec. 19, 2025 | This Week in Government: PSC Approves Data Center Contracts Unanimously",Sabrina Cynova,,,,,https://www.detroitchamber.com/dec-19-2025-this-week-in-government-psc-approves-data-center/,"Brinks said it was disappointing to see the House take the approach on work projects that it did last week.
Last week, the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee unilaterally voted to disapprove $645 million in work projects.
Although its status after the House moved to kill work project funding last week was unclear.
She also acknowledged that it was tough to determine a path forward on remaining legislation following the House’s move last week to defund hundreds of millions of dollars in work projects.
During session on Tuesday, the House passed SB 685, SB 686, SB 687, SB 688, SB 689, SB 690, and SB 699.","The Michigan Public Service Commission on Thursday unanimously approved contracts for DTE Energy Company to power the upcoming hyperscale data center in Saline Township while imposing various conditions on the agreement.

The crowd erupted when public comment was not taken before the decision to approve the contracts, with crowd members calling out that they don’t know the details of the contract. The commission approved the contracts on an ex-parte basis, which means it is not taking input from other parties.

Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remain on opposing sides of the discourse on the data center’s development. Whitmer championed the move, and Nessel claimed the commission, whose members are appointed by Whitmer, has cut corners on the deal.

Mike Byrne, chief operating officer at the commission, said the terms of the contract, which would pay for 1.33 gigawatts of energy over a 15-year period, would include a power supply agreement that would generate an affordability benefit to DTE’s other customers to spread the company’s fixed costs.

He said while many individuals petition the commission to start a contested case, the order would not result in an increase to rates.

Other parts of the conditional approval include a minimum contract duration of 19 years, compared to the standard agreement of five years, a minimum billing demand of 80% of the contracted electricity instead of the standard 50-60%, even if the entire amount of electricity is not used, and a termination payment of up to 10 years’ worth of billing demand if the facility stops operating earlier than contracted.

The commission has also directed the company to file a renewable energy plan, clean energy plan, analysis of the utility’s capacity compared to the data center’s usage need, and an energy waste reduction plan.

Commissioner Katherine Peretick said during comment after anger from the crowd that this was a conditional approval and that their decision was meant to decide if DTE was being “reasonable and prudent.”

She said she was comfortable voting to approve the contracts since their subject matter is within PSC jurisdiction, which is energy supply, not other considerations like water usage, noise pollution, or the merits of artificial intelligence generally.

“The power supply agreement and energy storage agreement are well negotiated, solid contracts,” Peretick said. “They show a net financial benefit to DTE’s other customers of approximately $300 million per year. That is a real cost savings at a time when affordability is so important.”

Peretick said the approval is contingent on DTE agreeing to bear all risks of costs, and if it turns out to be “overly optimistic,” DTE can refile the case as contested.

Commissioner Shaquila Myers said the case was meant to ensure there was sufficient power to serve all customers and individual customers were not subsidizing the data center.

She said all risks associated with collateral will be taken on by DTE, not the customers, and the commission can at any time go back and disapprove of the contracts.

Chair Dan Scripps said PSC approval on ex parte basis is a normal process for the commission. He said he believed the commission is holding itself to a higher standard, saying members don’t take things on faith and want all the facts in front of them.

He said he knows of similar contracts happening in other states, and he puts the DTE contracts on par with or better than other utility contracts.

He said the commission considered the idea of AI as a bubble, saying that even “if this is all overblown, and the load doesn’t materialize,” the customers would still be protected.

Throughout board comment, audience members left yelling about government being in the pocket of big business and worrying about the health of the community with the center.

Byrne also said the commission would approve future applications for battery storage to meet the electricity demand of the data center.

Part of the contract also says in an energy emergency, the data center’s load would be interrupted before interrupting other customers’ service, Byrne said.

The meeting included over an hour of public comments.

Nichole Keway Biber, an organizer for Clean Water Action, said the contract was a “long list of promises of conditionalities” and that the commission should change their name from a public service commission to who she said they actually serve: the governor who appointed them, elected politicians who are acting on returns of investment from their campaign contributors, the chambers of commerce, the big bosses of labor, and union workers and the “tech bro oligarchy.”

Justin Macauley, another commenter, said he didn’t believe the claims that zero costs would be shifted to ratepayers, saying billions for new lines of power don’t just vanish, landing on “families already stretched thin.”

The commissioners did not take questions from reporters after the meeting.

Attorney General Dana Nessel has criticized the commission and called for it to go through a contested case process.

The one public comment hearing before the decision received mixed reviews across the nearly 5,000 public comments.

After the vote, Nessel released a statement saying that while she was relieved to hear the commission had placed some conditions on the DTE application, she was extremely disappointed in the decision to not hold a contested case hearing and wanted more clarity on what the original contracts looked like.

“This secret contract still leaves Michiganders scrounging for hidden and vital details that could harm ratepayers should these AI corporations leave, move out of state, or simply go bankrupt,” Nessel said. “None of the conditions proposed by the commission will bring these terms into public view, including what exit fee provisions might be in effect before December 2027. Rushing approval through an ex parte process lets DTE brush past important questions and shields the utility from the transparency the public deserves, and review by essential consumer protection organizations and offices such as mine, which I take personally as an elected official charged with protecting the consumers of this state.”

On the other hand, Whitmer has trumpeted the project, wanting to move the contracts along quickly.

Whitmer, after the approval, said in a statement the Stargate project “cements our state as the place to pioneer cutting-edge technology and change the world.

“It is the largest economic project in state history, creating 2,500 good-paying union construction jobs, more than 450 good-paying permanent jobs, and more than 1,500 jobs in the surrounding community,” she said, going on to claim it will be one of the most advanced data centers ever built.

“With this project, we are ensuring we can grow our economy while also protecting our environment and precious natural resources,” Whitmer continued. “That’s why we worked with these companies to ensure that Stargate complies with Michigan law and will protect Michigan’s air, land, and water. I’ll keep working with anyone to create good-paying jobs and build a bright future for our state.”

Rep. Morgan Foreman, D-Pittsfield Township, whose legislative district includes Saline Township, released a statement saying she was disappointed in the decision. She said the commission was robbing the people of her community to ask questions and speak with the companies involved.

“I have said from the beginning that approving these contracts without full transparency would set a dangerous precedent,” Foreman said. “This is not ‘doing business with’ a community, which implies a mutual and reciprocal relationship with residents and neighbors; it is forcing themselves onto us, without discussion or review.”

The Michigan League of Conservation Voters said in a statement the state had an opportunity to set a high standard for data center development but fell short.

“The very nature of this conditional approval underscores why Michiganders need confidence that their bills won’t rise and our affordable clean energy future is protected,” Lisa Wozniak, the president of the league, said. “While these conditions attempt to hold DTE accountable, moving such a massive data center forward with limited expert review and heavily redacted agreements still raises serious concerns.”

Members of the Senate voted on Tuesday evening on a supplemental appropriations bill that would reinstate about $634 million in funding for work projects that were cut last week by the House Appropriations Committee.

The Senate in a 23-13 vote passed HB 4576, which contains $634 million ($351.5 million General Fund) for the 2025-26 fiscal year.

As passed, it would largely offset the $645 million in funding that House Republicans disapproved in work projects last week, which infuriated Democrats as well as some GOP lawmakers while blindsiding recipients of the funding who were confused as to how their projects were called waste, fraud, and abuse.

Five Republicans sided with the Democrats to restore the funding: Sen. Jon Bumstead of North Muskegon, Sen. John Damoose of Harbor Springs, Sen. Mark Huizenga of Walker, Sen. Ed McBroom of Vulcan, and Sen. Michael Webber of Rochester Hills. One Democrat, Sen. Sylvia Santana of Detroit, was absent and did not vote.

The vote came moments before Senate Democrats announced they sent a letter to Attorney General Dana Nessel seeking an opinion on the legality of the House’s use of the rarely used provision in the Management and Budget Act to enact the sweeping work project cuts.

In the letter, Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Sarah Anthony, D-Lansing, asked Nessel if the provision in the Management and Budget Act is constitutional.

“The scope of this action is unprecedented, and as such, it has raised serious questions about the legality of Section 451a of the Act and the committee’s application of that language,” Anthony wrote. “To that end, I ask for your opinion as to the following question: Whether the provision in MCL 18.1451a(3), allowing either the Senate or House Appropriations committees to disapprove work projects designated by the State Budget Office, violates the Michigan Constitution?”

Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, told reporters that Senate Democrats have been weighing their options to respond since last week’s move by the House. She said it took time to figure out exactly what the House had done so the supplemental could be crafted to accurately reflect the proposed restoration of funding.

“We thought it was very important to right that wrong, and really it’s about the people who are impacted,” Brinks said. “It’s incredibly important that we make those people whole and that we can help restore the trust that they should be able to have when the state makes a promise that they get certain funding to do certain things for the public good.”

Brinks said Senate Democrats have been clear on what they think of the House cuts and her hope is that House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, gets the message.

She added that she is not interested in negotiating the supplemental and that the funding needs to be restored.

As to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer‘s silence on the work project cuts over the last week, Brinks said the governor has a stake in the cut items.

“She was an active participant in negotiating this budget and ensuring that these dollars get to the entities for whom they were intended,” Brinks said.

Brinks said it was disappointing to see the House take the approach on work projects that it did last week.

“Having worked with them for a year now, it was not a move that should surprise anyone, seeing their willingness to do that kind of damage, but it is a positive thing that there are at least some things that we can work together on,” Brinks said. “Actually, I’m quite proud of my caucus for being willing to set some of those other feelings aside and do some of the things that do matter to people that are depending on us to come here, represent them and move legislation.”

She explained that the roughly $11 million difference between the supplemental and what the House disallowed was due to that money being in boilerplate, so that funding could not be disallowed.

In a statement, Hall took aim at Senate Democrats and was dismissive of their vote to reinstate the funding.

“The Senate Democrats are so addicted to pork and their secret slush funds that they just voted to reinstate the waste, fraud and abuse that House Republicans fought to eliminate,” Hall said. “Ultimate Lansing insiders like Sarah Anthony continue to do the bidding of lobbyists and the radical left special interests. Not the taxpayers. This isn’t surprising at all.”

House Speaker Matt Hall on Tuesday continued to deflect and defend his caucus eliminating hundreds of millions of dollars in work projects.

Last week, the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee unilaterally voted to disapprove $645 million in work projects.

The total amount cut, however, remains unclear because how much money was already spent and what programs, specifically, were affected is unknown.

Hall, R-Richland Township, faulted Gov. Gretchen Whitmer‘s administration for the uncertainty.

“The Whitmer administration cannot really produce for us what a lot of these programs are, how much of the money has been spent, what’s out the door, what isn’t, who the beneficiaries are,” he said. “The governor has not been able to provide a lot of those answers to us or to the media, and I think that is a symptom of the pork spending being out of control.”

Hall’s comments came during a press conference that ended with protesters outside the Speaker’s Library, who could be heard chanting on the livestream. Tuesday also saw a press conference from the Legislative Black Caucus and a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing slamming the cuts and the Senate moved to reverse the House action via a supplemental.

Hall alleged that much of the money for work projects was going to lobbyists for bonuses and on “secret pork spending.”

“You’re seeing the symptoms of that with this $10 billion slush fund and all the hundreds of millions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse,” he said. “You see projects that they snuck in the budget in the middle of the night, and nobody knew what they were. … A lot of these pork spending projects, they’re taking that money, and they’re paying lobbyists win bonuses, and they hide it under things like association management.”

Legislatively directed spending items were out of control, Hall said, and the process needs to be reformed. He said departments were creating “slush funds” with unspent money.

“They get to hold on to it indefinitely for years and years, with no legislative oversight,” he said. “So, what we’re doing here, we’re denying it, and now we’re forcing a negotiation.”

Hall again said that many state departments did not send House Republicans information about work projects until last week.

“In some cases, we kept those priorities from being cut because the department gave us the justifications,” he said. “I was never trying to disrupt really critical things that would create cataclysmic problems.”

An example of that, Hall said, was Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve funding. That money included appropriations to Dow Chemical, located in the 35th Senate District, which is an open seat that Republicans are hoping to flip in the upcoming special election next year.

The State Budget Office, however, sent more than 500 pages of detailed information to fiscal agencies about work projects, along with a summary to legislators on Nov. 14. Departments also compiled an additional 75 pages of documentation, and several departments met with Rep. Tom Kuhn, R-Troy, the week of Nov. 14. Departments were not asked to provide additional testimony.

“Departments complied with requests from Speaker Hall and House Appropriations Committee members, including providing more than 500 pages of materials on work projects. This documentation made clear that disapproval would mean voting to halt funding for local road, bridge and water infrastructure repairs, senior centers, job creation efforts, and other commonsense measures,” a statement from State Budget Director Jen Flood said. “While the governor and Senate Democrats are working to create jobs and lower costs for Michiganders, this was a vote to raise costs and harm some of our most vulnerable Michiganders.”

Worthwhile projects would have an opportunity to have their funding restored, Hall said.

“We have an obligation to put a pause on this, to force a conversation on our timeline next year,” he said. “When we see good programs that are justified, we’ll but those back in in a deal.”

Hall went on to say that it was not the responsibility of House Republicans to contact programs that were losing funding, and that it was on departments to have a better understanding of what money was spent.

As for Senate Republicans, like Sen. John Damoose, R-Harbor Springs, that had a problem with the cuts? Hall called them “budget traitors.”

During a Senate Appropriations Committee meeting on Tuesday, Damoose questioned whether these cuts would incentivize organizations to spend down money as fast as possible, which could open the door for more waste.

Hall brushed the concern aside.

“I think you start to see who the Republican budget traitors are, the people shove their pork into department budgets and are pissed off that their pork got cut,” he said. “What you should do is you should negotiate up front for the multi-year programs, like what we did in the ’26 budget, and then it should be the exception to the rule.”

In the future, Hall said that the confusion regarding what was cut won’t be a problem because of the new transparency laws requiring legislatively directed spending items to be introduced with a sponsor and a clear beneficiary 45 days before the budget is passed.

Ultimately, it was not House Republicans responsibility to know what was being cut, but rather on departments to know what is being spent, Hall said, and they don’t know because “spending is so out of control.”

“What you’re saying to me is, should you approve the spending of dollars when they won’t sufficiently justify what the use is?” he said. “And the answer to that is no.”

The House and Senate moved some legislation Tuesday as part of a deal to get a flurry of bills to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during the last days of session.

Senate Democrats acknowledged there was a deal in place to move several bill packages before the end of the year. Although its status after the House moved to kill work project funding last week was unclear.

A House Republican source told Gongwer News Service there is an agreement between the House and the Senate to move 18 bill packages before the end of the year. The legislation will split public acts between the House and the Senate.

The list includes legislation from both chambers to regulate online ticket sales, update the liquor codes, and several other regulatory reform bills.

Most of the bills the House passed during Tuesday’s session were part of the agreement. The Senate passed fewer bills, and also moved a supplemental reversing work project cuts made by the House last week, but Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said the Senate could be back Thursday.

The Senate is not taking attendance on Wednesday.

Brinks told reporters the Senate will determine if there is any additional business to take care of on Thursday.

“There are some things that been in a queue for a long time,” Brinks said. “We have been working to try and un-stick some bills, so we’d be happy to see some of those things move.”

Brinks said some bills that have been the subject of discussion with the House were passed in the Senate on Tuesday. She also acknowledged that it was tough to determine a path forward on remaining legislation following the House’s move last week to defund hundreds of millions of dollars in work projects.

“We had to really come back into the room and evaluate what it was our caucus was willing to do,” Brinks said.

During session on Tuesday, the House passed SB 685, SB 686, SB 687, SB 688, SB 689, SB 690, and SB 699.

The bills are designed to protect farmland and open space through agreements that restrict development and prove tax incentives for program participation. By enrolling for a minimum of 10 years, landowners may be entitled to certain income tax benefits.

SB 685 passed 102-3. Rep. Steve Carra, R-Three Rivers; Rep. Matt Maddock, R-Milford; and Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, voted no. SB 686 passed by the same margin and with the same opposition. SB 687, SB 688, and SB 689 passed 103-3. Carra, Maddock, and Wegela were, again, the only no votes. SB 690 passed 102-4. Carra, Maddock, Wegela and Rep. Ann Bollin, R-Brighton Township, voted no. The final bill in that package, SB 699, passed 103-3, with Carra, Maddock, and Wegela voting against it.

The House also passed SB 96, SB 97, and SB 98, which allow child care organizations to install temporary door locking devices in their buildings. Both bills passed unanimously.

SB 82, which would shield the personal information of Michigan judges, their families and households, was also part of the agreement. It passed the House 99-6. Carra, Rep. Joseph Fox, R-Freemont; Rep. Tom Kuhn, R-Troy; Maddock; Rep. Donni Steele, R-Orion; and Wegela voted no.

SB 23, which modifies the Land Division Act to allow for an increased number of parcel divisions also passed the House as part of the deal. It passed 97-5 with a substitute and will return to the Senate. Rep. Julie Brixie, D-Okemos; Rep. William Bruck, R-Erie; Rep. Peter Herzberg, D-Westland; Rep. Sharon MacDonell, D-Troy; Rep. Phil Skaggs, D-East Grand Rapids; Steele; Wegela; and Rep. Regina Weiss, D-Oak Park, voted no.

SB 25 also passed the House as part of the deal. The legislation allows motor vehicle repair facilities to operate an auxiliary facility under the same registration. It passed 102-3. Carra, Rep. Brad Paquette, R-Niles; and Wegela voted no.

The House also unanimously passed SB 95, which was not part of the agreement.

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Jonathan Lindsey, R-Coldwater, prohibits hospitals from attempting to collect debts incurred during any period in which they were not in compliance with federal hospital price transparency laws and regulations.

The Senate for its part moved only a small number of House bills on Tuesday that may have been included in the deal.

One bill which passed was HB 4543, which would amend the Income Tax Act to update how the Department of Treasury makes its yearly inflation adjustment for the Home Heating Tax Credit, using the U.S. Consumer Price Index to account for inflation. The bill passed 31-4.

Also passing the Senate was HB 4836, which would create an opt-out waiver for the workforce readiness portion of the M-STEP. It passed 32-3. The accompanying Senate bill, SB 349, previously passed the House with a substitute. Senators voted 35-0 to concur in the House substitute.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-center-feature.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 13:59:46.211273

Permanence vs. ‘Tax Cliffs’

Speaking with Checkpoint, Acuna emphasized the significance of permanent tax provisions for long-term business planning, contrasting them with the uncertainty created by temporary changes and “tax cliffs.” The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) enacted July 4 includes permanent extensions to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions and its own temporary measures.

For major, multi-billion-dollar investments that have long-term horizons, legislative certainty is critical, said Acuna. Without that certainty, there is “this inability to engage in longer-term planning,” as looming cliffs are “infinitely” worse for business planning. The last tax reform package, the Inflation Reduction Act, was signed into law just three years prior to the OBBBA, and five years after the TCJA.

Frequent overhauls to tax laws, especially when there are swings in party control of Congress and the White House, can result “putting all of your hopes into the political fates and expecting Congress to act to provide taxpayer relief,” Acuna explained. “That is not a place you want to be, as we’ve seen in recent years.”

She pointed to the treatment of research and experimentation expenses under IRC § 174 and the business interest limitation under IRC § 163(j), where expired or changing rules made planning difficult. The permanence of many business provisions in the OBBBA, she noted, is a “major benefit to business.”

But the OBBBA also temporarily raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 before it reverts, and introduces income thresholds. This provision “just created a mini cliff in the tax policy space where you’re going to see the significant drop off in the SALT benefit,” Acuna expects.

Guidance Rollout and Engaging With Treasury

Despite a significant reduction in its workforce and the disruption of the longest government shutdown in history, the IRS and Treasury have begun issuing a “steady stream of guidance,” which Acuna called a “relief to taxpayers.”

Yet tax filing season is just around the corner. With that in mind, Acuna’s best advice for taxpayers and practitioners is to act immediately. “What we have been recommending to clients in particular, is … to start modeling sooner rather than later,” she stated. “If you’re waiting for guidance to even start, you’re already many steps behind.”

Acuna explained that Treasury is still drafting rules and taking feedback from the public. “They’re open to discuss potential problems and potential gaps … that need to be filled in upcoming guidance,” she said. “The time is now to … go and speak to Treasury to try to get some clarity,” especially when planning for the new law yields “counterintuitive results.” Put simply, the Department should know about issues taxpayers are facing so guidance can address them sooner rather than later.

Acuna acknowledged that practitioners might hesitate to approach Treasury, fearing an unfavorable interpretation of a rule. However, she advised that the risk of inaction is greater. While there is always an “analysis of whether or not to bring the issue” to regulators, she concluded that “more guidance is always better than less guidance.” She urged practitioners to seek clarity to avoid having their clients’ critical issues lost or unaddressed as Treasury finalizes its rules.

Also worth noting is that a reduced IRS workforce will directly impact the “sheer volume of controversies” the agency can handle, forcing it to prioritize certain issues for examination, she said. “It puts more emphasis on the prioritization of issues at exams.”

Client Education

Given the scale of the legislation, Acuna said the first step for practitioners is always to “analyze exposure.” For example, the law’s changes to the TCJA’s global intangible low-taxed income regime (now referred to as net controlled foreign corporation tested income) will impact taxpayers differently, depending on their unique facts and circumstances.

While the OBBBA is largely an “extenders package” rather than a creator of entirely new tax systems like the TCJA, the technical details and retroactive provisions will still pose challenges, Acuna cautioned. Practitioners should educate clients on the small technical issues, which she said are “usually what gives rise to controversy.” This will be especially true for areas where the IRS is likely to focus its limited examination resources, such as the clean energy sector.

“But fewer exam agents and less capability doesn’t always translate into better results for taxpayers,” Acuna clarified.",https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/wp-content/themes/tac/assets/media/favicon.png,N,,2025-12-19 10:59:57.831031

The Indiana General Assembly identified long-term funding for Community Crossings as part of House Enrolled Act 1002, passed in 2017.

Following changes outlined during the 2025 legislative session, the program cap is now set at $100 million per year, with the annual cap reduced to $1 million per local unit of government per state fiscal year. Also, starting in fiscal year 2027, a single call for projects will occur each July.

New data from this year reveals that electric cars are no longer just a luxury for wealthy nations. Instead, emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America are now the ones adopting EVs the fastest. In 2019, only four countries saw electric cars take up more than 10% of their new car sales. By 2025, that number has jumped to 39 countries. A third of these leaders are now located outside of Europe.

China remains the giant in this field. This year, for the first time, more than 50% of all new cars sold in China were electric. But the real surprise is coming from its neighbors. Viet Nam's share of electric cars reached nearly 40% in 2025. That is double what it was just last year. For comparison, the European Union average is 26%, and the United Kingdom sits at 33%. Even Thailand has hit a milestone, with EVs making up 20% of its new car sales this year.

In Viet Nam, VinFast VF 3 has become the best-selling car in the country. This tiny ""mini-SUV"" is built for city life. It measures 10.47 ft long, 5.51 ft wide, and 5.31 ft tall. Despite its small size, it fits four people and offers a ground clearance of 7.5 inches. It uses an 18.64 kWh battery and can travel up to 130 miles on a single charge. It also charges quickly, going from 10% to 70% in just 36 minutes. In many markets, this car is expected to start at a price of around $20,000.

Other nations are using EVs to save money and clean their air. Ethiopia recently banned the import of gas-powered cars entirely. Because they have lots of water power for electricity, electric cars now make up 60% of their sales. In Nepal, that number is even higher at 76%. These countries want to stop buying expensive oil from other nations. Indonesia is also moving fast. Its EV sales share reached 15% this year, which is actually higher than the 7.3% share seen in the United States. Indonesia even gives tax breaks to companies like CATL and BYD to build batteries and cars locally.

Latin America is joining the race, too. Uruguay has reached a 27% share for electric cars, while Costa Rica is at 17%. Brazil and Mexico are now selling a higher percentage of EVs than Japan. In Brazil, driving an electric vehicle reduces the use of fossil fuels by 90% because the electricity comes from very clean sources. Popular models like the BYD Dolphin Mini (sold as Seagull or Surf in other markets) are helping. In Brazil, this car costs about R$115,800 (roughly $23,000). It has a 38 kWh battery and a range of about 174 miles. These prices make it easier for regular families to switch away from gas.

Countries like the US have recently cut back on tax credits, but the rest of the world is moving full speed ahead. Between January and October 2025, one out of every four cars sold globally was electric. This global shift is helping to create millions of new jobs. In Viet Nam alone, experts think the industry could create 6.5 million jobs by 2050. The era of the gasoline engine is fading, and the new leaders of the EV shift are appearing in places we might not have expected just a few years ago.",https://st.arenaev.com/news/25/12/new-leaders-take-the-wheel-of-the-global-ev-race/-828x414/arenaev_000.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 12:58:54.159008

In this series, we reveal how LNG demand and AI data centers could transform Permian gas into a primary revenue driver.","Energy Transfer (ET) picked up a G&P system in the Powder River Basin (PRB) when it bought Crestwood Equity in 2023 for $7.1B. Since then, the company’s growth machine has been squarely pointed at the Permian and Gulf Coast, leaving Wyoming as increasingly non-core.

The PRB assets include the Jackalope gathering system and the Bucking Horse I/II cryogenic plants in Converse County, WY (see map from ET). Jackalope includes ~180 miles of gathering line and primarily serves Continental Resources, Occidental Petroleum and Anschutz. The Bucking Horse plants have total processing capacity of 345 MMcf/d and deliver residue gas to Kinder Morgan’s (KMI) Wyoming Interstate system. East Daley’s “G&P System Analysis” dashboard in Energy Data Studio shows throughput of ~100 MMcf/d through the plants (see figure below).

Why the PRB assets screen as non-core:

Strategy mismatch. ET’s current spending is dominated by Permian gas/NGL expansions (processing at Red Lake/Badger, fractionation at Mont Belvieu), NGL terminal expansions at Nederland and Marcus Hook, and long-haul gas pipelines. The Powder River is not a focus of growth.

Marginal earnings impact. ET has guided to $16.1–16.5B of 2025 Adj. EBITDA, leaving the PRB system at well under 1% of the total. This is consistent with a divestible, niche position in ET’s large portfolio.

Outside core operations. Since the Crestwood deal closed, ET has expanded its Permian footprint, including the $3.25B WTG Midstream acquisition and its Permian crude/water JV with Sunoco. Wyoming has not factored into the company’s dealing.

Who would buy it?

Western Midstream (WES). WES expanded in the Powder River by buying Meritage Midstream, giving the company a large G&P footprint in Wyoming. The Jackalope/Bucking Horse assets would expand its footprint and create potential synergies for shared customers.

Tallgrass Energy. Tallgrass also operates Powder River midstream assets, including the nearby Casper and Douglas processing plants and Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission (TIGT). Folding in Jackalope/Bucking Horse could lift volumes on TIGT and strengthen one-stop midstream services in the basin.

What changes for ET: A sale would allow Energy Transfer to marginally delever while it continues to commit resources to Permian gas and NGL projects.

Investor Takeaway: The PRB system is a logical non-core candidate for ET — small, remote and overshadowed by Permian and Gulf Coast growth opportunities. A sale could unlock strategic value for the right buyer, with immaterial earnings impact to ET. – Jaxson Fryer Tickers: ET, KMI, WES.

Where they projected shares of electric vehicles to be 17 percent in 2026, the actual share is only about 9 percent.
Starting in model year 2027, the Biden EPA would have hit truck companies, fleet owners, and individual truck drivers with a significant economic impact.
That is why, in early 2026, EPA will propose a two-year delay to the Biden administration’s Model Year 2027 and Later Light-and Medium-Duty Vehicles regulation.
Additionally in early 2026, EPA will address the 2022 Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle NOx rule.","Throughout the 2024 campaign, President Trump sent a very clear message to the U.S. auto industry: Under his leadership it would be revived. Biden-era vehicle policies were infeasible, unrealistic, and would not work either for American consumers or the auto industry.

Our predecessors believed they could force their climate agenda upon Americans and remove consumer choice. We saw this with their electric vehicle mandate, which Americans flat-out rejected. Implementing Trump’s agenda, the Environmental Protection Agency is taking a different approach.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made protecting and bringing back American auto jobs one of his five pillars for his Powering the Great American Comeback initiative. As the assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation, my team is delivering.

This year, we have announced significant proposals and actions to bring certainty back to industry and choice back to American families. We have done this while simultaneously following the law and furthering the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.

This includes the agency’s proposal to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding and subsequent greenhouse gas vehicle rules. As 2026 approaches, the agency is working to build on its 2025 accomplishments.

On March 12, 2025, EPA launched the most consequential day of deregulation in agency history to reduce red tape and bring common sense back to rulemaking. In 2026, Americans can expect to see the reconsideration of two regulations — one pertaining to Model Year 2027 and Later Light-and Medium-Duty Vehicles, and the 2022 Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle NOx rule.

The Biden administration imposed the former regulation in an attempt to force electric vehicles upon American families. This utterly failed, as the Biden officials developing the regulation vastly overestimated the future share of electric vehicles in the market. Where they projected shares of electric vehicles to be 17 percent in 2026, the actual share is only about 9 percent. This left automakers scrambling to adapt to something their customers didn’t want.

The latter rule was no different. Starting in model year 2027, the Biden EPA would have hit truck companies, fleet owners, and individual truck drivers with a significant economic impact. The Trump EPA, in contrast, firmly believes we do not have to choose between fulfilling our core mission of protecting human health and the environment and boosting the economy.

Keeping promises is a very important principle to this administration. That is why, in early 2026, EPA will propose a two-year delay to the Biden administration’s Model Year 2027 and Later Light-and Medium-Duty Vehicles regulation. The agency is also working on a new rule for Model Year 2029 and beyond that better reflects reality, promotes consumer choice, and helps bring down prices.

Additionally in early 2026, EPA will address the 2022 Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle NOx rule. The agency is identifying strategic opportunities to streamline costs and reduce regulatory burdens.

One change we intend to propose will revise the Biden-era rule’s warranty provisions. This revision, if finalized, would reduce compliance costs by up to 50 percent. We are also considering an extension of what is known as “regulatory useful life.” This gets a bit into the weeds, but American truckers understand its significance. The gist is that the Biden administration’s changes increased the cost of engines — we intend to make engines cheaper and in turn lower the costs of the goods that trucks carry.

We are also looking into other changes that will increase choice and lower costs. Although the Trump administration would not have finalized the Biden standards, the required lead time within the Clean Air Act renders us unable to change the emissions standard itself.

At EPA, we are standing up for American families and businesses, while also doing our job to protect human health and the environment. This is a commitment we are proud to make and look forward to furthering on behalf of the president and the public in 2026.

Nel, a Norwegian energy company with over 100 years of experience, has recently announced it has taken a final investment decision on its new scaled-up next-generation alkaline electrolyser to reach 1 GW of capacity.
As other European nations progress with their own electrolyser deployments, Norway is set to dominate the market through Nel’s Next Generation Pressurized Alkaline platform.
Hydrogen can completely reshape global energy output capacity while keeping a close eye on the associated emissions from the energy market.

Nel, a Norwegian energy company with over 100 years of experience, has recently announced it has taken a final investment decision on its new scaled-up next-generation alkaline electrolyser to reach 1 GW of capacity. The FID follows years of significant testing and studies to confirm the commercial viability of Nel’s hydrogen-generating platform.

Norway is set to become a regional leader in the hydrogen market through the new electrolyser

The Viking nation has welcomed the announcement made by Nel that underscores the strategic importance of the hydrogen market and the renewable energy sector overall. The company stated that, following a seven-year development program, the successful start-up and production of clean hydrogen from its Next Generation Pressurized Alkaline prototype, the company’s Board of Directors took the Final Investment Decision.

The FID will enable Nel to begin construction on a 1 GW hydrogen production platform at the Herøya facility, which is located in the Herøya Industrial Park in Porsgrunn, Norway. The development of the new electrolyser began way back in 2018, and following rigorous testing of several smaller electrolyzer stacks, the company has now completed the testing for the full-scale system.

Nel expects to launch the new system in the first half of next year, with full-scale deliveries expected sometime in 2027. The company has stated that its new Next Generation Pressurized Alkaline platform can completely reshape operational costs of hydrogen production, delivering astonishing levels of clean hydrogen for the international market.

“Our new solution is extremely important for Nel as a company, but also for the clean hydrogen industry as a whole. A significantly improved levelized cost of hydrogen is expected to unlock business cases that were previously not viable without significant subsidies,” – Håkon Volldal, President and CEO of Nel

The project has attracted the attention of the European Union

The expected costs of developing the electrolyser are astronomical to say the least, the initial 1 GW of energy is set to cost approximately NOK 300 million. However, the project has such high strategic importance for the European clean energy ambitions that it has been granted significant funding from the European Union Innovation Fund.

The Viking energy company has been awarded EUR 135 million by the EU Innovation Fund to develop the project further to reach an estimated output capacity of 4 GW once fully operational. The funding from the EU fund covers approximately 60% of the relevant CAPEX and operational costs associated. As other European nations progress with their own electrolyser deployments, Norway is set to dominate the market through Nel’s Next Generation Pressurized Alkaline platform.

Following years of stagnation, the international energy market is finally giving the hydrogen sector the attention it deserves. Hydrogen can completely reshape global energy output capacity while keeping a close eye on the associated emissions from the energy market. Without the renewable energy sector, the world will see new environmental disasters becoming all too common.

Decarbonizing the international energy market is a shared responsibility

We can not understate the importance of decarbonizing the international energy market, as it is one of the main contributors of greenhouse gases. With the digital and AI age picking up traction, a new wave of energy demand has hit the market. AI data centers have been popping up all over the world as a litany of tech companies aim to revolutionize the tech market. Those AI centers will need vast amounts of energy. The technology for hydrogen production has been progressing to match the expected increase in energy demand driven by the new AI race.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/24.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 16:00:53.813396

Since September, Ford shares gained 14%, GM rose 34% and Tesla advanced about 7%.
Stellantis has also backtracked on some of its EV plans, axing a scheduled electric Ram ‍pickup truck and leaning ⁠into hybrids.

The writedown ‌was seen as the most visible sign to date of the auto industry's pullback from a technology carmakers ‌wholeheartedly embraced early this decade, exacerbated by President Donald Trump's cancellation of electric-vehicle tax breaks.

Ford Motor's shares rose 1.3% before the bell following the announcement. Tesla edged 0.6% lower and General Motors was flat. U.S.-listed shares of Stellantis were up about 1%.

Washington's action ⁠has deepened the decline in ‌sales, forcing the Detroit Three automakers - Ford, GM and Chrysler-parent Stellantis - to roll back their ambitious EV plans in the U.S. and ‍pivot back to their hybrids and gasoline-powered vehicles.

""Ford's strategic reset is a clear acknowledgement of shifting market realities and consumer demand,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.

The charges are a ""painful reset for the company"" ​but one that is essential to align itself with consumer interests which would ‌eventually improve profitability and returns for Ford, Morgan Stanley said.

U.S. sales of EVs fell about 40% in November following the expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit on September 30. The incentive had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand.

Since September, Ford shares gained 14%, GM rose 34% and Tesla advanced about 7%.

GM took ⁠a $1.6 billion charge in October as it adjusted ​its EV factory plans, and warned that it ​would likely take more charges in the future. Stellantis has also backtracked on some of its EV plans, axing a scheduled electric Ram ‍pickup truck and leaning ⁠into hybrids.

""This move by Ford was to be expected (and should be expected for others) given a new reality on the dramatically weaker U.S. EV environment, driven ⁠by weaker demand and heavily reduced compliance requirements,"" Barclays analysts said.

It is, however, a step in the ‌right direction, and can help Ford improve profits, they added.

With the Trump administration’s return to office, those billionaires got what they wanted.","Since taking office last January, the Trump administration has waged the worst assault in history on the environment and public health. It has taken or proposed nearly 400 reckless and misguided actions that undermine clean air and water, healthy wildlife, and public lands, all of which sabotage a safe and climate-friendly future.

In just one year, this administration has taken a wrecking ball to the commonsense safeguards and foundational institutions we all depend on to stand sentry against industrial-scale pollution and the harm it brings. It has upended five decades of responsible public oversight that has strengthened the economy, defended public health, and vastly improved our quality of life.

Amid the staggering pace of this administration’s broadside attacks on sound governance, constitutional norms, and the rule of law, much of the environmental assault has been waged without the public attention, scrutiny, or review it deserves.

As it has enfeebled essential institutions like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the administration has placed the U.S. Department of Energy in the hands of a fossil fuel executive and handed over U.S. energy policy to the oil and gas industry.

While the administration rigs the game to further enrich oil and gas billionaires, the rest of us are paying the price—in our homes, communities, factories, and farms.

Since Trump took office, home electricity bills have spiked 9.6 percent, on average. One reason is that power companies are spending money to upgrade aging transmission and distribution lines. Another is the soaring demand for power from the energy-guzzling data centers overtaking much of rural America.

The Trump administration’s policies are directly driving up costs

Backed by its allies in Congress, this administration is ending clean power incentives that were catalyzing innovation and investment, creating thousands of jobs, and saving billions of dollars each year for power providers and consumers alike. This administration is trying to suppress the cheapest form of new electricity generation—wind and solar power.

The administration has blocked or delayed wind and solar projects that could power millions of homes, at a time when that power is desperately needed to counter rising pressures on price and demand.

In the process, the administration is handicapping U.S. workers and companies in the economic play of our lifetime—the global clean energy transition that attracted a record $2.2 trillion in investments in this year alone. The Trump administration’s policies won’t stop the historic global shift to clean energy; they’ll just make it harder for U.S. workers, and easier for our competitors, to benefit from it.

It’s worth recalling where we were when the second Trump administration began

At that time, the United States was helping to lead the world toward a clean energy future that promised to deliver cleaner air and lower utility bills while also sharply mitigating the cascading impacts of rising seas, hotter heat waves, and raging wildfires, storms, and floods.

Across the United States, clean energy jobs were growing at three times the level of the economy overall, with more than 3.5 million Americans working each day to help make our homes, cars, and factories more energy efficient and environmentally friendly.

And, supported by federal incentives, American corporations announced more than $120 billion in investment in new factories to build solar panels, transmission and grid components, advanced batteries, and electric vehicles, all of which had created more than 106,000 jobs across the country between 2022 and 2024.

Under President Trump, the United States has become a climate denier and a drag on the energy revolution it was poised to lead. The Trump administration’s actions have moved the United States from the forefront of the emerging energy revolution to the role of spoiler.

Americans didn’t ask for this reckless assault on the nation’s environment, energy security, and public health. On the contrary, nearly 6 in 10 Americans (57 percent) say the U.S. government is doing too little to protect the environment. Nearly two-thirds (62 percent) say environmental quality is getting worse. And across the nation, people understand that the benefits of responsible environmental safeguards far exceed the cost of compliance—by more than 30 to 1, in the case of the Clean Air Act.

The public doesn’t want these manifest gains turned back, but someone else does: the oil and gas billionaires and other big polluters.

With the Trump administration’s return to office, those billionaires got what they wanted. Now, the rest of us are paying the price.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2023-05/nrdc-media-logo-teaser.png?h=ec041e41&itok=UFakqxFX,N,,2025-12-19 10:59:10.766195

Detroit has officially unveiled the first electrified public roadway in the United States capable of charging electric vehicles wirelessly as they drive. The project uses embedded inductive charging coils beneath the pavement to transfer power directly to compatible EVs, eliminating the need to stop and plug in during travel.

The technology is being tested on a stretch of road as part of Michigan’s broader push to position itself as a national leader in next generation transportation infrastructure. Only vehicles equipped with special receiver hardware can currently access the charging system, meaning the rollout remains limited while data is collected on efficiency, safety, and scalability.

If proven successful, electrified roads could dramatically reshape how electric vehicles are charged, reducing range anxiety and potentially shrinking the need for large onboard batteries. Officials say the pilot represents a major step toward a future where highways actively power vehicles rather than simply carrying them.

Financing for the Duffy project comprises a construction-to-term loan, tax equity bridge loan, and a letter of credit facility.","Colorado-based Peregrine Energy Solutions partnered with Helsinki-headquartered integrated BESS services provider Wärtsilä to advance the development of its 250 MW/500 MWh Mallard BESS project located northeast of Dallas, Texas.

Mallard has already commenced construction, and Peregrine Energy Solutions is working with Wärtsilä to use company’s Quantum2 energy storage system, which was launched in March 2024.

This is Peregrine’s second collaboration on utility-scale energy storage deployment with Wärtsilä, following the 150 MW/300 MWh Wizard Energy Storage Project under construction in League City, Texas.

Once operational, Mallard will provide flexibility and resilience to Texas’ ERCOT grid, and it will be a key project for Peregrine’s Texas expansion plan. In addition to its Wärtsilä partnership, the company has entered a tolling agreement with an unnamed Fortune 500 company for an undisclosed amount for Mallard. North America-focused WHC Energy Services will also come on board as an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) provider to facilitate Mallard’s construction.

According to its website, Peregrine has executed more than 50 GWs of renewable energy and energy storage facilities across North American energy markets. In October, it secured $130 million in new capital from investors including the Ministry of Environment of South Korea to advance its United States BESS portfolio.

A month later, in November, Peregrine closed a preferred equity agreement with Bildmore Clean Energy for a BESS project that was already under construction. Peregrine has originated and developed a pipeline of 15 GWh of storage across the United States.

The company’s Quantum2 system is a fully-integrated high-capacity system designed for large-scale deployment. It uses Wärtsilä’s GEMS Digital Energy Management Platform to monitor, control and optimize the BESS system and is compliant with ISO standards for 20-foot containers. Safety is a big focus for Wärtsilä, and its Quantum2 system is fully compliant with international safety standards, including NFPA 855. It features fully tested pre-installed liquid-cooled IP67 modules, requiring no additional site work and providing additional safety. Quantum2 successfully passed several control systems tests in September 2025.Meanwhile, ESS News reported that the company’s Quantum3 energy storage system passed three major fire safety and explosion tests in November.

Wärtsilä has deployed and contracted more than 19 GWh of energy storage worldwide. This year’s pv magazine Awards jurors in the Energy Storage category named Wärtsilä’s Blackhillock BESS in Scotland as the overall winner.

Duffy BESS debt financing

Also in Texas, Californian independent power producer and developer Linea Energy has closed project debt financing for its 235 MW/470 MWh standalone BESS – the Duffy BESS – in Matagorda County.

Financing for the Duffy project comprises a construction-to-term loan, tax equity bridge loan, and a letter of credit facility. Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (Nord/Lb) served as coordinating lead arranger and Societe Generale and SMBC acted as joint lead arrangers.

“We are thrilled to announce the closing of debt financing that will facilitate completing construction on the Duffy BESS project,” said Cassidy DeLine, CEO of Linea Energy. “We are grateful for the financial commitment of our lender partners whose support enables us to advance critical battery energy storage infrastructure in the Lone Star State.”

“The Duffy BESS project represents an important milestone in our mission to strengthen the resilience of the grid that powers Texas homes and businesses,” added the executive of Linea, which refers to itself as a “newly-formed independent power producer aiming to change the status quo of how clean energy is developed and financed to rapidly increase the speed of deployment.”

These credits can provide your government with significant financial returns for investments in renewable energy projects.

1. Understanding Elective Pay and Eligibility

Elective pay allows government entities, traditionally ineligible for tax credits, to receive refunds. This shift, introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act, opens the door for substantial financial incentives. For example, a Northern California city recently secured over $6 million in credits on a $28 million project.

To take advantage of these opportunities, your government must navigate the elective pay process — including pre-filing registration and understanding critical timelines.

2. Diverse Credit Opportunities

Energy tax credits are not limited to one type of project. They encompass a wide range of investments, including:

Energy Property: Investments in renewable energy equipment.

Energy Production: Generating electricity from renewable sources.

Commercial Clean Vehicles: Purchasing new commercial clean vehicles.

Electric Vehicle Recharging: Installing recharging or refueling equipment.

Each category has specific criteria and potential return rates, which can vary significantly based on factors like project location and adherence to prevailing wage requirements.

3. Critical Timelines and Application Processes

Timely action is crucial for maximizing these credits. For the 2023 tax year, pre-filing registration must be completed by July 15, 2024, to meet the IRS's review period recommendations. Additionally, applications for the Low-Income Community Bonus Credit Program, which can increase credits by up to 20%, are due by June 27, 2024.

Properly tracking and documenting project costs is essential for accurate credit computation and successful filing.

Maximizing Energy Tax Credits for Your Government

Your state or local government stands to gain significantly from energy tax credits by understanding and navigating the elective pay process, exploring diverse credit opportunities, and adhering to critical timelines. Engaging with tax professionals can help you maximize potential refunds and enhance your renewable energy investments.

The renewables have helped bring the growth of greenhouse emissions to a virtual standstill in China and put a global carbon peak within reach, said Science magazine, naming the renewable energy surge led by China the 2025 Breakthrough of the Year.

""China's mighty industrial engine is the driver,"" the journal stated, noting that the country produces 80 percent of the world's solar cells, 70 percent of wind turbines and 70 percent of lithium batteries ""at prices no competitor can match.""

Nature magazine also featured China's clean energy achievements as ""feel-good science stories to restore your faith in 2025.""

Renewables overtook coal as the world's top energy source for the first time this year, propelled by China's milestone of surpassing 1 terawatt of installed solar capacity in May, said the British scientific journal.

In the first six months of 2025 alone, China installed new solar systems with a capacity twice as much as the rest of the world combined, according to Nature.

RECORD EXPANSION

China's renewable energy expansion has shattered records, with wind and solar capacity surpassing thermal power for the first time in history by March.

By the end of June, China's installed wind and photovoltaic power generation capacity had reached 1.67 billion kilowatts, representing 13.6 percent higher than thermal power capacity.

Over the past five years, China has built the world's largest and fastest-growing renewable-energy system, with the share of renewables in installed power capacity rising from roughly 40 percent to 60 percent, according to the National Energy Administration (NEA).

During this period, the proportion of non-fossil fuels in China's energy consumption has climbed by one percentage point and coal's share has fallen by the same margin every single year, as shown in NEA data.

The 2025 energy Nature Index reveals that from 2019 to 2024, China's clean energy output was significantly higher than that of other countries.

In addition, China operates the world's largest carbon market by coverage, regulating over 60 percent of national carbon dioxide emissions through effective permits.

NEW COMMITMENTS

In September, China announced its new Nationally Determined Contributions with ambitious targets for 2035, including reducing economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by 7 to 10 percent from peak levels.

This represents China's first absolute emissions reduction target covering the entire economy and including all greenhouse gases, which is a testament to its firm resolve and maximum effort.

China also aims to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035 and to expand the installed capacity of wind and solar power sixfold from 2020 levels.

GLOBAL IMPACT

China's renewable energy expansion has not only transformed its domestic energy landscape but has also positioned the country as a global leader in the fight against climate change.

""China's burgeoning exports of green tech are transforming the rest of the world, too,"" said the journal Science.

In the last five years, the country's wind and solar exports have helped the world avoid roughly 4.1 billion tonnes of carbon emissions, according to the NEA.

It has collaborated with over 100 countries and regions on green energy projects, helping reduce the average cost per kilowatt-hour of global wind and photovoltaic power generation by 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, said Wang Hongzhi, head of the NEA, at a forum in October.

China has also provided more than 177 billion yuan (about 25 billion U.S. dollars) in climate funding for other developing countries since 2016.

""Now, China makes them [clean energy technologies] for the world -- better, vastly cheaper, and in staggering quantities,"" remarked a Science editor. ■",,N,,2025-12-19 16:01:22.281495

An expert witness testified the proposed unit would be the most expensive natural gas plant in the United States.

Environmental groups and energy organizations fear the high costs will burden residential ratepayers for decades.

About 15 miles north of Savannah and right above the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge in Rincon, Ga., stands Plant McIntosh, a robust 10-unit gas plant made up of eight 80-MW combustion turbine units, and two 660-MW combined cycle (CC) units. In 2022, it was listed as the state's fourth-largest carbon dioxide emitter.

Under Georgia Power's proposed nearly 10,000 megawatt (MW) grid expansion, it could be getting an eleventh unit, an addition that has received much scrutiny in the past week.

In last week's final round of Georgia's Public Service Commission (PSC) hearings on Georgia Power's energy expansion, Sierra Club attorney Isabella Ariza called its expert witness to the stand.

In an assessment of Georgia Power's Request for Proposal, Synapse Energy Economics Senior Associate Lucy Metz submitted a piece of testimony that Plant McIntosh would be the most expensive natural gas plant built in the United States.

The new 747-MW unit “is the highest cost I have seen for a CC [combined cycle] plant in the United States,"" according to Metz's testimony.

The former coal plant, retired in 2019, is named among three methane plants in Georgia Power's All-Source Resource Capacity request. The newest CC addition, McIntosh Unit 12, would produce 11% of Georgia Power's planned expansion.

As Georgia Power revs up to build new-generation capacity, largely to serve rapidly growing data center demand, they have filled most of their energy generation portfolio with CCs.

But environmental and energy organizations fear the plants will burden the average residential ratepayer. And the interveners representing them in the PSC hearings argue that CC costs will outlive the lifespan of data center contracts, pointing to Plant McIntosh for its high costs and the long-term financial risks it could pose.

""That is the one that sticks out like a sore thumb,"" said Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) Attorney Jennifer Whitfield. ""It is the most expensive option on the table, and we just don't need it.""

Combined cycle, combined costs

CC facilities use two different kinds of thermodynamic cycles to generate electricity and therefore tend to have higher upfront costs than typical single-turbine gas plants. The most common CC plant is a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), using gas and steam turbines.

The argument for CCGTs is that their higher fuel efficiency will balance out over time and high enough loads, ultimately providing cheaper electricity and lower emissions.

But CCGT plant operations costs have been on the rise. According to a report by the American Public Power Association, CCGT projects cost about $2,000 per kilowatt, nearly double of what was originally projected for the next two years.

“The capital costs of combined cycle units have more than doubled since Georgia Power completed its 2025 IRP,” said Metz. “Building the proposed combined cycle units now will lock Georgia ratepayers into the current high costs for these resources for decades to come.""

In the early 2000s, national CCGT capacity boomed to nearly 50 GW. But due to oversupply, market saturation and rising natural gas prices, new CCGT capacity steadily decreased. About half of today's CCGT capacity was built between 2000 and 2006, according to the U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA).

""Hardly any new natural gas capacity came online last year,"" reported the EIA—just one industrial CCGT power generator blipped online in the U.S. in 2024.

But as Georgia Power plans to contribute five more at plants Bowen, Wansley and McIntosh, it's not alone. Developers plan to add 18.7 GW of CC capacity in the U.S. by 2028, with 4.3 GW already under construction.

""However, developers of all those planned units are working through regulatory approvals and securing needed equipment, both of which add uncertainty to their construction costs and initial operation date,"" the EIA stated.

Rather than eliminating the option due to potential risk, the PSC states Plant McIntosh on the bottom of the utility's to-do list.

“We recognize its economics are not as good as the other ones, so that’s why you would put it towards the bottom” of the list, said PSC Utility Finance Director Tom Newsome. It would ""be one of the last ones you pull.""

Hinting what's ahead

As an intervener, SELC was privy to the projected cost breakdown of Georgia Power's energy portfolio, but ""we can't share the actual cost publicly, unfortunately,"" said Whitfield.

And the fear is how these costs will outlast the contracts between Georgia Power its large-load customers.

""Because data center load is happening so rapidly and it's such a high magnitude that Georgia Power is having to procure much more expensive resources to serve that load,"" said Metz. ""There's a very real risk that the data center load will instead drive up rates for existing rate payers unless we have these safeguards put in place.""

The design lifetime of CCGT units is typically 25 to 30 years, according to the EIA. Georgia Power set an asset life of 45 years for each of the CCGT plants.

""So in 2070 we could still be paying for Plant Macintosh, and won't need it,"" said said Whitfield.

According to Georgia Power’s rebuttal testimony, Metz’s analysis did not account for inflation.

“The appropriate adjustment for inflation demonstrates that the Company’s thermal resources are, in fact, comparable to other reported costs,” said the rebuttal testimony filed on Nov. 26.

But at the hearing, Metz did not budge.

""f you assume that inflation over the next 5 years will be somewhere between 2 and 2.5%, Macintosh still falls at the very upper range or above the benchmark cost that I provide in my testimony,"" said Metz.

These benchmark costs provided a point of comparison among other regional utilities in the country, and did not prove that Georgia Power did ""a bad job curating CC's. It's to point out how elevated CC costs are across the board for all utilities,"" said Metz.

Instead, Metz advises that Georgia Power should its near-term needs on battery storage with shorter lifetimes and therefore, lower risk.

""A combined cycle unit that comes online in 2030 will lock in capital and fuel costs through 2075, two to three times longer than the maximum length of a data center contract,"" said Metz. ""In contrast, the 20-year lifetime of battery storage resources aligns more closely with typical data center contract length.""

These projects will see Orkney connected to the transmission grid for the first time, as well as significantly strengthening the transmission infrastructure serving communities including Skye, Fort Augustus, Argyll and Kintyre.

EGL2 HVDC subsea project is the largest ever single investment in the UK transmission system and will play a critical role in delivering the UK and Scottish governments’ clean power and energy security targets – supporting thousands of jobs across the country and boosting local and national economies.

The National Wealth Fund’s supported financing offers longer-dated lending, better aligning with the life of grid assets and ensuring the swift progression of these four critical upgrade projects, which have been independently assessed as required by both the independent National Energy System Operator (NESO) and the energy regulator, Ofgem.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

“We are investing in grid upgrades and homegrown, clean energy to get us off the global energy price rollercoaster, creating thousands of new, skilled jobs in the process, and boosting growth. This builds on our action at the Budget to take an average £150 off energy bills.

“This backing from the National Wealth Fund will help deliver the infrastructure upgrades needed to capitalise on Scotland’s renewable energy production and help strengthen the energy security of the whole UK.”

Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband said:

""We are supporting 3400 good jobs for Scotland, reversing years of underinvestment in our energy grid to connect more clean homegrown power to get bills down.

“Our clean power mission is about growth, jobs and energy security – and this £800 million guarantee from the National Wealth Fund for Scotland’s electricity grid delivers on all three.”

Scottish Secretary, Douglas Alexander said:

""This £800 million guarantee is a major vote of confidence in Scotland's leading role in delivering Britain's energy transition.

It shows the strength of the U.K.’s support for Scotland as this National Wealth fund guarantee will support up to 3,400 jobs, strengthen our energy security, help reduce bills, and ensure the renewable power generated in Scottish communities can reach homes and businesses across the country.""

Rogers play gets a BS rating Terence Corcoran: A minimum wage is a tax on labour.","In a global world seemingly dominated by big government economic interventions and industrial policies fabricated out of the fantasies of politicians and bureaucrats — known as state capitalism — there are developments that suggest markets still prevail.

Two such occasions, one Canadian and the other international, stand out as welcome signs that market realities dominate. In Ottawa, Industry Minister Mélanie Joly’s major — even embarrassing — backtrack on the $70-billion merger of Teck Resources and Anglo American shows that when the cards are on the table, governments must bow to private markets.

Another victory for market reality over government central-planning fantasies is the political backtracking on electric vehicles and, more broadly, on climate policies in general.

Ottawa ramps up Anglo-Teck approval

A few weeks ago, Joly’s staff made a point of correcting a media report that the government’s Investment Act decision on the Anglo-Teck merger would be coming “next month.” Not true, said the minister’s staff. What Joly had said is that the decision would come “in the next months,” thereby pushing the deadline deep into 2026.

So why was the decision suddenly released this week, essentially within days rather than months? And, more importantly, what happened to all the minister’s blither about how the announced merger deal was not “enough” and that the new company should, among other things, move its primary stock listing to Toronto rather than London?

Based on information released Tuesday by the companies, nothing significant has changed since Joly launched her not-enough statements. The new company has committed to a 15-year series of targets and spending plans, but nothing on the list would amount to a meaningful change in corporate intentions and strategy. For example, it commits to spending $4.5 billion in Canada over the next five years. Was Teck not planning such spending before this week?

The sudden appearance of Ottawa’s decision follows the Supreme Court of British Columbia’s final approval of the merger on Dec. 12 and a massive majority vote by Teck shareholders approving the merger on Dec. 9.

Ottawa’s sudden approval of the merger confirms the primacy of a market-driven investment environment over a planning-driven environment. Anglo-Teck was a test of Canada as a market economy, and it passed the test over the heads of Joly and the Carney Liberals.

EV and climate policies face market forces

Around the world, the speeding electric vehicle market is slowing down as market reality begins to overtake automobile sales. The biggest hit is taking place in the United States, where EV sales fell 42 per cent in November following the removal of government tax credits. Left to the mercy of market prices, sales inevitably declined.

Globally, EV sales grew last month at their slowest pace (six per cent) since February 2024. At the same time, the European Commission this week unveiled a plan to relax the EU’s ban on new internal combustion-engine (ICE) cars beginning in 2035. The proposal was described by activists as the region’s “biggest retreat from its green policies in recent years.” EU automakers, however, argue the reduced target does not go far enough in light of market realities.

The EV market in Canada has also been tilted by the inability of governments to overcome the challenge of completely replacing ICE vehicles with electric automobiles — much to the distress of activists. New statistics released this week show new Canadian EV registrations dropped from 18 per cent to nine per cent of sales in the third quarter while ICE sales rose.

Clean Energy Canada, a Simon Fraser University think-tank, blamed the decline in Canada’s EV market on Ottawa for having “made a number of decisions that have collectively broken Canada’s EV market over this past year.” The opposite is true. In reality, it is the market that has broken another part of the federal government’s industrial plan to remake the automobile industry. Electric vehicles may well be the way of the future, but the future cannot be driven by massive government interventions. It takes a market. As Ford CEO Jim Farley said this week: “We can’t allocate money for things that will not make money.”

EV market troubles are only one part of a shifting global reality. Industrial strategies and state planning cannot overcome and crush the market economy. Even corporations cannot break the market reality they are dealing with. A Financial Times feature last week documented how two British oil giants — Shell and BP — failed to transform their companies into pioneers of the green energy transition away from fossil fuels.

In 2021, the two companies set out to become transition leaders by investing billions in electric and other non-emitting energy sources. The plan failed as BP and Shell confronted internal operational turmoil, unco-operative markets and unhappy shareholders. Both companies had to write off billions of dollars in misguided investments.

The BP-Shell fiasco highlights a bigger trend. Wall Street Journal columnist Greg Ip last weekend raised the question: “Whatever happened to the climate crisis?” Activists such as Bill Gates have pulled back, for example. But Ip writes that the real cause of change in the climate debate is “affordability, and affordability won.”

By definition, that means the reality of the market won. May it always be so.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — Across India, battery recycling faces a mixture of challenges and opportunity as it plays an important role in the country’s shift to clean power.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India’s growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country’s copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India’s capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India’s battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India’s waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

Gaps between policy and implementation

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world’s most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India’s government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

How battery recycling works

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery’s contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Reducing dependence on imported minerals

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it’s an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

This week, New York’s State Energy Plan was approved. It provides a balanced and pragmatic framework that treats energy as essential economic infrastructure. By embracing resource diversity, prioritizing affordability and reliability, and aligning energy policy with advanced manufacturing, the Plan positions New York State to compete, grow, and lead in a rapidly evolving national and global energy landscape.

The approval of New York State’s updated State Energy Plan also marks a pivotal moment for the state’s economic and industrial future. Developed through more than a year of analysis and extensive public engagement, the Plan provides a pragmatic framework for navigating rising energy demand, affordability pressures, grid reliability challenges, and continued progress toward a cleaner energy economy. More importantly, it recognizes that energy policy isn’t an abstract environmental exercise, but rather a foundational driver of economic development, industrial competitiveness, and community stability across New York.

At a time when energy systems face uncertainty from economic volatility and shifting federal priorities, the Plan adopts a realistic and balanced posture. New York continues to advance renewable energy at scale, but the Plan acknowledges that renewables alone can’t shoulder the full burden of reliability, affordability, and growth. The plan explicitly recognizes advanced nuclear technologies and natural gas as part of a diverse energy mix needed to meet system needs through at least 2040. This emphasis on resource diversity reflects an understanding that resilient energy systems underpin investor confidence, business expansion, and long-term job creation.

For New York’s economic development strategy, this framing is especially significant. Advanced manufacturing, semiconductor fabrication, life sciences, data centers, clean technology production, and electrified transportation all depend on access to abundant, reliable, and competitively priced power. The Plan recognizes the emergence of large new energy loads and the need to manage their grid and cost impacts thoughtfully. Rather than viewing these loads as a threat, the Plan positions them as an opportunity, provided energy planning, infrastructure investment, and demand management are aligned.

Energy affordability is treated as both a household concern and an economic competitiveness issue. Rising energy costs erode disposable income, strain small businesses, and weaken New York’s ability to compete with other regions for industrial investment. The Plan’s increased focus on system cost management, demand-side flexibility, and peak load reduction is therefore central to its economic logic. By lowering upfront costs for efficiency and clean energy adoption and by managing when and how electricity is used, the state can reduce the need for expensive infrastructure while protecting ratepayers and employers alike.

Equity is integrated into this affordability framework in a practical way. The Plan emphasizes reducing the financial burden on lower-income households while ensuring that the benefits of the clean energy transition, including jobs, workforce training, and local investment, are broadly shared. This approach strengthens public trust and reinforces the social license necessary for long-term infrastructure development.

The Plan also clearly links energy policy to workforce development and innovation. New York’s ability to lead in advanced manufacturing and clean energy depends on skilled labor, strong supply chains, and coordinated investment across its innovative ecosystem. By strengthening partnerships among state agencies, research institutions, utilities, labor organizations, and the private sector, the Plan supports job creation while also enhancing the return on public investment. These partnerships are especially critical for emerging technologies such as advanced nuclear, grid-scale storage, hydrogen, and next-generation manufacturing processes.

Reliability remains a central pillar throughout the Plan, reflecting lessons learned from extreme weather events, aging infrastructure, and increasingly complex grid operations. For manufacturers and large employers, reliability is non-negotiable; outages and volatility translate directly into lost productivity and higher costs. By prioritizing a diverse mix of generation resources and resilient supply infrastructure, the Plan reinforces New York’s value proposition as a dependable place to invest and operate.

Equally important is the Plan’s recognition that decarbonization and economic growth are not mutually exclusive. By aligning clean energy deployment with industrial demand, workforce readiness, and grid reliability, New York can position itself as a national leader in the next era of industrial growth. This alignment is particularly relevant as companies increasingly factor energy reliability, emissions performance, and long-term cost stability into site selection decisions.

The development of the Plan itself underscores the importance of transparency and stakeholder engagement. With nearly 15,000 written comments and broad participation across sectors, the process reflects the complexity and importance of energy decisions for communities, workers, and businesses statewide. The commitment to biennial implementation reports further reinforces accountability and adaptability as conditions evolve.

Ultimately, the State Energy Plan signals a shift from aspirational energy goals to disciplined execution. It acknowledges the realities of today’s energy system while laying out a credible path forward that supports economic development, advanced manufacturing, and community well-being. By grounding clean energy ambition in affordability, reliability, and resource diversity, the Plan strengthens New York’s ability to attract investment, create jobs, and sustain growth over the next two decades.",https://www.macny.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019-Presidents-Message.png,N,,2025-12-19 09:00:30.420043

Carbon pawprint A cheeky way to capture your pet’s contribution to climate change, based on the concept of a carbon footprint.","The years leading up to 2025 were marked by a rare optimism that the United States would finally do something about climate change. Former president Joe Biden called the crisis an “enormous opportunity,” and during his term, Congress passed the biggest climate law in the country’s history. It felt like the U.S. was on the cusp of a greener future — until that momentum came to a sudden halt.

As soon as President Donald Trump took office in January, he brought a swift end to that era with an all-out assault on his predecessor’s policies, unraveling environmental protections and canceling climate research. Trump abandoned global climate commitments while aggressively promoting fossil fuels at home, even as the rest of the world installed more solar panels and wind turbines than ever before.

There’s a word for this kind of reactionary response: greenlash, a social and political backlash against efforts to rein in emissions. In Trump’s second term, climate change became a politically radioactive word: Phrases including “clean energy,” “climate science,” and “pollution” began disappearing from government websites.

And people around the country took the cue. Corporations got quiet about their climate plans. Democratic politicians steered clear of phrases like “planetary emergency.” Media coverage of the climate crisis thinned. That all trickled down to everyday Americans, who say they’re hearing less than they used to about climate change on social media and from the people they know.

While greenlash might sound like a very American phenomenon, it actually took off in Europe. The EU was an early adopter of comprehensive climate policies, and also saw the first big wave of greenlash. That opposition was mainly driven by specific economic burdens — Germany’s plan to switch to energy-efficient heat pumps caused an uproar as homeowners worried about the costs, for example. In the United States, the greenlash gathered more fuel from Trump-style populism and the culture wars.

With a tumultuous 2025 coming to an end, dictionary editors have been digging through the lexicon for words that capture its spirit. Their picks — “AI slop,” “rage bait,” and the essentially meaningless phrase “6-7” — point to a world that’s very online, and not doing much better for it. For us at Grist, greenlash stood out as the word of the year, marking a moment when climate change was yanked off the political priority list.

The mood might have shifted, but people in the U.S. are about as concerned about climate change as they’ve ever been, with about two-thirds saying they’re worried. The consequences of a warming planet were on full display this year, from the horrific fires that burned through Los Angeles neighborhoods in January to the rains that drenched Texas in July, causing the deadliest flash flooding in the country in half a century. It was also a turbulent time for the politics of climate change, a trend reflected in these words and phrases that captured the zeitgeist.

Carbon pawprint

A cheeky way to capture your pet’s contribution to climate change, based on the concept of a carbon footprint.

A host of articles this year highlighted how cats and dogs have an outsized carbon pawprint — and, wow, pet owners got worked up about it. The chief culprit is the meat-heavy diets they feed their pets, with beef in particular emitting a lot of methane, a powerful, planet-warming gas. The conversation really kicked into gear this summer with a headline from The Associated Press: “People often miscalculate climate choices, a study says. One surprise is owning a dog.” The dog ownership question was only a tiny part of that study, which investigated how people rank the climate impact of various personal actions, like going vegan or using public transit. But the headline’s focus blew up on Reddit, where people complained that focusing on individual responsibility instead of big, systemic changes missed the point. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one user wrote sarcastically.

Cheap energy

A Democratic messaging slogan linking clean energy with lower costs for consumers.

Hoping to reach Americans more concerned about rising electricity bills than the upward march of global temperatures, Democrats have been talking more and more about how clean energy is cheap energy. After getting trounced in the 2024 election, many Democratic politicians turned to polling to see what had gone wrong. One theory was that they spent too much time talking about social issues like climate change and LGBTQ+ rights, putting them out of step with voters who cared more about affordability and health care. As one new think tank, the Searchlight Institute, summed it up: “Don’t say climate change.” Climate champions in Congress aren’t avoiding the topic entirely, but selling climate-friendly policies as a strategy to lower the cost of living instead. In September, for instance, two Democratic representatives, Sean Casten and Mike Levin, introduced the “Cheap Energy Agenda.” There’s some evidence the pivot might be working, after Democrats notched wins in November’s off-year election in races where energy costs played an important role.

Critical minerals

Raw materials that are crucial for modern technology, but in limited supply.

It was hard to avoid the phrase critical minerals in 2025, when it moved from policy jargon to the headlines. These metals — including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and so-called “rare earths” — are essential for building solar panels and the batteries that power electric vehicles and e-bikes. The Trump administration has been aggressively chasing these metals as part of its national security strategy, hoping to secure the vital ingredients for making everything from smartphones to high-tech military technologies. Trump signed executive orders calling for more mining of critical minerals and fast-tracked permits for new projects, while also setting his sights on procuring more supply abroad by negotiating deals in Ukraine, central Africa, and across Asia. Stocks for some rare-earth mining companies have more than tripled this year as critical minerals got hyped up. Some experts think that the future of geopolitics will be more defined by these critical metals than by oil.

Energy dominance

A slogan-turned-policy-goal emphasizing fossil fuel production and American power.

When Trump signed an executive order on Inauguration Day aimed at “unleashing energy dominance,” the phrase left experts scratching their heads. It soon became clear it had everything to do with maximizing the production of oil, gas, and coal in order to gain leverage over other countries. It certainly had nothing to do with dominating the market for renewable energy. Experts told Grist that the phrase seems to be more about vibes than specific policy goals. It taps into a nostalgia for what fossil fuels once promised — optimism, growth, and a certain ideal of masculine work. This kind of chest-beating reaction to industrial decline and climate change even has a name: “petro-masculinity.”

Green New Scam

A Trumpism that counters climate policy by rebranding the “Green New Deal” as a conspiracy.

The Green New Scam has become the Trump administration’s defining line on efforts to take on climate change. Trump came up with the catchphrase during a rally in New Hampshire in 2023, while riffing on ways to attack Biden’s climate policies. When he landed on “Green New Scam,” the crowd roared with approval, and he sensed he was onto something — even though Congress had never actually passed a Green New Deal. Renee Hobbs, who wrote a book on modern propaganda, told Grist that Trump’s repetition of Green New Scam fits into a classic strategy: “You repeat the phrases that you want to stick, and you downplay, ignore, minimize, or censor the concepts that don’t meet your agenda.”

Rain anxiety

A growing sense of dread triggered by rainfall.

For many people, the sound of raindrops isn’t comforting at all, but terrifying. If you’ve survived a flood, it can bring up traumatic memories, leading to what’s called rain anxiety. “Anyone else getting mildly stressed when it rains a lot?” reads a typical Reddit post on the matter. Floods struck many parts of the U.S. this year — not only Texas, but also New Mexico, Illinois, North Carolina, New York, and Washington state. By mid-year, the National Weather Service had issued almost 4,000 flash-floods alerts, the most for that time period since 1986. About 20 to 30 percent of people who live through flooding develop depression or post-traumatic stress disorder in the months afterward, according to a report from the U.N.’s international panel of climate scientists. There’s a clear connection to climate change: A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, making the idiom “when it rains, it pours” more of a reality than ever before.

Shutdown of the 730-MW plant, operating since 1972, was timed to comply with a state law banning coal power generation in 2026 and beyond.

The Dec. 16 “emergency order” issued by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright under the Federal Power Act directs owner TransAlta Corp. to ensure Unit 2 of the Centralia Generating Station in Centralia, Wash. “remains available for operation.” The plant’s 670-MW unit 1 shut down in 2020.

The order, in effect at least until March 16, 2026 to prevent claimed risk of winter power outages, follows two similar Trump orders this year directed at plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Wright cited the nation’s “unprecedented surge in electricity demand,” saying the Energy Dept “will continue taking action to keep America’s coal plants running.”

Washington state officials counter that the power plant is completing a shutdown agreed to in 2011. “The workers have moved on,” they said. “There’s no coal left to burn.”

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, Attorney General Nick Brown and state Dept. of Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller released a joint statement condemning the “11th-hour efforts to prevent the TransAlta power plant in Centralia from ceasing coal power generation.”

They added: “Under the guise of ‘emergency powers,’ Wright is attempting to force Washington state’s dirtiest power plant to continue burning coal. Let’s be clear: There’s no emergency here.” It is unclear when or if the state will join Michigan and Pennsylvania in filing a federal lawsuit against the closure.

Keeping the facility open beyond 2025 offers a reliable supply of power essential for grid stability in the Northwest, according to Wright. The department ordered the Bonneville Power Administration to handle power transmission from the Centralia plant. Rate recovery is available through federal regulations governing energy emergencies, according to Wright.

Plans were already in place to reopen the site as a 700-MW gas-fired power generator by 2028, with Puget Sound Energy agreeing on Dec. 9 to purchase power from the updated facility.

Gas Conversion is 'Priority'

Calgary, Alberta-based TransAlta confirmed in a statement to ENR that it it is evaluating the federal directive and “will work with state and federal governments.” But it said “the coal-to-gas conversion project remains a priority for TransAlta,”

The company said it will provide more details regarding the directive “in due course.”

The Energy Dept. cited a ""resource adequacy report"" saying blackouts in the U.S. were on track to potentially increase 100 times by 2030 if power continued to be taken off-line. The agency also noted a North American Electric Reliability Corp. 2025-2026 “winter reliability assessment” that the Northwest region is at elevated risk during periods of extreme weather, such as prolonged cold snaps.

The report also said delays threatening completion of new battery storage, solar and wind power-generating projects. But Trump administration policies also are hindering expansion and connection of those power projects to transmission systems.

The state officials said that instead of helping stabilize the Washington power market, the federal action “is more likely to drive up costs and expose Washington communities to more pollution.”

TransAlta’s plan to spend $600 million to convert the facility from coal to natural gas-fired generation and operate it until the end of 2044 is part of the agreement with Puget Sound Energy. TransAlta anticipated a final investment decision made after receipt of all required approvals in early 2027, including the agreement.

John Kousinioris, TransAlta CEO and president, previously said that converting to natural gas would “lower the emission intensity profile of the facility by approximately 50%.” He also said facility operation as a gas power plant ""will generate long-term contracted cash flow for TransAlta, earning a full return on capital within the contract term.”

On its website. TransAlta says Centralia is a merchant plant, with costs such as environmental upgrades not passed on to customers. The company says it has invested more than $300 million in coal pollution control technology at the plant, including scrubbers and low nitrogen dioxide burners.

TransAlta did not confirm status of contractor selection for the gas conversion, but Kousinioris previously said the company ""is well-positioned to execute this project given our deep technical, operational and engineering experience gained in previous coal-to-gas conversions.”

Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act requires state utilities to end all coal-fired generation by 2026 as part of a push toward greenhouse gas neutrality in 2030 and emission-free grid by 2045.

'Federal Overrreach'

“This federal overreach is incredibly unproductive,” Lauren McCloy, utility and regulatory director of NW Energy Coalition, a 100-member utility, business and civic clean energy advocacy group, told ENR. “Keeping a plant open that is slated for closure is not useful or economically feasible. This order takes resources and focus away from addressing the real challenges we have.”

McCloy said the Energy Dept. is “misinterpreting regional resource adequacy assessments” that do not indicate an imminent emergency, but show the system is adequate to meet demand in the near-term, even factoring in the long-planned Centralia coal plant retirement.

But forecasts assume a high level of uncertainty about how much load from data centers will materialize in the region. “The solution is to continue to plan for, acquire and build the new resources and transmission that we need to meet that load as it materializes,” McCloy said.

Christina Wong, Washington Conservation Action interim CEO, added that burning coal is an expensive way to produce energy, and Patti Goldman, Earthjustice attorney, called the federal order a “fake emergency.”

USA, Texas, Houston: Giga Energy has announced the opening of its new medium-voltage manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. The 5,600 m2 (60,000-sq-ft) plant will serve as the company’s main US site for producing medium-voltage transformers, with production scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2026. Annual output is expected to exceed 3,000 units, providing critical electrical infrastructure amid ongoing transformer supply constraints.

At launch, the Houston Factory will create 25 jobs, with plans to expand to nearly 100 as production increases. The facility supports domestic manufacturing and provides faster access to transformers for data centres, renewable energy projects, and industrial power systems.

The plant features advanced manufacturing equipment, including a terahertz drying oven that accelerates moisture removal during transformer production, enhancing consistency and reducing cycle time. Local manufacturing also allows Giga Energy to maintain direct oversight of quality and delivery schedules.

Matt Lohstroh, CEO of Giga Energy, said: “The MV Houston Factory combines advanced manufacturing technology with American-based production to deliver higher quality, faster lead times and new local jobs, all at a moment when the country urgently needs more transformer capacity.”

The MV Houston Factory will also supply transformers for Giga’s development projects, including over 500 MW of electrical infrastructure for AI-focused data centres. This will support both Giga-operated sites and colocation facilities for enterprise and hyperscale AI operators.

The facility is set to play a key role in scaling U.S. transformer production and reinforcing energy infrastructure for data centres, renewable generation, and industrial networks.

It’s been a difficult year for clean energy in America. President Donald Trump entered office in January and promptly stopped the transition away from fossil fuels and toward solar, wind, and batteries in its tracks. Right?

Not quite. In fact, for all of Trump’s paeans to ​“beautiful, clean coal” and to natural gas, it’s clean energy that has once again led the way this year. Through November, 92% of new power capacity added to the grid in 2025 came in the form of solar, wind, or storage, according to Cleanview analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data shared with Canary Media.

That’s in line with figures from recent years. In 2024, 96% of U.S. capacity additions were carbon-free.

This year, solar alone accounted for half of new capacity added to the grid through November, while storage made up 31%. Despite Trump’s all-out assault on wind energy — and his pledge that no ​“windmills” would be built during his term — the energy source has so far accounted for more gigawatts of new electricity than gas turbines have.

It’s worth noting that December is typically the busiest month for new energy deployments in the U.S., so these numbers will look a bit different when the full-year data comes in. It’s also possible that clean-energy deployments are artificially high right now as developers race to complete projects before Trump’s restrictions on lucrative tax credits kick in. And, overall, fossil fuels still generate a much larger share of U.S. electricity than renewables do — even if solar and wind are closing that gap.

Still, the figures underscore the warnings made by energy experts, policymakers, and advocates: The Trump administration is playing with fire by trying to limit the development of solar, battery, and wind energy right when electricity demand is rising at its fastest rate in decades.

These are the quickest sources of energy to deploy. Meanwhile, gas turbines face a supply-chain crunch that is both driving up the cost of some new power plants and making it near impossible to build enough gas facilities to meet new demand, even if climate concerns weren’t a factor.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/cotw-clean-capacity-nov.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=9405f635392e8f848318cf0262be2cc2,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:43.864284

Although youth climate plaintiffs have notched some victories, they have also seen setbacks.","Rikki Held grew up on her family’s ranch in Montana, watching the land transform amid the climate crisis. The Powder River, which runs through the property, has sometimes dried up during drought, leaving crops and livestock without water. At other points, rapid snowmelt and heavy rains have caused flooding and eroded riverbanks, making the land difficult to use.

Two years ago, the 24-year-old and a group of other young people won a groundbreaking legal victory, intended to prevent those impacts from worsening. In August 2023, a judge ruled in favour of plaintiffs in Held v Montana, in which 16 young people accused the state of violating their constitutional rights by promoting planet-warming fossil fuels. The state’s supreme court affirmed the judge’s findings late last year, but plaintiffs say lawmakers have since passed new laws that violate that ruling. So last week, they filed a new petition calling on the supreme court to enforce their earlier win, one of several youth-led constitutional climate lawsuits filed in the US this year.

“We have to keep working on cases like these,” Held said. More on this eventful year in youth climate litigation, after this week’s headlines.

In focus

Represented by the nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust, US youth brought other accountability-focused climate suits in 2025. In May, 22 young Americans sued the Trump administration, alleging that federal officials were violating their constitutional rights with their pro-fossil fuel policies, including moves to declare a “national energy emergency” and “unleash American energy”, and an order aimed at “reinvigorating” the domestic production of coal – the dirtiest and most expensive fossil fuel. A judge dismissed the lawsuit this autumn, but the group quickly appealed.

Eva Lighthiser, the 19-year-old named plaintiff in the federal court case, is also involved in the Montana litigation. Its earlier success “reminded me just how important democracy and the power of young voices are,” she said.

“With that in mind, [suing] this current administration was something I approached with confidence in our judicial system and the US constitution,” said Lighthiser.

Young climate plaintiffs also filed cases this year against Wisconsin and Utah. In September, some also submitted a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, claiming the US was violating international law by perpetuating a fossil fuel-based energy system.

The lawsuits face a challenging path. Although youth climate plaintiffs have notched some victories, they have also seen setbacks. Earlier this year, Juliana v United States – perhaps the best-known US youth climate lawsuit, which argued the US was harming youth by perpetuating a fossil-based energy system – ended after wending its way through the court for 10 years, when the supreme court declined to hear an appeal.

But the plaintiffs remain undeterred.

“Young people are inheriting an uncertain future where climate change is only going to continue to worsen, and it feels essential for us to use our voices and take action in [any] way we can,” said Lighthiser.

“When Held was initially filed in 2020, I was too young to vote. As young people, taking to the courts can be our only viable option in regard to participating in democracy.”

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill’s chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

“Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. “Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment …. has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, “we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill’s co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure “gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win” on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,” Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy … expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.”

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,” said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,” he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.",https://www.qcnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2025/12/694470622b39d5.30442811.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:26.563093

“So, in terms of building new plants, there’s an incentive to build more … and there’s incentive to build too much.”","An investigative report released this morning by Wisconsin Watch finds that shuttered power plants are on track to cost Wisconsin ratepayers nearly $1 billion by the end of 2026. At the same time, the state is facing unprecedented pressure to generate new electricity for data centers—raising the risk of another $1 billion in future “stranded assets.”

This reporting comes as the Legislature considers community solar legislation (SB 559 and AB 493), which would lower energy bills, strengthen the grid, and return decision-making power to local communities. The bill establishes a community solar program that allows farmers and developers to build small-scale projects—typically 20 to 30 acres—that neighbors can subscribe to and save 10% on their monthly utility bill. This approach expands access to solar, the cheapest form of electricity, avoids large-scale developments, and does so with zero taxpayer dollars.

Key Points from Wisconsin Watch:

In fact, residential and business utility customers throughout Wisconsin owe nearly $1 billion on “stranded assets” — power plants like Pleasant Prairie that have been or will soon be shut down, a Wisconsin Watch investigation found.

That total will likely grow over the next five years with additional coal plants scheduled to cease operations.

Customers must pay not only for the debt taken on to build and upgrade the plants themselves, but also an essentially guaranteed rate of return for their utility company owners, long after the plants stop generating revenue themselves.

Utilities “profit off of everything they build or acquire,” Stuart said, “and so there is a strong motivation to put steel in the ground and perhaps to even overbuild.”

When the Public Service Commission approves construction of a new power plant, it allows the utility company to levy electricity rates high enough to recover its investment plus the specified rate of return — even after a plant becomes a stranded asset.

Efficient Power Distribution: Designing electrical grids to be more efficient and reliable using modern power electronics and direct current (DC) systems.

""For a totally new grid. A smart DC grid makes way more sense with modern power electronics.""

""Then a DC smart grid makes more sense for connecting the solar panels home battery and the EV directly to each other.""

Decentralized Generation with HVDC

Local Power Generation: Placing power generation closer to load centers and using High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) for interconnections to reduce transmission losses.

""Generation needs to be near load centres, the way it used to be before there were national power grids, then use HVDC for interconnections.""

Mesh Networks for Reliability

Redundant Grid Design: Implementing mesh networks to build redundancy into the electrical grid, improving reliability and reducing the risk of blackouts.

""Look to mesh networks. Redundancy built in.""

Reduced Car Dependency

Improved Public Transit: Focusing on reducing the number of cars in cities through enhanced public transportation and alternative modes of transport.

""Owning electric cars is no solution for most problems that cars cause in cities... The solution is fewer cars.""

""Mixed traffic streetcars are a complete failure from what I can tell. Worse than busses since they so easily get blocked by cars."" - Highlights the need for dedicated infrastructure for public transit.

Affordable Solar Technology

Low-Cost Solar Panels: Leveraging the production of inexpensive solar panels to make green energy accessible, especially for developing countries and urban areas with poor grid infrastructure.

""China is producing small solar panels at unimaginably low prices, and these solar panels are being distributed in large quantities to developing countries with poor national power grids.""

Vertical Farming

Urban Food Production: While currently uneconomical, vertical farming is seen as a potential future solution for urban food production, which could reduce the energy associated with food transportation.

""Just for the record, vertical farming is a cool idea with a lot of upsides that may become practical in the future if we managed to make some big improvements in our energy system.""

They reached out to their Reddit community to help determine which one was best.

The homeowner explained in the r/HVACAdvice subreddit that they were deciding between two heat pump brands and wanted to take advantage of the expiring tax credit from the Inflation Reduction Act.

When choosing heat pumps and installers, TCD's HVAC Explorer page is a great place to start your research. You can save up to 50% on your energy bills and also choose from subscription services, with no money down.

The Inflation Reduction Act is also a great tool for saving you money. You can earn tax credits for upgrading your home with a heat pump, but you have to act fast before it expires. This is exactly what the homeowner is utilizing.

The OP said, ""We're deciding whether to replace our 35-year-old furnace + 2.5 ton AC with a heat pump to take advantage of the $2000 expiring federal tax credit.""

Heat pumps work differently from a traditional HVAC system. In the warmer months, they pull the warm air from inside your home and transfer it outside. In the colder months, they pull the heat from the ground, water, or air, and transfer it to the inside of your home.

Heat pumps work more efficiently than other heating solutions, which is how they can save you money. Because they work more efficiently, they are also better for the environment. They use less energy than a traditional HVAC system, and they don't have to run on fossil fuels, like a gas furnace, for instance.

When you're ready for the upgrade, the HVAC Explorer page can connect you with trusted partners. Palmetto is one of the partners that offers a subscription service for $0 down and as little as $99 a month. The company also provides 12 years of free maintenance, which can lower the total cost over the lifetime of the unit since you won't be paying for maintenance or repairs.

Government efforts to prevent the retirement of coal-fired power plants and boost the demand for coal may slow coal’s decline in the short term.","As projections of U.S. electricity demand rise sharply, President Donald Trump is looking to coal – historically a dominant force in the U.S. energy economy – as a key part of the solution.

In an April 2025 executive order, for instance, Trump used emergency powers to direct the Department of Energy to order the owners of coal-fired power plants that were slated to be shut down to keep the plants running.

He also directed federal agencies to “identify coal resources on Federal lands” and ease the process for leasing and mining coal on those lands. In addition, he issued orders to exclude coal-related projects from environmental reviews, promote coal exports and potentially subsidize the production of coal as a national security resource.

But there remain limits to the president’s power to slow the declining use of coal in the U.S. And while efforts continue to overcome these limits and prop up coal, mining coal remains an ongoing danger to workers: In 2025, there have been five coal-mining deaths in West Virginia and at least two others elsewhere in the U.S.

A long legacy

Until 2015, coal-fired power plants generated more electricity than any other type of fuel in the U.S. But with the rapid expansion of a new type of hydraulic fracturing, natural gas became a cheap and stable source for power generation. The prices of solar and wind power also dropped steadily. These alternatives ultimately overcame coal in the U.S. power supply.

Before this change, coal mining defined the economy and culture of many U.S. towns – and some states and regions, such as Wyoming and Appalachia – for decades. And in many small towns, coal-related businesses, including power plants, were key employers.

Coal has both benefits and drawbacks. It provides a reliable fuel source for electricity that can be piled up on-site at power plants without needing a tank or underground facility for storage.

But it’s dirty: Thousands of coal miners developed a disease called black lung. The federal government pays for medical care for some sick miners and makes monthly payments to family members of miners who die prematurely. Burning coal also emits multiple air pollutants, prematurely killing half a million people in the United States from 1999 through 2020.

Coal is dangerous for workers, too. Some coal-mining companies have had abysmal safety records, leading to miner deaths, such as the recent drowning of a miner in a sudden flood in a West Virginia mine. Safety reforms have been implemented since the Big Branch Mine explosion in 2010, and coal miner deaths in the U.S. have since declined. But coal mining remains a hazardous job.

A champion of coal

In both of his terms, Trump has championed the revival of coal. In 2017, for example, Trump’s Department of Energy asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to pay coal and nuclear plants higher rates than the competitive market would pay, saying they were key to keeping the U.S. electricity grid running. The commission declined.

In his second term, Trump is more broadly using powers granted to the president in emergencies, and he is seeking to subsidize coal across the board – in mining, power plants and exports.

At least some of the urgency is coming from the rapid construction of data centers for artificial intelligence, which the Trump administration champions. Many individual data centers use as much power as a small or medium city. There’s enough generation capacity to power them, though only by activating power plants that are idle most of the time and that operate only during peak demand periods. Using those plants would require data centers to reduce their electricity use during those peaks – which it’s not clear they would agree to do.

So many data centers, desperate for 24/7 electricity, are relying on old coal-fired power plants – buying electricity from plants that otherwise would be shutting down.

Limits remain

Despite the Trump adminstration’s efforts to rapidly expand data centers and coal to power them, coal is more expensive than most other fuels for power generation, with costs still rising.

Half of U.S. coal mines have closed within the past two decades, and productivity at the remaining mines is declining due to a variety of factors, such as rising mining costs, environmental regulation and competition from cheaper sources. Coal exports have also seen declines in the midst of the tariff wars.

The U.S. Department of the Interior’s recent effort to follow Trump’s orders and lease more coal on federal lands received only one bid – at a historically low price of less than a penny per ton. But in fact, even if the government gave its coal away for free, it would still make more economic sense for utilities to build power plants that use other fuels. This is due to the high cost of running old coal plants as compared to new natural gas and renewable infrastructure.

Natural gas is cheaper – and, in some places, so are renewable energy and battery storage. Government efforts to prevent the retirement of coal-fired power plants and boost the demand for coal may slow coal’s decline in the short term. In the long term, however, coal faces a very uncertain future as a part of the U.S. electricity mix.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9894-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:50.449280

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — Across India, battery recycling faces a mixture of challenges and opportunity as it plays an important role in the country’s shift to clean power.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India’s growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country’s copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India’s capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India’s battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India’s waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

Gaps between policy and implementation

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world’s most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India’s government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

How battery recycling works

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery’s contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Reducing dependence on imported minerals

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it’s an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

The Sessions The three sessions followed a similar format, although, as detailed below, the session held in North Dakota differed somewhat.
Other than the opening remarks provided by the Agencies, the purpose of the sessions was for the Agencies to receive verbal comments on the Proposed Rule.
The North Dakota session was organized and presented differently from the others.
Responding to these regional conditions is one of the many issues that are worth tracking as the Proposed Rule goes through the regulatory process.","As part of their proposed rule (Proposed Rule) to revise the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) (collectively, Agencies) hosted three public comment sessions in which they received verbal comments from those in attendance. Two of the sessions were held in person with virtual attendance options – Bismarck, North Dakota on December 12, 2025, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 15 – while the third session, on December 16, was fully virtual. EPA’s website contains additional details on the sessions, including draft agendas that list individuals who pre-registered to speak.

Background

As Nossaman previously detailed here, the Agencies are seeking to revise the definition of WOTUS and, thereby, what features would or would not be regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Because of the significant regulatory burden associated with being subject to CWA jurisdiction and permitting, the definition of WOTUS has been frequently litigated. The U.S. Supreme Court has weighed in on four separate occasions, and the Agencies have revised the definition four times in roughly a decade.

The Proposed Rule generally focuses on limiting federal jurisdiction through narrowing what qualifies as a WOTUS. More information on the rulemaking can be found here.

The Sessions

The three sessions followed a similar format, although, as detailed below, the session held in North Dakota differed somewhat. Representatives from the Agencies opened each session by explaining the need for the Proposed Rule. The Agencies stated there were three objectives served by the Proposed Rule: fully implementing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, 598 U.S. 651 (2023); cutting red tape to reduce costs; and protecting water quality by striking the right balance between state and federal authority. They also highlighted that they were seeking clarity, certainty and durability while requesting information on regional differences and tools to implement any final rule.

Each session lasted between 3 and 3.5 hours. Other than the opening remarks provided by the Agencies, the purpose of the sessions was for the Agencies to receive verbal comments on the Proposed Rule. As a result, the Agencies did not answer any questions from those in attendance. The sessions were recorded for internal use, although the Agencies plan to post transcripts to their respective websites.

The North Dakota session was organized and presented differently from the others. The first half of this session (i.e., pre-break) was hosted by U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) rather than by the Agencies. Senator Cramer, Senator John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong all voiced support for the Proposed Rule and opposition to the existing framework. The commenters during this part of the session included local government officials and business leaders, all of whom voiced their support for the Proposed Rule. It was also unique because no list of commenters was provided. The second half of this session set the stage for the following sessions, as it was led by the Agencies, included a list of pre-registered speakers (both online and in-person) that was provided to the observers and provided an opportunity for other commenters after that.

The Pittsburgh session included the least participation of the three. Like the North Dakota session, it included a mix of online and in-person commenters, providing mixed views on the proposed rule.

The fully remote session was the most well attended, again providing mixed views on the proposed rule.

The Comments

Across the three sessions, there were roughly 75-100 commenters. The comments were split nearly 50-50, with a slight edge over all of the sessions in commenters opposed to the Proposed Rule. However, the North Dakota and Pittsburgh sessions included more supportive comments whereas the remote-only session included more opposition comments. Many commenters requested the comment deadline be extended given the importance of the rule and the various holidays that fall within the comment period.

The following list summarizes the most common points made by commenters and is not intended to be exhaustive:

Comments in support

Common sense rule that can be instituted without the need for experts or lawyers and reduces uncertainty

Consistent with Sackett and other WOTUS precedent

Cuts red tape and lowers costs

Returns jurisdiction back to states, tribes and landowners, all of whom know their land better than bureaucrats

This rule is durable and should stop the back-and-forth of the past decade over WOTUS

Supporters often advocated for a strengthening of the Proposed Rule, listing the need for more clarity on significant terms such as continuous surface connection, relatively permanent and wet season. They also advocated for more clarity/a strengthening of essentially every exception that is listed, with ditches receiving the most attention. Supporters also advocated for tools and other guidance to assist with implementation.

Comments in opposition

Ignores the science on these issues, in particular the impact of wetlands, ditches and other now-excluded areas that impact traditional navigable waters

Features like intermittent streams and ephemeral streams have a substantial impact on navigable waters

Shifts costs away from those responsible onto the public

Especially the case with the loss of protection for wetlands, which provide flood control and other services that protect citizens

Contrary to the intent of the Clean Water Act, which has overwhelming support in public polling

Polls show that people want more protection, not less

Bad for public health

Does not protect tribal rights

A giveaway to polluters/developers/is political in nature

Next Steps

Written comments can be submitted until January 5, 2026, on www.regulations.gov; commenters must mention Docket ID EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

Given the number of commenters on both sides of the Proposed Rule requesting changes to it, it seems likely that the final rule could differ in some meaningful ways from the proposal. One area that the Agencies discussed was ensuring that the Proposed Rule properly reflected local conditions; they expressed a desire to ensure that the definitions and guidelines in the rule were clear enough to easily implement while also being crafted in a way to take into account regional differences in watershed conditions. For example, the commenters from North Dakota were supportive of the fact that prairie potholes did not qualify as WOTUS (although some wanted that more explicitly stated in any final rule) while one from Alaska discussed that this rule did not align with physical watershed conditions in Alaska. Responding to these regional conditions is one of the many issues that are worth tracking as the Proposed Rule goes through the regulatory process.",https://www.nossaman.com/i-t1766106585/logo-og.png,N,,2025-12-19 02:59:36.257332

Roadless areas are world-class destinations for hikers and mountain bikers, boast old-growth forests, support local economies, and, importantly, provide clean drinking water for communities downstream.
Roadless areas in the Shenandoah Valley make up one of the largest tracts of undeveloped public land in the region.
“The roadless areas are the cleanest source of water that we have in the state, and the communities like Harrisonburg and Stanton and the Shenandoah Valley that get their water supply directly from reservoirs that flow out of roadless areas, they are very fortunate to have such clean water,” Lynn Cameron said.
Clean water, big savings Revoking the Roadless Rule and putting clean water sources at risk doesn’t just impact public health—it threatens local economies too.","From the edge of the Staunton Reservoir, you can peer into the crystal clear waters that trickle down from Virginia’s George Washington National Forest. The Reservoir, which was created by the construction of the Staunton Dam in 1926, is the main water supply for the nearby city of Staunton. It’s also fed by rivers and streams in roadless areas, which are places protected by the Forest Service’s Roadless Rule.

The Roadless Rule is a critical policy that protects some of our wildest public lands from unnecessary roadbuilding and industrial development, ensuring they can be enjoyed by future generations. Roadless areas are world-class destinations for hikers and mountain bikers, boast old-growth forests, support local economies, and, importantly, provide clean drinking water for communities downstream.

Tell Congress to save the South’s wildest forests.

“The water coming off of the National Forest here in the valley is just so clean that it’s better than bottled water that you could buy,” Lynn Cameron, co-chair of the group Friends of Shenandoah Mountain, said. “We’re just so lucky to have clean water that tastes good, too.”

But she worries that luck could run out, because the Forest Service is currently pushing to get rid of the Roadless Rule, a move that would open roadless areas to harmful development and would put these incredible places—and the region’s supply of clean water—at risk.

The water coming off of the National Forest here in the valley is just so clean that it’s better than bottled water that you could buy.

Lynn Cameron, co-chair of the group Friends of Shenandoah Mountain

Communities “fortunate” to have clean water

Virginia has more acres of roadless areas than any other state in the eastern United States—nearly 400,000 acres. Roadless areas in the Shenandoah Valley make up one of the largest tracts of undeveloped public land in the region. They also safeguard dozens of creeks, rivers, and streams that are important drinking water sources for people living downstream.

“The roadless areas are the cleanest source of water that we have in the state, and the communities like Harrisonburg and Stanton and the Shenandoah Valley that get their water supply directly from reservoirs that flow out of roadless areas, they are very fortunate to have such clean water,” Lynn Cameron said.

Cameron’s sentiment is echoed by the city of Staunton itself. In a recent water quality report, the city mentions the Forest Service’s strict management of the area, saying the guardrails on development there protect the drinking water sources from pollution.

“The local governments have been very concerned about what happens to these mountains because they know how important the water supply is and they don’t want anything to happen,” Cameron said.

But it’s not just nearby communities that benefit from the crystal clear rivers and streams in Virginia’s roadless areas. The waters flow into the Potomac and James Rivers, benefiting millions of people downstream.

An SELC analysis found that more than three million people in Virginia and in Washington D.C. get their water from watersheds that are fed by streams in roadless areas.

That means if you turn on a faucet in Virginia, there’s a good chance the water coming out of your tap started in a roadless area.

“Just about everybody in Virginia benefits from the protection of this area because they’re using the water,” Cameron explained. “We’re lucky to be up here in the headwaters, but downstream they’re getting the benefit of these clean waters, too.”

Attack on our clean water

But those benefits are threatened by the Forest Service’s proposal to revoke the Roadless Rule, which would allow the agency and deep-pocketed corporations to carve up roadless areas with roads and logging projects that put clean water at risk.

Roads significantly increase pollution that runs into waterways. Harmful hydrocarbons like gasoline and oil can easily flow off of roads and into rivers and streams. Roads also erode slopes, clogging waterways with dirt, debris, and other contaminants.

When they fall into disrepair—which is often—roads pollute nearby streams, clogging them with dirt and sediment that hurts water quality and chokes out fish and other aquatic life. The Forest Service estimates that there are already “at least” 20,000 problematic roads—likely an underestimation due to a lack of agency assessments—and repairing them would cost more than $1.2 billion.

“Unnecessary roadbuilding is a massive threat to clean water,” SELC Senior Attorney Kristin Gendzier said. “Over the last 25 years, the Roadless Rule has protected important water sources from contamination by preventing reckless development. Getting rid of this critical safeguard will threaten the water that communities across the South rely on every day.”

The Forest Service isn’t looking to build new roads in roadless areas to make it easier for people to get to trailheads or scenic views. In fact, less than 25 percent of the agency’s current road system is open to passenger cars. Instead, the roads would be built for logging trucks as companies look to cut down forests that were previously protected by the Roadless Rule. The Forest Service has said as much, writing in its notice of intent to repeal the roadless rule that the goal is to “take immediate action” to increase logging on public lands.

Clean water, big savings

Revoking the Roadless Rule and putting clean water sources at risk doesn’t just impact public health—it threatens local economies too. The unpolluted qualities of water coming from Virginia’s roadless areas means that cities in the Shenandoah Valley have to spend fewer tax dollars to filter and treat water before it is pumped to homes and businesses.

Brad Striebig, an engineering professor at James Madison University, says the city of Harrisonburg, Virginia, saves millions of dollars by getting clean water from roadless areas in the George Washington National Forest. And those financial benefits—like the water itself—flow downstream to other communities across the state.

“We’re talking millions of dollars just to the city of Harrisonburg. You can imagine you could extrapolate the value of that water as it moves from the mountains to the coast. It’s immeasurable, it truly is. You cannot put a value on that water.”

Adding roads into roadless areas threatens those financial benefits, and when water gets contaminated, it’s taxpayers left on the hook.

Once we put things into the water, it’s much more expensive to treat them than to rely on the pure water that’s already there.

Brad Striebig, James Madison University

From the mountains to the bay

The effect of roadless areas in western Virginia can even be felt hundreds of miles away on the shores of the iconic Chesapeake Bay. Clean headwaters help reduce pollution that ends up in the bay, protecting a vital natural resource. The bay supports a thriving tourism economy and is the backbone of the region’s fishing industry, producing more than 500 million pounds of seafood each year.

But roadbuilding, logging, and mining projects in roadless areas will lead to pollution that not only hurts mountain streams but flows downriver into the Chesapeake Bay where it can do long-lasting damage. Sediment pollution, which is the biggest risk factor from unnecessary roads, smother oysters and other key species that live there.

“Decades of collaboration and billions of dollars have gone into cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay—which is a national treasure and a source of intense regional pride. In all these efforts to clean up the bay, we sometimes forget the critical role of keeping its headwaters clean,” Gendzier said. “Getting rid of the Roadless Rule would allow more pollution into bay headwaters, setting back our long and hard fight to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. That should make us all angry.”

Protecting roadless areas

While the U.S. energy system is continually evolving, the 10th District is well poised to retain a leading role in energy in the coming decade.","10th District Energy Overview

The 10th District remained a leading energy producing region over the last decade. Since 2015, the 10th District ranked second among Federal Reserve District’s for fossil fuel production (Chart 1, left panel). While fossil fuel production in the 10th District fell, mostly due to declining coal production in Wyoming (Chart 5, right panel), oil and natural gas production continued growing within the district (Chart 3, right panel).

For renewable energy, the 10th District ranked third among Fed districts. Power generation from renewable sources grew from roughly 14 percent to roughly 37 percent over the last decade (Chart 1, right panel). The shift toward renewable energy was driven primarily by the expansion of wind facilities (purple area) in states like Oklahoma and Kansas – some of the windiest locations in the country (Cowley and Farha 2024, EIA 2024). All-in the 10th District is an energy-abundant region of the U.S., which maintained its importance over the last decade.

Energy Trade Flows

Energy trade flows were a key change in the U.S. energy system in the last decade – the topic for the External LinkFederal Reserve’s 10th Annual Energy Conference. Growing energy exports were supported by rising production levels (Chart 3 – Panel A) and the U.S. moved from being a net importer to net exporter of energy products over the last decade. The U.S. became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017 (Chart 2, left panel), driven by growing natural gas production and a rapid increase in liquified natural gas (LNG) exports (Chart 2, right panel). The U.S. is now the world’s largest LNG exporter (EIA 2025a). Similarly, the U.S. became a net exporter of petroleum in 2018 (Chart 2, left panel), following the repeal of the crude oil export ban in 2015. The growth in U.S. petroleum exports over the last decade were driven primarily by growing crude oil exports (Chart 2, right panel). The U.S. is now one of the top five crude oil exporting nations globally.

Oil and Natural Gas Production

Greater energy exports coincided with rapidly growing domestic energy production over the last decade. U.S. crude oil and natural gas production rose by roughly 50 percent over the last decade (Chart 3, left panel). However, oil and natural gas production growth was mixed across 10th District states in the last decade – New Mexico (Permian Basin) was a notable outlier with oil production growth over 4 times and natural gas production growth roughly 2 times. Colorado had a more modest oil and natural gas production growth – 39 and 9 percent, respectively. Oklahoma witnessed a 12 percent decline in oil production growth and 13 percent increase in natural gas. Wyoming had a 24 percent increase in oil production and 48 percent decline in natural gas production (Chart 3, right panel). Higher oil and gas production growth over the last decade was predominantly concentrated in locations with the greatest productivity gains.

Drilling Productivity

A driving force behind growing oil and gas production levels in the U.S. is a substantial rise in productivity. Chart 4 shows a measure of capital and labor productivity – output per unit input – for oil and gas production by location. Drill rig productivity – the primary form of capital equipment used for extracting oil and gas – more than doubled over the last decade and labor productivity rose by roughly 90 percent. Drilling productivity changes were mixed across District states: Colorado and New Mexico both saw substantial productivity gains – rig productivity rose 385 percent and 108 percent in CO and NM respectively, while labor productivity rose 64 percent and 336 percent respectively. Oklahoma rig and labor productivity rose by 147 percent and 93 percent. Wyoming witnessed a modest 9 percent decline in rig productivity and 3 percent increase in labor productivity in the last decade.

Coal Electricity Generation and Mining Activity

While oil and gas production rose in the last decade, coal declined. Coal electricity generation fell by nearly 50 percent in the U.S. and roughly 40 percent in the 10th District over the last decade. As overall electricity generation capacity grew – driven mostly wind and natural gas – coal as a share of total electricity generation fell by 17 percentage points in the U.S. and 27 percentage points in 10J (Chart 5, left panel). Coal as a share of net electricity generation now makes up only 16 percent of electricity generation for the U.S. and 34 percent for the 10th District. As demand from the power sector subsided, coal mining activity also fell in the last decade. U.S. and 10th District (mostly Wyoming) coal mine production fell by nearly 50 percent in the last ten years (Chart 5, right panel).

Renewable Energy

While coal declined in prominence, renewable energy adoption steadily grew over the last decade. Renewable energy generation in the 10th District grew by a little over three-fold and roughly doubled in the U.S., driven by steady growth in wind and more recently greater solar adoption. Consequently, the renewable share of electricity generation grew from roughly 14 percent in the 10th District and U.S. to roughly 37 and 26 percent, respectively (Chart 6, left panel). With rapid expansion in renewable generation over the last decade, most District states now exceed the national average share for renewables, with wind and solar as the primary contributors to the renewable generation mix (Chart 6, right panel).

Conclusion

Over the last decade the 10th District remained a leading energy region in the U.S., even as domestic energy system witnessed several key changes. Oil and natural gas production grew nationally and regionally, driven by rising productivity. Growing domestic oil and gas production helped support energy exports, turning the U.S. into a net exporter of natural gas and petroleum over during that time period. While coal production declined regionally and nationally, renewables rose substantially. The 10th District outpaced the U.S. in renewable energy additions, driven by rapid growth in wind and solar generation. While the U.S. energy system is continually evolving, the 10th District is well poised to retain a leading role in energy in the coming decade.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/images/HERO_SIZING_FOR_IMAGES_78.original.png,N,,2025-12-19 05:59:28.723693

World leaders were a bit premature in announcing the death of internal combustion. Ford recently became the latest global manufacturer to acknowledge it made a colossal, $20 billion mistake in throwing all its energy behind electric vehicles.

“The $50, $60, $70,000 EVs just weren’t selling. We’re following customers to where the market is. … These really expensive $70,000 electric trucks, as much as I love the product, they didn’t make sense,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNBC.

The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker wasn’t alone in going all in on converting its entire lineup into plug-ins. Just about every major brand embraced the delusion that, one day, people would intend to be able to travel a few hundred miles, pull over and wait an hour or more at a roadside station for their high-tech jalopy to draw sufficient juice from the grid.

Toyota was the notable exception in refusing to hop onto the politically correct bandwagon like its peers. The Japanese firm produces just one battery-motivated vehicle. The remaining offerings include an assortment of hybrids, normal sedans and SUVs. It even offers a pair of gas-guzzling sports cars, a rare option in these times.

C-suite automotive executives elsewhere felt their world turn upside down when President Trump flipped the off switch on the subsidies. Predictably, EV sales plunged 53% the instant the freebies vanished. The administration is also eliminating the onerous fleet mileage targets that were meant to strangle vehicles animated by fossil fuels.

On the bright side, the big car companies will no longer toss billions of dollars into the bonfire by developing overpriced models that nobody wants. Misallocated capital resources pushed sticker prices skyward, even on gas-powered cars, because someone has to pay for that research and development.

Thus, an average automobile now costs $50,000, a staggering $16,000 rise over the past 10 years. With the scam unraveling, these numbers should settle.

“It was ridiculous, very expensive. It put tremendous upward pressure on car prices, combined with the insane electric vehicle mandate. Biden’s burdensome regulations have caused the price of cars to soar more than 25%, and in one case, they went up 18% in one year,” Mr. Trump said earlier this month as he signed the executive order killing the previous administration’s CAFE standards.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy added on X, “Freedom Means Affordable Cars,” and even the Europeans are seeing the wisdom of Mr. Trump’s actions. The European Commission released a package of reforms Tuesday that some have styled as a reversal of the EV mandate.

It’s more of a slight scaling back. Instead of dictating that 100% of cars must be electric, the bureaucrats in Brussels will allow 10% to be gas-powered. How generous of them. “The Automotive Omnibus will ease administrative burden and cut costs for European manufacturers, boosting their global competitiveness, and freeing up resources for decarbonisation,” a commission statement explained.

That’s good news for Detroit, because a 10% reprieve isn’t enough to stay competitive. Let the Continent continue to dwell in the schemes of the past while America readjusts to restore the liberty the public once had to buy the product that best suits its needs and tastes.

Government meddling in car design has flopped, and Ford’s misadventures serve as a cautionary tale for lawmakers intent on intruding elsewhere in the economy. When it comes to picking marketplace winners and losers, Uncle Sam is incompetent.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2022/06/14/B4_morgan1_c0-310-1800-1360_s1200x700.jpg?67f1854f4c2448f74de1b3b3660c207af05409e3,N,,2025-12-19 02:59:46.510976

“Our next-generation F-150 Lightning EREV will be every bit as revolutionary.
Even further back, GM offered its Volt under the Chevrolet brand, which also was an EV with a gasoline range extending engine.","Ford Motor Company has announced the next generation of its F-150 Lightning Extended Range Electric Vehicle (EREV) half-ton truck and it’s no longer a pure electric vehicle. The new version of the truck still retains electric final drive and battery power, but adds a gasoline engine as a range extender, with the company claiming the total range of battery-only plus gasoline-fueled power of over 700 miles.

This newer model will continue to use an all-electric final driveline and battery power but there will be the addition of a gasoline on-board generator. This is not dissimilar to how a railroad locomotive works and offers the benefit of the flat torque curve that EVs are known for with the additional range and fueling convenience of a gasoline engine.

No details were shared on the gasoline engine itself and contacts at Ford were not willing to divulge more details beyond what were listed in the press release.

With the current F-150 lightning range can be up to 320 miles when empty, but hanging a trailer off the back of the truck reduces that to about 100 miles. A further challenge for towing with any EV is that charging stations on the road are simply not set up to enable a vehicle with a trailer to pull in and charge up. So you would have to disconnect the trailer about every 100 miles to do any appreciable distance.

Where an EV shines with towing is not only in the instant torque of an electric drive motor, but also regenerative braking when slowing. Today’s F-150 Lightning has up to 580 horsepower and 775 foot-pounds of torque. While many bandy about the 10,000-pound pulling capacity, Ford touts the current truck’s cargo carrying of at least a ton — another area where it would also shine when hooking up to a travel trailer.

“The F-150 Lightning is a groundbreaking product that demonstrated an EV pickup can still be a great F-Series,” Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital and design officer, stated in the release. “Our next-generation F-150 Lightning EREV will be every bit as revolutionary. It delivers everything Lightning customers love — near instantaneous torque and pure electric driving. But with a high-power generator enabling an estimated range of 700-plus miles, it tows like a locomotive. Heavy-duty towing and cross-country travel will be as effortless as the daily commute.”

In a video presentation with Bloomberg (see above) Ford said it anticipates that about half of the new vehicle shipments will ultimately be EVs. In 2022, Ford sold about 15,6187 Lightning models of its F-150 line with the peak reaching 33,510 sales in 2024. As of November, Ford has sold 25,583 units this year. However, the trajectory of sales of pure electric vehicles has dropped with the elimination of tax credits for EVs.

In the same announcement for the new F-150 Extended Range Electric Vehicle (EREV) the company also stated that it would begin using some of its battery building capacity to start developing power backup solutions for homes and businesses, citing the growing need for power solutions from data centers and AI facilities.

Ford is investing approximately $5 billion and creating or securing nearly 4,000 jobs across its Louisville Assembly Plant and BlueOval Battery Park Michigan to deliver a new pickup and produce advanced prismatic LFP batteries.

One of the new products planned under this change is a mid-sized pickup with a targeted starting price of about $30,000 to be assembled at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant and scheduled for sales to begin in 2027.

The statement indicated that Ford would leverage wholly-owned plants in Kentucky and Michigan to provide solutions for energy infrastructure and growing data center demand.

It was also stated that Ford is working on a universal EV platform that will underpin trucks, vans and other vehicles.

The idea to have an EV with a range extender is not new ,with Stellantis’ Ram brand having announced a similar product a while ago. Even further back, GM offered its Volt under the Chevrolet brand, which also was an EV with a gasoline range extending engine.

When used as a range extender, a gasoline engine’s performance can be optimized for this use case and doesn’t have to be as large an engine as would be the case if it were the sole source of power. For example, in the Ram REV, Stellantis is using the 3.6 liter Pentastar V6 as part of the on-board power generation. Again, this is not much different than a railroad locomotive with the exception of the locomotive not generally having any battery system to power the traction motors.

As a side benefit of having a large on-board generator these vehicles can also be used to provide back-up power to homes or at construction sites giving them another benefit.",https://rvbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ford-Lightning-with-Range-Extender-2-scaled-e1766066623812.webp,N,,2025-12-19 12:00:53.437945

Capacity prices in PJM hit fresh record high

PJM’s supply shortfall affects 13-state region, raising power bills

Governors push for extended price limits

Dec 17 (Reuters) – Power bills for about a fifth of Americans are expected to continue to rise after the largest U.S. grid operator, PJM Interconnection, reported fresh record-high capacity prices on Wednesday that reflected electricity demand by data centers overtaking supplies.

The expansion of Big Tech’s data centers has driven up so-called capacity prices in PJM by about 1,000% over a roughly two-year period, intensifying energy affordability problems for those living and working in the 13-state region covered by the grid operator.

Prices reached $333.44 a megawatt-day in the latest PJM capacity auction.

“This auction leaves no doubt that data centers’ demand for electricity continues to far outstrip new supply, and the solution will require concerted action involving PJM, its stakeholders, state and federal partners, and the data center industry itself,” said Stu Bresler, who becomes PJM’s chief operating officer next month.

Rising costs in PJM have hit everyday power bills in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest U.S. states in the grid’s territory, with some areas seeing a more than 20% jump in utility bills starting from last summer.

Capacity prices make up a portion of utility bills, while other spending on power lines and services and the cost of fuel, such as natural gas, also contribute to the overall cost.

PJM, which operates the grid covering the largest amount of energy-intensive data centers in the world, holds auctions to determine the prices that energy companies will be paid to guarantee they run their power plants when called upon.

On-call generators in PJM’s capacity market are meant to guard against disruptions like blackouts during times when power demand spikes, and the high prices are aimed at encouraging developers to build more supply.

More supply, however, is not coming on fast enough. The available supply secured in the latest auction reached 134,479 megawatts. That was about 6,600 megawatts, or enough to power nearly 5 million homes, short of PJM’s reliability requirement, PJM officials said.

Higher consumer costs led a group of PJM-area governors, including Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, to negotiate a price ceiling and floor. That price ceiling took effect during the last auction, in July, and extended through the latest bidding round.

Shapiro and others are now calling for the price limit to be extended to future auctions.

“Reforms must be in place in time to protect Pennsylvania ratepayers before the next (auction),” Shapiro said in a filing this week with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

MORE AUCTIONS

PJM once held its auctions three years out from the time the prices took effect to give power companies time to plan for new developments and to budget ahead of time. With regulatory delays affecting the power grid operator in recent years, capacity auctions have begun to take place less than a year out, which power companies say have slowed the pace of new developments.

PJM is now holding catch-up auctions as a way to get back to its three-year-out program. The prices released on Wednesday will take effect for the year beginning in June 2027.

In the meantime, existing power plant owners in PJM are expected to see windfalls from the recent capacity prices. Independent power producer Talen Energy said on Wednesday it expected to land more than $1 billion in capacity revenues for the 2027-2028 planning year.

Shares of Talen were up 3.7% after the market closed, while other PJM-region power producers Constellation Energy and Vistra were also higher by 2.7% and 1.6%, respectively.

“Our role in this initiative reflects our dedication to supporting innovative energy solutions that benefit both industry and community,” said Randel Badeaux, senior vice president for the Power Sector at WHC. “Peregrine’s leadership on the Mallard project is outstanding. We’re proud to contribute to a project that sets a benchmark for excellence in construction and engineering.”

Gridstor Project

Gridstor said the tolling agreement for the Hidalgo County project was signed with an undisclosed Fortune 500 group. GridStor acquired the Gunnar Reliability Project from developer Balanced Rock Power in February of this year. Hidalgo County also is home to the 200-MW/400-MWh Anemoi battery energy storage project developed and operated by Plus Power, an installation that came online last year.

The Gunnar Reliability Project once complete will be Gridstor’s second operational BESS in Texas. The company earlier this year brought online the Hidden Lakes Reliability Project, a 220-MW/440-MWh BESS in Galveston County.

“At a time of rapidly increasing power demand, battery energy storage helps ensure affordable, reliable power to households and Lower Rio Grande Valley businesses,” said Chris Taylor, CEO of GridStor and a former Google executive. “We are proud to increase our commitment to building battery storage facilities that help Texas sustain its historic economic expansion and deliver cost-effective power.”

GridStor, backed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, manages a pipeline of more than 3 GW of battery storage projects in later-stage development or under construction across the western and central U.S.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gridstor-texas-gunnar-1024x471.png,N,,2025-12-19 06:58:59.126178

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India's growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country's copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India's capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India's battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India's waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

Gaps between policy and implementation

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world's most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India's government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

How battery recycling works

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery's contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Reducing dependence on imported minerals

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it's an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

How many will lose access to affordable health care or health care altogether due to expiration of ACA enhanced premium tax credits?
How many veterans impacted by changes to SNAP, Medicaid, and ACA enhanced premium tax credits are currently, have recently, or are at risk of experiencing homelessness?","[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Ranking Member Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) today led a group of 26 of their colleagues in a letter calling on the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate the impact Republicans’ health care-cutting agenda will have on veterans and their families.

This follows Senate Republicans’ failure last week to join Democrats in extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits, which 267,000 veterans rely on to afford health care. Coupled with Medicare and Medicaid cuts – which go into effect next year – Americans, including millions of veterans and veteran family members, are bracing for higher costs and a looming health care crisis.

“The 2025 budget reconciliation bill, Public Law 119-21, or the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ (BBB), will reduce access to essential health care and supportive services for millions of Americans, including veterans and their families. Compounded with expiring enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans established by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, veterans are facing a life-threatening reduction in access to health care and other essential benefits. These reductions in access to private health insurance, Medicaid, and funding for community health services will result in more veterans relying more heavily on their Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care and benefits,” the Senators wrote.

1.6 million veterans and four million family members of veterans utilize Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and are at risk of losing Medicaid or CHIP coverage because of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” One in ten veterans under the age of 65 relies on Medicaid, and forty percent of these veterans rely on Medicaid as their sole coverage. In addition, recent analysis found 267,000 veterans who rely on ACA enhanced premium tax credits will no longer be able to afford ACA marketplace coverage if these credits are not extended. Veterans who benefit from ACA tax credits are largely not eligible for Medicaid, TRICARE, or Medicare, or who are not eligible to get some or all of their health care through VA.

The Senators emphasized their concerns with these widespread health care cuts amid the Trump Administration’s ongoing efforts to shrink VA: “Because of the recent catastrophic, unnecessary cuts to VA’s workforce and resources since January 20, 2025, we are deeply concerned about the Department’s capability to support this potential spike in utilization. We write to request you review how these widespread cuts to health care access for all Americans will also impact veterans and their families and to what extent VA will be able to support an influx of veterans relying on the Department for health care more than ever before.”

Recent reporting exposed the Trump Administration’s plan to eliminate as many as 35,000 health care jobs at VA this month, including unfilled positions for doctors, nurses, and support staff. In addition, VA already lost more than 30,000 employees between January and September of this year as a result of President Trump and VA Secretary Collins’ hiring freeze, deferred resignations, early retirements, and the significant number of VA staff who have quit due to Trump and Collins’ draconian workforce policies.

Blumenthal and Schumer’s letter was joined by U.S. Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Coons (D-DE), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Patty Murray (D-WA), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Bernard Sanders (I-VT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

The full text of the lawmakers’ letter is available here and below.

Dear Mr. Dodaro:

The 2025 budget reconciliation bill, Public Law 119-21, or the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (BBB), will reduce access to essential health care and supportive services for millions of Americans, including veterans and their families. Compounded with expiring enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans established by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, veterans are facing a life-threatening reduction in access to health care and other essential benefits. These reductions in access to private health insurance, Medicaid, and funding for community health services will result in more veterans relying more heavily on their Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care and benefits. Because of the recent catastrophic, unnecessary cuts to VA’s workforce and resources since January 20, 2025, we are deeply concerned about the Department’s capability to support this potential spike in utilization. We write to request you review how these widespread cuts to health care access for all Americans will also impact veterans, and their families and to what extent VA will be able to support an influx of veterans relying on the Department for health care more than ever before.

Up to 5.6 million veterans and their family members rely on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and are at risk of losing coverage as a result of funding cuts and further restrictions on eligibility enacted in the BBB. Nearly one in ten veterans under 65 rely on Medicaid, with forty percent of those veterans relying on Medicaid as their sole coverage – often due to ineligibility for Medicare or VA health care. Medicaid helps ensure regular access to care for veterans and their families, especially those who have diverse heath care needs or require care with high out-of-pocket costs, both of which can pose a barrier to care. Regardless of VA’s capacity to absorb these veterans that may now need to rely on the Department for more of their care, many of them are ineligible or were using Medicaid as a supplement because the Department couldn’t provide access to the care they required.

The 140,000 women veterans currently utilizing Medicaid will be particularly impacted by the cuts to this program. This includes nearly one in nine women veterans nationwide and more than one in five women veterans with disabilities, nearly one in seven rural women veterans, and 12.4 percent (54,000) of women veterans who are mothers. Nearly four in ten women veterans rely solely on Medicaid for their health care coverage. For those who are ineligible for Medicare or VA health care, the cuts made in the BBB will likely leave them uninsured resulting in high vulnerability to medical debt or being barred from accessing care altogether.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was also severely harmed by the BBB. Currently, 1.2 million veteran households rely on SNAP benefits. The sixty-three percent of veterans on SNAP who are under 65 will be newly subject to so-called work requirements to maintain access to SNAP. Exemptions from these punishing requirements for disabling conditions are not clearly defined in the BBB, leaving uncertainty regarding whether veterans with disabilities limiting their ability to sustain regular employment will have the requirement waived. For example, a veteran with a traumatic brain injury or severe post-traumatic stress disorder – both conditions more common in veterans than non-veterans and which often require more complex accommodations – may not be exempt despite being unable to maintain the focus or manage the stressors required by many employers. Because of these changes, many veteran households will experience reduced access to SNAP and, therefore, because there is no equivalent alternative service available through VA or any other federal program, their main source of food.

Like the harmful and ineffectual work reporting requirements added to SNAP, the BBB also added these so-called work requirements for certain adults, including veterans, to access Medicaid. The BBB mandates Medicaid enrollees aged 19-64 who are covered through the ACA’s Medicaid expansion must engage in employment, education, a work program, or community service to maintain their Medicaid eligibility. This requirement cannot be waived. Though there are exemptions allowed for certain individuals, including disabled veterans – defined as veterans with a disability rated as total under section 1155 of Title 38, United States Code – and caregivers of children thirteen years of age and under or disabled individuals, the gray areas of life and disabilities often do not align with these black and white requirements. Applying for or updating veteran disability ratings or caregiver status is already a significant challenge and can take years to establish, which, under these new bureaucratic requirements, could leave veterans or their loved ones without health care.

Even veterans who will not lose their coverage due to these Medicaid cuts may no longer be able to access health care because of their reliance on ACA premium tax credits. Since the ACA coverage provisions took effect, the number of uninsured, non-elderly veterans has decreased by more than one-third, from 9.6 percent to 5.9 percent. As Congress expanded the premium tax credits starting in 2021, the ACA marketplace enrollment more than doubled by 2025. However, these enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of this year, and without them many veterans will be forced to withdraw from their health care coverage because they can no longer afford it. This may increase their reliance on VA for their care if they’re eligible, but many veterans who are ineligible for VA care and benefits will lose access to health care entirely. Furthermore, VA’s actuarial firm has indicated that for every one percent of increased reliance on the Department for care, VA can expect its costs to increase by $2.6 billion – a cost unaccounted for in the BBB or VA’s budget request for fiscal year 2026, when these changes will start to take effect.

It is critical for Congress, VA, and, most importantly, veteran households to understand how these recent changes will impact their access to essential health care and nutrition services. With a better understanding of these impacts, Congress and the veteran community can better advocate for swift and effective changes to mitigate the truly catastrophic future created by the BBB. To that end, we request you conduct a review of the potential and actual impacts of this bill and the expiration of the enhanced ACA tax credits on veterans and their families.

To expedite access to this data and improve Congress’ ability to act proactively, we request an initial review and estimation of potential harmful impacts based on current utilization, followed by a subsequent review of the actual impacts to veterans as they unfold from 2026-2028. To the extent practicable, please disaggregate your findings by age, gender, household size, employment status, average income, and any other categories you deem appropriate. In particular, we request you address the following questions as they pertain to veterans and their families, to the extent data are available:

How many utilize SNAP or Medicaid and are impacted by the BBB?

How many will lose access to affordable health care or health care altogether due to expiration of ACA enhanced premium tax credits?

How many are subject to work reporting requirements set for Medicaid? How many are eligible for exceptions to those requirements?

How many are subject to work reporting requirements set for SNAP? How many are eligible for exceptions to those requirements?

How many veterans impacted by changes to SNAP, Medicaid, and ACA enhanced premium tax credits are currently, have recently, or are at risk of experiencing homelessness?

We look forward to working with you to conduct oversight on this important issue. If you have any questions about this request, please have your staff contact the office of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, Minority Staff.

Our goal is simple: a permitting process that is efficient, predictable, and fair for investors, communities, and the environment alike.” “We urgently need to get permitting reform done this Congress.
These concerns were not addressed before SPEED was brough to the House Floor.","Washington, D.C. – Today, Representative Scott Peters (CA-50) released the following statement after voting against the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development or SPEED Act to update the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

“The environmental laws of the 1970s were designed to stop projects. The environmental imperative of today is to build. That’s why I support permitting reform and why reforming NEPA is necessary if America is going to remain competitive.

“I was encouraged when Chairman Westerman introduced the SPEED Act. The bill reduces the statute of limitations and ensures that environmental reviews can satisfy federal requirements, saving both time and money. The bill also ensures federal dollars cannot solely trigger federal environmental reviews, streamlining the federal grant process, so that we can get grant money out of the bank and into the ground. These are exactly the types of reforms America needs to build energy infrastructure responsibly and efficiently.

“Earlier this month, I led a letter with 30 Democratic colleagues outlining our support for permitting reform and the specific changes needed to earn additional Democratic support for this bill. In the letter, we emphasized four key areas that must be addressed for broad bipartisan support.

“We emphasized that projects that comply with the law must be protected from political interference, that courts should have a targeted role to ensure decisions are based on accurate analysis, and that local stakeholders should continue to have meaningful input early in the process. We also highlighted the need to avoid provisions that could backfire, delay projects, or reduce the quality of environmental reviews. Our goal is simple: a permitting process that is efficient, predictable, and fair for investors, communities, and the environment alike.”

“We urgently need to get permitting reform done this Congress. I remain committed to continuing to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with the Senate to craft truly bipartisan solutions that can become law and help America build the clean, reliable energy infrastructure we need.”

Background: Rep. Peters has been a longtime champion of permitting reform in Congress and was encouraged to see the SPEED Act brought up before the House Natural Resources Committee in November. After passing out of Committee, Rep. Peters sent a letter signed by 30 of his House Democratic colleagues, to the Chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, Rep. Bruce Westerman, outlining what they’d like to see in the final bill. These concerns were not addressed before SPEED was brough to the House Floor.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid.
Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory.
“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email.
While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom.","Calls are mounting for the largest US grid operator to make electricity more affordable after power costs again surged to a new high.

Households and businesses from New Jersey to Chicago will pay a record of $16.4 billion to secure electricity starting in the year starting June 2027, according to PJM Interconnection LLC, which operates the 13-state grid that serves nearly one-fifth of Americans. That fee will come on top of what consumers pay for the power they actually use, plus other line items on their bills such as charges for maintaining and expanding the power lines.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid. The results released Wednesday show the daily cost of those payouts rose to $333.44 per megawatt from $329.17, which will show up in users’ monthly utility bills. Prices were as low as $29 a megawatt in 2023.

“The amount of pressure on PJM is enormous,” said Daniel Palken, director of infrastructure for energy and permitting at philanthropy Arnold Ventures. “The people’s hackles are up.”

It’s the third consecutive record-breaking auction held by PJM, a process that has emerged as a focus of the national debate on affordability. Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory. Meanwhile, governors across the region have called on PJM to make changes to lower the cost of electricity amid a massive build-out of AI data centers that has fueled record demand and prices.

The biggest beneficiaries of the auction will be independent power generators. Vistra Corp., which rose as much as 2.7% in early trading Thursday, earned $1.29 billion in the auction. Talen Energy Corp. cleared $1.07 billion and saw shares jump 5.6%. Constellation Energy Corp. earned $2.19 billion, with shares up 2.7%.

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email. “I’m angry. it didn’t have to be this way.”

Constellation is responding to high prices by investing billions in adding capacity, spokesman Paul Adams said in an email. The firm has also proposed adding 5,800 megawatts of supplies, including storage, in Maryland and increasing output from its existing nuclear fleet by about 1,000 megawatts.

“The increased demand necessitated by America’s national security imperative of winning the AI race is challenging PJM’s system reserve requirement in this most recent auction,” Adams said.

Vistra and Talen didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog. And in the latest auction, it comprised the majority of new demand, Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy, said on a call with reporters Wednesday.

“The energy market is not capable of meeting unlimited growth in a short amount of time without having massive price increases accompany that,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy in Indiana.

In spite of the skyrocketing costs, the auction for a second year didn’t manage to secure enough supply to meet projected demand. While the grid needs a 20% reserve margin to ensure reliability, the auction only cleared 14.8%.

That means the grid will be 6.6 gigawatts short — the equivalent of six big nuclear reactors — versus about 200 megawatts in the previous auction. PJM will need to procure more supplies through incremental follow-up auctions, Bresler said.

Costs would be even higher if not for a price cap negotiated last year. But PJM hasn’t decided whether to extend that price ceiling to further auctions. With Wednesday’s results hitting the limit, the grid operator will be more likely to move forward with an extension, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

“I think this price cap is in place indefinitely for the time being,” said Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Preserving the cap is controversial, though. While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory. While six governors have asked for an extension, Citigroup analyst Ryan Levine said it’s unlikely.

Pennsylvania consumers will pay about $126 for the 12-month period starting June 2027, according to a statement. In the next auction, the price cap — typically based on the cost of building new gas plants — is set to more than double to $776, but PJM is seeking approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adjust how it prices supplies, which could cut that cap to about $550. Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.

PJM’s board is working on a proposal to integrate data centers to help them connect to the grid faster and potentially mitigate the impact on consumers. A dozen proposals failed to pass last month. FERC could provide guidance as early as Thursday on how to divvy up transmission charges for certain data center projects co-located with power plants.

The tech giants building those facilities – Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. – will closely be watched to see if they step up to help alleviate that pressure.

In the meantime, the impact of the rising auction prices will be felt most in states like New Jersey and Maryland where utilities rely heavily on the capacity market, said Mark Christie, former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman. But even Virginia, which can pay for power plants through utility rates, is seeing its own “generation deficit grow rapidly” as data center growth accelerates there, he said.

Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers. PJM is in the processing of finalizing an $11.6 billion plan to build out the wires, substations and other related infrastructure largely to meet soaring demand from data centers, which would be paid for by consumers.

“PJM needs real reform and they are running out of time to protect consumers from their inaction,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said in a statement after the auction.

Utility company DTE Electric argued it needed quick approval to move forward with the energy-intensive project backed by tech companies OpenAI and Oracle.

Thursday’s decision takes advantage of a policy allowing projects to skip a deeper review, known as a contested case, if they won’t raise rates for other customers.

Michigan Public Service Commission chair Dan Scripps said contracts put the project on the hook for billions of dollars, regardless of if it pans out.

“This provides real protections that don’t exist in many other states to ensure that, if ultimately, this is a bubble, if this is all overblown and that the load doesn’t materialize, that again, even in that worst case scenario, customers are still protected,” Scripps said.

DTE would need to expand its energy capacity by a quarter for the data center. The project would require over a gigawatt of energy, more than an average nuclear reactor produces, according to U.S. Department of Energy estimates.

Opponents say they don’t trust that ratepayers won’t be left holding the bill. York Township resident Sarah Brabbs said no one has fully explained how the project will be held accountable.

“Who determined if that’s there. Is that there? We don’t know. But if it is, we don’t know who determined what it looks like. We don’t know who’s in charge of it. If it’s part of the dealmakers or is it someone else? What does that look like? How are you testing and making sure that they do what they say?” Brabbs said.

During the Public Service Commission meeting, attendees frequently heckled commission members. The vote faced massive backlash as attendees took issue over both environmental concerns and because the plan skipped the reviews that would’ve been part of a contested case.

Local resident Beth Foley said it was worth a deeper look.

“There is potential for egregious harm by fast tracking this with no downside in taking your time and ensuring you got it right,” she said.

The MPSC insists it did conduct a thorough review.

Commissioner Katherine Peretick said her board and their staff got to see several documents not available to the public, including unredacted versions of the contracts up for approval.

She said she was satisfied enough was there to keep Michiganders safe. Peretick argued because the companies and DTE would responsible for the infrastructure upgrades, the deal would benefit everyday ratepayers.

“The power supply agreement and energy storage agreement are well-negotiated contracts.

Mendonça Filho is among the filmmakers who have taken on the task of confronting national memory.","BENGALURU, India (AP) — Across India, battery recycling faces a mixture of challenges and opportunity as it plays an important role in the country's shift to clean power.

A fledgling system has taken off in the past decade for recovering materials from the batteries used in electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer electronics. The valuable minerals these companies recover — such as lithium, cobalt and nickel — are then reused in India’s growing fleet of electric vehicles and solar power installations. Recycling and repurposing batteries is a key to reducing dependence on imports for hard-to-obtain metals.

“More than 40% of the country's copper and aluminum needs are met by recycling scrap and we want to aspire for the same when it comes to lithium, cobalt and nickel,” said Rajat Verma, founder and CEO of Lohum Cleantech, a 7-year-old battery manufacturing and recycling company based in Noida near India's capital New Delhi.

A formalized system can potentially create 100,000 green jobs and meet nearly 40% of the country’s demand for key minerals, according to a November study by the renewable energy think tank RMI. The report found that an industry around recycling and reusing batteries could be worth $9 billion as India's battery demand skyrockets, mostly due to EVs.

“What’s exciting about these materials is it’s not like plastics. You can recycle them for perpetuity and they can still have material strength and the quality you need once you refine them,” said Marie McNamara, a manager with RMI’s India program who was one of the authors of the report.

But the system faces challenges. India currently has 60,000 tons of battery recycling capacity, but not all of it is used because supply chains are still being developed to supply the recovered materials to factories. One reason for this is that most of India's waste recycling is done by informal workers — estimated to be as many as four million, who deal with a variety of scrap materials beyond batteries and work without any formal contracts.

India is among the highest emitters of planet-heating gases as the world’s most populous nation provides power for billions of people. At the same time, its clean energy sector has grown rapidly, led by adoption of solar power and electric vehicles.

India's government passed battery waste management rules in 2022 that mandate environmentally safe disposal and management of battery waste. But given the largely informal nature of scrap recycling in India, experts and recycling companies said the rule has been poorly implemented so far. Recycling in an environmentally friendly way is another challenge.

The rules mandate producers meet specific collection and recycling targets for various battery types. The rules include heavy fines for violators. However, there are no specific outlets for discarded batteries and each company has to set up their own systems for recycling. Experts said a lack of a well-structured recycling industry makes it difficult for companies to implement the rule.

Jaideep Saraswat, an energy expert with New Delhi-based Vasudha Foundation, said India has moved “surprisingly fast from a policy perspective,” but the right battery recycling supply chain is still missing.

A typical electric car battery is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, weighs up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds) and is usually designed to last for at least 160,000 kilometers (99,400 miles) which is usually reached after 8 to 12 years of use. Up to 90% of an EV battery's contents can be extracted after use if recycled properly.

Recycling processes vary, but two common means are “shredding” battery modules into fine powder using machines or smelting them in industrial furnaces. The products of these processes are often then processed using acids or other chemicals to recover specific metals.

Alternatively, discarded batteries can be repurposed to store excess solar and wind energy for homes and small shops. Repurposing involves testing the battery for defects and cleaning its components before it is sold for reuse.

Toxic contaminants are at times dumped illegally by recyclers, which can cause environmental pollution, said Nishchay Chadha, CEO of U.S.-based ACE Green recycling, which has operations in India.

If not done properly, recycling lithium batteries can emit carbon monoxide and other hazardous gases. The recycling process also usually produces wastewater containing heavy metals that can contaminate soil and water if improperly disposed.

“We’ve not expanded much in India because we don’t see much appreciation for clean operations, whether it’s lead or lithium,” he said.

RMI’s McNamara urged India to set up training programs to help scrap workers transition to more formal jobs. She said the government at the federal and state level should also provide support to the businesses who can hire these workers.

“Formalization will really help drive safety and accountability, especially considering that batteries are both defined by their toxicity as well as their potential,” she said.

Globally, critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt are essential for products ranging from smartphones to electric cars. However, China controls much of the critical mineral supply chain through mining, refining and processing, according to the International Energy Agency.

India doesn’t yet have any operational mines for lithium and some other key minerals, and like most of the world is dependent on its Asian neighbor. Energy experts said that effectively recovering minerals from used products can meet an important need.

However, India should take baby steps first, said Chadha of ACE Green Recycling. Chadha said China takes recycling seriously because it's an important part of the supply chain, even though it’s often unprofitable by itself.

“They also actually lose money on recycling, but they look at it as part of the whole puzzle where recycling is a critical part and they’re looking at making money across the whole value chain,” he said.

Others in the battery sector are optimistic.

“If the momentum that is there in India today continues, in my opinion, we can probably create five multibillion dollar giants in this industry,” said Verma of Lohum Cleantech.

SAO PAULO (AP) — “The Secret Agent,” a Brazilian feature shortlisted for the Oscars, is all about ordinary people. It follows an unassuming scientist and widowed father who becomes a target of Brazil’s military dictatorship in the 1970s — not because he is an activist or revolutionary, but because he stands up to a business owner with ties to the regime.

“He’s in danger simply for being who he is, for holding the values he holds,” star Wagner Moura told The Associated Press in a recent interview. “That’s how authoritarianism works everywhere.”

Directed by Kleber Mendonça Filho, “The Secret Agent” has been hailed by critics as one of the year’s best films and arrives amid a renewed international interest in Brazilian cinema. Expanding in U.S. theaters Friday, the film is backed by major wins at the Cannes Film Festival for both Mendonça Filho (best director) and Moura (best actor).

Earlier this month, the 2 1/2-hour thriller earned Golden Globe nominations for best drama, best non-English film and best actor in a drama. And it is on the shortlist for best international feature film at the 2026 Academy Awards.

“The Secret Agent” arrives at a strong moment for Brazilian cinema following the success of “I’m Still Here,” which won this year’s Oscar for best international feature and a Golden Globe for lead actor Fernanda Torres.

In Brazil, expectations for “The Secret Agent” are high. Moura said the widespread enthusiasm around the film — and the public's engagement with Brazilian artists — has made him “incredibly happy.”

“No country develops without culture, without identity,” he said. “You’re watching a Brazilian film, seeing a part of Brazil and its history. That matters.”

Set in 1977, at the height of Brazil’s dictatorship, “The Secret Agent” opens with a black-and-white montage of the era’s national symbols, from movie classics to hit soap operas.

Mendonça Filho anchors the story in a precise time and place: Carnival in Recife, the filmmaker's hometown in northeastern Brazil. As the center of his cinematic universe, the city is the set for confronting a country that still struggles to reckon with its past.

“We’ve all consumed incredible things from so many places — from Akira Kurosawa in Japan to Elvis Presley in the American South,” Mendonça Filho said. “I am Brazilian, and my film is Brazilian. If it’s good, it will be universal.”

Living undercover and under the alias Marcelo, Armando spends his days scouring archives for clues about his mother’s past and planning to flee the country with his young son. As his quiet quest unfolds, the streets outside explode with Carnival revelry — a festival so embedded in Brazilian life that even the police chief appears rumpled from the celebrations, confetti still clinging to his hair.

Mendonça Filho blends political suspense with urban legends from the period, touching on themes that extend beyond the dictatorship itself, including corruption, state violence and institutional complicity.

One pivotal sequence unfolds inside a movie theater, a nod to the director’s lifelong cinephilia. As fictional audiences spill out of screenings of “Jaws” and “The Omen,” shaken by fictional threats, the country itself is living under real terror.

Over the past decade, Brazilian cinema has increasingly revisited the military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964 to 1985. Alongside “The Secret Agent” and “I’m Still Here,” filmmakers have returned to the period in works such as “Marighella,” directed by Moura, about the legendary guerrilla leader who took up arms against the regime.

Many of these films were made or released in the past decade, amid the rise of Brazil’s far right. Its most prominent figure was former President Jair Bolsonaro, a retired army captain who praised officers accused of torture and minimized state crimes committed during the dictatorship.

Mendonça Filho is among the filmmakers who have taken on the task of confronting national memory.

“The military is a trauma that was never truly examined,” he said. “You can’t just say, ‘Move on, forget it.’ A crust forms over it. The same thing happens to an entire nation.”

As “The Secret Agent” arrived in Brazilian theaters on Nov. 6, history was unfolding in real time.

That same month, Bolsonaro was arrested and began serving a 27-year prison sentence for attempting to overturn the 2022 election after losing to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. For the first time, high-ranking military officers were also imprisoned for their role in the attempted coup.

“Today, I’m much more optimistic about Brazil as a democracy,” Mendonça Filho said. “For the first time, we’re holding military officers accountable — and sending to prison a president who did nothing but harm the country.”

Few stories in “The Secret Agent” are as striking as that of Tânia Maria, 78, who plays Dona Sebastiana.

A Brazilian artisan, Maria lived an ordinary life until age 72, when she was cast as an extra in Mendonça Filho’s 2019 film “Bacurau.” Since then, she has appeared in six films that have yet to be released.

The director said he never forgot her presence — “a birdlike bearing, a voice shaped by 60 years of cigarettes and a razor-sharp sense of humor.” He later wrote the role of Dona Sebastiana specifically for her.

The character, who shelters political fugitives including Armando, stands out. When she walks toward the camera in a flowered dress, cigarette in hand, the film briefly belongs to her.

“Her authenticity carries something of many women I’ve known,” Mendonça Filho said. “There’s something literary about her.”

Moura said he wasn't able to hide his awe at the actor’s authenticity. He pointed to their first scene together, in which Dona Sebastiana shows Armando the apartment he is moving into.

If viewers watch closely, he said, they will see that he is genuinely “like a fool orbiting around her.”

Maria lives in a rural village of about 22,000 people in northeastern Rio Grande do Norte. There is no movie theater there. She says the only films she has ever seen are the ones she acted in.

For Maria, the authenticity of her performance begins with Mendonça Filho’s script.

“Filming is wonderful, and Kleber Mendonça’s films feel like they’re copying our lives,” she said, laughing. “Dona Sebastiana’s life is my life. I’ve always liked taking people in, and I’ve always liked complaining.”

Since the film’s release in Brazil, the seamstress-turned-actor has become a national sensation, appearing on morning shows and gaining thousands of followers.

She is also hoping for Oscar recognition — for the film and, perhaps, for herself.

“I want to go to the Oscars,” she said. “And I want to make my own dress. It will be red, very sparkly.”

Other large-scale solar projects had costs that doubled that figure.
Regional collaboration The selection of new solar projects was conducted through a multi-state process led by DEEP.
Connecticut also selected two solar projects in Vermont; Viridis Solar, with 50 megawatts, and Fair Haven Solar, with 20 megawatts.","​​The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced the selection of three solar projects on Thursday that will expand grid capacity, racing to lock in federal clean energy tax credits before they expire.

The agency said the projects would secure affordable, reliable and clean energy sources — but declined to disclose the bid prices.

“The price is kept confidential while negotiations are ongoing,” a department spokesperson responded to queries from CT Examiner.

The selected projects will total approximately 67 megawatts of capacity, enough to supply 12,000 homes in the state, according to DEEP. The agency expects them to be online before the end of 2030.

In its press release, DEEP explained the selection was launched on September 10 and conducted expeditiously to choose advanced-stage projects that could capitalize on federal incentives while they’re still available.

“We are pleased to announce the selection of new grid-scale solar projects that can take advantage of federal tax credits before they expire to help provide affordable, reliable clean energy to Connecticut residents and businesses,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “By working together with New England and state partners, and working quickly to take advantage of competitively priced projects, we are able to secure greater affordability and reliability benefits for Connecticut at a fraction of the cost.”

The Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the Biden Administration, modified tax credits for carbon-neutral technologies, with changes that took effect in January this year. These changes introduced two types of benefits, of which developers could choose only one—an immediate 30% tax credit on the investment value or a tax credit of up to 2.8 cents per kilowatt-hour produced over 10 years from the start of production.

The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed this year, determined that credits for solar and wind projects would be eliminated for projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 and projects that are not in service before the end of 2027. However, projects that begin or are completed before those two deadlines would not be affected.

The cost of renewable energy has been a political football in recent years. Critics blame renewable generation in part for the state’s high cost of electricity, among the most expensive in the country, while renewable energy advocates point to falling costs in recent years, and the need to decarbonize the state’s sources of energy.

Over the past 12 months, the wholesale price of electricity in Connecticut was just above 7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Other large-scale solar projects had costs that doubled that figure.

Revolution Wind, the first offshore wind project expected to start supplying power to Connecticut homes next year, has an agreed 10 cents per kilowatt-hour price in its purchase agreement.

State Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, introduced a proposal in the past legislative session that would have prohibited power purchase agreements at 150% above the wholesale price.

Regional collaboration

The selection of new solar projects was conducted through a multi-state process led by DEEP. Massachusetts and Maine participated, along with Vermont’s largest electric utility. Connecticut chose the largest capacity, accounting for 39% of the 173 megawatts selected collectively by the four states.

“Regional collaboration is critical to expanding and diversifying our energy supply, especially as we work to bring down the cost of electricity for Connecticut ratepayers,” Gov. Ned Lamont said, according to a press release issued by DEEP. “These resources can start providing power in the near future, sooner than any other new generation resources, and will help ensure we have a more reliable and affordable grid.”

Connecticut’s share of the project will be funded through contracts with utilities, subject to review by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority.

Husky Solar, a 50-megawatt project, is the project that would be located in Connecticut, in the town of Plainfield. The state selected 25% of this project’s capacity, while the remainder was divided between Massachusetts and Maine.

Connecticut also selected two solar projects in Vermont; Viridis Solar, with 50 megawatts, and Fair Haven Solar, with 20 megawatts. Connecticut secured about 80% of each project’s capacity.

The state has significantly expanded its solar capacity over the past decade to nearly 1.7 gigawatts by 2024, enough to power about 245,000 homes, according to data from the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Last year, when Connecticut decided to pass on selecting offshore wind energy in the tri-state auction held with Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the state announced the same day that it had opted for solar and batteries to increase capacity.",https://ctexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AdobeStock_290547138-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-18 23:59:07.465383

The Dec. 10 decision restores the Rooted in Comunidad, Cultivating Equity (RICCE) initiative — a Transformative Climate Communities (TCC) grant — to its originally proposed $29.5 million funding level, ensuring that all community-identified improvement projects can proceed as planned. The additional funding was made possible by the passage of Proposition 4 in 2024, which supports expanded investment in climate-related projects. The initiative is led by San Diego Foundation and the Environmental Health Coalition, working alongside 10 dedicated community partner organizations.

Developed through extensive community engagement in Barrio Logan, Logan Heights, Sherman Heights, Shelltown, Stockton, Grant Hill, Mount Hope and Southcrest, the project reflects priorities identified directly by residents, including:

Improved air quality near industrial corridors

Safer, more accessible streets and transit connections

Urban greening and expanded open space

Workforce development tied to climate-related careers

Increased affordable housing and anti-gentrification efforts

“This funding restoration demonstrates California’s commitment to supporting community-driven climate solutions, even during times of uncertainty,” said Mark Stuart, President and CEO of San Diego Foundation. “San Diego Foundation remains dedicated to being a steady, reliable partner for the residents of the historic barrios, ensuring that investments align with community priorities and that a healthier, more sustainable future can move forward as planned.”

The supplemental award restores California’s original level of support for the project following funding volatility that affected climate initiatives statewide:

The Rooted in Comunidad, Cultivating Equity initiative was initially awarded $22 million in 2023, with project partners encouraged to seek additional resources to close the remaining gap.

While federal funding for the initiative awarded through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2024 was later rescinded in 2025 as part of a national policy shift, the state of California’s action ensures stability for the community-driven work and allows implementation to proceed as planned.

“This funding is an initial step in restoring hope and trust in a community that wasn’t just devastated by the EPA funding cuts this year, but that has been underinvested in for generations,” said Jose Franco Garcia, Executive Director of Environmental Health Coalition. “This is a huge win for San Diego’s historic barrios, especially the over 400 community members who participated in the grant application process, helping identify which improvement projects will preserve, protect, and strengthen their community.”

California’s TCC program invests in neighborhood-level climate solutions in communities facing longstanding environmental and economic challenges. Projects are required to be developed with meaningful community input and to deliver measurable benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health and economic opportunity. The RICCE initiative represents one of four projects across the state selected for TCC funding in 2023.

With full state funding now secured, project partners are moving forward with implementation while continuing to explore additional resources to address the loss of federal support.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said.
A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.
The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO.
“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill’s chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

“Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. “Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment …. has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, “we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill’s co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure “gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win” on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,” Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy … expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.”

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,” said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,” he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.

Vol 390, Issue 6779

pp. 1210-1221

China’s turn to green energy dwarfs any other country’s, as a parade of astonishing numbers attests. In 2024 alone it installed new solar and wind generation equivalent to roughly 100 nuclear power plants, and the pace quickened early this year. Dozens of new, ultrahigh-voltage power lines are marching thousands of kilometers from western deserts where much of the solar energy is generated to the eastern cities where it is used. Hungrily awaiting the bounty of clean energy are millions of electric cars and a sprawling network of high-speed electric trains that can zip between cities 1000 kilometers apart in a morning.

China’s landscape reflects this metamorphosis. The vistas of smog, smokestacks, and coal heaps still exist, but glinting silicon panels now cover hills, deserts, and lakes. One solar farm on the Tibetan Plateau spans more than 400 square kilometers, an area more than twice the size of Washington, D.C. Wind turbines grow ever bigger; one meant for use offshore has blades 150 meters long. Arrays of house-size lithium batteries stockpile excess energy, and more is stored in mountaintop reservoirs, pumped full of water when energy is abundant and tapped as needed by allowing the water to cascade through turbines to a lower lake. The factories that produce the solar panels, turbines, batteries, and cars have added new industrial sprawl—but often without the smokestacks because they are electrified.

These days, the containers in China’s busy ports are packed with new wares: electric cars, solar cells, wind turbine blades. In building up its own green energy system, China has also created an export industry worth nearly $180 billion in 2024, putting low-cost renewable energy within reach for much of the rest of the world (see story, p. 1208). The revolution these images document is now going global. —Tim Appenzeller

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the revisions will help to manage electricity costs as the race to develop artificial intelligence drives an unprecedented increase in electricity use across the country.

In Thursday’s meeting, the commission unanimously approved an order directing PJM Interconnection to revise its tariff — a compilation of rate schedules and terms of a particular company or utility — to detail the terms and conditions for customers to follow when using generating facilities to serve co-located load. The order directs PJM to offer customers who want to co-locate four options to manage how data centers and other large loads interact with the grid.

Montgomery County-headquartered PJM manages the wholesale electricity market and grid for about 65 million customers in Pennsylvania and 12 other states plus Washington, D.C.

“PJM has been actively engaged with stakeholders throughout 2025 to address the rapid growth of data centers and the related increase in demand for electricity,” spokesman Jeff Shields said in a statement.

Shields added the PJM board intends to move forward with a proposal to FERC derived from its own process in which stakeholders have provided their input on possible solutions.

“We share FERC’s focus on clear and transparent rules as data centers expand their role as an engine of the U.S. economy. PJM is reviewing the order and will assess how it impacts efforts already underway.”

FERC Chairperson Laura Swett said Thursday the decision would advance the nation in the AI and manufacturing revolution while safeguarding the prices consumers pay for electricity.

“While uncertainty has abounded across our country on how we will facilitate data centers, this morning, my colleagues and I are taking a critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem,” Swett said.

In February, FERC initiated a proceeding to review issues associated with the co-location of AI data centers, which can use as much electricity as a small city, and generators to ensure the clarity of the rates, terms and conditions of service that apply to co-location arrangements.

“Co-location arrangements are a fairly new phenomenon that entail huge ramifications for grid reliability and consumer costs,” former Chairperson Mark Christie said in February. “Given these ramifications, the commission truly needs to ‘get it right’ when it comes to evaluating co-location issues.”

Advanced Energy United, an association for the renewable energy industry, said the order has potential to bring welcome regulatory clarity for large load customers and safeguards to minimize the impact of co-location on the electric rates and system reliability of all other customers.

Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United, said demand is outpacing the ability of the market alone to reliably and affordably serve data centers and existing customers.

“Advanced energy solutions like battery storage, solar, wind, demand response, and distributed energy resources are well-suited to reliability and affordably serve new large loads in PJM and across the country,” Marquis said. “The advanced energy industry will welcome new rules within PJM that empower large load customers to bring their own new clean energy to the system, benefiting all energy users.”

Co-location, the group noted, is attractive to AI hyperscalers because it can result in faster connections for data centers, which companies like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are competing to bring online first.

Microsoft has a $1.6 billion deal with Constellation Energy to restart the remaining nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Dauphin County to power its data centers elsewhere in the PJM service area. Amazon announced an agreement to buy a data center development adjacent to Talen Energy’s Susquehanna Steam Electric nuclear power station in Luzerne County.

Co-location also raises questions about who will pay for additional transmission infrastructure and how large loads or other customers will be affected by fluctuations in electricity supply across the grid.

Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents competitive power generators, said the order provides options, recognizing that there are a variety of approaches to co-locating large electricity users and generating stations.

“Clearly, this is the first step in a process that will require quick action and durable consensus from many stakeholders and highlights the urgency in getting solutions onto the system and for that we applaud FERC’s approach,” Snitchler said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/img_6060-1024x7681766105653.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=1mFLeP7y,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:46.174997

There are various ways to index the downturn of the U.S. nuclear industry, but the starkest is probably by permits.
From 1954 to 1978, regulators issued a hundred and thirty-three construction permits for civilian nuclear reactors.
Although this now looks like a mixed bargain, at the time, the U.S. nuclear industry was only too happy to take it.
Kairos represents a new era for the U.S. nuclear industry.","This April, in a speech given at the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the physicist Xu Hongjie announced a breakthrough. For over a decade, his team had been working on an experimental nuclear reactor that runs on a lava-hot solution of fissile material and molten salt, rather than on solid fuel. The reactor, which went online two years ago, was a feat in itself. It is still the only one of its kind in operation in the world, and has the potential to be both safer and more efficient than the water-cooled nuclear plants that dominate the industry. Now, Xu explained, his team had been able to refuel the reactor without shutting it down, demonstrating a level of mastery over their new system.

As dazzling as that was, the timing of Xu’s speech also freighted the topic with geopolitical import. Only a few months earlier, DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial-intelligence company, had set alarms ringing through the U.S. tech world when it became clear that the relatively small Chinese startup, operating under U.S. export controls, had created a large language model that rivalled anything devised by the behemoths of Silicon Valley. Xu cast his team’s molten-salt reactor in the same light: yet another sign that the technology gap between China and the U.S. had closed.

Xu explained that his team had based their design on an experimental reactor that had been built in Tennessee in the nineteen-sixties. Known as the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment, or the M.S.R.E., that project hit a dead end in the early seventies, when it lost federal funding. Xu’s team had learned everything they could about the M.S.R.E. so that, decades later, they could bring the project back to life. Xu compared their labors to the story of the tortoise and the hare: whereas the United States had “gotten lazy and made a mistake,” China had seized the “chance to overtake” it.

In reality, China’s molten-salt reactor was less the product of a race than a collaboration. Less than ten years earlier, Xu’s team had been working with an array of American nuclear scientists. M.I.T. had irradiated graphite samples for the Chinese scientists. Nuclear engineers from Berkeley flew to Shanghai to review the original design. And by 2015, at what was perhaps the peak of U.S.-China amity in the sciences, Xu’s home institution, the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, or SINAP, had signed a coöperative research-and-development agreement with Tennessee’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the site of the world’s first molten-salt reactor.

These agreements could be seen as products of Reagan-era neoliberalism. They allow national labs to hire out their facilities and staff to outside entities that, in exchange for funding, can secure a proprietary claim to any technologies U.S. national labs discover while working on the designated project. For the most part, this has facilitated technology transfer from public institutions to the private sector. But the agreement between O.R.N.L. and SINAP created an unprecedented situation: a Chinese state-owned lab was paying an American lab millions of dollars to develop materials and plumbing for molten-salt reactors.

From the start, the American side operated under the belief that the Chinese would be the first to build a molten-salt reactor. China was spending the money to do it, after all. There was some funding for molten-salt research in America, but much less than was needed, and this was why the Oak Ridge researchers were willing to accept support from the Chinese. Through the partnership, the American researchers were hoping to advance work on a less complex reactor, in which molten salt would be used as a coolant rather than a fuel line. “The budget is what the budget is,” David Holcomb, Oak Ridge’s principal investigator for the agreement, explained during a conference appearance at the time.

Ten years later, the armature of assumptions and policies that enabled such a partnership has been blown apart. After Donald Trump won the 2016 Presidential election, the Department of Energy severed ties with SINAP and threatened to revoke licenses from American companies that exported nuclear technology to China. During Trump’s second term, the Administration’s hostility toward China has only increased. “If you write about the coöperative research agreement, the new Administration will fire everyone for being evil collaborators,” a senior figure at a U.S. nuclear company told me. He was only half joking. When I requested information about molten-salt research at Oak Ridge, the media-relations manager there told me “we won’t be able to help you this time,” and later minimized the extent of the facility’s coöperation with SINAP. After a brief back-and-forth with Idaho National Laboratory and Los Alamos about interview requests for David Holcomb, who has since moved to the private sector, and for Thomas Mason, who had been the head of Oak Ridge during its partnership with SINAP, both laboratories stopped responding to my messages. This reticence stands in contrast to the atmosphere a few years ago, when Holcomb gave multiple interviews to the press, and Oak Ridge allowed tours of the facility that had originally housed its molten-salt reactor.

My two e-mails to Xu Hongjie similarly went unanswered. Then, in November, Xu passed away, reportedly dying while at work at his desk.

The days of “common interest” and “open science,” invoked by Holcomb in 2015, have given way to new mantras of “geostrategic influence” and “national security.” These talking points, which have been embraced by Republicans and Democrats alike, call on nationalism to reboot an industry withered by decades of retrenchment. It remains to be seen if this is enough to make the U.S. nuclear industry competitive in international markets, or even profitable domestically.

To make sense of what is happening in nuclear energy today, it helps to know about what was once called “the first nuclear era”—a thirty-seven-year stretch between 1942, when Enrico Fermi oversaw the first controlled fission chain reaction, and 1979, when the second reactor at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, in southeastern Pennsylvania, partially melted down. At the height of this period, around 1960, the United States accounted for almost seventy per cent of global spending on R. & D. Nuclear energy, which sat at the nexus of defense and civil engineering, was a double beneficiary. From these investments came a series of ever more terrifying weapons alongside a fleet of experimental and commercial reactors that made the U.S. the world’s largest producer of nuclear energy. America still holds this title, but China is poised to assume the mantle, probably sometime around 2030.

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment epitomized the possibilities of this period. The concept originated in the late nineteen-forties, with a request from the Air Force to develop a nuclear-powered airplane. Alvin Weinberg, who later became the director of research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, didn’t think that such an aircraft would fly, but he was willing to try to build one. He had helped develop the reactors that produced plutonium for the Manhattan Project and moved to East Tennessee, after the war. There, he presided over the development of O.R.N.L., which grew from a plutonium-production facility near the Clinch River. For Weinberg, the purpose of a national lab was to try “things too difficult or too risky for private industry to undertake.” An airplane that burned uranium was precisely that.

Weinberg wrote that the reactor would need to reach temperatures around fifteen hundred degrees Fahrenheit in order to power a jet engine. His team surmised that such heat would mangle any fuel rods small enough to install into an aircraft, so they decided to use fluoride salts. These melted into a liquid at around four hundred degrees Celsius and stayed stable above sixteen hundred degrees. With uranium fluoride mixed in, the molten salt itself could function as fuel.

The system went critical in November, 1954. In its brief life, it showed some remarkable properties, but the test also revealed some of the challenges of working with molten salt. Leaks were a constant problem, and the radiotoxicity of most of the apparatus made repairs next to impossible. As a stopgap, Weinberg’s team had to repeatedly off-gas the reactor compartment, bathing a nearby forest in radioactive xenon and iodine. At the hundred-hour mark, the project was shut down.

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment gave him another shot. By then, the Atomic Energy Commission was ready to make major investments in order to develop breeder reactors, or reactors that produce more fissile material than they burn. Breeder reactors promised energy on a scale far beyond what could be provided by the global supply of coal and oil, fuels that were projected to become scarce within a century and which were already suspected of warming the Earth. Planning began in 1960, and five years later Weinberg’s team loaded sixty-nine kilograms of enriched uranium into the salt. This time, the experiment was a success. The M.S.R.E. logged over thirteen thousand operational hours, during which the researchers ran countless tests. “​​They did, like, every calculation you could have done at the time to understand how you would build and run and fuel this reactor,” Katy Huff, the Assistant Secretary of Nuclear Energy under President Joe Biden, said. The most important finding was a simple one: the M.S.R.E. proved that a molten-salt reactor was viable.

Weinberg had hoped to move from the M.S.R.E. to a molten-salt breeder reactor. But in 1973 President Richard Nixon pulled federal funding for molten-salt research in order to go all-in on a competing breeder reactor that was cooled with sodium. In 1983, the sodium breeder, in turn, lost its funding. Plagued by budget overages, the project also fell victim to a conservative revolt, spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation. By then, the public had also soured on nuclear-energy projects, owing to the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island, in 1979.

There are various ways to index the downturn of the U.S. nuclear industry, but the starkest is probably by permits. From 1954 to 1978, regulators issued a hundred and thirty-three construction permits for civilian nuclear reactors. Between 1979 and 2012, they issued none. “There’s been almost no real work on nuclear power since the seventies,” Nathan Myhrvold, who sits on the board of TerraPower, a nuclear-technology company that he co-founded with Bill Gates, told me. “The Department of Energy still had some research programs going, and I don’t want to slight anyone who was in one of those things. But they stopped building plants. When you stop building plants, it makes it very hard for companies to justify the enormous number of engineers it takes.”

“The thing that struck me the first time we went to China, in particular, is they assigned an awful lot of people to the problem,” Charles Forsberg, a research scientist at M.I.T., told me. “And if you assign several hundred engineers to the problem you will learn very, very rapidly.” Forsberg spent his early career as a researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory before moving to M.I.T., where he is overseeing the construction of a molten-salt loop that will run along the side of the campus’s research reactor. He is also one of three engineers who, in 2002, hashed out the concept for a fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor, or F.H.R. That involved taking Weinberg’s molten-salt reactor and swapping the liquid-fuel loop for a more conventional core design, while still using molten salt as a coolant. This change simplified the most vexing problems, of corrosion and containment, while preserving the high process heat that molten salt makes possible. The F.H.R. has played a significant role in rekindling interest in molten salt for fission reactors in the United States—which is the reason that Forsberg initially travelled to China to meet with the SINAP team.

Forsberg’s travel, and the relationship that he developed with Xu Hongjie and other researchers at SINAP, took place at the outset of a relatively recent period of collaboration between the U.S. and China. The partnership was formed under the framework of a 2011 “memorandum of understanding” between the Department of Energy and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which provided for coöperation on nuclear technologies. That agreement was based on a previous agreement, from 2006, which had cleared the way for U.S. nuclear firms to sell reactors to China. Both stemmed from the desire of each country to leverage the other to revamp its own nuclear industry.

China had only a handful of reactors in the early two-thousands, but in 2007 its planners had vowed to massively increase nuclear-energy production by 2020. That meant building something like forty new reactors in about fifteen years—a pace and scale only matched by the U.S. nuclear industry in the twentieth century. To meet that goal, China intended to buy the first fleet of new reactors from foreign companies, under contracts that required significant technology transfer. Although this now looks like a mixed bargain, at the time, the U.S. nuclear industry was only too happy to take it. The industry had just weathered a quarter century of effectively zero domestic demand for new reactors, and had hundreds of experts unable to put their skills to use. These were “a bunch of old Navy nuke guys, or guys that studied nuclear engineering forty years ago, who knew a ton about aging management and cracking piping and corroding pumps and things like that,” David Fishman, then a partner at a boutique China-based nuclear consultancy, told me. “They were just so pleased to come over and find a young, eager market and industry that was planning to build dozens of reactors.”

U.S.-China coöperation on molten-salt research proceeded under conditions not so different from the commercial melee. Forsberg and his collaborators—Per Peterson, a nuclear engineering professor at Berkeley, and Paul Pickard, formerly of Sandia National Laboratories—had pursued their design through academia for years, using oil or water to simulate molten salt, which is expensive and difficult to acquire in the United States. Then, in 2011, they were awarded a major multi-university grant from the Department of Energy which ultimately allowed them to start running tests with the real thing. That became a useful point of connection for Xu and his team, who had recently received a major grant from the Chinese government. The SINAP group was created to build a liquid-fuel reactor, with hopes of eventually fulfilling Weinberg’s vision of making a thorium breeder. To create some common ground with the Americans, they also committed to building a salt-cooled reactor like the F.H.R.—the project that the D.O.E. was most interested in at the time.

You can see the early dynamic of U.S.-China coöperation play out in a video of SINAP’s first presentation at Berkeley, delivered in August, 2012. As the institute’s representative, SINAP sent Kun Chen, who had done his Ph.D. at Indiana University and was still in his thirties. The audience skewed much older: about two-thirds of them looked to be in their fifties or sixties. The attendees tried to suss out the practicality of SINAP’s ambitious plan. One man asked about the budget, which was about three hundred and fifty million dollars, spread over five years. Another man asked where SINAP planned to get molten salt, since “to my understanding, there are no facilities in the world that can produce” it. Chen replied that China had several facilities that could.

It’s hard to tell from the video what the Chinese side got out of these exchanges, but when I spoke with Chen he stressed how helpful it was to have interlocutors in the U.S. “From the start, we didn’t believe we could get this far,” he said. Molten salt was no less niche in China than it was anywhere else. Chen estimated that, back in 2011, there were only thirty or forty people in the whole world working seriously on using the substance for fission reactors. Connecting with some of those individuals in the U.S. made the project seem possible.

For the Americans, there was the curiosity of seeing how far the Chinese could go with resources that simply didn’t exist here. Coöperating with SINAP was also a way to prod the U.S. federal government. The logic was “If the Chinese are doing it, it must be relevant,” Forsberg said.

In that sense, the coöperative research-and-development agreement that Oak Ridge signed with SINAP cut out the middleman. To fund the molten-salt loop, SINAP paid Oak Ridge around four million dollars, according to Chen. With such a loop, researchers could test materials and all the plumbing components needed to circulate molten salt. The project also gave a focal point to people working on molten salt in the U.S. Speaking to a reporter from the MIT Technology Review, David Holcomb explained his motivations. “One of the important things to realize is that a number of key people in molten-salt reactors are retiring very fast or passing away,” he said. “China is providing the funding that allows us to transfer that knowledge, to gain practical experience at building and operating these reactors.”

That article ran in August, 2016. By 2018, the U.S. had withdrawn from almost all coöperation with China. “I wouldn’t say it’s a total surprise,” Chen told me. He and the SINAP team figured that the relationship would probably deteriorate under Trump. “But it was just happening very suddenly. It’s similar to what we have learned in the tariff issue.”

I asked Chen if he ran into any challenges once his team was going it alone. “The challenges are, I think, mostly, first of all, if you have the money,” he said. But the SINAP team certainly had that. The Chinese Academy of Sciences had been extending the project’s grant every year. By 2018, China promised three billion dollars for molten-salt reactors over the next two decades, while Chinese planners have called for a $1.3 trillion investment in nuclear energy as a whole by 2050.

During Chen’s first presentation at Berkeley, in August, 2012, one of the few young people to ask him a question was a man with a shock of dark brown hair and an ample goatee. I had watched the recording several times before I realized the man was Mike Laufer, who would go on to help found Kairos Power, a privately held nuclear company that is attempting to commercialize the fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor originally designed by Forsberg, Pickard, and Peterson, who is also a co-founder of Kairos. Once I recognized Laufer, his question to Chen, about “the biggest challenges or obstacles to overcome” in order to build a salt-cooled reactor, had a new resonance. Was Laufer, who at the time was a graduate student at the university, already putting together a business plan?

Kairos represents a new era for the U.S. nuclear industry. Inspired by SpaceX, it is effectively trying to rebuild U.S. industrial capacity within a single company. The business model calls for a vertically integrated network of facilities that can fabricate fuel and salt for Kairos, and can manufacture a large share of what the company needs to build its reactors. The hope behind all this is that by running things internally Kairos will be able to offer nuclear energy at a competitive price in the market. And it has had some success. Last year, Google committed to buying five hundred megawatts from the firm by 2035. Kairos is also one of only two U.S. companies with a permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build a new reactor. Construction of the reactor building, located in Oak Ridge, broke ground last year. “We’re working to get that reactor up and running this decade,” Laufer told me.","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/69431caccd2701eb86520635/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jones_ThoriumReactor_GettyImages-639357208.jpg",N,,2025-12-18 23:58:07.959163

Those moves particularly impacted offshore wind developments and added significant uncertainty to the feasibility of clean energy investments as a whole.","The House of Representatives cleared the way for a massive overhaul of the federal environmental review process on Thursday, despite last-minute changes that led clean energy groups and moderate Democrats to pull their support.

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or SPEED Act, overcame opposition from environmentalists and many Democrats who oppose the bill’s sweeping changes to a bedrock environmental law.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and backed by Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), passed the House Thursday in a 221-196 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined Republican lawmakers to back the reform effort. It now heads to the Senate, where it has critics and proponents on both sides of the aisle, making its prospects uncertain.

The bill seeks to reform foundational environmental regulations that govern how major government projects are assessed and approved by amending the landmark 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed into law under the Nixon administration. NEPA requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them. Although NEPA reviews are only one component of the federal permitting process, advocates argue that they serve a crucial role by providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects that major projects could have on the environment.

Critics of the law have argued for years that increasingly complex reviews—along with legal wrangling over the findings of those reviews—have turned NEPA into a source of significant, burdensome delays that threaten the feasibility of major projects, such as power plants, transmission lines and wind and solar projects on federal land.

Speaking on the floor of the House Thursday before the vote, Westerman described the SPEED Act as a way to “restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting.” Westerman praised the original intent of NEPA, but said the law’s intended environmental protections had been overshadowed by NEPA becoming “more synonymous with red tape and waste.

“What was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said.

After the bill’s passage through the House on Thursday, the SPEED Act’s Democratic cosponsor, Golden, praised the bill’s success.

“The simplest way to make energy, housing, and other essentials more affordable is to make it possible to actually produce enough of it at a reasonable cost,” Golden said in a press release following the vote. “The SPEED Act has united workers, businesses, and political forces who usually oppose each other because scarcity hurts everyone.”

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the bill aims to reform the NEPA process in several key ways. First, it makes changes to the ways agencies comply with NEPA—for example, by creating exemptions to when a NEPA review is required, and requiring agencies to only consider environmental impacts that are directly tied to the project at hand.

It would also drastically shorten the deadline to sue a federal agency over its permitting decision and constrain who is eligible to file suit. Current law provides a six-year statute of limitations on agency decisions for permitting energy infrastructure, and two years for transportation project permits. Under the SPEED Act’s provisions, those deadlines would be shortened to a mere 150 days and only allow lawsuits to be filed by plaintiffs who demonstrated in public comment periods that they would be directly and negatively impacted by the project.

NEPA does not require the government to make particular decisions about whether or how to move forward with a project based on a review’s findings. However, critics argue that in the decades since its passage, interest groups have “weaponized” the NEPA process to delay or even doom projects they oppose, sometimes forcing agencies to conduct additional analyses that add costly delays to project timelines.

Strange Bedfellows on Either Side of the Bill

Although climate activists and environmental groups have used NEPA to oppose fossil fuel projects, such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, oil and gas interests are far from the only group seeking respite. Some voices within the clean energy industry have called for permitting reform too, arguing that delays stemming from the current permitting process have had a negative impact on America’s ability to build out more climate-friendly projects, including some offshore wind projects and transmission lines to connect renewables to the grid.

So when Westerman and Golden introduced the SPEED Act in the House, a hodgepodge of odd alliances and opposition groups formed in response.

The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, launched a seven-figure advertising campaign in recent months pushing lawmakers to pursue permitting reform, according to a report from Axios. And the bill also initially enjoyed support from voices within the clean power industry. However, last-minute changes to the bill—designed to win over Republican holdouts—undermined the SPEED Act’s cross-sector support.

The bill’s opponents had previously raised alarm bells that fossil fuel interests would disproportionately benefit from a more streamlined review process under the current administration, citing President Donald Trump’s ongoing war against wind and solar energy projects.

In recent months, the Trump administration has sought to pause, reconsider or revoke already approved permits for renewable energy projects it dislikes. Those moves particularly impacted offshore wind developments and added significant uncertainty to the feasibility of clean energy investments as a whole.

A bipartisan amendment to the SPEED Act, added during the Natural Resources Committee’s markup in November, sought to address some of those concerns by adding language that would make it more difficult for the administration to “revoke, rescind, withdraw, terminate, suspend, amend, alter, or take any other action to interfere” with an existing authorization.

However, that measure encountered resistance from key Republican voices who support Trump’s attacks on offshore wind projects.

A Last-Minute Loophole for Trump’s Energy Agenda

On Tuesday, Republican lawmakers in the Rules Committee were able to amend the SPEED Act in a way that would facilitate the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to axe renewable energy projects. The changes were spearheaded by Andy Harris (R-Md.) and Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), two vocal proponents of Trump’s energy policies. The amendment fundamentally undermined the technology-neutral aspirations of the bill—and any hope of receiving widespread support from moderate Democrats or the clean power industry.

According to Matthew Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters, Harris and Van Drew’s amendment would allow the administration to exclude any project from the bill’s reforms that the Trump administration had flagged for reconsideration—something the administration has done repeatedly for renewable projects like offshore wind.

The result, Davis argued, is that the bill would speed up the environmental review process for the Trump administration’s preferred sources of energy—namely oil and gas—while leaving clean energy projects languishing.

“They couldn’t pass the rule on Tuesday to even consider this bill without making it even better for the fossil fuel industry and even worse for the clean energy industry,” Davis said.

In a public statement following Thursday’s vote, Davis described the amended SPEED Act as “a fossil fuel giveaway that cuts out community input and puts our health and safety at risk to help big polluters.”

The American Clean Power Association, which represents the renewable energy industry, previously hailed the bill as an important step forward for the future of clean energy development. But after the Rules Committee’s changes on Tuesday, the organization dropped its support.

“Our support for permitting reform has always rested on one principle: fixing a broken system for all energy resources,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet in a Wednesday statement. “The amendment adopted last night violate[s] that principle. Technology neutrality wasn’t just good policy—it was the political foundation that made reform achievable.”

The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), a nonprofit trade and advocacy organization, echoed that sentiment.

“Durable, bipartisan, technology-neutral permitting reforms that support and advance the full suite of American electricity resources and the necessary expansion of transmission infrastructure to get that electricity from where it’s generated to where it’s needed are essential to meeting that challenge reliably, securely, and most importantly, affordably,” said ACORE CEO Ray Long. “Unfortunately, the changes made on the House floor are a disappointing step backward from achieving these objectives.”

Following the SPEED Act’s passage through the House on Thursday, advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) issued a public statement praising the bill’s success while noting how the recent amendments had affected the law.

“While we are concerned that post committee additions to the bill could put the certainty of a range of projects at risk, this bill’s underlying reforms are critical to advancing American energy,” CRES President Heather Reams said in the statement.

Mixed Expectations for the Reform’s Impact

Even before the move to strip protections for renewables from the bill, some critics—like Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.)—said that the legislation didn’t go far enough to curtail the president’s “all-out assault” against clean power, arguing that the bill does nothing to restore approvals that have already been canceled by the administration, and doesn’t address other roadblocks that have been put in place.

“The administration cannot be trusted to act without specific language, in my view, to protect the clean energy projects already in the pipeline and to prevent the Interior Secretary from unilaterally stopping projects that are needed to lower costs and improve grid reliability,” Levin told Inside Climate News in an interview ahead of the House vote.

Both Levin and Davis pointed to a July memo from the Department of Interior that requires all wind and solar projects on federal land to receive higher-level approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

“The administration is not even returning the phone calls of project developers. They are not responding to applications being submitted,” Davis said. “That sort of approach is in stark contrast with the ‘white glove, concierge service’—and that’s a quote from the Trump administration—the service they are providing for fossil fuel companies to access our public lands.”

The SPEED Act’s opponents also dispute the idea that NEPA reviews are one of the primary causes of permitting delays, arguing that reports from the Congressional Research Service and other groups have found little evidence to support those claims.

“Often missing in the conversation around NEPA is the empirical research that’s been done, and there’s a lot of that out there,” said Jarryd Page, a staff attorney at the Environmental Law Institute, in a September interview with Inside Climate News.

That research points to resource constraints as one of the biggest roadblocks, Page said, like not having enough staff to conduct the environmental reviews, or staff lacking adequate experience and technical know-how.

Debate over NEPA and the reform of the permitting process will now move into the Senate, where experts say the SPEED Act will likely undergo further changes.

“I think as the bill goes forwards in the Senate, we’ll probably see a neutral, across-the-board approach to making sure the process is fair for all technology types,” Xan Fishman, an energy policy expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center told ICN after Thursday’s vote.

Fishman stressed it would be crucial to ensure permits for projects wouldn’t suddenly be cancelled for political reasons, but said he was optimistic about how the SPEED Act would be refined in the Senate.

“It’s great to see Congress so engaged with permitting reform,” he said. “Both sides of the aisle see a need to do better.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2242254350-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:10.757368

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025.
Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance.
Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit.","The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service on Dec. 17 delivered a proposed rule to set 45Z clean fuel production credit guidance to the White House Office of Management and Budget. OMB review marks a final stage before a proposed rule is released for public comment.

According to information released by the OMB, the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) includes guidance regarding 45Z implementation, including the calculation of emissions factors for transportation fuel, the determination of clean fuel production credits, and producer registration.

The 45Z tax credit was first established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, providing a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The original version of the credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025. Under the OBBBA updates, the “special rate” for SAF will is eliminated beginning in 2026, effectively capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all fuels, including SAF. The OBBBA also extended 45Z for two additional years, through the of 2029. Legislative efforts are currently underway to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF and further extend the credit.

Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance. Guidance delays have been particularly harmful to the biobased diesel industry, with domestic production down significantly when compared to last year.

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit. A companion notice, also issued in January 2025, included initial guidance on emissions rates under the 45Z credit, including an initial table that sets forth emissions rates for similar categories and types of fuel.

Also in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy released the 45ZCF-GREET model, which is designed specifically to evaluate life cycle GHG emissions to meet the requirements of section 45Z.

The DOE in July 2025 issued a notice soliciting public comments on a preliminary plan for determining provisional emissions rates (PER) for the purposes of the 45Z clean fuel production credit. A PER must be determined for any fuel not addressed in the emissions rate tables.

According to information published by the OMB, the upcoming NPRM is expected to address public comments gathered by Treasury and the IRS in response to the January 2025 notices. “These notices were published in early 2025 to meet the statutory deadline of January 1, 2025, however the rules need to be further formalized in an NPRM and then finalized,” according to the OMB’s summary of the NPRM.

""Energy Transfer management has determined that its continued development of the project is not warranted by Energy Transfer but remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project,"" the company said.
Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its decision to suspend development, which marks an abrupt shift by the developer.
Energy Transfer, which said it wanted to sell down about 80% of the equity in the Lake Charles project, had also said it was in advanced talks with potential partners.
Earlier this year, Energy Transfer had expanded its long-term contract with offtaker Chevron to 3 million mt/year and signed a long-term deal with Japan's Kyushu Electric for 1 million mt/year.","Energy Transfer has suspended the development of its proposed 16.5 million metric ton/year Lake Charles LNG export project in Louisiana, the company said Dec. 18.

The US pipeline giant announced the move in a brief statement, saying it made the decision ""to focus on allocating capital to its significant backlog of natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects that Energy Transfer believes provides superior risk/return profiles."" In a separate statement, the company said it has increased the diameter of its planned Desert Southwest Pipeline to 48 inches in response to strong demand in a recent open season.

The company suggested it would be open to turning the Lake Charles project over to another developer.

""Energy Transfer management has determined that its continued development of the project is not warranted by Energy Transfer but remains open to discussions with third parties who may have an interest in developing the project,"" the company said.

The decision to halt development of Lake Charles comes amid expectations of an LNG oversupply in the late 2020s and early 2030s, around the time the long-delayed project was expected to come online.

Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its decision to suspend development, which marks an abrupt shift by the developer.

In early November, Energy Transfer said it was ""very close"" to realizing its target of signing 15 million-15.5 million mt/y of project volumes under long-term contract.

Some of the deals it had signed were preliminary agreements that the developer still needed to convert into binding deals.

Energy Transfer, which said it wanted to sell down about 80% of the equity in the Lake Charles project, had also said it was in advanced talks with potential partners. Energy Transfer co-CEO Marshall McCrea had described the targeted sell-down as ""the last big, most important box"" before launching the project, speaking during a Nov. 5 earnings call.

Counterparties included the US-based LNG player MidOcean, which is managed by EIG and backed by Saudi Aramco. Energy Transfer in April signed a preliminary deal that would have seen MidOcean commit to funding 30% of the construction costs of the project and receive the same share of LNG offtake from the facility, or about 5 million mt/year.

Earlier this year, Energy Transfer had expanded its long-term contract with offtaker Chevron to 3 million mt/year and signed a long-term deal with Japan's Kyushu Electric for 1 million mt/year.

This year, final investment decisions on new US liquefaction projects have already reached an all-time high. Six US LNG projects have reached an FID in 2025, bringing the total liquefaction capacity approved this year to around 60 million mt/y. US projects represent a majority of the 84 million mt/y to reach FID globally during the year.

Desert Southwest

Upsizing the Desert Southwest Pipeline from 42 inches to 48 inches will increase capacity to ""up to 2.3 billion cubic feet per day, depending on final compression configuration,"" Energy Transfer said.

Desert Southwest is an expansion of the Transwestern Pipeline system. It involves roughly 516 miles of greenfield pipeline running from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Phoenix area in Arizona. Its planned in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2029 is unchanged.

When Energy Transfer reached FID on the project in August, it planned for a 42-inch pipeline and a capacity of 1.5 Bcf/d. At the time, executives expressed confidence that it could be upsized, even though the original 1.5 Bcf/d had not yet been fully subscribed.

Energy Transfer increased the size after a supplemental open season. ""There is significant demand growth in the Desert Southwest region, including the potential to retire and or convert coal-fired power plants to natural gas, which could further benefit the project,"" it said. ""The ultimate capacity of the Desert Southwest expansion project will be based on market demand.""

Shippers on Desert Southwest include Arizona Public Service, Salt River Project and Arizona G&T Cooperatives.

The expansion will ""enable us to meet the region's growing power needs and strengthen Arizona's energy infrastructure,"" Bobby Olsen, SRP's chief power system executive, said in the statement.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 19:59:18.003301

“We’re proud to help deliver better power, more jobs and a brighter future for our fellow Arkansans.” About Entergy Arkansas Entergy Arkansas provides electricity to approximately 735,000 customers in 63 counties.
We’re also investing in cleaner energy generation like modern natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy.","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Entergy Arkansas today announced Next Generation Arkansas, the company’s comprehensive plan to provide electricity that does more for Arkansas by strengthening reliability, expanding energy supply, driving economic growth and keeping power affordable for all customers. The company, and its more than 2,800 employees, are focusing the plan and their efforts in the coming years on helping keep the state and its customers out in front of the emerging electric future developing in the U.S. and globally.

“Next Generation Arkansas is about preparing our state for what’s ahead. By strengthening the grid, adding new generation and modernizing how we deliver power, we’re making the system more reliable and more affordable while also building a system that enables unprecedented growth over the long term,” said Laura Landreaux, Entergy Arkansas president and CEO. “These investments help prevent outages, support new jobs and ensure that Arkansas families and businesses continue to benefit from low, predictable electricity costs as our state grows.”

Next Generation Arkansas is a multi-faceted plan that includes input from state and local leaders and Entergy Arkansas customers across the state to ensure transparency, accountability and open dialogue about affordability and how to best meet their needs. The plan represents the company’s response to several power-related issues facing the state:

Recent state growth requiring more power to serve customers;

More extreme weather in recent years affecting customer reliability;

Increasing state competitiveness for job-creating projects; and

Cost pressures requiring new approaches to keep rates low for customers.

To meet this demand, Next Generation Arkansas has been built around four core priorities, detailed below.

Better power for Arkansas: Fewer outages, faster repairs

Entergy Arkansas is launching one of the most ambitious reliability improvement plans in recent history designed to make the power grid stronger and more reliable with an initial goal to reduce power outages by at least 30% over the coming years.

In addition to increasing vegetation investments that will keep power lines clear, the company is performing reliability improvement projects across the state and deploying new, advanced technology tools that will help spot problems faster, prevent challenges and improve power quality for decades to come.

The economic growth the company is helping enable is adding new large customers to the grid that helps offset the costs of these improvements for existing customers.

More power for Arkansas: Power when and where needed to meet soaring demand

Arkansas was recently ranked the fastest-growing state economy in America for two quarters in a row, the No. 1 state for inbound movers, and the state with the lowest cost of living. Arkansas is already expected to see more than a 35% increase in power needs in the next five years, and with projections showing that figure could more than double, Entergy Arkansas is acting now to build the next generation of power sources to support the state’s growth and serve its customers while keeping rates affordable.

To do this, Entergy Arkansas plans to invest in approximately 2,600 MW of new, more fuel-efficient generation resources and repower approximately 1,600 MW of existing generation in the next five years pending approval from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, including:

Investing in new, modern natural gas plants to increase fuel efficiency by up to 40%, which lowers fuel charges on customer bills:

450 MW at the new Ironwood Power Station natural gas plant in Hot Spring County (2028).

750 MW at the new Jefferson Power Station natural gas plant in Jefferson County (2029).

600 MW of solar + 350 MW of battery storage at the Arkansas Cypress facility in Jefferson County (2028), which will provide clean, renewable power that lowers fuel charges on customer bills.

Retrofitting coal-fired generators to burn natural gas and extend their lives.

Investing in upgrades at existing natural gas facilities to increase output more than 150 MW.

Renewing the license to generate 1,800 MW of clean, reliable 24/7 energy produced by the Arkansas Nuclear One power plant and investing in new, more efficient plant equipment that increases the output of the facility.

These investments will ensure Arkansas has a balanced, more cost-efficient, “all-of-the-above” energy mix needed to support homes, businesses and new industries.

Job power for Arkansas: Helping the state recruit more and better jobs

Arkansas offers a strong pro-business environment, and over the past five years, Entergy Arkansas has partnered with state and community leaders to drive the creation of more than 7,500 jobs and over $13 billion in capital investments. As electricity becomes a key factor in securing new business, the state must continue delivering the power infrastructure and site development needed to compete. When structured strategically, these private investments not only generate tax revenue and quality jobs, but also provide broader benefits for Arkansans, including bill savings and a more reliable grid. The company plans to do this by:

Using the blueprint created by the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025 to work at the speed needed to compete nationally for once-in-a-generation tech and industrial projects.

Bolstering local job impact – Arkansas building Arkansas – by using local contractors and companies around the state whenever possible, reinvesting growth back into our communities through new jobs, state and local tax revenue, and indirect economic impact.

Creating economic impact while implementing the plan – for example, the development of the Ironwood, Jefferson Power Station and Arkansas Cypress power plants would create approximately 1,860 direct jobs as well as significantly more indirect jobs during construction, provide 46 permanent jobs during operation, and that will generate more than $105 million in new local and state tax revenue by 2030.

“We want to commend state leaders for passing the Generating Jobs Act of 2025, which is a landmark legislation and shows what’s possible when Arkansas sets a bold vision for its future, and the Arkansas Public Service Commission for approving the new associated rider,” Landreaux said. “Because of the state’s leadership, Arkansas has the tools to compete for once-in-a-generation opportunities. We are committed to delivering a power system that attracts new jobs, strengthens communities, and keeps our state moving forward for the next generation of Arkansans.”

Affordable power for Arkansas: Keeping rates low and predictable

Entergy Arkansas’s rates remain 22% below the national average, and the company plans to continue finding ways to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and offer innovative bill solutions to keep power affordable for all customers, even as the company invests in the state’s growth including:

Leveraging new policies to help build the power system Arkansas needs while keeping rate stable and predictable.

Using new technologies to help manage the grid and prevent outages at less cost to customers.

Providing customers with ways to lower their bills with new rate structures and by helping them access resources like free home energy checkups, free and discounted energy-saving products, and rebates on energy-efficient equipment purchases.

Continuing to recruit new large industrial customers to help spread the cost of maintaining and upgrading the power grid across a larger customer base and reduce the burden on residents and small businesses.

Working with new large customer partners to scale and accelerate energy affordability initiatives and encourage others to provide community support, as Google has with its $25 million Energy Impact Fund.

All of these efforts will be managed with transparency for customers and with direct oversight from the Arkansas Public Service Commission, Landreaux said.

“Our 2,800 Entergy employees in Arkansas and I understand that this is some of the most important work of our careers, and we feel it personally because we’re Arkansans too,” Landreaux said. “We’re proud to help deliver better power, more jobs and a brighter future for our fellow Arkansans.”

The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act (H.R. 1366) streamlines critical mineral production and creates the Abandoned Hardrock Mine Fund to support an abandoned hardrock mine cleanup program created by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021.

“The bill I passed in Congress today puts Nevada’s natural resources to work for Nevadans,” Rep. Horsford said. “Streamlining the hardrock mining process will create good jobs and strengthen our energy sector. At the same time, this legislation delivers more resources for the Silver State to clean up past mining-related contaminants in our environment. The result is more jobs, a stronger economy, and an opportunity for a cleaner Nevada moving forward.”

“Strengthening our domestic mineral supply chain isn’t optional, it’s demanded to ensure we don’t fall further behind China,”Rep. Amodei said. “Western states are sitting on a wealth of resources and a critical opportunity to break our dangerous reliance on foreign adversaries while powering our own economy. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act restores decades of established precedent, repairs a permitting process undermined by the Rosemont decision, and gives domestic mining operations the certainty they need to compete aggressively and win. I’m glad to see the House pass this bill once again with bipartisan support, and I urge the Senate to act swiftly to get it signed into law.”

“The bipartisan Mining Regulatory Clarity Act is foundationally important to ensuring the U.S. can use our vast domestic resources to build the mineral supply chains our economic and national security demand,” Rich Nolan, National Mining Association President and CEO said. “China has weaponized its mineral dominance and left no doubt about how untenable our import reliance has become. The urgency to address our minerals challenge has never been greater. This legislation ensures the fundamental ability to conduct responsible mining activities on federal lands. Regulatory certainty, or the lack thereof, will either underpin or undermine efforts to decisively confront our minerals crisis.”

“The Nevada Mining Association is in full support of the passage of the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act,” Amanda Hilton, Nevada Mining Association President said. “As the importance of strengthening domestic supply chains continues to grow, this legislation provides clear guidance for mine operations in Nevada and across the United States to responsibly produce the minerals needed here at home, support national security, and provide good-paying careers for American workers.”

The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act now moves to the U.S. Senate where Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto introduced companion legislation.

(AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation’s largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.

But it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.

It also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.

Laura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday’s meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”

It would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.

Power plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday’s trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.

The Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.

Jeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.

Thursday’s order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.

For tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.

But utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.

FERC’s Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.

It requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.

That could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.

The order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.

To wrap it up… In every way, 2025 was a challenging year for protecting our coasts and ocean.","The Surfrider team, volunteers, and supporters knew from the onset that this year was not going to be easy. We expected efforts by the federal administration to weaken coastal and ocean protections, but what we experienced was unprecedented. From cutting regulations that limit pollution and development in our waterways, to rescinding funding for critical coastal and marine monitoring programs, to the most aggressive ocean sell-off to offshore oil drilling in more than half a century, the onslaught of challenges delivered by our federal government kept us busy.

Watch our 2025 year in review video

Then there were ‘drop everything’ unforeseen circumstances, like the LA fires, that for a while sucked the energy out of our grassroots efforts to be effective stewards of that coast. Meanwhile, the visible challenges persisted — plastic pollution, the water quality crisis on the US-Mexico border, and our rapidly eroding shorelines.

We could have tried to look past the obstacles that stood in the way of our mission in 2025, but that’s not what we do. Instead, we faced them head-on and played into our strengths even harder to protect what we love.

Surfrider has the unique ability to scale and adapt to be effective, from the halls of Congress all the way to your local beach. When there is little opportunity to be proactive on federal policies that protect our coasts and ocean in Washington, D.C., we continue to mobilize in Sacramento, Tallahassee, Eugene, Albany, and other state capitals across the country. While we have watched the momentum for a swift transition to renewable energy decline, our network of volunteers has activated to restore our coastlines, in the wetlands, dunes, and mangroves, as a nature-based solution to the changing climate.

In 2025, the Surfrider network doubled down on opportunities to make progress on the ground, in the local councils, and in the state capitols, while still defending the bedrock federal protections in place for our coasts and ocean. Several state plastic pollution prevention bills were passed after years of effort. We won more than 20 local campaigns across the country with the leadership of Surfrider’s chapters. Volunteers turned out in the tens of thousands to give nature a boost by restoring coastal ecosystems.

Despite the challenges and the absence of federal leadership for healthy coastlines, this was still a year of incredible impact for Surfrider and our coasts.

Here are some of Surfrider’s major achievements of 2025:

45 campaign victories were won at the local, state, and federal levels that improve water quality on our beaches, reduce plastic pollution, protect ocean ecosystems, and strengthen the resilience of our coastlines through nature-based solutions.

More than 23,000 Surfrider volunteers removed 120,633 pounds of trash and recycling from U.S. beaches and waterways.

More than 40,000 native plants were installed across 22 acres of coastal dunes and mangrove forests.

Through 97 Ocean Friendly Garden workdays, 2,905 native plants and trees were planted, achieving more than 26 acres of Ocean Friendly Gardens that filter 23.8 million gallons of runoff annually.

Volunteers conducted more than 10,000 Blue Water Task Force water quality tests at 613 sampling sites.

In 30 states and territories, 646 Ocean Friendly Restaurants served an estimated 42 million single-use plastic-free meals.

An estimated 1.8 million plastic water bottles and 2.7 million mini plastic toiletry bottles were saved from polluting our communities, waterways, and landfills by 40 Ocean Friendly Hotels.

Plastic Pollution

In 2025, the issue of plastic pollution on our beaches persisted, as noted by the 120,633 pounds of trash and recycling that were removed through Surfrider’s 831 cleanups. On the fifth of July alone, more than 10,000 pounds of trash were cleaned up. All of this was captured in Surfrider’s Beach Cleanup Report, which found that 83% of the 870,000 pieces of trash analyzed in 2024 were plastic.

Turning off the tap on plastic pollution is the only effective way to make an impact on this issue, and market solutions play a major role. This year, Surfrider’s Ocean FriendlyBusinesses network grew to 646 Ocean Friendly Restaurants in 30 states and territories, serving an estimated 42 million single-use plastic-free meals every year. New businesses were added as Ocean Friendly Hotels, now 40 in total, collectively eliminating about 1.8 million plastic water bottles and 2.7 million mini plastic toiletry bottles from polluting our communities, waterways, and landfills.

While the federal administration’s priorities blocked any efforts to pass meaningful plastic pollution reduction legislation in DC, Surfrider still successfully achieved 14 coastal victories in states and cities around the country. Together, these victories resulted in more than 862 million single-use plastic items taken out of circulation.

One example was Washington’s Recycling Reform Act, which reduces the amount of plastic pollution found on the state’s beaches and improves access to recycling. Another was in Oregon, where Surfrider successfully waged the Beyond the Bag Ban campaign, a statewide effort to eliminate thicker plastic check-out bags from grocery stores. Oregon is the second state in the US, after California, to pass a stronger bag ban.

Additionally, Surfrider defeated a dangerous Florida state bill that would have expanded the state's preemption on the local regulation of single-use plastic and reusable materials, containers, bottles, and bags. In the California cities of Santa Cruz and Capitola, Surfrider helped pass ‘Ban the Butt’ ordinances that end the sale of filtered tobacco products, the number one item found at Surfrider’s beach cleanups. In New Jersey, four local campaigns were won to require the containment and removal of plastic particles and dust at construction sites.

A lot of wins for eliminating needless plastic waste and the impacts it has on our coasts and ocean.

Coasts and Climate

There were significant threats at the federal level in 2025 to upend bedrock ocean protection laws, climate programs, and funding for coastal management. Even so, Surfrider demonstrated in real time how coastal communities and ecosystems can not only survive, but thrive with nature-based solutions. By working with nature and leaning into community voices and expertise, Surfrider worked swiftly to make real progress on local and state coastal resilience policy and project opportunities.

In 2025, Surfrider’s Climate Action Program came to life as a frontline defense against coastal erosion and the impacts of climate change. By restoring blue carbon mangrove forests, coastal dunes, and riparian habitats, Surfrider is adding decades of resilience to coastlines across the country while enhancing habitat and coastal access. A total of 76 restoration events were carried out across more than 22 acres of coastline in Hawaii, California, Florida, Puerto Rico, North Carolina, New York, New Hampshire, Maine, and Wisconsin, with the support of more than 2,000 volunteers. Collectively, these volunteers installed over 40,000 native plants and removed more than 85,000 pounds of invasives.

Meanwhile, the finishing touches were put on the Surfers’ Point Managed Retreat Project in Ventura, California. This project has become the gold standard in the application of nature-based solutions to address coastal erosion and climate change preparedness. By leveraging the success of Surfers’ Point and years of community organizing, Surfrider secured a state grant of $1 million to design and apply a similar approach to the rapidly eroding and beloved ‘Surf Beach’ at San Onofre State Beach in Southern California.

Surfrider won eleven local and state campaigns in 2025 to better equip our coasts for a changing climate. In Oregon, Surfrider advanced its multi-year Oregon Beaches Forever campaign aimed at safeguarding the state’s public beaches as they try to adapt to climate change. Four state and local wins were achieved in Oregon that advance nature-based solutions, promote climate-forward planning, and protect beaches against destructive riprap.

In Florida, Surfrider helped pass a state bill to provide long-term protections for state parks, including coastal areas, against harmful development projects. On the legal front, Surfrider’s amicus curiae (“friend of the court”) support led to a significant victory for California coasts in a case that properly limits armoring on California coastlines, consistent with the California Coastal Act.

To help scale proven coastal resilience, climate action, and nature-based tools, policies, and projects, Surfrider's 2025 State of the Beach Report highlighted case studies from around the country that can be replicated and applied along coastlines facing similar management challenges.

Clean Water

While protections for water quality at our beaches and waterways were also targeted by the federal administration’s efforts to reduce environmental regulations, in 2025, Surfrider worked tirelessly to safeguard the programs that keep us and our families safe when we visit the coast. Eleven clean water campaigns were won at the local, state, and federal levels. This includes having successfully advocated for congressional support for the EPA’s Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act, or BEACH Act, which provides national grants to coastal states to run their beach water quality monitoring and public notification programs. The program is critical to provide families with the information they need to stay safe at the beach and to safeguard our valuable coastal economies.

At the state level, Surfrider helped pass a Washington bill that requires public notification of sewage spills. Other state bills that passed in 2025 include: solutions for new wastewater system technology in Hawaii; a ban on the use of Neonicotinoids, a class of synthetic, neurotoxic insecticides in Connecticut; and protections for recreational water quality against seafood processing wastewater discharge in Oregon.

Meanwhile, to address the ongoing public health and environmental crisis at the US-Mexico border, Surfrider and its coalition partners successfully advocated for more federal investment in border sewage infrastructure operations, maintenance, and capital improvements.

The role of Surfrider’s clean water programs has become more important than ever to help fill the gaps where governments are lacking the capacity or political will to address pollution issues. The Blue Water Task Force, the nation’s largest volunteer-driven beach water quality monitoring program, is now testing water quality at 613 sampling sites on beaches and waterways around the country. In 2025, volunteers ran more than 10,000 water quality tests. A total of 107,000 tests have been completed over the program’s 30-year history.

To identify and fix the sources of pollution identified through the Blue Water Task Force, multiple Surfrider chapters are working collaboratively in their local communities. This includes projects in San Mateo, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura Counties, California; Eastern Long Island, New York; Melbourne and Miami, Florida; Newport, Oregon; Kaua’i and O’ahu, Hawaii; and Rincón and Isabela, Puerto Rico.

Surfrider’s Ocean Friendly Gardens program is helping people across the country reimagine and transform landscapes, yards, and community green spaces with nature-based solutions that protect clean water, build biodiversity, and support climate resilience. In 2025, Surfrider led 97 Ocean Friendly Garden workdays during which volunteers planted 2,905 native plants and trees. Across the country, there are now more than 26 acres of Ocean Friendly Gardens that filter 23.1 million gallons of runoff annually.

Surfrider also developed a new digital resource, Re-planting After Fire: A Fire-Resilient Landscape Guide for Lahaina & West Maui, to help residents in the Maui community affected by the devastating 2023 fires create and maintain landscapes that are fire-resilient, environmentally responsible, and ocean-friendly.

Finally, Surfrider secured two significant legal wins in the courts for clean water in 2025. Hawai’i’s Supreme Court held in Surfrider and our partners’ favor in Kaua’i to help end the use of dangerous pesticides in Hawaii. Meanwhile, in another federal case, the courts concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must make better decisions when setting water pollution standards for industrial facilities.

Beach Access

In 2025, among the many unique challenges to beach access in the US, there were coastal erosion, Space X launches, the privatization of coastal parking, and climate change. Surfrider won six coastal victories to help address threats to coastal access in California, Texas, Florida, and Hawaii while monitoring dozens more.

In California, through the Love Your Beach tour, Surfrider mobilized the public to advocate against threats to weaken or abolish the state’s Coastal Act, a landmark law that protects the state’s 1,100-mile coastline. With stops from San Diego to Sacramento, the tour collected more than 1,500 signatures from 100 different California districts, all in support of the crucial coastal environmental and access protection law.

Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, Surfrider successfully supported the repeal of Florida legislation that preempted local jurisdictions from protecting the public’s customary use rights to recreate on Florida beaches.

Ocean Protection

On January 6, 2025, President Biden announced the withdrawal of the entire US East Coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, and part of the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska from future oil and gas leasing. The historic action protected more than 625 million acres of U.S. waters from oil and gas development. The Surfrider network celebrated this incredible victory.

However, following the change in administrations, the White House reversed President Biden's ban and initiated an onslaught of policies, proposals, and plans to sell off our ocean resources. Surfrider quickly filed litigation with our coalition partners to restore these protections. These cases remain ongoing and may extend for years, reinforcing the importance of Surfrider’s grassroots advocacy.

While persistently on the defensive, Surfrider helped achieve two major proactive ocean protection victories in 2025. The 582,570 square-mile Papahānaumokuākea National Marine Sanctuary in Hawaiʻi was established, becoming one of the largest marine protected areas in the world. The sanctuary safeguards coral reefs, seamounts, and shoals that are home to diverse marine wildlife, including invertebrates, fish, birds, and marine mammals, including many endemic species.

Surfrider helped strengthen the protection of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, home to the only barrier coral reef in the continental US, in addition to seagrass beds, mangrove forests, and diverse marine wildlife. The sanctuary’s Restoration Blueprint expands the sanctuary by 739 square miles to more than 4,530 square miles of protected marine ecosystems.

While these wins were significant, our ocean faced a dangerous new threat in 2025 — a brewing offshore drilling plan to open vast stretches of the U.S. coastline to new offshore oil and gas leases. The nearly 1.3 billion acres of ocean at risk in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s proposed five-year drilling plan, released in late November, include all federal waters off California, all of the western and portions of the eastern Gulf, and most of Alaskan waters, including the untouched High Arctic, where drilling has never been attempted because of the environmental hazards.

In anticipation of such a plan, Surfrider was ready and quickly mobilized a nationwide effort to demonstrate widespread public opposition to more offshore drilling on our coasts. Surfrider’s Drilling is Killing campaign is live, and will deliver tens of thousands of public comments to the agency through the deadline on January 23, 2026. Surfrider is engaging communities, businesses, and elected leaders in this critical comment period to build the public record of opposition to the plan.

As part of a coalition effort in California, Surfrider has organized people’s hearings in response to the absence of a public process in shaping the plan. Events in San Diego, Orange County, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, Humboldt, and beyond are each turning out hundreds of ocean voices to advocate for ocean protection, and say no to new offshore drilling.

To wrap it up…

In every way, 2025 was a challenging year for protecting our coasts and ocean. New threats emerged while the persistent challenges to coastal conservation remained. Undeterred, the Surfrider network championed key coastal and ocean programs threatened with elimination or defunded by the federal administration while also taking local action on the ground.

Thanks to the dedicated volunteers, staff, and supporters from coast to coast, diverse and powerful voices were shared with our federal leadership on the importance of conserving our coastal resources. Meanwhile, every day, those same ocean defenders were safeguarding your beach through local solutions, in the field, and in the water.

We don’t expect 2026 to be any easier, but we do know that we are walking away from this year stronger than ever to confront the challenges that lie ahead.",https://www.surfrider.org/hubfs/Andrew%20Tonra.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 04:59:05.466146

PROVIDENCE, RI – Today the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4), chaired by Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) Director Terry Gray, approved the 2025 Climate Action Strategy. The Strategy is intended to guide implementation of the Act on Climate and provides a comprehensive assessment of Rhode Island’s emissions trajectory, programmatic tools, and the feasibility of achieving statutory greenhouse gas reduction mandates under current conditions. Developed in collaboration with the Office of Energy Resources (OER) including significant public input, the strategy outlines a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 45% below 1990 levels by 2030.

“The Climate Action Strategy is the result of hard work by all the EC4 agencies and, in particular, the climate teams at OER and DEM. Over the last 14 months they have worked very closely with the experts at Energy, Environment, and Economics, Inc. (E3) who provided contract support and modeling. Throughout the process, we have engaged with many different communities to get meaningful input and feedback,” said DEM Director and EC4 Chair Terry Gray. “This strategy reflects a clear-eyed assessment of today’s landscape and the challenges ahead. Rhode Island was moving in the right direction under the Act, but our efforts are clearly impeded by considerable federal policy changes.”

“The EC4’s approval of this strategy charts a path forward for making progress towards the Act on Climate while recognizing new, significant challenges from the Trump administration,” said OER Acting Energy Commissioner Christopher Kearns. “The core of our climate work is increasing the share of zero-emission energy resources while maintaining electricity affordability for households. Supporting rate stability is a key foundation for meeting our emissions reduction goals, alongside continued investments in clean energy, electric vehicles, heat pumps, pre-weatherization, and energy-efficiency programs that are essential to sustaining progress.”

Since the Act on Climate was signed in 2021, new programs, laws, and regulations have supported the state’s emissions-reduction goals. RI has been a leader in offshore wind development and modeling showed that fully carrying out these initiatives as originally planned would’ve put the state on track achieve the 2030 reduction targets.

Recent federal actions – including tariffs, the rescission of Clean Air Act authorities supporting clean vehicles, the termination of Inflation Reduction Act clean-energy and electric-vehicle tax credits, efforts to stall offshore wind development, and the elimination of programs such as Solar for All – have significantly altered the landscape on which Rhode Island’s climate strategy was built. The updated strategy recognizes that these changes will have immediate and serious consequences for the state’s climate plans. Given these challenges, Rhode Island must adjust its climate planning efforts to reflect the new federal landscape. The EC4 is evaluating alternative paths to achieve meaningful emissions reductions while protecting ratepayers from unsustainable costs.

""We strongly support the Trump administration's systemic reforms to the NEPA process, which are already yielding dividends. But we need legislation to enshrine improvements to NEPA for the long-term.

""And as AI and data centers drive unprecedented electricity demand,"" he continued, ""we need a permitting system that can enable speed to power and innovation. We urge the Senate to act swiftly to advance meaningful, comprehensive permitting reform legislation that reduces bureaucracy, simplifies decision-making, and ends frivolous, activist-driven litigation.""

""AI-scale growth is testing how quickly America can plan, permit, and build."" said Ann Bluntzer Pullin, PhD, Executive Director of the Hamm Institute for American Energy. ""Streamlining federal reviews without sacrificing environmental protections creates the predictable, efficient pathways needed to bring reliable energy online at the pace innovation demands.""

AUSTIN, Texas – The Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) lauded passage of H.R. 4776, The SPEED Act, in the U.S. House of Representatives. This legislative effort, supported by TIPRO, will streamline federal permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969.

The following statement can be attributed to Ed Longanecker, President of TIPRO:

“On behalf of our nearly 3,000 members, TIPRO applauds the passage of H.R. 4776 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Comprehensive permitting reform is a strategic imperative for our country and industry. Without it, America’s energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad, or ensure long-term affordability for consumers. For too long, federal infrastructure approvals have languished in bureaucratic limbo, with critical energy projects delayed by years due to duplicative reviews, inconsistent agency coordination, and open-ended legal challenges.

Permitting paralysis has real-world consequences. American families feel it at the gas pump. Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs. And communities waiting for the economic benefits of infrastructure development, including jobs, tax revenue, and improved local services, watch opportunity pass them by. In addition, the coming AI revolution, with the need to power massive data centers across the country, will drive further demand for American natural gas. When domestic production is throttled, imports from less regulated producers fill the gap, increasing global emissions and undermining U.S. environmental standards.

For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is mission critical. It unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures that the United States remains a reliable energy partner to the world. At a time when energy reliability and affordability are top concerns for working Americans, we strongly encourage expedited consideration in the U.S. Senate to help reshape the federal permitting process for energy infrastructure.”

The SPEED Act: Reforming Federal Permitting to Accelerate Economic Development

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, formally designated as H.R. 4776, represents a bipartisan legislative effort to streamline federal permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. Introduced on July 25, 2025, by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR), the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and cosponsored by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), the bill aims to reduce bureaucratic delays that have long hindered infrastructure, energy, and economic projects across the United States. By addressing inefficiencies in environmental reviews, the SPEED Act seeks to foster economic growth, enhance energy security, and support critical developments such as transmission lines, data centers, and manufacturing operations, while maintaining core environmental safeguards.

Key Provisions of the SPEED Act

The SPEED Act modifies NEPA to expedite approvals without eliminating environmental oversight. Notable provisions include:

Standardizing Review Processes: The bill redefines “major federal actions” to exclude designations based solely on federal funding and exempts actions already reviewed under equivalent federal, state, or tribal environmental laws.

Setting Deadlines: It imposes strict timelines for environmental assessments and impact statements, typically limiting reviews to one to two years, to prevent indefinite delays.

Limiting Judicial Review: Lawsuits challenging NEPA compliance must be filed within 150 days of final agency action, and courts are directed to remand cases for correction rather than halting projects entirely. This provision also restricts standing to parties who submitted comments during the public review process, curbing frivolous or politically motivated litigation.

Enhancing Agency Coordination: The legislation requires better interagency collaboration and focuses reviews on “proximate” effects directly caused by the project, excluding speculative or unrelated impacts.

These reforms are designed to balance environmental protection with economic imperatives, particularly in sectors like mining, energy production, and AI infrastructure, where permitting delays have historically increased costs and deterred investment. Supporters argue that the bill will unlock domestic resources, reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, and create jobs.

The SPEED Act is particularly vital for the oil and natural gas industry, where protracted NEPA permitting processes have significantly impeded exploration, infrastructure development, and overall energy security. Over the past five decades, NEPA has evolved into a complex framework burdened by court rulings, executive directives, and agency interpretations, resulting in unpredictable delays that deter investment, stifle innovation, and increase project costs. For oil and gas exploration, these delays have stalled federal leasing and project approvals, limiting access to domestic resources and exacerbating reliance on foreign imports, which undermines national energy independence.

In terms of infrastructure, the bill addresses barriers to constructing essential facilities such as pipelines, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, and drilling operations. Permitting bottlenecks have historically prevented timely market access for crude oil and natural gas, leading to higher flaring rates and inefficient resource utilization. By imposing reasonable timelines, reducing frivolous litigation, and streamlining interagency reviews, the SPEED Act enables faster development of these projects, ensuring they are delivered on budget and supporting more efficient production methods. This is crucial for meeting growing domestic and global energy demands, particularly amid rising needs from sectors like artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

On energy security, the legislation promotes the expansion of reliable, affordable American energy supplies, generating jobs and tax revenues while potentially reducing global emissions by displacing higher-emission foreign alternatives. Overall, by cutting red tape while preserving environmental protections, the SPEED Act positions the oil and natural gas sector to contribute more effectively to national security, economic growth, and a stable energy grid.

Senate action in 2025 remains uncertain and unlikely, however reform could gain traction in 2026 as part of larger legislative packages, such as energy security or infrastructure bills, amid partisan debates on environmental policy. Advocates are pushing for Senate consideration, emphasizing the bill’s role in national security and economic competitiveness. If enacted, the SPEED Act could significantly reshape federal permitting, potentially accelerating projects critical to AI development and domestic manufacturing in the coming years.

But with higher temperatures and heat factored into the equation, folks living in Louisiana, and the South in general, tend to use more kWh each month to stay cool regardless of who provides their power. That can mean higher overall electric bills for families and businesses.

Introduction

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit the following comments in response to the administration’s Request for Information for Accelerating the American Scientific Enterprise. ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

The U.S. scientific enterprise has reached a fork in the road. While previous policy has encouraged principal investigators to pursue creativity and curiosity in conducting research, it is clear that this approach has not had the desired effect on advancing American competitiveness and strengthening America’s position in maximizing national power. The science community must move beyond the linear Science, the Endless Frontier-model of scientific research, developed and encouraged by Vannevar Bush, and realign scientific exploration with national interests, especially in the face of the growing technological and economic threat posed by China.[1]

Undertaking this shift will mean prioritizing high-impact fields such as engineering, life sciences, and computer science over those with a less-direct impact on national competitiveness, and it means more closely aligning the research and academic community with private industry, prioritizing technology transfer and commercialization over basic, curiosity-driven research.

While we hope the administration will consider ITIF’s comments and recommendations on these issues, we also would like to urge the administration to consider the bipartisan policy blueprint already developed during the first Trump administration in the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) “Return on Investment Initiative for Unleashing American Innovation” (the Green Paper). The Green Paper outlined a series of readily executable policy ideas to improve America’s technology transfer ecosystem, increase the return on investment (ROI) from research dollars, streamline federal technology regulations, and increase the competitive orientation of the scientific enterprise. We believe that the Green Paper presents a set of readily accessible and easily implementable policy ideas to advance the American Scientific Enterprise. The administration should start by reviewing and implementing the strong work it’s already done in this regard.

Responses to RFI Questions

(i) What policy changes to Federal funding mechanisms, procurement processes, or partnership authorities would enable stronger public-private collaboration and allow America to tap into its vast private sector to better drive use-inspired basic and early-stage applied research?

First and foremost, the United States must recognize that it has already built the world’s most effective system for technology commercialization, especially where it pertains to intellectual property (IP)/technologies derived from federally funded research and development (R&D) conducted at U.S. universities and research institutions. While positive reforms can still be made on the margins, the Trump administration must refrain from implementing poor IP/technology commercialization policies that unnecessarily make innovation more difficult, risky, and expensive.

In September 2025, in an Axios interview, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called for the federal government to claim half the patent earnings from university inventions derived in part from federal R&D, erroneously asserting that “the U.S. government is getting no return on the money it invests in federal research.”[2] Yet the reality is the U.S. taxpayer—and the government—benefits greatly from this R&D funding. They benefit first from the extensive innovations produced from the academic tech transfer process, which alone has produced hundreds of life-saving drugs and vaccines, including treatments for breast, ovarian, prostate, and skin cancer, not to mention other breakthroughs in everything from Honeycrisp apples and neoprene to cloud and quantum computing. Second, university IP licensing revenues help fund key innovation-enabling infrastructure at U.S. universities, such as labs, incubators, or innovation accelerators that keep the innovation flywheel churning. Third, the government benefits from the taxes produced by the trillions in industrial output and millions of jobs created as a result of university tech transfer.[3] For instance, university research parks alone generated $33 billion in federal tax revenue in 2024.[4] The administration should refrain from imposing a claim or a tax on IP licensing revenues earned by U.S. universities.

Similarly, the administration should refrain from proposals to charge patent holders between 1 and 5 percent of a patent’s overall value. As ITIF has written, taxing patents would disincentivize innovation and harm American competitiveness all while be extraordinarily difficult to implement.[5] (It’s difficult enough for the private sector to accurately value IP, let alone a government agency doing so, and especially when debatable valuations would be tied up in litigation for years.) If the United States wishes to develop more and more useful IP—which is certainly should as a matter of technology and innovation policy—then increasing the cost of that IP through an annual tax should be a proposal summarily dispatched. Indeed, the United States should proceed in the exact option direction, such as how the United States offers lower patent filing fees for small businesses and how it has worked through patent backlogs which once took years to clear.[6]

Do not apply Bayh-Dole march in rights to control the price of resulting products. As late as 1978, the federal government had licensed less than 5 percent of the as many as 30,000 patents it owned.[7] Most of them languished on the shelves of government offices or labs. Congress transformed the situation by passing the bipartisan 1980 Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, better known as the “Bayh-Dole Act.” The legislation both created a uniform patent policy among the many federal agencies funding research and allowed universities to retain ownership of the IP and inventions made as a result of federally funded research.[8] The Bayh-Dole Act has transformed U.S. universities into engines of innovation, spawning robust academic technology transfer and commercialization capabilities and activities at hundreds of universities across the United States.[9]

In fact, the impact of academic technology transfer from U.S. universities has been so extensive that, from 1996 to 2020, it resulted in 554,000 inventions disclosed, 141,000 U.S. patents granted, and 18,000 start-ups formed.[10] Moreover, academic technology transfer has bolstered U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by up to $1 trillion, contributed to $1.9 trillion in gross U.S. industrial output, and supported 6.5 million jobs over that time.[11]

When Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act it included so-called “march-in right” provisions, which permit the government, in specified circumstances, to require patent holders to grant a “nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license” to a “responsible applicant or applicants.”[12] Yet some have called for the government to use Bayh-Dole march-in rights to control the price of resulting products, such as pharmaceutical drugs. This despite the fact that lower prices are not one of the rationales laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act. In fact, as senators Bayh and Dole have themselves noted, the Bayh-Dole Act’s march-in rights were never intended to control or ensure “reasonable prices.”[13]

The Trump administration should return to an initiative undertaken in its first iteration, when it had directed NIST to undertake a review of federal policies that could bolster the return of federal investments in R&D. The final 2018 report NIST produced, the “Return on Investment Initiative: Draft Green Paper,” concluded, “The use of march-in is typically regarded as a last resort, and has never been exercised since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980.”[14] The report further noted, “NIH determined that that use of march-in to control drug prices was not within the scope and intent of the authority.”[15] The Trump administration should build upon the findings of the 2018 NIST Green Paper and affirmatively declare that price is not a legitimate basis for the exercise of Bayh-Dole march-in rights.

Do not give away American IP. The administration should also refrain from giving away private American IP to foreign or domestic entities. In the waning days of the Biden administration, the Nuclear Research Program at the Department of Energy misguidedly opened up U.S. clean energy technology to the world. The Nuclear Research Program actually mandated that any interventions supported by its funding be given away—even to foreign rivals.[16] The memo, which was not initially made public outside of the Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories, stated:

The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) is issuing this guidance regarding the commercialization of NE-funded technologies. With this guidance, NE is establishing a policy preference for the dedication to the public of such technology, where it is made freely available to the public with few or no intellectual property restrictions, or the non-exclusive licensing of technology developed with NE funding. (Emphasis added.)

Recognizing that the contractors who manage National Laboratories for DOE according to Management & Operating (M&O) contracts (DOE National Laboratory contractors) generally have rights under the Bayh-Dole Act, including the right to elect title to federally-funded inventions and license those inventions per the technology transfer mission clauses of M&O contracts this policy is intended to be a significant factor that the National Laboratory M&O contractors are expected to weigh when structuring and negotiating the licensing of NE-funded technologies, even when owned by the contractor. In the extraordinary circumstances in which a National Laboratory wants to exclusively license a NE funded technology, NE expects the National Laboratory M&O contractor to consult with NE leadership and the DOE Patent Counsel prior to entering into such an exclusive license. The purpose of this consultation is to verify that all parties agree that the exclusive license is the best vehicle for advancing DOE’s mission and interests, including maximizing commercialization and broadly disseminating NE-funded technology.[17]

Giving away U.S. nuclear technology is a poor strategy when China has already begun to surpass the United States in the research into and deployment of fourth-generation nuclear reactor technologies and to at least be close to, if not at par, with the United States in nuclear fusion.[18] The DOE should follow established technology licensing practices as codified in the Bayh-Dole Act.

(ii) How can the Federal government better support the translation of scientific discoveries from academia, national labs, and other research institutions into practical applications? Specifically, what changes to tech transfer policies, translational programs, or commercial incentives would accelerate the path from labs to market?

Empower the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) TIP Directorate. One of the most effective ways in which the U.S. government can catalyze technology transfer and commercialization would be by empowering a program it has already established. The National Science Foundation (NSF) created the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnership (TIP) with the mission of accelerating key technology transfer to advance U.S. competitiveness. Congress authorized the directorate with $20 billion through the CHIPS and Science Act through 2027.[19] TIP makes industry buy-in a prerequisite for all projects receiving funding. Under Subtitle G of the CHIPS and Science Act, TIP grants must “develop mutually beneficial research and technology development partnerships and collaborations among entities such as institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, labor organizations, for-profit entities, government entities, and international entities,” a guideline meant to guarantee an accelerated path to practical commercialization and use, and a stark contrast from much of NSF’s other research.[20] Additionally, Subtitle G states that TIP grants are to be awarded only for research in several key technology focus areas, including AI, quantum computing, biopharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.[21]

However, in the years since the CHIPS Act was passed, Congress has only appropriated $410 million to the program.[22] Unsurprisingly, a program with an intended budget of $20 billion can’t build U.S. competitiveness in critical technologies with just 10 percent of that budget. Yet, it has still made significant strides in accelerating technology translation. Rather than funding the ten technologies it originally chose, TIP has launched funding opportunities for three technologies viewed as having the greatest potential for growth in competitiveness with the smallest investment: AI use for protein and enzyme design, advancing cell-free systems in biochemical processes, and improving fifth-generation networks and creating next-generation wireless networks.

Given the success TIP has displayed in funding critical technology research and attracting private partners to research projects, Congress should extend the period over which the CHIPS Act authorizes TIP funding beyond 2027 to ensure that all $20 billion authorized is appropriated and appropriate $1 billion to the directorate for fiscal year 2026. Even with an additional $1 billion in appropriated funds from the CHIPS and Science Act, TIP would not be able to pursue funding opportunities across all 10 key technologies that Congress identified as critical to U.S. competitiveness. It would, at most, fund opportunities in a handful of technologies. An additional $1 billion should be added each fiscal year until annual appropriations for TIP reach or exceed $4 billion per year.

TIP is also operating with a 45 percent smaller workforce as of January 2025 as a result of departures from attrition, deferred resignation programs, early retirement offers, and other cuts made in compliance with directives from the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, compounded by the ongoing federal hiring freeze.[23] A smaller workforce, coupled with the hiring freeze, has made it impossible to expand TIP’s network of programs into critical technology areas. Congress must make it a priority to fund TIP fully and lift the hiring freeze for TIP.

Increase the importance of commercialization activities at federal labs and research institutes. America’s federal laboratories are insufficiently incentivized to invest time, energy, and resources in facilitating technology transfer, in large part because technology transfer is not even one of the eight main criteria in the Performance Evaluation and Management Plan (PEMP), a kind of annual report card for the federal labs.[24] Rather, PEMP treats successful transfers of technology to market as an afterthought. Elevating this important function to its own category would have significant impacts on the management of the labs and help to reverse the buildup of decades of skepticism and intransigence toward commercialization. Adding a ninth category to the PEMP for “Technology Impact” would create a mechanism to evaluate the economic impact of lab-developed technology, creating a stronger incentive for lab managers to focus on market implementation of valuable government IP assets and technical capabilities.[25]

Consider federal model IP agreements. Several states have implemented model intellectual property agreements, enabling faster, easier collaboration between universities and the private sector and streamlining the technology transfer process. Virginia, one of these states, announced its Lab-to-Launch initiative in August of this year, which will help university researchers and entrepreneurs in two key ways. First, the agreement standardizes the language in university IP agreements with start-ups, reducing the barriers and costs for entrepreneurs looking to commercialize their innovations. Start-ups that spin off from universities using these licenses are also eligible for awards of up to $50,000 toward their commercialization costs.[26]

Second, the bill creates an Entrepreneur-in-Residence program that connects university researchers with the private sector. This program will develop an online database of university IP, making it easier for private industry to find and engage with university researchers, reducing the cost and time required for collaboration.[27] The federal agreement should examine these model IP licensing agreements and evaluate if they could be helpful toward improving IP licensing practices, such as for IP coming out of national laboratories.

Expand DOE’s Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP). LEEP is designed to help early-stage innovative energy entrepreneurs take their product ideas to market with the collaboration of laboratory staff. LEEP programs have been developed at several national laboratories, including the Cyclotron Road program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The LEEP program has enabled scientific entrepreneurs to develop critical energy-specific technologies that would have been cost-prohibitive without funding from national laboratories. One study found that LEEP achieved a 92 percent success rate, with nearly 4,000 jobs created, 182 new businesses started, and 212 fellows supported.[28]

Other government agencies should adopt the LEEP program, expanding this opportunity beyond simply clean energy technologies. The Department of War could undertake LEEP programs to support entrepreneurial scientists in defense and security technologies, or the National Institutes of Health (NIH) could develop a similar program for individuals with innovative ideas in life sciences or biotechnology.

Empower the NSF Engineering Research Centers (ERC) program. NSF’s Engineering Research Center program (ERC) supports a network of 17 strategic university-industry partnerships that pursue high-risk, high-payoff research across almost the entire spectrum of technology fields—including advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, clean energy and sustainability, microelectronics, and information technology.[29] Since 1985, NSF has funded 83 ERCs that have led to more than 1,400 invention licenses, 920 patents, and 250 spinoff companies.[30] However, these partnerships do not require any industry funding match, reducing the likelihood that engineers trained in this program will be prepared with industry-specific skills or that research in these centers will be commercialized by private industry. Additionally, among the 17 ERCs currently funded by NSF, several are not focused on technologies used in globally traded industries, again reducing the applicability of the skills learned and the research conducted in these centers to the private sector.[31]

The administration should work to reform and expand this program. Given the goal of the ERC program to engage industry, it should be housed within the TIP directorate at NSF. Moving this program will also ensure that the ERC centers are aligned with the aforementioned 10 strategic key technology areas focused on by TIP.[32] Additionally, the framework for awarding funding under ERC should be adjusted. NSF should require that ERCs have at least half of their federal funding matched by industry. TIP should also ensure that existing and new ERCs more effectively coordinate with other similar federally funded programs. For example, NSF’s ERC for Cell Manufacturing Technologies should coordinate with the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing and Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL), as both conduct research on cell manufacturing, but with a lower-level TRL focus for the ERC and a higher-level focus for NIIMBL. Beyond these reforms, the administration should work with Congress to ensure at least $150 million in annual funding for the NSF ERC program, supporting both existing and new manufacturing-focused ERCs.

Expand the Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRC) program. The Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) program forges partnerships between universities and industry, featuring industrially relevant fundamental research, industrial support of and collaboration in research and education, and direct transfer of university-developed ideas, research results, and technology to U.S. industry to improve its competitive posture in global markets.[33] NSF currently operates IUCRCs in 10 different critical technologies, including advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, and information, communication, and computing.[34] As with the ERC program, the United States could get more out of the IUCRC program to support both the American scientific enterprise and U.S. industrial competitiveness. The IUCRC program should also be moved under the TIP directorate in NSF to ensure that IUCRC focus areas align with those designated by Congress as critical to U.S. competitiveness. Additionally, the Trump administration should work with Congress to provide annual funding for the IUCRC program that supports at least 15 more centers in critical commercial-ready technologies.

(iii) What policies would encourage the formation and scaling of regional innovation ecosystems that connect local businesses, universities, educational institutions, and the local workforce—particularly in areas where the Federal government has existing research assets like national laboratories or federally-funded research centers?

Expand the collaborative R&D Tax Credit. Growing sectors of the economy increasingly rely on collaborative research (e.g. research performed between a business and a university, federal lab, or consortium). Businesses are increasingly turning to universities, federal labs, and other external sources for research, allowing for the creation of top-ranked innovative commercial products. In response, U.S. allies and competitors are increasingly offering additional tax incentives to spur collaborative R&D. For example, Hungary offers a full expensing of all R&D costs conducted under collaboration with a university or research institution up to 500 million forints.[35] Japan offers a flat tax credit for collaborating with a university or research institution of up to 30 percent.[36]

Yet, the R&D tax credit—the principal way the government entices the private sector to invest more in R&D—falls short of effectively incentivizing research collaborations. To make the United States more competitive, Congress should create a collaborative R&D tax credit, eligible for all sectors. The United States currently provides a 20 percent credit for collaborative R&D, but it only applies to energy research. The administration should work with Congress to eliminate the energy restriction. Further, companies should be able to claim the R&D tax credit on 100 percent of the investments they make in R&D at U.S. universities; currently they’re only able to make a claim of up to 70 percent of their investment.

Reform Technology Hub Programs. In a 2019 report, “The Case for Growth Centers,” ITIF examined where innovation jobs are found in the U.S. economy, defining these as jobs in industries that have a specified level of R&D intensity and that employ a certain share of STEM workers. ITIF found that fully one-third of U.S. innovation jobs are concentrated in just 14 U.S. counties, and one-half in 40 counties.[37] This insight was part of the inspiration behind Congressional creation of the Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) Regional Tech Hubs program. EDA has designated 31 Tech Hubs and, in July 2024, released $504 million in Implementation awards for 12 of the 31 designated Tech Hubs.[38] The remaining 19 hubs should be fully funded.

Besides Congress not appropriating enough money, the program was poorly implemented. The Biden administration allowed NSF and the Department of Commerce (along with the Department of War and the Small Business Administration) to develop their own regional hub programs with no coordination, essentially spreading limited resources far too wide and thin. Moreover, many of the EDA awards are weak and likely to never become self-sufficient hubs once federal funding ends. Accordingly, the Trump administration should redo the competition, but this time fund fewer centers, make NSF and EDA develop a joint program, require industry investment, and ensure that winners could be self-sufficient.

(iv) How can federal policies strengthen the role played by small and medium-sized businesses as both drivers of innovation and as early adopters of emerging tech?

The Trump administration should work with Congress to get the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs reauthorized. The programs (enacted in 1982 and 1992, respectively) have grown to become the federal government’s most impactful programs and largest sources of early-stage capital for technology commercialization, allowing U.S.-owned and operated small businesses to engage in R&D activity that has a strong potential for commercialization.[39] SBIR sets aside 3.25 percent of R&D funding from 11 federal agencies (all those with R&D budgets greater than $100 million annually), providing about $2.5 billion annually to support small businesses engaging in R&D with commercialization potential.

SBIR accounts for only 3 percent of federal extramural research funding, yet numerous studies have documented the program’s tremendous contributions to the U.S. innovation economy. Since the program’s inception, it has distributed over $40 billion in funding, which has contributed to the generation of over 70,000 patents and 700 public companies.[40] On average, SBIR-supported companies receive 10 patents each day—a testament to the innovative prowess of the more than 450,000 engineers and scientists working in companies that have been SBIR-supported.[41] Companies launched in part with SBIR support feature a “who’s who” of some of America’s most successful innovators, including 23andMe, Amgen, Apple, Biogen, Jarvik Heart, LIFT Labs, Millennium Pharma, Qualcomm, Symantec, iRobot, and countless others.[42]

Congressional policymakers failed to reauthorize the program before its expiration on September 30, 2025, leaving the future of large-scale small business and startup success in jeopardy. Congress should reauthorize the programs in new legislation while addressing some obvious issues, such as so-called SBIR mills, or companies that have become dependent on SBIR awards as a primary business model. For instance, Congress could cap the number of proposals any single small business may submit in response to any single Phase I or Phase II solicitation to no more than three proposals across the firm or limit businesses to no more than 25 proposals per year across all SBIR and STTR solicitations.[43] Congress could also cap the total award amount that a firm may receive from SBIR grants to $75 million.

Expand the use of innovation vouchers. The administration should consider working with Congress to expand the availability of innovation vouchers for small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Innovation vouchers are grants that enable SMEs to purchase services from universities, research institutions, or federal labs to stimulate innovation. These services may include assistance with conducting R&D, technology feasibility assessments, overcoming specific product development hurdles, product prototyping, lab validation, or other activities that are difficult for smaller businesses to undertake. Many innovation voucher programs have been adopted at the state level in the United States, including in Connecticut, New York, and New Mexico, as well as internationally in many European nations and Canada. In the United States, vouchers range from $25,000 to $50,000, while in Europe they range from €10,000 to €25,000.[44]

Innovation vouchers foster greater levels of the industry-academic collaboration necessary for knowledge transfer, while introducing SMEs to continuous R&D and innovation practices. As firms become more comfortable conducting R&D, the time required for product commercialization is reduced, inducing greater economic benefits.[45]

For the past several years, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have provided technical assistance to the recipients of Department of Energy (DOE) -funded voucher programs, namely American-Made Challenges (AMC), the Incubator Program, and the Small Business Vouchers Program. This effort should be fully built out into a national program across the clean energy focused federal labs to drive strong relationships between entrepreneurs and the national labs to accelerate the roll-out of new technologies in U.S. clean energy sectors such as electric vehicle (EV) batteries and solar cells.[46]

Expand the availability of Manufacturing Reinvestment Account. In Connecticut, small manufacturers receive a manufacturing reinvestment account, similar to a 401(k), where they may invest up to $100,000 of profits annually over five years. These accounts are 100 percent tax-exempt and may only be used for R&D-related expenses. Implementing these accounts on the federal level would allow small manufacturers to more easily afford R&D activities, with minimal cost to the government.[47]

(v) What empirically grounded findings from metascience research and progress studies could inform the federal grantmaking process to maximize ROI? Please provide specific examples of evidence-based reforms that could improve funding allocation, peer review, or grant evaluation.

A growing body of metascience studies can inform two key points of the federal grantmaking system: what and how it funds.

1. What the federal government funds:

(a) Longer, flexible, investigator-focused grants increase breakthrough output

Empirical evidence:

Azoulay et al. (2011) compare Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator awards—long-term, flexible grants that tolerate early failure—to NIH R01 awards, which are shorter, milestone-driven, and more risk averse. The study finds that HHMI investigators produce high-impact articles at significantly higher rates than comparable NIH-funded scientists.[48]

Potential reform:

Dedicate a defined share of NIH/NSF extramural budgets (e.g., 10-20 percent) to investigator-focused awards that offer longer terms, flexible budgets, and broader mission statements rather than narrow specific aims. This operationalizes the principle of funding people, not just projects, which empirical evidence suggests yields more transformative science.

2. How the federal government decides what to fund: Improving peer review

(a) Funding more highly novel projects

Empirical evidence:

A metascience review of existing studies found that standard peer review is biased against highly novel or interdisciplinary proposals, which are routinely penalized by reviewers, as reviewers discount ideas that are too unfamiliar or interdisciplinary (See: Tartari and Kolympiris, 2021; Ayoubi et al., 2021; Boudreau et al., 2016; Lane et al., 2021).[49]

Potential reform:

Create dedicated high-novelty tracks at NIH/NSF with panels explicitly instructed to reward novelty and be more tolerant of failure, evaluation frameworks that expect a mix of failures and successes, and a committed budget share for high-risk, high-reward proposals.

(b) Partial randomization to increase fairness when reviewer scores converge

Empirical evidence:

Research shows that in the mid-range, where many proposals are essentially indistinguishable in quality, reviewers are faced with the difficult task of selecting among these, which increases the risk of arbitrary decisions not based on scientific criteria that opens the door to biases. Partial randomization (lotteries) in this zone of proposals, complementing peer review, could provide an unbiased measure of fairness without harming scientific quality.[50]

Potential reform:

Implement tiered review in large NIH/NSF programs:

▪ Tier 1: Clearly outstanding, top rated, proposals—fund normally.

▪ Tier 2: All proposals above a quality threshold but not clearly rankable—enter into a lottery.

▪ Tier 3: Clearly noncompetitive—do not fund.

Start with pilots (e.g., small programs) and rigorously evaluate outcomes relative to traditional peer-reviewed programs.

(vi) What reforms will enable the American scientific enterprise to pursue more high-risk, high-reward research that could transform our scientific understanding and unlock new tech, while sustaining the incremental science essential for cumulative production of knowledge?

Create megafunds for high risk R&D. In 1960, private-sector R&D was split one-third to research and two-thirds to development. Today, only one-fifth of firm R&D goes to research. One reason companies are moving away from basic and applied research is because of the risk involved in financing. In drug development, for example, it often takes years or decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to produce a profitable product. Individual companies and even venture capitalists often lack the appetite for such long-term, high-risk, high-reward investments.

This risk could be mitigated through large portfolios that aggregate and manage risk. Mutual funds, pension funds, and 401(k) retirement accounts work this way, and MIT economist Andrew Lo has proposed extending this idea by establishing “megafunds” that utilize financial engineering techniques to fund R&D in long-term, high-risk, high-payoff areas such as drug discovery for cancer or orphan diseases.[51] However, to date, no such megafunds have been created by the market. The government incentives required for the creation of these funds could include one or more approaches from four broad categories: research and investment data streams; clear rules for private foundation program-related megafund investments; federal credit support; and tax incentives for funds investing in technologies with high societal impact (for example through the establishment of schedules and values of basis point step-ups and penalties).

To promote the creation of R&D megafunds, the Trump administration should establish an office within the Department of Commerce to develop and implement the needed incentives and oversight. The office would be tasked with establishing the rules for the funds and coordinating with federal agencies and the private sector to identify the technical areas of national interest where private-sector engagement is needed and the incentives required. The office should work with researchers, industry, and regulators to develop data-reporting and transparency standards that promote the translation of research to the market, provide a better understanding of the societal benefits of research, and an efficient data stream for regulation, and coordinate with federal funding agencies to enforce the provision and collection of such data.[52]

Continue to support the existing HRHR programs across government. Several government agencies have programs designed to fund HRHR research, which often have high costs but can yield high ROI. The NIH Common Fund includes an HRHR portfolio designed to invest solely in these more expensive investments, and the several ARPA offices in the DOE, Department of War, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Transportation have a similar purpose. The administration should refrain from cutting these programs as a short-term cost-saving measure and instead focus on the long-term returns they provide. The Trump administration should continue to empower these agencies to fund HRHR research.

(vii) How can the federal government support novel institutional models for research that complement traditional university structures and enable projects that require vast resources, interdisciplinary coordination, or an extended timeline?

The Financial Accountability in Research Model (FAIR). Under the current federal research funding mechanism for research institutions, institutions are paid for their research costs under two different categories: direct research costs, which include the cost of project materials, researchers, and payments to research participants, and indirect research costs, including the costs of utilities, leases, operations, and other facility expenses supporting research activities. Indirect costs are paid to the institution at a negotiated reimbursement rate that has not been adjusted in recent years and therefore does not account for the increase in regulatory and administrative costs for researchers. Thus, researchers are often reimbursed far below the true value of indirect research costs, placing an extra financial burden on research institutions.[53]

The Financial Accountability in Research (FAIR) Model improves on the current system by requiring all research institutions to classify all costs for each project they undertake as research performance costs (formerly direct costs) and essential research performance support and general research operations (formerly indirect costs). These changes increase the transparency for the government by outlining exactly what services are being funded, and ensures that research institutions are funded for their complete research costs, rather than just a small fraction. The administration should work with Congress to implement the FAIR Model for all agencies that award grant funding.[54]

Focused Research Organizations (FROs). Traditional academic structures excel at investigator-driven discovery but struggle with projects that require large-scale coordination, extended timelines, or shared research infrastructure. Novel institutional models could fill this gap. The federal government can support Focused Research Organizations (FROs)—non-profit entities designed to tackle large, complex research challenges and produce public goods (tools, datasets, platforms) and fall outside the scope of a single academic lab, company, or informal consortium.[55]

Historical examples include the Large Hadron Collider and the Human Genome Project—efforts too large and too uncertain for individual labs or early-stage companies, not immediately lucrative enough for industry to undertake, yet essential for scientific progress.[56]

In biopharma, FROs could tackle pre-competitive challenges too big for one company. One current example, supported by Convergent Research, an incubator for FROs, aims to map the pharmome—identifying all unintended targets of approved small-molecule drugs.[57] The public benefits include better safety pharmacology profiling, new drug repurposing opportunities, and better training data for AI drug development models.

NSF’s initiative, Tech Labs, announced December 12, 2025 to launch and scale a new generation of transformative independent research organizations to advance breakthrough science is an important step in this direction.[58] Most federal science funding takes the form of small, project-based grants to individual scientists at universities, but a more diversified funding portfolio, with initiatives such as Tech Labs (with $10-50 million/year awards per team, 5+ year commitments, and measuring impact through advancement up the Tech Readiness Level scale rather than papers published) is key as research today is increasingly team-based, interdisciplinary, and infrastructure-intensive, needing institutional support, and cannot be done only through the traditional funding model of a series of grant projects.

(viii) How can the Federal government leverage and prepare for advances in AI systems that may transform scientific research—including automated hypothesis generation, experimental design, literature synthesis, and autonomous experimentation? What infrastructure investments, organizational models, and workforce development strategies are needed to realize these capabilities while maintaining scientific rigor and research integrity?

One of the most effective ways the federal government can prepare for AI-driven advances in scientific research is by ensuring that emerging automation capabilities are translated into widely usable research infrastructure. A key priority should be supporting the adoption of self-driving labs (SDLs), which use AI and robotics to autonomously design, execute, and interpret experiments. SDLs directly increase scientific productivity by replacing slow, manual trial-and-error workflows with automated experimental loops. This is especially important in materials science, where progress remains rate-limited by the need to fabricate and test large numbers of physical samples because material behavior cannot be reliably predicted in advance. By automating experimentation and continuously feeding results back into models, SDLs allow researchers to explore larger design spaces more quickly while generating standardized, reproducible data.

While promising SDL systems already exist, ensuring their broad adoption as routine research infrastructure will require sustained public support. Materials science, in particular, has seen slower diffusion than related fields such as chemistry, where automated synthesis and high-throughput experimentation are more established. This reflects the long timelines from discovery to deployment in materials, which reduce private incentives to invest in capital-intensive automation despite large long-term returns. Targeted public funding can ensure these capabilities scale.

Policymakers should ensure broad adoption by pursuing public funding models that de-risk early deployment and make self-driving labs accessible beyond a small number of well-resourced institutions. One approach is an ARPA-E–style Grand Challenge that competitively funds teams to build and demonstrate SDLs capable of delivering measurable advances in materials discovery. This would accelerate technical progress while establishing proof points for SDLs as durable national infrastructure. In parallel, policymakers should support Focused Research Organizations to develop modular, open-source hardware and software components that lower costs, enable interoperability, and make SDLs easier to replicate and adapt across labs. Together, these models would move SDLs from isolated demonstrations into widely usable research infrastructure.

(ix) What specific federal statutes, regulations, or policies create unnecessary barriers to scientific research or the deployment of research outcomes? Please describe the barrier, its impact on scientific progress, and potential remedies that would preserve legitimate policy objectives while enabling innovation?

Develop a Phase Zero grant award program within major federal research agencies. When the SBIR and STTR programs were still active, they both supported innovation, but required high approval standards for early-stage companies. There was often insufficient funding available at universities (or from other sources) to advance nascent technologies to the point at which these companies were positioned to receive an SBIR or STTR grant. The problem was that researchers and universities lacked the resources to support the proof-of-concept work, market analysis, and mentoring needed to translate ideas and nascent technologies from the university laboratory into a commercial product.

A national “Phase Zero” proof-of-concept program would not only help more projects cross the “valley of death,” but would also help enhance the infrastructure (e.g., expertise, personnel, support, small business, and venture capital engagement) and facilitate the cultural change necessary for universities, federal laboratories, and other non-profit research organizations to support commercialization activities.

America’s competitors have recognized the need for such an instrument. For instance, the European Research Council (ERC) has announced a new proof-of-concept funding initiative to help bridge the gap between ERC-funded research and the earliest stage of marketable innovations.[59] These awards can be as high as $215,000 for individual researchers, in total, equivalent to about 1 percent of ERC’s budget.[60] Here in the United States, the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation has established Translational Research (for individual researchers) and Translational Partnership (for institutions) Awards for proof-of-concept research in biomedical engineering.[61] The Translational Research Awards are made in amounts of approximately $100,000 per year, while the university grants have a duration of five years at over $500,000 per year.

Similarly, NIH’s Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) program fosters the development of therapeutics, preventatives, diagnostics, devices, and tools that address diseases within NIH’s mission in a manner consistent with business case development. The work supported by the REACH program may include technical validation, market research, clarification of IP position and strategy, and investigation of commercial or business opportunities.[62] Finally, a number of states, such as Kentucky and Louisiana, have developed Phase Zero grants to help firms apply for SBIR grants and support early proof-of-concept research. One way for the federal government to implement such a proof-of-concept program would be through a grant program for states that agree to match the funds dollar-for-dollar.

(x) How can Federal programs better identify and develop scientific talent across the country, particularly leveraging digital tools and distributed research models to engage researchers outside traditional academic centers?

If the United States is to significantly revitalize America’s scientific enterprise, it needs to take further steps to ensure it has the workforce to support expanded U.S. scientific and technical output. That’s especially the case as analysts expect the demand for tech talent to grow to 7.1 million tech jobs by 2034 in the United States, from an estimated six million in 2023.[63] Another report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) finds that, by the end of 2030, an estimated 3.85 million additional jobs requiring proficiency in technical fields will be created in the United States, but that, “Of those, 1.4 million jobs risk going unfilled unless we can expand the pipeline for such workers in fields such as skilled technicians, engineering, and computer science.”[64] For the semiconductor industry, the report estimates that roughly 67,000—or 58 percent of projected new jobs (and 80 percent of projected new technical jobs)—risk going unfilled at current degree completion rates.[65] The administration should lead in several efforts to enhance U.S. workforce skilling, including:

Expand Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program funding. Skilled technicians are a key component of the traded sector workforce. One highly successful program designed to build technician skills is NSF’s Advanced Technological Education program, which supports community colleges working in partnership with industry, economic development agencies, workforce investment boards, and secondary and other higher education institutions.[66] ATE projects and centers are educating technicians in a range of fields, including nanotechnologies and microtechnologies, rapid prototyping, biomanufacturing, logistics, and alternative fuel automobiles. Notwithstanding this, ATE funding is quite small, at approximately $74 million in FY 2025.[67] The Trump administration should work with Congress to double ATE funding to at least $150 million per year.

Expand the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP). The engineering curricula at too many American universities is overly academic as opposed to industry focused. Indeed, university engineering programs have evolved in two troubling directions over the past several decades. First, the focus on “engineering as a science” has increasingly moved university engineering education away from a focus on real problem solving toward more abstract engineering science. Second, this focus on “engineering as a science” has left university engineering departments more concerned with producing pure knowledge than working with industry to help them solve real problems.

That’s why ITIF has argued that the United States needs more “manufacturing universities,” which would revamp their engineering programs and focus much more on manufacturing engineering and in particular work that is more relevant to industry. This would include more joint industry-university research projects, more student training that incorporates manufacturing experiences through co-ops or other programs, and a Ph.D. education program focused on turning out more engineering graduates who work in industry. These universities would view Ph.D.s as akin to high-level apprenticeships (as they often are in Germany), where industry experience is required as part of the degree. Likewise, criteria for faculty tenure would consider professors’ work with and/or in industry as much as their number of scholarly publications. In addition, these universities’ business schools would integrate closely with engineering and focus on manufacturing issues, including management of production.

One model for these manufacturing universities is the Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts, which reimagined engineering education and curriculum to prepare students “to become exemplary engineering innovators who recognize needs, design solutions, and engage in creative enterprises for the good of the world.”[68]

Congress implemented a form of these proposals when it passed the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program into law in December 2016 as part of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), authorizing the Department of Defense to support industry-relevant, manufacturing-focused, engineering training at U.S. institutions of higher education, universities, industry, and not-for-profit institutions. With its $48 million in initial funding, MEEP made awards to 13 educational and industry partners to bring educational opportunities to Americans interested in learning manufacturing skills critical to sustaining the U.S. defense innovation base.[69] In 2023, MEEP issued additional three-year funding grants “that establish programs or enhance existing programs to better position the manufacturing workforce to produce military systems and components that assure technological superiority for DoD.”[70]

MEEP can be a powerful initiative, but it is underfunded and has become too solely focused on engineering in the national defense context. Therefore, the Administration should work with Congress to broaden the MEEP remit to refocus it more on supporting industry-relevant, applied engineering programs at leading universities. Congress should allocate $150 million annually to a revitalized MEEP program that would make grants to 20 engineering programs at leading U.S. universities to redirect them toward more hands-on, industrially relevant engineering activities.

(xi) How can the fed government foster closer collaboration among scientists, engineers, and skilled technical workers, and better integrate training pathways, recognizing that breakthrough research often requires deep collaboration between theoretical and applied expertise?

Establish an Office of Innovation Review. Because federal agencies often propose regulations with little consideration given to their effect on innovation, Congress should task the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs with creating an Office of Innovation Review (OIR) to review proposed regulations to determine their effect not just on costs in the short term but also on innovation over the long term. OIR would have the specific mission of being the “innovation champion” within agency rule-making processes.[71] It would have authority to push agencies to either affirmatively promote innovation or to achieve a particular regulatory objective in a manner least damaging to innovation. OIR would be authorized to propose new agency actions and to respond to existing ones and could incorporate a “competitiveness screen” in its review of federal regulations that affect globally traded industries.[72]

(xii) What policy mechanisms would ensure that the benefits of federally-funded research, including access to resulting tech, economic opportunities, and improved quality of life, reach all Americans?

Withdraw the NIH Intramural Research Program Access Planning Policy. On January 10, 2025, in one of the Biden administration’s final actions, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued an Intramural Research Program (IRP) Access Planning Policy whose objective was to “expand equitable patient access to products that emerge from NIH-owned patents.”[73] The directive required “organizations applying to NIH for certain commercial patent licenses to submit Access Plans to NIH outlining steps they intend to take to promote patient access to those licensed products.”[74] Pricing was a central focus of the Access Planning Policy, the guidance noting that ways applicants could “promote equitable access and affordability in product deployment” could include by “Committing to keep prices in the U.S. equal to those in other developed countries” or by “Committing to price reductions once preset sales, revenue, or profit thresholds are reached.”[75]

But bringing a drug to market represents a complex, risky, lengthy, and costly process that can take 14 or more years at costs measured in the billions of dollars. The notion that a small start-up licensing prospective IP in the form of a novel chemical compound from a university is in any kind of position to reliably price a potentially resulting product over a decade and hundreds of millions, if not billions, in further development and clinical trials costs is simply not realistic. (And the same goes for many products beyond drugs.) Requiring licensees to accurately predict years in advance how a product resulting from a licensed IP would be priced would stifle U.S. biopharmaceutical innovation. Therefore, the Trump administration should direct the NIH to withdraw its Intramural Research Program Access Planning Policy and also ensure that similar requirements aren’t promulgated across other federal agencies.[76]

The advancement of transformative scientific breakthroughs requires more than robust R&D funding—it also depends on a comprehensive policy framework that supports both innovation and timely deployment.

Innovative U.S. companies have pioneered the breakthrough technology of multi-cancer early detection (MCED), developing diagnostic tests that can reliably screen for the presence of more than 50 types of cancer from a simple blood draw. MCED is poised to transform the world’s cancer screening paradigm—which is vitally important when one in two women, and one in three men, are likely to develop cancer at some point in their lifetimes.[77] Unfortunately, the United States has lagged in crafting a policy environment supporting MCED adoption and encouraging innovation.

Current Medicare statutes create the most significant barrier to deployment of breakthrough medical technologies by requiring explicit congressional authorization for each new category of preventive screening, regardless of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval status. For MCED technologies this statutory gap prevents Medicare beneficiaries from accessing FDA-approved tests despite their transformative potential. The barrier’s impact extends beyond patient access: it weakens incentives for continued private-sector investment in high-risk medical research and risks ceding American leadership in precision medicine to foreign competitors, namely China.[78]

The United States simply can’t afford to squander its lead in MCED by allowing regulatory roadblocks to remain in the way of the industry’s further development. The bipartisan Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act (H.R. 842/S.339) offers a practical remedy by establishing an evidence-based pathway for coverage of FDA-approved breakthrough technologies while preserving CMS’s authority to determine appropriate coverage parameters. These reforms are consistent with the approach taken by Congress with colonoscopy screening—which ultimately paved the way for tremendous progress America has achieved in the screening of colon cancers. Importantly they would maintain rigorous safety and efficacy standards while eliminating arbitrary delays that currently separate regulatory approval from patient access, thereby strengthening the entire innovation ecosystem from basic research through clinical deployment.

(xiii) How can the federal gov strengthen research security to protect sensitive technologies and dual-use research while minimizing compliance burdens on researchers?

Create tiered risk categorizations for technologies. In practice, the current system for research security often relies on broad, compliance-heavy requirements that are not consistently tiered to the actual sensitivity of the research or the threat environment. The federal government does not use a single, unified definition of “sensitive technology” or “dual-use”; instead, it operationalizes sensitivity through multiple, partially overlapping regimes. The current model defines these categories primarily through export-control lists (the Export Administration Regulation’s Commerce Control List and the International Traffic in Arms’s U.S. Munitions List) and a few domain-specific oversight regimes (e.g., the U.S. Government Policy for Oversight of Dual-use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential in the life sciences). However, these mechanisms are anchored mainly to known items, agents, or reasonably foreseeable misuse pathways, rather than systematically tiering basic research areas by how they might become dual-use over time; this can leave emerging risks underappreciated, and some disciplines may not view themselves as part of the research/security problem set.

The centralization of risks through tiered categorization is needed precisely because of the political economy in scientific communities and research organizations/universities. There is little incentive to self-assess that basic research, far away from practical dual-use applications, can build rival countries’ capacities. Yet, this happens in practice. For example, basic research on how bacteria defend themselves from viruses helped enable CRISPR gene editing, which is now widely treated as biosecurity-relevant because it can lower barriers to modifying organisms, including potentially harmful ones; likewise, open computer-vision and machine-learning research has been incorporated into military intelligence/surveillance and targeting support.

Develop security assessment guidelines. Research scrutiny is heavily focused on projects that receive federal funding, but most R&D is driven by private investment. Although screening and organizational risk assessments for defense contractors generally work as intended, they tend to overlook private R&D in areas with capabilities that could be used for dual purposes but are currently business-oriented. For example, robotics for household use or software-heavy R&D.

A simple solution to this problem would be to introduce security assessment guidelines for companies applying for the widely used R&D tax incentive. In other words, to qualify for tax benefits for private R&D, applicants should meet a basic set of security standards, such as those established by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Department of Homeland Security.

Assemble the interagency research security working group. The interagency research security working group was established under the National Science and Technology Council and authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 to enforce the continued implementation of NSPM-33, which instituted requirements for disclosure and research security infrastructure for research recipients. OSTP should regularly convene the interagency research security working group to ensure that NSPM-33 continues to be implemented across all government agencies and that security measures are coordinated and harmonized across government.

Another potentially effective research security model would borrow from cybersecurity concepts to shift away from today’s largely binary, front-loaded approach to vetting researchers and move toward a more robust endpoint security and zero-trust architecture model. Currently, universities assess research security risk most heavily at the hiring stage, which requires high amounts of compliance and often results in a go/no-go decision that either blocks talent entirely or assumes low risks thereafter.

A zero-trust–inspired framework could instead allow broader participation while segmenting access based on risk and sensitivity, asking explicitly what data, tools, or research outputs a university is comfortable exposing if compromised. This means continuous checks throughout the research lifecycle, including in the laboratory, collaborations, access, and offboarding, rather than concentrating compliance on individual disclosures. Such an approach would reduce friction for researchers and might increase overall compliance resources, but would better shift that responsibility to universities without choking off openness or talent.

Conclusion

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation commends the Trump administration for working to reform and accelerate the American scientific enterprise. The success of this effort will be vital to enhancing the global competitiveness of U.S. science and technology over the coming decade.

Economic fragmentation is driving countries to prioritize national security and resilience. Heavy industries, such as manufacturing and data centers, require dispatchable, reliable energy sources that operate 24/7. These demands are reshaping energy both domestically and abroad.

The U.S. is uniquely positioned to adapt to these changes. Its geographical advantages, including resource-rich neighbors like Canada and access to low-cost labor in the south, create a strong North American economic bloc. Combined with abundant natural resources, such as a vast supply of natural gas, the U.S. has the foundation for reindustrialization and energy independence.

In contrast, Europe faces several significant energy vulnerabilities. The continent’s lack of natural resources and reliance on imports make it susceptible to energy shocks. While renewables advance environmental goals, they cannot meet the demands of heavy industries, accelerating Europe’s deindustrialization.

Meanwhile, China pursues an ""all-of-the-above"" energy strategy, investing in coal, nuclear, and renewables, while forging ties with resource-rich nations. However, inefficiencies in its state-controlled system, coupled with politically motivated policies, and the health of its domestic economy without a US consumption partner to trade with raise concerns about the long-term sustainability and efficiency of its energy approach.

America’s market-driven energy system offers a structural advantage over state-controlled models. Efficient resource allocation and abundant natural gas provide a reliable bridge fuel for heavy industry. At the same time, strong infrastructure supports growth despite fiscal challenges, and the U.S. is better equipped to handle the energy demands of heavy industry. To maintain this edge, U.S. policy must focus on reliability and affordability. The demand for dense, reliable energy transcends political divides. To drive reindustrialization, the U.S. must prioritize natural gas and nuclear energy as central components of its energy strategy. While renewables like solar and wind can play a complementary role, they cannot replace firm baseload power required for heavy industry. Reviving nuclear is critical to deliver 24/7, high-capacity energy.

As the world shifts to a multipolar economic system, technologies like AI are unlocking vast opportunities. By securing reliable energy, strengthening supply chains, and committing to long-term investments, the U.S. can solidify its global leadership. Businesses and investors who grasp these dynamics may be well-positioned to thrive in this new era of global competition.",https://www.williamblair.com/-/media/williamblairwebsite/feature/insights/2025/eqr_close-up-earth-image.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:40.939026

The report, Clean Energy Across America, by Environment Massachusetts Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group, provides tips and policy recommendations to help more Americans adopt clean energy, even as federal tax credits phase out.
“Clean energy adoption in Massachusetts is a movement hiding in plain sight.” Local homeowners Nicole Barna and Dudley Wyman are among the growing number of Bay Staters opting into clean energy.
“Hundreds of thousands of Bay Staters are already using clean energy in their lives in some way,” Pappas said.
“This report shows that millions of Americans are moving forward to reduce the impact of their energy use on the environment”, said Massachusetts State Representative Steven Owens.","Boston – Environmental advocates gathered at a home powered by clean energy in Cambridge on Wednesday, to highlight a recent report showing that hundreds of thousands of Bay Staters have incorporated clean energy technologies into their lives. The report, Clean Energy Across America, by Environment Massachusetts Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group, provides tips and policy recommendations to help more Americans adopt clean energy, even as federal tax credits phase out.

“From Cape Cod to the Berkshires, Bay Staters have invested their own time and money to install solar panels on their roofs, put EVs in their driveways, or buy clean energy from their utilities,” said Joseph Pappas, Campaign Associate with Environment Massachusetts Research & Policy Center. “Clean energy adoption in Massachusetts is a movement hiding in plain sight.”

Local homeowners Nicole Barna and Dudley Wyman are among the growing number of Bay Staters opting into clean energy. Barna and Wyman live in a “passive home” powered by an array of solar panels. Their home features efficient electric heat pumps to heat and cool their home, chargers to power their electric vehicles, and other energy efficiency features.

“On an annual basis, our solar array has produced more electricity than we have consumed”, said Nicole Barna. “This energy surplus has come back to us in the form of rebates, ensuring a win/win for our wallet and the environment.”

To help more Americans reduce energy waste and switch to renewables, the report offers resources, including guides for home winterization and how to go solar, and tips for buying a used EV.

“Hundreds of thousands of Bay Staters are already using clean energy in their lives in some way,” Pappas said. “Common-sense steps can make it easier and more affordable for Americans to adopt clean energy.”

One way Massachusetts can help more residents adopt renewable energy is to encourage or require local jurisdictions to use “smart permitting” online platforms for residential solar and energy storage systems. These platforms, used in many states across the country, make it faster, easier and cheaper for residents who want to put solar on their roofs, or batteries in their garage or basement, to do so.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said.
A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.
The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO.
“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill’s chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

“Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,” said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. “Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,” said Jason Grumet, the group’s CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment …. has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, “we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill’s co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure “gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win” on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,” said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,” Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy … expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.”

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,” said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,” he said.

House approval of the permitting measure shifts focus to the Senate, where a broader deal that includes changes to the Clean Water Act to facilitate pipeline projects and transmission lines is being considered.

Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, also are pursuing legislation to make it harder for President Donald Trump to cancel permits for clean-energy projects.",https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2025/12/69447067dc81c6.26060837.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-18 20:58:22.131440

The Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a lawsuit in Louisiana’s 38th judicial district against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy.

The environmental groups say that the agency “violated its constitutional, statutory and regulatory duties,” as well as the court’s previous judgment when it reissued a permit for the construction of Commonwealth LNG’s export facility on the coast of Cameron Parish.

​​“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.

“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club managing attorney.

Huber said the Department of Conservation and Energy “is attempting to shrug off its responsibility” by relying on studies done by other agencies— the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission— rather than doing its own analysis.

The lawsuit is the latest in back-and-forth between regulators, environmentalists and industry as the liquified natural gas industry pursues its expansion along the Gulf Coast.

Louisiana district judge Penelope Richard ruled in a surprise move in October that the state agency did not adequately consider the effects of climate change and impacts to environmental justice communities nearby the planned facility when it issued its first permit to Commonwealth LNG.

About a month later, the state reissued the permit, citing the need for haste in part to align with the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda.

The goal is to fund programs that will find and remove lead service lines that deliver drinking water to communities.

As part of its process, the EPA collected updated lead service line data and released a new dashboard that shows the latest data on lead service lines in the United States. The data for this dashboard comes from the EPA’s Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR), which required, among other things, that public water systems provide a service line inventory to their primary state agency by October 16, 2024.

The LCRR submissions required that service lines be categorized as follows: lead service lines or pipes made from lead; galvanized pipes requiring replacement or pipes made from galvanized steel; non-lead service lines, and water service lines made with unknown materials. Note: Galvanized pipes requiring replacement under the guidelines were treated as lead service lines, as lead can adhere to galvanized steel lines.

According to Reuters, Ford Motor is taking a $19.5 billion write-down and is removing several electric-vehicle (EV) models from its line-up, as the auto industry retreats from battery-powered models in response to weakened EV demand and the Trump administration’s policies. GM and Stellantis have already shifted more of their production to combustion engine vehicles, also taking financial hits. GM wrote down $1.6 billion in EV assets and indicated that more write-downs are expected. Due to the push for electric vehicles by Western governments, automakers overestimated their demand and are now making a detour to correct the costly error.

Sales of new electric vehicles in the United States, especially more expensive models, have slowed since the beginning of 2024. The Trump administration rolled back financial incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by removing tax credits at the end of the fiscal year, further depressing sales. The administration is also modifying automobile efficiency standards from those approved by the Biden administration to eliminate the requirement forcing EV purchases.

Companies Will Continue with EV Production at a Reduced Level

According to Reuters, Ford will switch production at a new factory in Tennessee to gas-powered pickup truck models from electric models, cancel an electric commercial van model, remake the F-150 Lightning vehicle into a hybrid from a pure electric vehicle; and convert its Kentucky EV-battery factory into a battery-storage business for utilities, wind- and solar-power developers, and data centers that train artificial intelligence. It is also planning to build a medium electric truck with a $30,000 price target by 2027 to be competitive with Chinese automakers. That was the first in a line of low-cost electric vehicles. CBS News reports that, by 2030, Ford expects about half its global volume to consist of hybrids, extended-range vehicles, and electric vehicles, up from 17% this year. Hybrids are believed to be more affordable and practical to consumers who are wary of pure electric vehicles due to their high sticker prices, worries over battery range, and access to charging stations.

Western vehicle makers are aware of the competitive threat posed by Chinese EV automakers, whose models are popular at home and abroad. U.S. automakers see Americans want smaller, affordable EV models like those made by Chinese automakers and sold outside the United States. Currently, Chinese vehicles are banned from U.S. markets because of tariffs. Ford’s changes are expected to put it on a better footing to compete with Chinese automakers.

Besides the $19.5 billion write-down Ford is taking, its EV losses since 2023 have totaled $13 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, making its total EV junket at least a $32.5 billion mistake. American automobile buyers were charged more for their gas and diesel vehicle purchases to help pay for the misguidance of automakers producing electric vehicles, with overall vehicle prices hitting new heights. Many Americans felt vehicles were becoming unaffordable.

Via Electrek, GM is halting production of its electric vehicles due to slower EV industry growth and customer demand. Production of the Cadillac Lyriq and larger Vistiq, both of which are built at a Spring Hill, Tennessee facility, will be reduced during the first five months of 2026. GM plans to suspend one of its two shifts at the facility, resulting in layoffs for workers on the second shift. GM is also delaying the start of a second shift at its Fairfax assembly plant outside of Kansas City “indefinitely,” where the new Chevy Bolt EV was scheduled to enter production this year. GM also plans to slow production of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ at its Factory Zero plant in Detroit.

Automakers Turn to Producing Energy Storage Batteries

According to the Wall Street Journal, automakers and battery manufacturers are repurposing electric-vehicle battery plants to serve the fast-growing data-center and utility markets, as slowing EV demand pushes companies to seek alternative revenue streams. General Motors, South Korean conglomerate LG, and Chrysler parent Stellantis have shifted toward producing batteries for energy-storage systems to help offset the downturn in electric-vehicle sales.

Tesla has already built a sizable business in the segment, generating billions of dollars in sales from energy-storage batteries. Revenue from its energy-generation and storage division, which also includes solar panels, rose 67% last year to $4 billion, partially cushioning a $6 billion decline in EV revenue.

GM is also exploring a partnership to supply energy-storage batteries to Redwood Materials, a battery-recycling startup. Under the proposed arrangement, GM would provide Redwood with a mix of new and used batteries for large-scale storage projects. Meanwhile, a Chinese-owned battery manufacturer that had planned to supply Mercedes-Benz is now considering pivoting to energy-storage products in an effort to revive a stalled factory project in Kentucky.

U.S. electricity demand is growing again due to demand from artificial intelligence data centers, manufacturing, and increased electrification, which was pushed by the Biden administration and continues to be pushed in blue states. These factors make energy storage a growing business.

Europe Waters Down Its Ban on New Gas-Powered Vehicles

As reported by the BBC, the European Union has watered down its ban on new gas-powered vehicles, easing rules approved two years ago that required all new vehicles sold from 2035 onward to have zero carbon emissions, which would have effectively barred the sale of hybrid vehicles as well as traditional internal combustion engines. Instead, it is using a strict emissions cap that leaves room for gas and hybrid models. Instead of a 100% tailpipe carbon dioxide reduction target in 2035, it has a 90% fleet reduction. The change still forces automakers to sell mostly zero-emission vehicles, but it opens a path for a small number of plug-in hybrids and highly efficient combustion cars, particularly those that can run on certified carbon dioxide-neutral e-fuels or advanced biofuels.

Analysis

The so-called EV revolution is beginning to stall as automakers repurpose their EV production capacity in favor of gas-powered vehicles and batteries for energy storage. Slowing EV sales and the removal of subsidies and mandates by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have signaled to these manufacturers that their efforts are better served by meeting consumer demand rather than government incentives. Even in Europe, politicians are starting to realize that forcing automakers to sell only EVs would raise prices and force consumers to drive cars that can’t travel as far.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bigstock-Vilnius-Lithuania-July-459514845.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 18:02:10.624909

These wins didn’t happen on their own. They happened where governors, regulators, consumer advocates, environmental organizations and community partners fought for cleaner air and lower bills – and where utilities were held accountable for delivering modern, reliable, cost-effective solutions. Here are some of Environmental Defense Fund and our partners’ most meaningful victories from the past year:

A Year of Big Wins for Clean, Affordable Power in the States Share on X

Illinois curbed rate hikes and expanded access to clean, affordable electricity

Illinois regulators cut gas utilities’ proposed rate increases in half, trimmed the utilities’ profit rates, and rejected renewable natural gas proposals that would have raised costs without providing environmental value. EDF and Illinois PIRG were involved for months, urging regulators to require cleaner, cheaper alternatives – and the decision sends a clear message that utilities must modernize and offer cleaner, more affordable alternatives rather than double down on yesterday’s gas infrastructure.

Illinois regulators also unlocked more than $250 million for an electrified clean energy future: EV charging, fleet electrification, small business support and customer benefits. When the Illinois Attorney General challenged the Commission’s authority to approve these programs, EDF and partners intervened and won on all contested issues, protecting this progress.

EDF secured a landmark agreement with a utility to add new and expanded transmission lines – one of the most powerful tools for keeping electricity clean and affordable ­– and deploy grid-enhancing technologies to boost the performance of existing lines. These advanced hardware and software tools can cut the time and cost of connecting renewable energy to the grid. The agreement is expected to create up to 32,000 jobs, support power for 1.8 million homes, and deliver long-term savings for customers across the Midwest and beyond.

In Illinois, a new electricity rate called Rate BEST helps Commonwealth Edison customers save money using more renewable energy by shifting electricity use to times of day when power tends to be more affordable and cleaner. Since 2015, EDF and the Citizens Utility Board have championed time-of-use rates in Illinois, working with ComEd to design, pilot, and bring Rate BEST to customers in the new year.

New York advanced heat pump affordability and modern grid planning

EDF and partners secured an agreement with Con Edison to expand access to simpler, fairer electric rates designed for heat pumps – helping households cut heating bills and realize the full benefits of clean, efficient heating. These types of rates can save an average customer around $500 per year in energy costs. The utility will also expand outreach and education programs to help customers understand their options.

At the same time, the New York Public Service Commission advanced 29 critical electric grid upgrades to support electric vehicle (EV) charging and building electrification, then adopted a proactive planning framework that speeds interconnection of new loads while cutting costs. EDF’s recommendations helped drive these reforms.

Texas advanced EV charging and smarter grid planning

Texas also saw meaningful progress in 2025. EDF secured commitments from the utility CenterPoint to improve EV forecasting and modernize distribution system planning – essential steps for cost-effective electrification in one of the country’s fastest-growing EV markets. CenterPoint also committed to bolster its efforts to support the Port of Houston’s ongoing electrification, a move that will cut pollution and improve public health in surrounding communities.

Massachusetts helped customers reduce energy bills with clean heat

Massachusetts utilities – Unitil, National Grid, and Eversource – cut winter electricity rates for homes using heat pumps, saving these households about $540 on average this winter, a 17% reduction in heating bills. Adopted by the Department of Public Utilities, the rates fix long-standing inequities in how heat pump customers are charged. EDF intervened in National Grid’s rate case to secure the heat pump rate for all heat pump homes and a tiered discount rate of 32-71% for income qualifying households regardless of whether their home has a heat pump.

Looking ahead to 2026, EDF and partners are pushing for deeper seasonal delivery-charge discounts to better align winter electric heating costs with natural gas. New analysis commissioned by EDF shows that fairer rate design could enable more than 80% of Massachusetts homes to save an average of $687 in a single season – unlocking even greater benefits from clean electric heating and providing a model for other states.

In addition, Massachusetts began implementing landmark siting and permitting reforms adopted by the state legislature in late 2024. These reforms streamline and speed up the deployment of clean energy infrastructure, while helping ensure robust community engagement and careful consideration of project impacts. This year, the state released draft guidance and proposed regulations on site suitability assessments, cumulative impacts, and related issues. EDF has actively engaged at every stage of this process and remains committed to supporting the successful implementation of these critical reforms.

New Jersey protected customers and stopped costly hydrogen blending experiments

New Jersey regulators rejected a utility proposal to make customers pay for unproductive experiments blending hydrogen and biomethane – rebranded as “renewable natural gas” –into the gas system. EDF helped negotiate a settlement that scales back Public Service Electric & Gas’ (PSE&G) planned infrastructure spending, protecting households from unnecessary costs and keeping the state focused on cleaner, proven, and more affordable solutions. EDF also commissioned a study showing that PSE&G’s proposed hydrogen blending is far less efficient than helping customers electrify home heating with heat pumps.

A year of progress despite Washington’s attempts to reverse course

In a year when the Trump administration focused on undermining climate progress and helped drive up electricity costs, states showed what real leadership looks like. They cut unjustified rate hikes, rejected wasteful gas spending, required utilities to invest in modernizing the grid, expanded clean energy and secured fairer, more affordable electric rates for millions of families.

The message from 2025 is clear: a cleaner, more affordable, and fairer electricity system is possible, and EDF is committed to helping states deliver on this promise for everyone.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//couplelookingatbills.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 18:59:01.224977

The groups are led by the Oregon Environmental Council, and include the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Public Citizen, Hopi Utilities Corporation, Woven Energy, the city and county of San Francisco and the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel.

“The Trump administration has undertaken an illogical and illegal war on clean energy, and these arbitrary tax rules are just another salvo,” said Grace Henley, a tax attorney at NRDC, in a press release. “This is bad for clean energy, bad for workers and communities, bad for the air we all breathe, and horrible for Americans squeezed by higher utility bills.”

The lawsuit concerns an executive order issued by President Donald Trump following passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July that removed a safe harbor clause specifically for solar and wind projects. Safe harbor lets projects eligible for tax credits still qualify for the subsidies if they complete an established percentage of the project before a deadline.

“These new IRS rules have been a harsh blow. We have been counting on new solar projects to get electricity to those without it, help support essential services and to create and provide jobs,” said Tim Nuvangyaoma, former chairman of the Hopi Tribe. “The guidance has forced us to change our plans, and the Hopi Utilities Corporation is now racing to qualify for tax credits under the new guidelines.

Those groups opposed the plant and are represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center.
Environmental advocates also argued that Dominion must meet energy efficiency targets under state law in order to build new fossil fuel power plants — targets that the utility has not met.
The state commission's acceptance of the appeal isn't necessarily a sign that regulators agree with its arguments, nor that the SCC will change its November decision in approving the plant.
Disclosure: The Southern Environmental Law Center is a VPM sponsor.","The State Corporation Commission suspended its approval of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center — a planned Dominion Energy Virginia natural gas plant that has drawn significant opposition from Central Virginia residents and environmental groups.

Regulators said in a short filing Tuesday that the suspension will allow them more time to consider an appeal filed on Monday by Appalachian Voices, the NAACP and Mothers Out Front. Those groups opposed the plant and are represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center.

Their appeal petition argued that the SCC failed to consider emissions impacts on fenceline communities as required under the state's environmental justice law, instead leaving that to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.

The EJ law defines a fenceline community as ""an area that contains all or part of a low-income community or community of color and that presents an increased health risk to its residents due to its proximity to a major source of pollution.""

The commission's Nov. 25 final order said CERC would have smaller local health impacts than the coal plant that operated on the same property from 1952 until 2023.

The appeal challenged that conclusion: ""With all due respect, that methodology countermands the fundamental goals of the VEJA; it would encourage constructing new fossil fuel infrastructure at locations that have historically housed such infrastructure, ensuring those communities continue to experience harms.""

Environmental advocates also argued that Dominion must meet energy efficiency targets under state law in order to build new fossil fuel power plants — targets that the utility has not met. That requirement can be superseded if there is a demonstrated need for more electricity production to avoid reliability issues; regulators said in their November order that need does exist.

That's another issue raised by the appeal: how the threat to reliability was determined. Appellants argued that Dominion provided ""minimal evidence"" of its claim that CERC is necessary to prevent rolling blackouts, brownouts, or other consequences.

The SCC cited modelling and statements from Dominion, PJM Interconnection (which operates the regional electric grid capacity market) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation in deciding that additional generation is needed by 2029.

The state commission's acceptance of the appeal isn't necessarily a sign that regulators agree with its arguments, nor that the SCC will change its November decision in approving the plant. SELC attorney Grayson Holmes said he appreciated their willingness to take a closer look.

""We hope the Commission will recognize that permitting Dominion to claim this narrow exception on flimsy evidence sets a bad precedent—effectively suggesting that any future gas proposals could easily clear this hurdle, even if they are not the cleanest or most economic option,"" Holmes said in a press release.

Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said in a statement that CERC is ""an important part of Virginia's all of the above strategy to ensure our region has the reliable power we need.""

""We stand behind the SCC's approval of the project,"" Slayton wrote Thursday. ""It was approved after a year of exhaustive review, an extensive public hearing and participation by thousands of Virginians.""

A new analysis from the Center for American Progress Action Fund highlights premium cost increases in 13 states where Republican senators could face accountability from voters, are retiring, or may otherwise be persuadable.

After months of congressional Republican obstruction, a discharge petition will force the House to vote in January on a clean, three-year extension of the ACA’s enhanced tax credits. This vote creates a clear path forward to preserving affordability. But preventing massive premium increases ultimately depends on whether the Senate acts to protect families from higher health insurance costs.

“Republican senators no longer get to hide behind House gridlock, it appears,” said Natasha Murphy, director of Health Policy at CAP Action and co-author of the analysis. “The path to stopping premium spikes in 2026 is clear, and the question now is whether Senate Republicans will step up for families or allow costs to skyrocket.”

The analysis finds that, without action, Americans could see significant increases in their health care premium costs, including:

Anchorage, Alaska: A family of four earning $161,000 would pay $25,300 more annually.

Portland, Maine: A single parent earning $85,000 would pay $12,700 more annually.

Huntsville, Alabama: A 27-year-old earning $63,000 would pay $1,365 more annually.

Charleston, West Virginia: A 62-year-old couple earning $85,000 would pay $52,000 more annually.

Instead, it left homeowners dealing with a bankrupt company and nowhere to turn for help.

Nearly two years ago, Gov. Dan McKee announced the Affordable Solar Access Pathways (ASAP) program. The idea behind it was simple: provide cash incentives for homeowners in low-income and environmental justice zones to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes.

The state, using money from the Renewable Energy Fund, would give incentives to a vendor to provide solar panels, leases and power-purchase agreements to qualifying homeowners. Leases would be signed for 25 years. The state would also provide energy efficiency measures and a home energy audit to the homeowners, at no cost to them, as part of the program.

The idea behind the initiative was to spur solar panel adoption among low-income homeowners and lower their energy costs. Areas of Woonsocket, Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence, Cranston, West Warwick, East Providence, Warren, Middletown, and Newport would be eligible to apply.

The only other requirement for households was to have a roof in good condition and have an income at or below 80% of the state median. There was no credit score required, and homeowners in default electric service could apply. The program, as designed, was guaranteed to provide savings for homeowners in the first year.

“Low-to-moderate income communities have been historically underserved in the solar marketplace and often experience the negative impacts of climate change firsthand,” McKee said in a January 2024 press release announcing the launch of the program. “Providing environmental justice communities with affordable access to rooftop solar is essential to ensure all Rhode Islanders benefit from the renewable energy transition.”

The state hired PosiGen, a Saint Rose, La.-based company, to administer the program, which was similar to the service PosiGen provided, except the state would subsidize a big chunk of the leases for enrollees in the program.

PosiGen ultimately owned the solar panels and the leases, and households in the program were actually paying back the company, not the state. That’s how its business model worked: the company installed the solar panels at no cost, recouping costs entirely via the lease payments.

The $1 million in incentives from the Renewable Energy Fund would provide between 200 and 300 homes with solar panels, according to the program launch’s press release.

By August 2024, 116 households had signed contracts with PosiGen, with the state estimating the first year of energy savings to be $830 in electrical costs. The effective price of the energy was 13 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the program metrics recorded by the state Office of Energy Resources (OER) — the last resort service rates last winter and this winter were 16.39 cents and 14.77 cents per kilowatt-hour respectively.

The program was, by all measures, succeeding. It was putting solar panels on the roofs of low-income homeowners in environmental justice zones — areas determined by the state to suffer adverse environmental and public health consequences usually caused by pollution — and lowering their winter electricity costs. But developments with PosiGen in recent months have put the program, and its enrollees, in uncertain waters.

Last month PosiGen filed for bankruptcy, and it’s not clear what will happen to the Rhode Islanders who signed contracts in the solar program. State officials aren’t saying much.

“It’s too soon to determine,” said Matthew Touchette, director of communications for the state Executive Office of Commerce. Touchette declined to provide ecoRI News with a copy of the PosiGen contract, saying a request for the document must go through open records request procedures.

Beadle said both state agencies are committed to offering a low-income solar program, but had not made a decision on either finding a new vendor or pursuing a different program. The existing program still has one thing left: money. Touchette told ecoRI News the ASAP program still had most of its funding; $842,199 was left when the program was paused.

On Aug. 24, PosiGen laid off nearly its entire staff. The company at that point had furnished solar power for some 40,000 residential customers across 15 states.

Solar Power World, a solar industry trade publication, reported that thanks to the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” clawing back tax credits related to renewable energy, the company had failed to make interest payments on some of its debt, and the company’s investors declined to put more money into the company.

With not enough cash left in the bank to cover its operating expenses, PosiGen moved to lay off most of its staff instead, many of whom were caught unaware. OER and Rhode Island Commerce paused applications for the ASAP program shortly after, and have yet to find a new vendor to run the program.

On the state’s ASAP webpage, consumers are told to contact the company: “If you are a current ASAP participant with questions about your project or billing, please contact PosiGen customer service at 888-939-4442.”

The company remained in something of a holding pattern until last month. Reuters reported the company filed for Chapter 11 protections in Texas in November, and the company has been working its way through bankruptcy court. The company has $206 million in funded debt and its primary lender, Brookfield Asset Management, wants to foreclose on its assets and transfer the customers to a new solar power provider.

Part of PosiGen’s problems was its core business model. PosiGen provided solar panels at no cost to the consumer, instead of recouping expenses through the 25-year leases, as well as selling tax credits and the revenue from the leases to investors.

The second coming of the Trump administration was an existential crisis for PosiGen and the larger renewable energy industry in the United States. Trump’s hostility to renewables has been well documented. And when Congress passed the “Big Beautiful Bill” this past summer, it sunset or slashed dozens of tax credits used by the industry, which has as a result sharply reduced its expectations for expansion in the coming years.

In an increasingly divided country, Environment America’s longstanding focus on bringing people together to protect the natural world led to relationships with new and sometimes unconventional allies — and to results that every American can benefit from.

“America has the greatest outdoors on the planet. If there’s one thing that gave me hope in 2025, it was seeing people who share that belief come together across the nation and political spectrum to take action,” said Environment America’s Executive Director Lisa Frank. “Americans worked shoulder to shoulder to protect public lands, invest in wildlife crossings and clean up our waterways. Our resolution for 2026 is to continue working with everyone who values the natural places and species that make this country special, as we near its 250th birthday.”

Environment America and its state groups celebrated the following highlights and milestones in 2025:

Safeguarding America’s treasured natural spaces

This summer, when Congress mulled over a proposal to sell off up to 1.2 million acres of public lands, we joined with a broad, bipartisan movement of ranchers, hunters, hikers, climbers and conservationists to successfully convince lawmakers to withdraw the plan.

In Georgia, we worked with our supporters and allies to build public opposition to a mining project just three miles from the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. The large number of opponents eventually helped conservation allies purchase the land so that no one can mine there. The proposed project would have involved digging for titanium dioxide, a chemical the EU has determined isn’t safe in food, yet U.S. companies use as a whitener in cookies, toothpaste, salad dressing and other things. Thankfully, Georgians across the political spectrum thought it was more important to preserve this unique place of natural beauty than to have more of an unnecessary food additive.

We continued working in Minnesota to urge decision makers to protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness from proposed copper sulfide mining that could leak acidic drainage and toxic metals into the region’s many interconnected lakes and streams. Our staff and volunteers educated the public and built support for stronger protections for this beloved wilderness.

Additionally, alongside our allies, partners and members, we submitted more than 600,000 comments opposing opening millions of acres of our last wild national forests to large-scale, industrial and commercial logging. Across 45 million acres and 37 states, these special forest places are home to countless animals and are essential to the way of life of hunters, anglers, hikers and others who cherish the access they provide to America’s great outdoors.

Bipartisan momentum behind wildlife crossings

Every year, vehicle collisions kill between 1 and 2 million large animals and put countless drivers at risk. Wildlife crossings can dramatically reduce these collisions while reconnecting fragmented landscapes. Environment America’s state and national staff have been actively supporting and promoting the construction of these crossings, including in California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, Washington and Oregon.

We worked to shore up support for state and federal legislation and programs that will invest in these important infrastructure projects. This includes urging Congress to reauthorize the Wildlife Crossings Pilot Program, which would provide funding for crossing projects across the nation.

We also cultivated a broad coalition to advance the Wildlife Movement through Partnerships Act. This bipartisan effort included nearly one hundred groups and businesses such as sportsman’s clubs, rod and gun clubs, outfitters and guide services. The proposed legislation would direct agencies to coordinate research, action and funding that would allow for new wildlife corridors and effective crossing projects where they are needed most.

Meanwhile, our canvassing operations engaged thousands of people by knocking on their doors, successfully building public awareness about how wildlife crossings and corridors mitigate collisions, save lives and restore habitat connectivity.

Finally, in Idaho, Environment America and its partners reached an agreement with the mining company P4 Production to fund improvements to a critical mule deer migration corridor near Soda Springs. The Soda Hills mule deer herd follows ancient seasonal routes now threatened by fences, highways and development. The project will help restore those pathways so deer can safely move between their summer and winter ranges.

Tackling plastic pollution through citizen science, state laws

This spring, Environment America Research & Policy Center and its partners organized the first International Plastic Pellet Count, a global citizen science effort to track “nurdles,” the tiny pellets used as raw material for plastic products.

More than 1,100 volunteers collected 49,256 pellets across 200 sites in 14 countries and 29 U.S. states, showing just how widespread this pellet pollution has become.

The participants not only cleaned up thousands of pellets, but also helped provide crucial data to build public awareness and momentum for rules and policies to curb plastic pellet pollution at the source.

In Oregon, we played a crucial role in launching an ambitious producer responsibility law for packaging and paper products. The state’s Recycling Modernization Act gives more Oregonians access to curbside recycling, especially in rural areas. Furthermore, producers of packaging and paper products will now share the costs of improving the recycling system.

We also supported Washington state’s Recycling Reform Act, which will expand curbside recycling to hundreds of thousands of additional homes, require companies to help pay for the waste their packaging creates and simplify recycling rules with a uniform statewide list. We supported similar laws in other states including Colorado, California, Minnesota and Maryland.

Landmark court victories: making polluters pay

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court denied ExxonMobil Corporation’s petition asking the justices to take up an appeal of the company’s record-setting loss in a Clean Air Act enforcement suit. Environment Texas, the National Environmental Law Center and Sierra Club filed that suit in 2010.

The suit cited repeated violations at the company’s Baytown, Texas, oil refinery and chemical plant complex. It resulted in a $14.25 million civil penalty against Exxon — the largest penalty ever imposed by a court in a citizen-initiated public interest lawsuit to enforce the Clean Air Act.

Then, in September, our partners at PennEnvironment, alongside Three Rivers Waterkeeper, reached a major settlement with Styropek USA after documenting nurdles from its facility washing into the nearby Raccoon Creek and Ohio River system. Pellets were found on the water’s surface, in sediment and even caught in shoreline vegetation downstream of Styropek’s plastic facility.

Under the agreement, Styropek will pay $2.6 million in penalties and must completely redesign its stormwater collection and treatment systems to capture all of its pellet waste. The company will also install real-time monitoring at every outfall, with automatic penalties if even a single pellet escapes.

One mission: protecting the natural world

Looking back on these highlights from 2025, we’re proud of what we, our partners across the political spectrum and members have achieved. In 2026, we look forward to building on these accomplishments, and more, in service of our sole mission: to protect the natural world.",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SocialCardEnviroC4_AME.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 17:00:14.454401

The researchers used data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to see if the benefits of federal environmental regulations, such as the estimated number of asthma attacks prevented by air pollution regulations, outweigh the costs to comply with and enforce environmental protection rules. The team found that the benefits — calculated by looking at medical costs and financial losses from missed work, decreasing premature deaths and reducing the prevalence of diseases like lung and bladder cancer and cardiovascular issues — are up to five and six times higher than the costs associated with implementing the rules.

In the following Q&A, study co-author Onur Apul, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Penn State, discussed the societal impacts of environmental protection

Q: What do you mean when you say “environmental protection”?

Apul: The U.S. EPA protects human health and the environment by developing and enforcing regulations based on environmental laws passed by Congress. In addition, EPA conducts scientific research, sets national standards for air, water and soil quality, and works with states to address local pollution issues and minimize environmental risks.

Q: How have environmental regulations impacted public health and the economy over the past 50 years?

Apul: The message of our article is very simple: Environmental protection is good for public health and the American economy. Protecting our environment is not an expense, it's cost-saving. It’s like conserving energy in your house: It may look expensive at first — you have to install nice windows, maybe insulated heat exchangers — but in the long term you're going to be saving energy and saving money.

In our article, we went to the EPA’s databases and extracted how much it costs, for example, to remediate arsenic from drinking water versus implementing and enforcing a federal-level rule regulating arsenic in drinking water. Then we looked at EPA benefit computations, like how much does it cost to lose a young person from the workforce because of a sickness? We did a summary of all major EPA environmental rules and concluded that environmental protection is a cost-savings. In some cases, it's five times; in some cases, 10 times more beneficial than the costs associated with implementing and enforcing the regulations.

For example, the Clean Air Act is predicted to prevent 100 million asthma attacks by 2050. What's the average cost or benefit of not having an asthma attack? This corresponds to about 200,000 fatalities prevented. Or look at the Lead and Copper Rule, which regulates lead and copper in drinking water and prevents almost 1 million infants per year from having low birth weight.

Q: You noted that for the past 20 years, about 24 new chemicals have been registered every minute. How many chemicals does the EPA regulate?

Apul: Think about how many chemicals you use daily. Think about the paints, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter painkillers people use each day. The American Chemical Society Chemical Abstract Service lists about 275 million chemicals. That means 24 new chemicals have been registered every minute over the past 20 years, but the EPA regulates fewer than 100 contaminants out of 275 million. Advancing science, advancing engineering, increases life expectancy and environmental protection is one of those advancements, improving our quality of life by preventing child deaths, unexpected disease-related deaths and pollution-related deaths.

Q: How much does it cost to run the EPA?

Apul: The EPA’s operating budget is tiny compared to the total federal budget and the country’s GDP. The EPA’s budget for fiscal year 2024 was about $10 billion, or less than 0.15% of total government spending. That’s 0.03% of U.S. GDP. And in 2024 the EPA employed only about 15,000 people who regulate all these compounds, contribute to research, contribute to policy making, engage with communities and direct messaging. This small number of people, working on a small budget compared to total government spending and the nation’s GDP, help to protect the environment, preserve natural resources and save lives.

The French automaker could introduce a successor to the C1 that echoes the iconic 2CV’s character while looking completely different, according to Autocar reports. This would position Citroen among Europe’s most affordable electric options.

Consumers have been pushing for genuinely affordable electric vehicles for years without much success in Western markets. Battery packs remain the priciest component despite steady cost reductions over recent years. Most Western-market EVs start above $30,000, excluding many buyers seeking economical transportation options.

Chinese manufacturers produce models under $15,000 for their domestic market, but trade restrictions and certification requirements block their entry into American and European markets. This affordability gap outside China frustrates consumers wanting to abandon fossil fuels without exceeding their budgets.

Britain’s Dacia Spring retails for around $18,750, establishing the current European baseline for electric affordability. BYD’s Dolphin Surf starts at $23,300, several thousand dollars more expensive than the new Citroen. The French automaker’s potential model might price lower than both options if the proposed regulations pass. The new classification aims to reduce the financial burden of manufacturing small, inexpensive vehicles by easing certain compliance standards.

Brussels is weighing this framework after manufacturers complained that current rules make entry-level production economically impossible. The category would relax requirements these vehicles must satisfy.

Similar to the United States, Europe finds building genuinely inexpensive cars increasingly difficult under existing mandates and regulations. This proposal seeks to revive affordability across the segment. Its ultimate direction remains unclear.

Implementation would probably involve compromising some protection standards and oversight measures that ostensibly serve valid purposes. Citroen’s chief executive Xavier Chardon endorsed the potential ruleset during recent statements. He suggested approval would probably allow the French automaker to re-enter the smallest vehicle category it previously exited due to economic pressures.

Delivering a sub-$20,000 EV in Western countries demands several advances beyond regulatory adjustments alone. Battery expenses must keep declining while production efficiency rises substantially.

Western manufacturers need to implement cost-cutting manufacturing methods without quality sacrifice. Volume becomes essential as increased output reduces individual unit expenses significantly. Tax credits could fill remaining price differences, though recent policy shifts eliminated numerous purchase incentives that previously improved affordability for buyers. Material breakthroughs might decrease reliance on costly parts and components.

Simplified configurations with reduced amenities could lower prices, though buyers might reject bare-bones products missing features they consider standard equipment. The obstacle isn’t purely engineering but also consumer expectations, since Western purchasers may anticipate comforts that Chinese buyers willingly forgo for lower costs.

For entities like Ferrari N.V. (NYSE: RACE) that focus on the luxury segment of the auto industry, concerns about affordability aren’t as strong, since the buyers they target only need to be convinced about the quality and exclusivity of the new electric models made as an alternative to the gasoline versions they have relied on for decades.

Key developments

The U.S. Department of Commerce will seek feedback from stakeholders between January 1, 2026 and 11:59 p.m. ET on January 14, 2026 on including new auto parts and components within the scope of sectoral tariffs, according to a notice published this week.

Business and industry stakeholders that testified during a U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) public hearing on December 3-5, 2025, urged caution against destroying the benefits of the agreement while noting there is room for improvement. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) is expected to provide a report to Congress regarding its USMCA position by early January, in preparation for ongoing negotiations ahead of the July 1, 2026 deadline to conclude the review.

In a statement on the USTR review of the USMCA, the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC) urged the administration to “preserve the core structure of the USMCA while pursuing targeted refinements, adequate transition periods, and measures that further incentivize North American supply chain resilience.”

The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) stated the “U.S. should preserve and strengthen the USMCA during the agreement’s six-year review,” but seek targeted revisions in areas that include reducing red tape at the border, promoting greater use of USMCA preferences, addressing unfair competition, and working with North American partners on “regional economic security issues instead of levying Section 232 tariffs.”

In recent remarks to The Wall Street Journal and POLITICO, USTR Jamieson Greer suggested the USMCA could be split into separate deals, and commented that withdrawal from the USMCA is “always a scenario.” Greer also stated, “The president’s view is he only wants deals that are a good deal. The reason why we built a review period into USMCA was in case we needed to revise it, review it or exit it.” According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, “any party can invoke USMCA Article 34.6 and exit the agreement with six months’ notice, regardless of the review process.”

The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) predicts 2025 U.S. new light-vehicle sales will “finish the year at 16 million-plus units, given the strong sales performance earlier this year.”

Mexico approved a proposal to impose tariffs of 5% to 50% on more than 1,400 products from China and other nations with which it does not have a free trade agreement.

Shipments across the U.S. – Mexico border could be delayed due to blockades in certain areas that have been coordinated toprotest robberies and assaults on cargo drivers. TRADLINX, a supply chain visibility platform based in Seoul, stated, “For cross-border logistics teams, this is not a one-day headline; it’s an ongoing risk factor for planning U.S.–Mexico freight through the end of the year and into 2026.”

OEMs/SUPPLIERS

Amid heightened market pressures that could lead to increased risk for supplier bankruptcies in 2026, a new Supplier Distress Tracker created by Automotive Newsmonitors for layoff notices, insolvencies and bankruptcies.

The Chinese government is reported to have sought assistance from European automotive trade groups to help facilitate a resolution of ongoing disputes over the operations of Chinese-owned Netherlands-based chipmaker Nexperia.

Automotive News provided an overview of what several major suppliers plan to feature at CES 2026, to be held January 6-9 in Las Vegas.

Detroit Manufacturing Systems, LLC completed its previously announced acquisitions of Android Industries, LLC and Avancez, LLC. The combined entity, Voltava, LLC, has an estimated revenue of $1.77 billion, and it will be headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan.

Aisin Canada will invest $11 million in its Stratford, Ontario plant to produce panoramic sunroofs. The investment will be supported by $2.2 million awarded through the Ontario Together Trade Fund (OTTF), which was established to assist businesses impacted by U.S. import tariffs.

Hyundai and Kia will install theft prevention equipment on all new vehicles and retrofit over 4 million vehicles to resolve an investigation by a bipartisan coalition of 35 attorneys general.

Nissan Americas leader Christian Meunier intends to improve the automaker’s 5% U.S. market share by adjusting production to specific dealer orders, instead of relying on bulk output. The automaker is also considering plans to localize hybrid powertrain production at its plant in Decherd, TN.

MARKET TRENDS AND REGULATORY

U.S. new light-vehicle inventory was estimated at 3.01 million units at the start of December 2025, or a 90 days’ supply industrywide, compared to 2.97 million units at the beginning of November 2025. Inventory across individual brands varied significantly: Lexus and Toyota had the lowest days’ supply, at 44 and 45, respectively, while the highest inventory exceeded a 140 days’ supply for Audi, Jeep, Chrysler, and Lincoln.

Kelley Blue Book data indicates new vehicle average transaction price (ATP) rose 1.3% year-over-year to $49,814 in November, and the average new vehicle manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) has been above $50,000 since April 2025. The average incentive package in November was 6.7% of ATP, compared to 7.9% of ATP in the same period last year. The analysis also noted that new vehicle prices reflect “a market heavily influenced by affluent households.”

Commentary from Edmunds excerpted in CNNand CNBC suggested that certain new-vehicle consumers may “still face a challenging marketplace” despite the Federal Reserve’s December 10 decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. Edmunds estimates the average monthly payment for a new vehicle reached $772 in November 2025, while the average amount financed was close to an all-time high of $44,000.

A report in Automotive News assessed whether vehicle total cost of ownership could increase if automakers deprioritize fuel-saving technologies in response to the Trump administration’s revisions to Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards.

The Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly planning to delay enforcement of 2027-2032 vehicle pollution rules. The Biden-era standards would require a 50% reduction in certain pollutants such as nitrogen oxides through 2032 for light vehicles, and a 58% reduction for medium-duty vehicles.

A significant portion of vehicles recalled across all reasons – including serious flaws – do not get repaired, according to analysis of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data by The Wall Street Journal.

Car and truck rental company Enterprise Mobility acquired St. Louis-based Hogan for an undisclosed amount. The deal is expected to support Enterprise Mobility’s entry into the Class 7 and Class 8 heavy-duty truck market.

The European Commission released a proposal to require a 90% reduction of carbon-dioxide tailpipe emissions from baseline levels for new cars sold in the bloc beginning in 2035. The remaining 10% of emissions will have to be offset by sustainable fuels or low-carbon steel made in Europe. The proposal revises a previous target that would have required 100% CO2 emissions reductions for new passenger vehicles sold in the EU by 2035.

In remarks submitted for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged lawmakers to address the competitive threat posed by Chinese manufacturers, and stated, “No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent from happening inside the U.S.”

China’s vehicle exports in the first eleven months of 2025 reached 6.3 million units globally, up 18.7% year-over-year.

Autonomous Technologies and Vehicle Software

Uber plans to offer robotaxi service in more than 10 markets globally by the end of 2026.

Rivian plans to launch an artificial intelligence chip developed in-house, as well as lidar sensors, for its electric R2 models in late 2026. In the coming weeks, Rivian also intends to offer a new Autonomy+ driver-assistance package that will be available for purchase through a software update.

Volvo is considering collaborations that include licensing agreements for its new “Superset” software stack that will run on the automaker’s future EV models.

Detmar Logistics will use trucks equipped with Aurora Innovation’s self-driving technology to autonomously transport fracking sand on public roads and highways in parts of the Permian Basin in Texas.

HYBRID AND Electric Vehicles

Ford will incur approximately $19.5 billion in special charges primarily related to its EV business, and the automaker announced a revised electrification strategy that will prioritize “higher-return opportunities.” By 2030, Ford intends that 50% of its global volume be hybrids, extended-range EVs, and electric vehicles, versus 17% today. Ford lost nearly $13 billion on its EV business since 2023.

A report in The Wall Street Journal described EVs as a “money pit” for U.S. automakers, while noting that scaling back electrification strategies will impede their ability to compete with Chinese automakers.

New EV sales in November 2025 were estimated at 70,255 units in the U.S., falling 41% year-over-year and down 5% from October 2025.

South Korean battery maker SK On will end a battery plant joint venture with Ford as part of a revision to allocate resources to markets such as energy storage systems. Ford will assume full ownership of the companies’ two battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will own an upcoming facility in Tennessee.

BloombergNEF predicts the average global price for a lithium-ion battery pack in 2026 will drop by 3% year-over-year to $105 per kilowatt-hour.

Paccar units Kenworth Truck and Peterbilt Motors launched new battery-electric tractor and truck models.

The CEO of ChargePoint Holdings indicated that more than 40 states have solicited or signed contracts to build new EV charging stations in recent weeks, located in rural and underserved areas, and “other places where they might not have otherwise made economic sense.” The activity was attributed to the Department of Transportation’s revised guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program issued in August 2025.

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration over allegations the federal government is blocking congressionally approved funds intended to establish EV charging infrastructure. The funding was established through the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program (CFI) and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program. A group of environmental organizations filed a separate suit accusing the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration of unlawfully withholding funding for the CFI program.

As of late 2025, the U.S. was estimated to have over 81,000 EV charging stations with more than 250,000 individual charging ports nationwide. This represents a 17% increase compared to the start of 2025.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said.
A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.
The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,'' said Jason Grumet, the group's CEO.
“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,'' said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects that now take five or more years to complete, as lawmakers seek to meet growing demand for electricity and other forms of energy.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would also limit judicial review as Congress seeks to enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old environmental policy law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews often total nearly 600 pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,'' said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill's chief sponsor.

Clearing a ‘bureaucratic bottleneck’

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

""Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,'' Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,"" said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. ""Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Eleven Democrats voted for the bill, while one Republican, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, opposed it.

GOP amendment would block offshore wind

Huffman and other critics also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that ae being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

The GOP amendment “fundamentally changed legislation that represented genuine bipartisan progress on permitting reform,'' said Jason Grumet, the group's CEO. “It’s disappointing that a partisan amendment .... has now jeopardized that progress, turning what should have been a win for American energy into another missed opportunity.”

Harris, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, defended the change, which he said “will protect legal actions the Trump administration has taken thus far to combat the Biden offshore wind agenda,” including a project in Maryland that the administration has moved to block.

Westerman called the change minor and said that without it, ""we probably would not have gotten permitting reform done.”

Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, the bill's co-sponsor, said lawmakers from both parties have long agreed that “America’s broken permitting system is delaying investments in the basics we need — energy, transportation and housing.”

Support for the measure ""gives me hope that Congress is finally ready to take the win'' on permitting reform, Golden said.

A win for business, but environmentalists raise alarm

Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, hailed the vote.

“Permitting reform is not just a business issue — it is a national priority,'' said Rodney Davis, senior vice president for government affairs.

“Delays in project approvals hinder economic development, increase costs for consumers and undermine America’s ability to build and maintain critical infrastructure,"" Davis said. “Modernizing this process will enable timely construction of projects that deliver affordable and reliable energy ... expand broadband connectivity (and) strengthen our ability to compete in the global race for AI innovation.""

Environmental groups said the bill undermines a fundamental environmental law while empowering the Trump administration to quickly permit polluting projects without adequate review.

“We urgently need to build the infrastructure necessary to address the climate crisis and to transition to a clean energy economy, but this bill is not the solution,"" said Stephen Schima, a senior lawyer for Earthjustice Action.

“Far from helping build the clean energy projects of the future, the SPEED Act will only result in an abundance of contaminated air and water, dirty projects and chronic illnesses, with fewer opportunities to hold polluters accountable in court,"" he said.

“Across the country, a patchwork of state regulations has resulted in unverified claims like ‘recyclable,’ ‘compostable,’ and ‘reusable’ to appear on packaging, often without any connection to real-world recycling or composting systems,” Weber’s office said in a statement. “This confusion has made it harder for consumers to know what can actually be recycled and has weakened legitimate environmental initiatives.”

The PACK Act aims to address this problem by promoting science-backed, industry-driven standards for environmental labeling. Under the legislation, companies may only make environmental claims if those claims are scientifically verified and recognized by existing recycling or composting programs, ensuring “honesty and transparency” without imposing new mandates.

“Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,” Weber said. “The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It’s pro-environment, pro-business, and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.”

Industry leaders have praised the legislation’s approach.

“AMERIPEN applauds Rep. Randy Weber for introducing the Packaging and Claims Knowledge (PACK) Act and supports the PACK Act’s creation of a federal framework for recyclable, compostable, and reusable claims for consumer packaging under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC),” said Lynn Dyer, President of AMERIPEN. “This new framework will address concerns with the patchwork of state regulations and its negative effect on interstate commerce and consumer awareness regarding management of consumer packaging. AMERIPEN will continue to support Congressman Weber as he moves this critical legislation through the House of Representatives.”

“The Plastics Industry Association thanks Congressman Weber for introducing the PACK Act,” said Matt Seaholm, PLASTICS President and CEO. “Plastic packaging is essential to modern life—protecting products, keeping food fresh, and ensuring medical supplies arrive safely—yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable, and reusable packaging claims. This growing patchwork not only creates regulatory uncertainty but also has the potential to increase costs and contribute to broader affordability concerns.

""The PACK Act would establish a clear national framework under the FTC, reducing uncertainty and supporting businesses operating across state lines. As an industry that employs more than one million Americans, we appreciate Congressman Weber’s leadership on this important issue that strengthens U.S. manufacturing and consumer confidence.”

“We welcome the introduction of the PACK Act for creating a single, national framework for packaging claims,” said Peter DePasquale, Vice President, Government Affairs, Keurig Dr Pepper. “By setting clear, national standards and certifications through credible third parties, this legislation helps ensure consumers receive accurate information while giving companies the consistency they need to innovate and accelerate investment in sustainable packaging solutions nationwide.""",https://www.packagingstrategies.com/ext/resources/2025/12/us-capitol-hill-closeup-washington-dc-900x550.jpg?height=635&t=1766088737&width=1200,N,,2025-12-18 15:59:11.824629

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.

New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania are suing the Trump administration over funding for electric vehicle chargers, as part of a coalition of 17 Democratic attorneys general, and Gov. Josh Shapiro. They are alleging the White House is acting unlawfully by withholding funds approved by Congress.

“Without any notice or explanation, the United States Department of Transportation just quietly refused to approve any new funding under the programs which had already been appropriated by Congress and awarded to the states,” said New Jersey Attorney General Michael Platkin.

“This is consistent with how this administration has treated congressional appropriations. They’re not optional. They’re laws,” said Platkin. And the Constitution says that only under limited circumstances can the president, after money has been appropriated by Congress and passed into law, can he restrict those funds from going to their intended recipients.”

New Jersey is waiting on $16 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program. Both programs are part of the Biden-era bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Congress passed in 2022.

Platkin said the funds would create new jobs and provide EV drivers greater access to the roads.

“At a time, again, when we’re trying to make energy costs go down,” Platkin said. “We’re trying to make people’s lives easier and more affordable. This makes no sense. It’s illegal, but it also just makes no sense.”

The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration’s actions violate the Constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement that the funds would support “EV construction projects in Pennsylvania and … new, good paying jobs.”

“I will not let the federal government break their word at the expense of Pennsylvanians,” Shapiro said.

Pennsylvania was awarded funds to construct three charging stations along I-78 and I-81. The joint project involving Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia was awarded $18.6 million.

The effort was part of former President Joe Biden’s effort to tackle climate change.

This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the effort. “While the Administration is busy finding ways for their Big Oil donors to profit, California will continue to fight for its people, environment, and innovation.”

The Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment.

But President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he’s not a fan of electric vehicles. Trump signed a law that ended EV tax credits and recently weakened fuel efficiency standards, saying that Americans prefer gas-powered vehicles.

The federal lawsuit, filed in the Western District of Washington state, seeks a court order forcing the Department of Transportation to release the funds.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2022-12-21-K-PAYNTER-camden-county-charging-stations-18.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 15:59:16.862076

“The core of our climate work is increasing the share of zero-emission energy resources while maintaining electricity affordability for households.

Given these challenges, Rhode Island must adjust its climate planning efforts to reflect the new federal landscape.","PROVIDENCE, RI – Today the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4), chaired by Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) Director Terry Gray, approved the 2025 Climate Action Strategy. The Strategy is intended to guide implementation of the Act on Climate and provides a comprehensive assessment of Rhode Island’s emissions trajectory, programmatic tools, and the feasibility of achieving statutory greenhouse gas reduction mandates under current conditions. Developed in collaboration with the Office of Energy Resources (OER) including significant public input, the strategy outlines a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 45% below 1990 levels by 2030.

“The Climate Action Strategy is the result of hard work by all the EC4 agencies and, in particular, the climate teams at OER and DEM. Over the last 14 months they have worked very closely with the experts at Energy, Environment, and Economics, Inc. (E3) who provided contract support and modeling. Throughout the process, we have engaged with many different communities to get meaningful input and feedback,” said DEM Director and EC4 Chair Terry Gray. “This strategy reflects a clear-eyed assessment of today’s landscape and the challenges ahead. Rhode Island was moving in the right direction under the Act, but our efforts are clearly impeded by considerable federal policy changes.”

“The EC4’s approval of this strategy charts a path forward for making progress towards the Act on Climate while recognizing new, significant challenges from the Trump administration,” said OER Acting Energy Commissioner Christopher Kearns. “The core of our climate work is increasing the share of zero-emission energy resources while maintaining electricity affordability for households. Supporting rate stability is a key foundation for meeting our emissions reduction goals, alongside continued investments in clean energy, electric vehicles, heat pumps, pre-weatherization, and energy-efficiency programs that are essential to sustaining progress.”

Since the Act on Climate was signed in 2021, new programs, laws, and regulations have supported the state’s emissions-reduction goals. RI has been a leader in offshore wind development and modeling showed that fully carrying out these initiatives as originally planned would’ve put the state on track achieve the 2030 reduction targets.

Recent federal actions – including tariffs, the rescission of Clean Air Act authorities supporting clean vehicles, the termination of Inflation Reduction Act clean-energy and electric-vehicle tax credits, efforts to stall offshore wind development, and the elimination of programs such as Solar for All – have significantly altered the landscape on which Rhode Island’s climate strategy was built. The updated strategy recognizes that these changes will have immediate and serious consequences for the state’s climate plans. Given these challenges, Rhode Island must adjust its climate planning efforts to reflect the new federal landscape.

A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The House approved legislation Thursday aimed at speeding up permitting reviews for new energy and infrastructure projects and limiting judicial review.

The bill, dubbed the SPEED Act, would enact the most significant change in decades to the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock environmental law that requires federal agencies to consider a project’s possible environmental impacts before it is approved.

The bill was approved, 221-196, and now goes to the Senate.

Republicans and many Democrats believe the 55-year-old law has become mired in red tape that routinely results in years-long delays for major projects. The law requires detailed analysis for major projects and allows for public comments before approvals are issued. A recent study found that environmental reviews total hundreds of pages and take nearly five years to complete.

The House bill would place statutory limits on environmental reviews, broaden the scope of actions that don’t require review and set clear deadlines. It also limits who can bring legal challenges and legal remedies that courts can impose.

“The SPEED Act is a focused, bipartisan effort to restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting,'' said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, the bill's chief sponsor.

While NEPA was passed “with the best of intentions,” it has become unwieldly in the decades since, said Westerman, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has long pushed for permitting reform.

""Unfortunately, what was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,'' Westerman said Thursday on the House floor.

Democrats agreed that the permitting process has become unwieldy, but said the House bill does not address the real causes of delay and undercuts public input and participation while overly restricting judicial review.

“The SPEED Act treats environmental reviews as a nuisance rather than a tool to prevent costly, harmful mistakes,"" said California Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the Natural Resources panel.

“Weakening environmental review won’t fix permitting challenges (and) won’t help us build the clean energy future that we need,” Huffman said. ""Gutting NEPA only invites more risk, more mistakes, more litigation, more damage to communities that already face too many environmental burdens.”

Huffman and other Democrats also complained that the bill could harm wind and solar projects that are being shut down by the Trump administration. A last-minute change this week allows the administration to continue to block some offshore wind projects, bending to demands by conservatives who oppose offshore wind.

The American Clean Power Association, which represents wind developers, pulled its support for the bill because of the changes, which were demanded by Republican Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey.

Ford is also shelving planned electric commercial vans and repositioning its production lines to prioritize trucks, vans, and hybrid vehicles.
One report projected that U.S. energy storage deployments will reach record levels this year amid surging interest.
The move also underscores widening divergence between the EV market and energy storage.
Energy storage markets are competitive, with established players such as Tesla already commanding significant shares of the grid-scale battery business.","Ford Motor Co. is taking a nearly US$20-billion hit on its electric-vehicle investments and redirecting capital toward hybrids and energy storage as U.S. EV demand falters, even though global EV sales remain strong. The strategic overhaul includes cancelling several EV models, expanding hybrid and extended-range vehicles, and repurposing EV battery plants for grid and data-centre storage applications.

Ford framed the move as a “decisive redeployment of capital” in a Monday announcement that accompanies its 2026 business plans, as part of its broader Ford+ strategy. The company plans to redirect investment away from larger EVs that have struggled to meet sales and profitability expectations, and toward products and technologies where it sees stronger near-term returns.

“The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities,” Ford President and CEO Jim Farley said in a company press release outlining the new strategy. That includes expanding its lineup of hybrid and extended-range vehicles, as well as a new battery energy storage systems (BESS) business, which Ford said will use existing battery production capacity in the U.S.

Major write-down underscores EV market headwinds

Ford’s nearly US$19.5 billion impairment charge — one of the largest in recent corporate history — reflects the cancellation of planned EV models, the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korean partner SK On, and other program-related write-downs. About $8.5 billion of the charge relates to scrapped EV projects, including large pickups and vans, while roughly $6 billion reflects the end of the SK On venture and $5 billion covers other program expenses.

Reuters reporting notes that Ford is discontinuing the fully electric F-150 Lightning and its next-generation sibling, the T3, in favour of an extended-range hybrid model that incorporates a gasoline engine to recharge the battery. Ford is also shelving planned electric commercial vans and repositioning its production lines to prioritize trucks, vans, and hybrid vehicles.

The retrenchment comes as U.S. EV sales have faltered — in part due to federal policy changes that ended consumer tax credits and relaxed emissions regulations — and overall EV market penetration has remained lower than earlier projections. According to Reuters, EVs now account for roughly 10 per cent of new vehicle sales in the U.S., compared with about 25 per cent globally.

Battery plants repurposed for grid and data-centre storage

One of the most notable aspects of Ford’s pivot is its intention to repurpose existing EV battery manufacturing capacity to produce large-scale energy storage systems. At its Glendale, Kentucky battery plant — originally built for EV battery production — Ford plans to invest roughly US$2 billion over the next two years to build lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells and assemble them into 20-foot energy storage containers with at least 5 megawatt-hours (MWh) of capacity each. The company aims to produce at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually by the end of 2027.

The storage units are intended for grid operators, utilities and data centres, where demand for reliable power buffering and peak shaving is growing rapidly. Analysts say that as data centres and other large energy users seek to manage peak demand and integrate more renewable generation, the market for grid-connected battery systems is expanding quickly. One report projected that U.S. energy storage deployments will reach record levels this year amid surging interest.

In reporting by Canary Media, industry watchers say Ford’s strategy reflects broader trends in the energy transition. “They have built up battery manufacturing capacity, and now they need to do something with it,” Pavel Molchanov, managing director for renewable energy and clean technology at Raymond James, told reporters. “While EV demand is languishing, U.S. energy storage deployments are skyrocketing.”

Broader industry and market dynamics

Ford’s shift comes amid a broader reevaluation of EV strategies across legacy automakers. General Motors has also taken impairment charges related to EV production, while Stellantis has scaled back some EV plans in favour of hybrid platforms. Reuters coverage notes that many traditional carmakers — constrained by higher development costs, weakening demand and shifting regulatory environments — are returning to hybrid and traditional powertrain investments.

Analysts also point to weakening consumer incentives as a factor. The U.S. federal EV tax credit, once worth up to US$7,500 per vehicle, expired this year following legislative changes, removing a key subsidy that helped boost EV demand earlier in the decade. At the same time, average gasoline prices in the U.S. have fallen below US$3 per gallon in recent months, making conventional vehicles more attractive to cost-conscious buyers.

Strategic reset and future prospects

Ford’s revised approach prioritizes profitability and flexibility. The company says it expects its global mix of hybrids, extended range vehicles and EVs to reach roughly 50 per cent of total volume by 2030, up from about 17 per cent today, suggesting hybrids will play a major role alongside any future EV offerings.

The move also underscores widening divergence between the EV market and energy storage. Where EV sales have slowed, grid storage demand — particularly for data centres and utility applications — remains robust, driven by efforts to stabilise electricity systems and integrate renewables.

Yet Ford’s transition is not without risks. Energy storage markets are competitive, with established players such as Tesla already commanding significant shares of the grid-scale battery business. Whether Ford can carve out a meaningful position in storage while recalibrating its vehicle lineup remains to be seen.

For now, the Detroit automaker is betting that redeploying capital from struggling EV programs into hybrids, extended-range vehicles and energy storage will position it for more sustainable, profitable growth in a shifting automotive and energy landscape.",https://energi.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EV-Big-Guan-Getty-Images.webp,N,,2025-12-18 15:58:51.983478

Here are three reasons why I believe it's best not to buy Tesla stock right now.
Expenses are rising fast Tesla CEO Elon Musk is transitioning his company toward an autonomous vehicle and robotics company.
Following the expiration of the federal EV tax credits, Tesla's vehicle sales fell below 40,000 in November -- its lowest monthly sales in years.
However, the November vehicle sales numbers indicate that Tesla and other EV manufacturers have a significant problem on their hands.","Tesla (TSLA +3.44%) has been a fantastic stock for long-term investors, with returns exceeding 3,100% over the past decade. However, the company currently faces significant headwinds, as sales of its electric vehicles (EVs) are slowing, costs are rising, and it places big bets on unproven markets including robotics and autonomous vehicles (AVs).

It's no surprise, then, that many investors are trying to determine what to do with Tesla stock. Is it a good time to buy with its shares priced under $500, or is it too early to take a risk on the company transitioning toward future technologies when its EV business is slumping?

Here are three reasons why I believe it's best not to buy Tesla stock right now.

1. Expenses are rising fast

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is transitioning his company toward an autonomous vehicle and robotics company. The idea is for Tesla to mass-produce its Optimus robots -- up to 1 million by 2030 -- and for the company to vastly expand its fledgling robotaxi service that's currently only in a handful of cities. It's worth noting Musk said in July the service would cover half the country by the end of the year, which is now, and it's nowhere near achieving this.

There's nothing wrong with Tesla focusing on these two opportunities, considering that AVs could eventually be worth $1.4 trillion by 2040, and humanoid robotics will be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050.

But to achieve its goals, Tesla is spending heavily, and it's likely to increase from here. The company's operating expenses rose by 50% to $3.4 billion in the third quarter, and research and development (R&D) costs jumped 57% to $1.6 billion. Management specifically said the operating cost increase was ""driven by SG&A [selling, general, and administrative], AI and other R&D projects.""

For Tesla to expand into nascent robotics and AV markets, additional billions of dollars will need to be spent at a time when the company's core business -- selling electric vehicles -- isn't doing so hot.

2. Tesla's core business is suffering

It's easy to get caught up in Tesla's big plans to be an autonomous vehicle and robotics company, but Tesla is still primarily an electric vehicle company right now. Unfortunately, business is not so good.

Tesla's net income fell 37% to $1.4 billion in the third quarter, leaving the company with significantly less money to reinvest in the business.

Things could be getting worse, too. Following the expiration of the federal EV tax credits, Tesla's vehicle sales fell below 40,000 in November -- its lowest monthly sales in years. Tesla's third-quarter results temporarily received a boost as customers rushed to take advantage before credits expired at the end of September, which helped lift Tesla's revenue 12% to $28 billion in the quarter.

However, the November vehicle sales numbers indicate that Tesla and other EV manufacturers have a significant problem on their hands. EVs often cost more than traditional gas-powered vehicles, and after years of inflation and high interest rates, and no more tax credits, there's less demand for EVs than in the recent past.

This would be a significant problem on its own for Tesla, but it's compounded by the fact that the company is spending so much to move into robotics and AVs.

3. Its stock is expensive

Even if Tesla somehow pulls off its transition to AVs and robotics and turns around its stumbling EV business, it doesn't eliminate the fact that investors are paying a high premium for a company as it makes risky moves.

Tesla's shares currently have a price-to-earnings ratio of 206, far above the tech sector's average P/E ratio of about 45.

This means Tesla's stock is already priced for perfection at a time of significant transition, falling profit, and increasing expenses. That's too risky for my liking, even if Tesla eventually achieves its goals. I think investors are better off not buying Tesla stock right now, at least waiting until the company can prove that it can reinvigorate sales and earnings from its electric vehicle business.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F847339%2Fnewmodely_65.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-18 18:01:40.142986

In every conversation, policymakers, companies and other stakeholders highlighted the work to secure a domestic critical materials supply through industrial development and innovation and create new American jobs.

Hosted by the C2ES Regional Clean Economies Initiative, this cross-sectoral group of energy leaders offered achievable policy solutions to accelerate the development of the critical battery materials supply chain and deliver local economic benefits to the communities of the Southeast.

Although near-term projections for the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market have cooled slightly, global battery demand is rising at a rapid pace. Many American companies and communities across the emerging “battery belt” possess the capabilities to supply the key materials and components that go into these products, creating massive opportunity to capture the economic benefits of building out this supply chain domestically.

Through C2ES roundtable convenings in Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, and Georgia, we gathered expertise from leaders of communities, workers, economic developers, local businesses, academic experts, state policymakers, entrepreneurs and more. Each echoed that the battery industry brings tremendous tangible job creation and investment opportunities to their region. All agreed that realizing this opportunity requires regional cooperation and intentional, impactful, and intelligent policy solutions at all levels of government.

In Tennessee, we heard from startups and Fortune 500 companies alike about the challenges they face in a rapidly shifting policy environment, and the importance of a stable incentive and regulatory structure that enables predictable investment decisions.

In Alabama, we learned about the importance of an integrated economic development and policy strategy that focuses on industry-driven research and development, prioritizes intentional workforce development, and leans into the state’s competitive advantage within the broader regional value chain.

In North Carolina, we explored the many different shapes and sizes of companies and research efforts in this industry that can span raw materials extraction to final battery assembly, and talked about the importance of collaboration among companies, policymakers, and leaders across state lines.

Finally, in Georgia, we learned about how the state’s proactive economic development strategy to land some of the largest electric vehicle and battery factories in the region helped solidify Georgia as an anchor for the many suppliers and innovative technology developers in the region.

Though each of these conversations brought their own unique local opportunities and challenges, we heard a common refrain from the more than 150 leaders brought together: with the right combination of policy support and private sector investment, the Southeast United States is ready and willing to be the center of the global battery industry.

What would that support look like? Our participants recommended financial incentives for domestic production of critical battery materials, paired with demand-side support to promote the consumption of American made products. They talked about stronger coordination and acceleration of cutting-edge research and development efforts, with a focus on integrating industry needs and bridging the gap from pilot projects to commercialization. They highlighted the importance of proactive workforce development that brings current and future workers into the emerging battery industry while prioritizing transferrable skills and pathways to long-term careers in an advanced and rapidly evolving sector. They recommended smart standards and guidelines for building battery manufacturing facilities and battery storage installations that prioritize safety and remain flexible to the unique needs of the communities that host them.

Under the Regional Clean Economies Initiative in 2025, we were able to bring stakeholders new and old, big and small together to land on shared principles and offer smart policy solutions for the Southeast. In 2026, we’re looking forward to building these big ideas into actionable recommendations through a regional policy roadmap. C2ES will reconvene our network of leaders and advocates at a regional summit in April 2026 to finalize this roadmap and work towards domestic energy solutions needed for a thriving, growing economy.",https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iStock-1570041382-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 15:58:56.553474

The Act guts the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) – a bedrock environmental protection – to make it easier for Big Oil and other polluting industries to inflict their projects on communities.

By undercutting NEPA, the SPEED Act would allow fossil fuel companies and other polluting corporations to cut corners in environmental reviews; bury information about the risks posed by their dirty, dangerous projects; and silence community opposition. It would also drastically curtail communities’ ability to hold polluters accountable through the courts.

Yesterday, more than 70 organizations sent a letter to members of Congress expressing their strong opposition to the bill.

In response to the SPEED Act’s passage in the House, national environmental groups and organizations representing communities fighting fossil fuel projects said:

“The SPEED Act fast-tracks harmful fossil fuel and polluting projects, not the community-led clean energy solutions families and Indigenous peoples across the country have long called for. Instead of pushing the SPEED Act – a bill that would strip away what few legal protections communities still have, weaken safeguards for clean air, land, and water near new industrial development, and sidestep meaningful consultation with federally recognized Tribal Nations – Congress should be advancing real, community-driven permitting reform. Examples include the Environmental Justice for All Act, which lays out meaningful public engagement, strong public-health protections, respect for Tribal sovereignty and consultation obligations, and serious investments in agencies and staff.” – Mar Zepeda Salazar, Legislative Director, Climate Justice Alliance

“The baseline environmental protection found in NEPA is not red tape – it is the public’s seat at the table and one of the only tools communities have to protect their health, homes, and future. The SPEED Act would remove that protection, and when public review is cut off and independent science is ignored, corporations get to externalize pollution, illness, flooding, and the loss of livelihoods onto families who never had a say. The SPEED Act protects corporate interests, not the public, and it should be rejected by any senator who claims to stand with the people.” – James Hiatt, For a Better Bayou

“Organizing in New Mexico, I’ve seen how hard our communities fight just to protect what should never be up for negotiation – our air, our water, our health, and our future. Gutting NEPA is an open invitation for Big Oil to deepen the extraction, pollution, and harm we already face in the Permian Basin, in Greater Chaco, and across our rural, Indigenous, and working-class communities. Instead of weakening our last lines of defense, Congress should be strengthening environmental protections, investing in community-led solutions, and honoring the voices of the people who live with the consequences of extraction every single day.”- Feleecia Guillen, New Mexico Fellow, Institute for Policy Studies

“The SPEED Act represents yet another assault on the health of frontline, Black, Brown, Indigenous and poor white communities that have been designated as sacrifice zones by big polluters who bribe lawmakers with big money to continue a culture of extract, slash, burn, and emit at the expense of oppressed and marginalized peoples. Worse yet, this piece of industry-friendly legislation will take away due process from impacted communities by removing their right to sue big polluters who purposely select the places they call home to be dumped on and contaminated. Rather than speeding up the approval of dirty projects, Congress should increase funding for federal agencies and grassroots organizations accountable to frontline communities to carry out legally defensible and accurate environmental analyses as called for by Reps. Raúl Grijalva and McEachin in their landmark Environmental Justice for All Act.” – Anthony Karefa Rogers-Wright, Co-Coordinator Black Alliance for Peace Climate, Environment and Militarism Initiative

“The SPEED Act favors golden calf solutions and the idolatry of profits above a people-centered economy and a planet where we can all thrive. It sacrifices community voices and environmental standards as a hasty concession to industry, allowing fossil fuel and corporate polluters to cut corners, suppress science, and sideline communities during routine review procedures. It is legislation at the expense of community and environmental well-being. We support legislation that upholds justice, stewardship, and the dignity of the human family, rejecting the SPEED Act’s inadequate solutions.” – Pablo DeJesús, Executive Director, Unitarian Universalists for Social Justice

“The SPEED Act is a handout to fossil fuel companies and other big polluters at the expense of working people. Its sponsors include major recipients of Big Oil money like Bruce Westerman and Henry Cuellar. The bill lets the fossil fuel industry steamroll community opposition to their dangerous projects, suppress science on a project’s potential harms, and ignore climate consequences. Our senators must stand up against the SPEED Act’s attempts to undermine democratic decision-making, pollute our communities, and threaten our collective future.” – Allie Rosenbluth, U.S. Campaign Manager, Oil Change International

“Tribal Nations in California are challenged with various laws and policies that perpetuate erasure and uphold extractive economies that lead to irreversible destruction to our lands, waters, and all beings. The SPEED Act will likely deepen the barriers that are imposed on Indigenous Peoples and Indigenous Sovereignty, as this could: reduce the Tribal participation in the environmental reviews, accelerate permitting, and continue the legacy of settler-driven climate catastrophes. Congress must acknowledge that this is not the solution to achieving climate justice and would further burden Indigenous Peoples by diluting our inherent and sovereign rights; all decisions must be rooted in Free, Prior, and Informed consent– not deregulation.” – Starry Insixiengmay (Cahuilla), Ending Extractive Industries in Our Homelands Project Director, Sacred Places Institute For Indigenous Peoples

Backers of AI and other facilities that consume large amounts of power say that co-locating them near power plants offers efficiency benefits, including cutting the need for new transmission lines. Opponents say it can damage grid reliability and raise power bills for surrounding communities by reducing electricity available for public use.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the move will protect consumers in the mid-Atlantic region that serves about a fifth of Americans in 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Laura Swett, the FERC chairman, said the order was a “monumental step towards fortifying America’s national and economic security in the AI revolution,” and would ensure power rates remain “just and reasonable.”

Washington policy advisory firm Capstone called the order a “major victory” for existing nuclear and gas plants, as it directs PJM to implement rules that allow power stations to reduce output to the grid to serve new behind the meter customers such as data centers.

Power bills for the region are expected to continue to rise after PJM on Wednesday reported fresh record-high capacity prices that reflected electricity demand by data centers overtaking supplies.

The expansion of Big Tech’s data centers has driven up so-called capacity prices in PJM by about 1,000% over a roughly two-year period, intensifying energy affordability problems for those living and working in the region.

Rising costs in PJM have hit power bills in the grid’s territory, with some areas seeing a more than 20% jump in utility bills starting from last summer.

FERC took aim at PJM’s open access transmission tariff, which the operator says governs its services in the region to allow for a fair and competitive wholesale electricity market.

The agency said the tariff was “unjust and unreasonable due to a lack of clarity and consistency in the rates, terms, and conditions.” It directed PJM to revise its tariff to detail the terms and conditions for interconnection customers to follow when using generating facilities to serve co-located load.

PJM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NEPA outlines a robust process for environmental reviews based on scientific rigor, transparency and deliberation, all of which require appropriate time and effort. It is also one of the few laws that communities can use to highlight environmental justice concerns.

Below is a statement by David Watkins, director of government affairs for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

“This bill is a sizeable holiday gift basket for Big Oil and Gas. It includes goodies like shielding fossil fuel projects from meaningful review or public input before they are permitted, then shielding them from legal recourse after they are approved. Our elected officials are letting people down by supporting this regressive legislation designed to give an antiquated industry more time to profit from their dangerous and deadly polluting at a time when our communities, our economy and our planet need forward-looking clean energy policies. The bill even allows federal agencies to ignore scientific or technical information related to permit applications. Circumventing science and denying reality will only lead to greater harm to our environment and worse outcomes for communities.

The nonprofit recipients of $14 billion in climate grants frozen by the Environmental Protection Agency can have their case reheard, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said in a Wednesday ruling.

A three-judge panel had ruled 2-1 on Sept. 2 to uphold the freeze on funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. On Sept. 10, the plaintiffs requested a rehearing en banc, meaning all judges of that particular court would have to hear the case.

The court agreed to that rehearing, and the en banc court will hear further oral arguments in the case on Feb. 24. However, the court left in place the partial administrative stay issued in April, meaning the GGRF grant funding will remain frozen for now.

The majority opinion upholding the funding freeze was filed by two judges appointed by President Donald Trump — Judge Neomi Rao and Judge Gregory Katsas. The panel’s dissenting judge, Nina Pillard, was appointed by President Barack Obama.

“The month before President Trump’s inauguration, EPA modified the grant agreements — with no apparent consideration from the grantees — to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants” Rao and Katsas wrote, adding that “nothing in the Inflation Reduction Act prevented EPA from taking care that the grant programs be faithfully executed.”

The GGRF provided “nearly $27 billion in competitive grants to mobilize financing and leverage private capital for clean energy and climate projects that reduce pollution – with an emphasis on projects that benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities,” according to a fact sheet produced by the Biden EPA.

Grant recipients included “green bank” nonprofits such as the Climate United coalition, which received almost $7 billion to finance clean energy projects in rural, tribal and low-income communities, and the Coalition for Green Capital, which received $5 billion and was working to design, create and implement other green bank programs.

An amicus curiae brief filed Sept. 17 by Democratic members of Congress said, “After President Trump took office, the new EPA Administrator and other officials began to make outrageous attacks on grantees – including attempts to fabricate criminal fraud allegations.”

They argued that the administration’s attempts to claw back the funding “[ignored] Congressional spending power” and amounted to a “constitutional power grab.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made fraud allegations in March, saying the Biden administration’s rush to award grants before the Trump administration took over was tantamount to “throwing gold bars off the Titanic” and alleged “instances of self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, and intentionally reduced agency oversight” within the GGRF program.

The administration unjustly and arbitrarily singled out solar and wind projects for these more restrictive – and unprecedented – eligibility rules.
“The Trump administration has undertaken an illogical and illegal war on clean energy, and these arbitrary tax rules are just another salvo,” said Grace Henley, a tax attorney at NRDC.
“The guidance has forced us to change our plans, and the Hopi Utilities Corporation is now racing to qualify for tax credits under the new guidelines.
In rules issued in August, the IRS eliminated the five percent standard for all wind projects and solar projects larger than 1.5 megawatts.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – A broad array of groups with strong interests in clean and affordable energy sued the IRS and Treasury Department over new rules for tax credits that unfairly and illegally discriminate against wind and solar projects.

As part of a series of attacks on wind and solar, the IRS eliminated a key pathway for companies to demonstrate they have begun construction and thus qualify for federal tax credits before they expire on July 4, 2026. The administration unjustly and arbitrarily singled out solar and wind projects for these more restrictive – and unprecedented – eligibility rules.

The IRS guidance “unlawfully changes the tests for beginning of construction for only solar and wind facilities, without providing adequate reasons or data for treating those facilities differently from all other industries,” the filing says. This change is “likely to increase power prices, resulting in higher electric rates and bills for consumers.”

This lawsuit asks the court to declare the rules arbitrary and capricious and reject them, restoring projects’ ability to rely on the prior rules that had been in place for more than a decade.

The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today by a coalition of groups, led by the Oregon Environmental Council. Other plaintiffs are: NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Public Citizen, Hopi Utilities Corporation, Woven Energy, the City and County of San Francisco, and the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel.

“Oregon is counting on renewable energy. The Trump administration’s unfair decision to pull the rug out from under wind and solar projects will lock Oregon ratepayers into expensive, polluting energy sources,” said Jana Gastellum, executive director of Oregon Environmental Council. “Oregonians are already paying the price through devastating wildfires, toxic air pollution, and extreme weather. We can't afford to go backwards – not when the climate crisis is worsening, and communities are suffering.”

The filing also notes that this is part of a series of actions by the Trump administration to block renewable energy, listing 11 specific measures it has taken to stop or delay wind or solar projects. Those actions are putting a damper on much-needed new electricity generation, restricting supply just as utility prices are skyrocketing across the nation.

“The Trump administration has undertaken an illogical and illegal war on clean energy, and these arbitrary tax rules are just another salvo,” said Grace Henley, a tax attorney at NRDC. “This is bad for clean energy, bad for workers and communities, bad for the air we all breathe, and horrible for Americans squeezed by higher utility bills.”

“These new IRS rules have been a harsh blow. We have been counting on new solar projects to get electricity to those without it, help support essential services, and to create and provide jobs,” said Tim Nuvangyaoma, former Chairman of the Hopi Tribe. “The guidance has forced us to change our plans, and the Hopi Utilities Corporation is now racing to qualify for tax credits under the new guidelines. Getting the court to rectify this unjust action would give us the certainty we need.”

""In Maryland, hundreds of thousands of households live paycheck to paycheck and struggle to pay their utility bills,"" said Maryland People's Counsel David Lapp. ""Adding renewable energy lowers those bills and eliminates fuel cost price volatility. The Treasury Department’s guidance is a nonsensical attack on clean energy and an assault on affordable energy at a time when Marylanders can least afford it.""

“Undercutting solar and wind projects will drive up energy prices for average Americans and cities like San Francisco,” said San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu. “Clean energy developers need predictability and certainty to build projects that benefit us all. San Francisco is joining this coalition to fight for our clean energy future and keep energy costs affordable for consumers.”

“The Trump administration’s use of the IRS to target wind and solar energy projects will result in even higher electricity prices for consumers,” said Nandan Joshi, attorney with Public Citizen's Litigation Group. “Congress wanted to encourage investment in new, cleaner power generation without favoring any one technology. By using the tax code to wage war on wind and solar energy, the Trump administration will cause electric bills to rise, workers to lose their jobs, and older, dirtier power plants to spew more pollution into our air.”

Background

Last year’s Republican tax law cut tax credits for solar and wind and provided a transition period for projects that begin construction within a year.

For more than a decade, Congress has established that an energy project could qualify for a tax credit if it began construction on that project before certain statutory deadlines. This provided certainty to companies that their project would qualify for the tax benefits even if they faced unforeseen delays. IRS rules have long held that starting construction could mean either spending five percent of the total project costs or beginning physical work of a significant nature.

The so-called “Five Percent Safe Harbor” is what is at issue in today’s lawsuit.

Days after passage of the tax law, President Trump issued an Executive Order to “eliminate” clean energy incentives. The order specifically directed the agencies to revise the IRS’s guidance on the meaning “beginning of construction” for wind and solar facilities. In rules issued in August, the IRS eliminated the five percent standard for all wind projects and solar projects larger than 1.5 megawatts. The lawsuit today argues IRS’s elimination of that option is without any legal rationale. Moreover, sources like nuclear, geothermal and hydropower did not face these new restrictions.

The case concerns an IRS notice issued on August 15 titled “Beginning of Construction Requirements for Purposes of the Termination of Clean Electricity Production Credits and Clean Electricity Investment Credits for Applicable Wind and Solar Facilities.”",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 15:58:59.718094

This story originally appeared in Canary Media and is republished here with permission.

Ford, a century after it launched the modern automotive era, has given up on its early ambitions to charge into the electrified future.

The company announced that it will delete nearly $20 billion in book value to extricate itself from its EV investments, an eye-popping loss that amounts to one of the biggest corporate impairments ever.

The company, of course, views it differently: The move is a ​“decisive redeployment of capital,” it said on Monday, as it rolled out a string of related strategic changes alongside the write-down.

The pivot hits particularly hard in the southeastern Battery Belt, where Ford had invested in multibillion-dollar BlueOval plants to produce batteries and electric vehicles. The EV battery facility in Glendale, Kentucky, will lay off about 1,600 employees, and local outlet the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported that a Ford factory in Tennessee will hire around 1,000 fewer workers than previously planned, now that it is making gas trucks instead of electric ones.

As Ford retreats from EVs, though, it’s enthusiastically embracing battery-making — announcing plans to repurpose the Kentucky plant to fuel its entrance into the grid storage market. It expects to spend roughly $2 billion over the next two years to launch production of lithium iron phosphate cells and package them into 20-foot containers that hold at least 5 megawatt-hours of storage capacity, equivalent to a Tesla Megapack. The plan is to ship at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually by the end of 2027.

“This strategic initiative will leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford,” the company said in a statement. Ford also plans to make cells for home battery units at its factory in Marshall, Michigan.

Ford recently cut a deal with partner SK On, the South Korean battery maker, to dissolve their joint venture. Ford will keep the Kentucky battery plant while SK On takes the one at the sprawling BlueOval City complex near Memphis, Tennessee. That means batteries will still be made in that factory, just not exclusively for Ford products.

“They have built up battery manufacturing capacity, and now they need to do something with it,” said Pavel Molchanov, managing director for renewable energy and clean technology at financial services firm Raymond James. ​“While EV demand is languishing, U.S. energy storage deployments are skyrocketing.”

Ford’s sunny rhetoric about a ​“customer-driven shift” can’t hide the sheer enormity of the blow to its overall business.

As of Sept. 30, Ford’s accountants pegged its corporate value at more than $47 billion. Now Ford must lower that by $19.5 billion to reflect the dissolution of the joint venture agreement with SK On and the loss of planned EV models. The company will have to spend money to end production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, switch to producing a gas-and-battery-powered extended-range model, and retool factories for new, non-EV production.

The move comes as EVs account for just about 10% of new vehicle sales in the U.S., far below the global figure of 25%. Though EV sales reach new records each year, the rate of growth has slowed, and there’s little reason to expect momentum to improve given recent federal policy changes.

“U.S. EV sales have never lived up to expectations,” said Molchanov. ​“That was true even while the tax credit was in place. Now, there’s no more tax credit, and EV sales have fallen off a proverbial cliff.”

The consumer EV tax credit ended in September as a result of the Republican budget law, taking away an incentive that helped lower or eliminate the premium for buying electric compared to a similar gas-powered model. Now, too, the average price of regular gasoline has dipped below $3 a gallon for the first time in four years, while residential electricity prices rose 13% over the first three-quarters of this year, much faster than inflation.

“In terms of commodity prices, this is the worst of both worlds for EVs,” Molchanov said.

Energy storage soars as U.S. EV market falters

Ford’s announcement says a lot about the changing fortunes of EVs and energy storage in the U.S. right now.

It used to be that EVs were on the exponential growth curve, and stationary storage offered a modest side hustle for any leftover batteries. Now, between American automakers’ apparent inability to make affordable models and the Trump administration’s slashing and burning of federal EV incentives, that market is heading for some doldrums.

Grid battery providers, by contrast, are seeing business surge. Revenue from Tesla’s energy division, home to the Powerwall home battery and Megapack for large-scale storage, grew 67% last year compared to 2023, and broke $10 billion for the first time, even as the company’s market-leading EV business lost revenue.

Overall, the U.S. will install a record amount of battery capacity on the grid this year. Though analysts predict some dropoff over the next couple of years as the industry adapts to new federal anti-China rules, the utility-scale outlook through 2030 has actually increased 15% since the first half of this year, according to industry group American Clean Power.

Demand from AI data centers plays a massive role in that: Hyperscalers are realizing that strategically placed batteries can unlock capacity at critical constrained hours, in some cases letting the companies build computing hubs years earlier than they could if they waited for conventional grid upgrades. Ford, not coincidentally, will target data centers with its new battery products.

The grid storage market has to date depended almost entirely on lithium iron phosphate cells made in China. But when President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act this summer, he preserved federal tax incentives for energy storage deployment while adding a new bureaucratic regime to make projects prove they don’t source parts from China in excess of newly set limits.

Starting in 2026, that will push storage developers to source U.S.-made batteries. There aren’t a lot of options today: LG, after making EV batteries in Michigan for years, began producing lithium iron phosphate cells there for grid use earlier this year. Tesla, Fluence, and others are following suit — in fact, the U.S. is on track for self-sufficiency in cell production for grid storage use by the end of 2026, according to the Energy Storage Coalition.

If project developers end up in a race to secure scarce domestic supply come 2027 or 2028, Ford could find eager buyers in spite of its short track record.

Still, that’s no guarantee of success. Other companies have been building grid storage products for years, working out kinks, packing more capabilities into a tighter footprint, and building relationships with savvy customers. Ford has a reputation for reliability in pickup trucks, not in grid batteries.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/04.01.25-KY-Plant-14.webp,N,,2025-12-18 15:00:28.331247

The Paint Bay was reported to have been used to repaint vehicles and other mobile machinery that would fit into the garage-sized bay. Building 541, a former maintenance shop, is also located within the SWMU 52 area. Building 542 has a floor drain connected to an underground pipe that exits the building to the south and then runs southwest to the oil-water separator (Building A541). The floor drain collected wastewater associated with Paint Bay and tire shop operations. The paint bay area includes three 4-foot diameter exhaust fans along the east and south walls to discharge paint fumes and particulates. The east wall discharged fumes through a vented exhaust fume hood. Along the south wall fumes were discharged through two fans located within an exhaust fan housing constructed of plywood and sheet metal. Painting operations were reportedly discontinued at the facility in the mid-1970s.

In 1989, a visual site inspection was conducted. As part of the inspection, the U.S. Army identified staining on the outside wall of Building 542 and on the ground surface around the exhaust fans described above. Through correspondence between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the U.S. Army, SWMU 52 was identified as a potential release site, as certain paints and associated products used at SWMU 52 may have contained hazardous or toxic constituents. The USEPA recognized that the potential for contaminant migration from this site to potential receptors was low (Dames & Moore, 1989).

In 2000, a RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) for soils at SWMU 52 was conducted by Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns & McDonnell). Laboratory analytical data collected during this RFI were later determined to be unreliable due to laboratory malfeasance; therefore, the data was not used and is not presented here.

In 2003, a subsequent RFI at SWMU 52 for soils was conducted by Shaw Environmental, Inc. (Shaw). Four surface soil samples were collected and analyzed for SFAAP metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and phthalates (a subset of semi-volatile organic compounds [SVOCs]). The locations of samples collected during the Shaw RFI were biased toward known potential release sites or potential runoff accumulation areas. Analytical results were non-detect or at concentrations below the residential target media cleanup levels (TMCLs) for all analytes. Based on these results, a request for NFA for soils at SWMU 52 was written by the Army and submitted to KDHE in April 2007. KDHE provided concurrence that the Army had completed all necessary work associated with soil at SWMU 52 on April 1, 2009.

In a letter dated May 8, 2008, KDHE requested that a groundwater investigation be conducted at SWMU 52. In response to this request, a supplemental RFI was conducted by WSP USA Solutions Inc. (WSP) and Burns & McDonell in 2021 to characterize groundwater contaminant concentrations at SWMU 52. As part of the investigation, two groundwater samples were collected downgradient of the potential Building 542 release areas and analyzed for SFAAP metals, VOCs, and phthalates. Analytical results were non-detect or at concentrations below their respective residential TMCLs indicating there is no groundwater contamination originating from SWMU 52.

The KDHE have determined that NFA with restrictions for soil and site-specific groundwater is the appropriate remedy for SWMU 52. No COCs were identified in soil or groundwater. Remaining soil and groundwater contamination as a result of ACM, LBP, or pesticides will be adequately addressed through the restrictions imposed by the EUCA Number 25-EUC-0017. This proposal is based upon KDHE’s review of all available historical documentation regarding the site.",https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 18:02:03.115504

U.S. Rep. Randy Weber, R-Texas, has introduced the Packaging and Claims Knowledge Act, a federal labeling harmonization bill that’s been championed by Ameripen for over a year.

It would amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to include certain requirements for recyclable, compostable and reusable claims for consumer product packaging, including that they make qualifying claims and are backed by third-party certifications. Packaging that doesn’t meet stated parameters would be prohibited from bearing resin identification codes surrounded by chasing arrows.

The bill also calls for state preemption. “This uniform structure will replace the confusing patchwork of state regulations, helping businesses provide accurate and transparent information across state lines,” Ameripen said in a news release Wednesday.

Dive Insight:

This federal push comes at a time when more packaging stakeholders are raising concerns about how differing state-level packaging regulations could inhibit interstate commerce. It’s also less than a year away from California’s planned implementation of SB 343, a landmark labeling law that will make it illegal for packaging to bear chasing arrows or other recycling indicators unless specific criteria are met.

All the while, unfinished efforts under the Biden administration to get clarity on best practices for sustainability claims by updating the non-binding FTC Green Guides have been quiet under the Trump administration.

“Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,” Weber said in a statement. “The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It’s pro-environment, pro-business, and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.”

The bills calls on the FTC to, within a year, establish an advisory council of experts and industry stakeholders to meet annually. Within two years, the FTC would have to issue guidance on third-party certification, including considering different types of packaging materials, colors, shapes and sizes.

The bill text shared by Weber notes various criteria for recyclable, compostable and reusable claims for consumer product packaging.

For example, a “recyclable” package must inform consumers about the availability of recycling programs and collection sites where the item is sold by noting the percentage of consumer or communities with access.

At the same time, a package can be exempt from that requirement if “a recycling program or facility isavailable to a substantial majority of consumers or communities in which the consumer product is sold.” A package cannot be deemed recyclable if it’s made from a recyclable material but due to its shape, size or other attributes is not accepted in recycling programs.

“Compostable” claims require “competent and reliable scientific evidence that the packaging is compostable.” And “reusable” claims require that a person provide means for reusing the packaging through a systems of collection and reuse, or offer a product for purchase to reuse the original packaging.

Ameripen says that the third-party certification requirement “allows businesses to utilize a variety of qualified independent parties to certify that packaging meets industry standards and follows the FTC’s ‘Green Guides’ to avoid deceptive claims.”

“This new framework will address concerns with the patchwork of state regulations and its negative effect on interstate commerce and consumer awareness regarding management of consumer packaging,” said Executive Director Lynn Dyer in Weber’s press release. “Ameripen will continue to support Congressman Weber as he moves this critical legislation through the House of Representatives.”

Peter DePasquale, vice president of government affairs at Keurig Dr Pepper, said in a statement the bill is a welcome step to establish “a single, national framework for packaging claims.”

“By setting clear, national standards and certifications through credible third parties, this legislation helps ensure consumers receive accurate information while giving companies the consistency they need to innovate and accelerate investment in sustainable packaging solutions nationwide,” DePasquale said.

The Pack Act’s dozens of of other supporters include major packaging companies and CPGs such as Amcor, Anchor Packaging and Dart, and Kraft Heinz, General Mills and Nestlé USA. The legislation is widely supported by different packaging trade groups, including the Plastics Industry Association, EPS Industry Alliance, Biodegradable Products Institute, Can Manufacturers Institute, Carton Council, Foodservice Packaging Institute and more.

Flexible Packaging Association CEO Dan Felton said the group is “thrilled” about the Pack Act’s introduction “and looks forward to fully supporting its passage into law.”

“We believe that a federal law for the labeling of packaging for compostability, recyclability, and reusability that supports existing national labeling programs makes far greater sense than a state-by-state approach of passing related laws and will lead to more — not less — consumers properly handling flexible packaging at its end of life,” Felton said in an emailed statement.

The NMC to LFP macro-story The transition is considerably easier for manufacturers already producing EV batteries using LFP, a chemistry that China has long prioritized, but that did not become the preferred alternative for both stationary storage and EV batteries globally until the early 2020s.
Unlike LFP cells, which typically use a prismatic form factor for storage, NMC cells are often produced as pouch or cylindrical units.
“But it’s very hard to build an energy storage product or cell business if you’re not shipping prismatic LFP.
“Energy storage is one of the most important tools for grid resiliency.","Earlier this week, Ford Motor Company — arguably the most iconic U.S. automaker in the U.S. — began to inch into the energy space. The company, which a century ago revolutionized auto manufacturing through its use of the assembly line, announced plans to repurpose some of its “underutilized” EV manufacturing lines, and use them to build advanced energy storage systems instead.

The automaker said it will change over EV capacity at its plant in Glendale, Kentucky, to manufacture storage systems of five-plus megawatt-hours, which it hopes to start bringing online in 2027. This will be the starting point for a new Ford energy storage business; it plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years “to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid.”

This is the latest, and most high-profile, example of a pivot that has seen a growing group of manufacturers, including LG Energy and SK On, repurposing some of the capacity they built up when U.S. forecasts for EV sales were rosier. (Fellow automaker GM is also participating in the trend, but instead of repurposing lines, it is giving some of its new and used EV batteries to Redwood Energy to deploy in hybrid storage solutions for data centers.)

The Trump administration’s elimination of subsidies for EVs last summer is leaving battery manufacturers with more capacity than they can hope to deploy in the short term. At the same time, the energy storage industry is experiencing some tailwinds; the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill left the full value of its tax credits intact until 2033, as batteries become more important to powering data centers and meeting record load growth.

So, according to Daniel Finn-Foley, director of energy storage at Clean Energy Associates, it’s only logical for an EV battery manufacturer with the requisite expertise, factories, and supply chain already in place to get into the stationary storage business as well. “If you already have a battery plant up and running, converting that to stationary storage is an effort to preserve some of the economic value of that facility when it may otherwise have to close or scale back production,” he told Latitude Media.

The shift, however, is neither cheap nor particularly easy. Analysts estimate the conversion can cost up to a third of a facility’s total capex and take up to 18 months — a timeline reflected in Ford’s plan, which doesn’t see storage capacity coming online until 2027.

From density to lifecycle

As an investor at VC firm Piva Capital, Lee Larson has been in many conversations with both battery companies and automakers about “the shift away from EVs and towards stationary storage,” a trend he says everyone has seen and is trying to understand.

He says that the key element of the shift is the fact that EVs and BESS have a fundamental difference in priorities: EV batteries require high gravimetric energy density to maximize range, while BESS prioritizes cycle life to ensure long-term value.

“In EVs, the watt-hours per kilogram define your range and performance, but EVs only need 1,000 cycles, which, depending on your energy density, could be 300,000 miles of lifetime range,” Larson said. “For energy storage, the metric of value is dollar per cycle… and the leading cells can now get 8,000 cycles or more, which improves the economics over a 20-year lifetime.”

This pivot from prioritizing density to lifecycles drives a shift toward physically larger cells, which require some retooling of the cell line for thicker electrodes and different additives, as well as the replacement of the pack assembly lines to build bigger grid-ready racks instead of flat, thin batteries that can fit into an EV.

The NMC to LFP macro-story

The transition is considerably easier for manufacturers already producing EV batteries using LFP, a chemistry that China has long prioritized, but that did not become the preferred alternative for both stationary storage and EV batteries globally until the early 2020s. Most U.S. factories, however, are built for NMC chemistries, which dominated Western manufacturing in the late 2010s; they largely only started the slow transition to using LFPs after Tesla incorporated them into its standard-range EVs in late 2021.

Unlike LFP cells, which typically use a prismatic form factor for storage, NMC cells are often produced as pouch or cylindrical units. Ryan Gibson, a venture partner at VC firm Eclipse, where he’s helped build companies including sodium-ion battery manufacturer Peak Energy, says this makes things harder, as switching lines from NMC to LFP requires changes not only to the internal chemistry but also to the machinery used to shape the cells.

“When you’re changing the fundamental form factor of the cell, you’re going to be reinvesting considerable capex…It’s a huge hill climb,” Gibson said. “But it’s very hard to build an energy storage product or cell business if you’re not shipping prismatic LFP. So, if your goal is to enter that market and you’re sitting on old capex for old chemistries that can’t sell into that market, you sort of have to switch over.”

In its announcement, Ford said it’s planning to produce LFP prismatic cells for its new storage business, as well as battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems. The company had started introducing LFP batteries for its EVs in 2023, including for its F-150 Lightning trucks; the latter, which is the electric version of one of the best-selling cars in the U.S., was scrapped as part of Monday’s pivot.

Broadly, according to Larson, this EVs-to-storage battery trend is the continuation of the necessary transition from NMC to LFP that was already happening in the market before the policy headwinds against EVs materialized. “Over the past couple of years, most of the non-Chinese players were already struggling with relatively low capacity utilization on their NMC lines,” he said. “The big, broader macro-story here is the rise and dominance of LFP from a cost performance perspective.”

The EV manufacturers’ relatively quick embrace of BESS is also a manifestation of the battery industry’s resilience and ability to adapt to “seismic shifts in the market,” according to Finn-Foley. Just in the past seven years, he noted, the industry went through shifts including a supply crunch that occurred because demand was being eaten up by incentives within South Korea; the sudden shift to LFP batteries from NMC chemistries; and a 10x spike and drop of lithium prices.

“This is an industry that is constantly shifting, and people underestimate the creativity of developers in terms of reducing cost and getting manufacturing online,” he said. “Energy storage is one of the most important tools for grid resiliency. So it’s appropriate that the supply chain itself would be resilient as well. Resiliency is in the DNA of the storage industry itself.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-12-18T125247.950.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:59:45.505208

Clean Energy Standard: The Commission approved, with modifications, NYSERDA’s 2026 CES administrative budget, including funding the ZEC program via an administrative adder. NYSERDA had requested $34.78 million to support the 2026 CES compliance year budget. The Commission ultimately approved a budget of $31.4 million, a 15 percent decrease from the CES 2025 budget. This budget modification was to reflect the current renewable project landscape and reduce the burden on ratepayers. This funding will support NYSERDA’s CES staff salaries and overhead, system development, technical support, and the New York State Cost Recovery Fee. NYSERDA will fund its 2026 CES administrative budget with revenues from previous years including bid fees, alternative compliance payments, and interest income. The ZEC program would continue to be funded with an administrative adder. NYSERDA's CES budget addresses the continued growth of workload for the administration of CES programs including managing more than 100 renewable energy generator contracts.

In a related ZEC action, the Commission accepted the final SGEIS related to the ZEC program extension proposal. With the SGEIS finalized, the Commission may now prepare a findings statement as required under the State Environmental Quality Review Act. A findings statement is required before the Commission may act on the underlying ZEC program extension proposal.

Clean Transportation Prize: The Commission approved, with modifications, NYSERDA’s petition for its Clean Transportation Prize Program. In its petition, NYSERDA requested a two-year extension for nine of the 10 Clean Transportation Prize winners and a five-year extension for one of the Clean Transportation Prize winners. After the petition was filed, NYSERDA submitted a notice advising that two of the awarded projects had been cancelled. Additionally, NYSERDA requested a budget increase of approximately $500,000, or 15 percent, to provide additional program implementation support to administer the program for a longer period than originally anticipated. Finally, the petition proposes additional, publicly available, reporting requirements.

The Commission also approved the additional reporting requirements to ensure greater visibility and oversight of NYSERDA's administration of the Clean Transportation Prize Program, but the Commission denied the budget modification NYSERDA sought because there are now fewer projects to manage.

The Sierra Club, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and Turtle Island Restoration Network filed the challenge in state court, citing the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s failure to provide proper public notice, allow for public comment, or give an opportunity for a public hearing on the agency’s re-issuance of its coastal use permit for construction of the Commonwealth LNG facility. LDCE also relied entirely on the final Commonwealth Environmental Impact Study to re-issue the permit, despite an earlier D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals finding that EIS unlawful, and failed to adequately consider the environmental justice and climate change impacts that a state court judge had ordered in throwing out Commonwealth’s first coastal use permit in October.

If built, Commonwealth LNG would permanently destroy over 75 acres of wetlands in the Calcesieu Pass area, and alter hundreds more, adding to the already staggering permanent alteration of over 500 acres of wetlands approved for just two of the neighboring coastal LNG projects. The liquefied methane gas, known as LNG, it would export would have annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 14 coal-fired power plants or 13 million new gasoline powered vehicles.

The Sierra Club, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and Turtle Island Restoration Network released the following statements:

“Commonwealth LNG would destroy vital storm buffers, wetlands, and fishing sites, but LDCE refuses to do the right thing and put a stop to this project,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club Managing Attorney. “The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted. By refusing to allow public comment– and using a faulty study to justify its decision– LDCE is attempting to shrug off its responsibility to represent and protect the people of Louisiana.”

“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, Director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “One of the concerns was for the fishermen in Cameron Parish, and the revised version does not address this issue at all. Our fishermen’s livelihoods are threatened by the pollution and tanker traffic already in the area, yet the department is turning a blind eye toward their struggles. It’s sad when our own state would put a corporation ahead of our fishermen. The department has done nothing more than rubber stamp a permit for an out-of-state corporation that has never cared about our home and never will.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 14:01:29.243267

Connecticut’s Conservation and Load Management (C&LM) energy efficiency programs, implemented by Connecticut’s utilities with oversight from DEEP and the state’s Energy Efficiency Board, continue to provide significant energy and bill savings benefits to ratepayers.","(HARTFORD, CT) – Governor Ned Lamont, chairman of the State Bond Commission, today announced that the commission voted at its meeting this morning to approve an allocation of $18 million in bond funding that will be used to establish the Housing Environmental Improvement Revolving Loan and Grant Fund – a new state loan and grant program that will assist in making energy efficiency upgrades at existing single-family and multi-family homes and helping residents generate savings on energy bills.

Administered by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), this program will be used to help with the retrofitting costs of items such as the installation of more efficient heating and cooling equipment, building envelope upgrades, and other similar items that produce energy savings. The program will build on the success of DEEP’s most recent barrier remediation program, the Residential Energy Preparation Services program, which recently utilized all its available funding, removing hazards in dozens of homes, clearing the path for money saving efficiency upgrades.

The establishment of the program and its related bond funding was authorized by the Connecticut General Assembly through Public Act 25-125, which Governor Lamont signed into law this summer.

“Energy efficiency improvements are a huge part of the way that savings can be generated on energy bills,” Governor Lamont said. “One of the great things about energy efficient upgrades is that they help reduce costs and increase reliability for all ratepayers – not just the person installing an energy efficient upgrade – by reducing wasted energy across the electric grid. With this funding, we’re also removing barriers that prevent people from being able to install energy efficient upgrades. Everyone should be able to realize the savings that can come from installing energy efficient upgrades in the home. Altogether, these funds will help expand affordable housing in Connecticut by rehabilitating existing housing and integrating energy upgrades that lower utility costs, improve resident comfort, and extend building life.”

“The Housing Environmental Improvement Revolving Loan and Grant Fund builds on DEEP’s commitment to addressing high utility costs for low-income residents,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “With housing and utility costs rising, this funding is essential to help residents and developers, who live in or own low income single and multifamily buildings, access weatherization and energy efficiency measures that can lower utility bills, increase comfort and safety, and keep housing costs affordable.”

When the program begins, $12 million from this initial $18 million allocation will be used to provide loans for developers to install energy upgrades and retrofits in existing multifamily affordable housing, including but not limited to more efficient heating and cooling equipment and building envelope upgrades.

The remaining $6 million will go toward removing barriers that prevent people in lower-income, single family homes from making their homes more energy efficient. Barriers include asbestos, knob and tube wiring, mold, and moisture. These barriers disqualify homes from state and federal weatherization and energy upgrade programs, as contractors are unable to move forward with energy audits, window and insulation installation, and other measures if such barriers are present. For example, in 2024, about 30% of Home Energy Solutions – Income Eligible units and 50% of Weatherization Assistance Program units were deferred due to health and safety barriers. Lower-income residents face the highest energy burden, or percentage of gross income spent on energy bills, and without funding for barrier remediation these homes cannot proceed with weatherization work and therefore are not able to improve their energy efficiency, which can save money on utility bills and increase home comfort.

In 2024, DEEP compiled public input related to this funding through a request for information, where respondents highlighted gaps and challenges in the affordable housing energy efficiency space, such as lack of technical assistance, difficultly accessing financing, high costs, health and safety barriers, and market confusion. Additionally, DEEP held three Affordable Multifamily Stakeholder Roundtables in June that produced similar key takeaways and sparked the creation of an interagency working group to discuss coordination among their various affordable multifamily programs.

The next steps in the establishment of the Housing Environmental Improvement Revolving Loan and Grant Fund include determining the process to recruit entities that can implement the program. DEEP hopes to solidify a process for entity selection by early to mid-2026, with the goal of initial program launch for both the grants and loans by end of 2026.

Funding complements other recent efforts to reduce energy costs

The funding and establishment of this program complement other efforts Governor Lamont has enacted recently to help reduce energy costs. These include:

Governor Lamont signed energy affordability legislation this year that will save ratepayers at least $300 million on their electricity bills over the next two years, and more in future years.

Public Act 25-173 was a collaborative, bipartisan effort to provide rate relief immediately and over the longer term to Connecticut residents and businesses facing costly utility bills.

Connecticut was recently recognized for its passage of Public Act 25-173 and Public Act 25-125 by the National League of Conservation Voters in its 2025 Clean Energy Report.

The $300 million includes savings to ratepayers of $125 million annually in each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027 by shifting hardship protection measure costs off electric bills to state bonds; and $30 million in savings in fiscal year 2026 and $20 million in fiscal year 2027 by shifting electric vehicle charging program costs off electric bills to state bonds.

Connecticut’s Conservation and Load Management (C&LM) energy efficiency programs, implemented by Connecticut’s utilities with oversight from DEEP and the state’s Energy Efficiency Board, continue to provide significant energy and bill savings benefits to ratepayers.

C&LM program investments in 2025 alone are expected to deliver $353 million in bill savings to Connecticut ratepayers over the lifetimes of the installed efficiency measures.

In 2025, an individual Connecticut resident participating in the home energy assessment program through EnergizeCT is expected to receive an average incentive of $1,129, which will result in $2,068 average lifetime bill savings.

Overall, C&LM programs returned $2.38 in benefits for every $1 invested from 2022 to 2024. Benefits are anticipated to increase to $3.30 for every $1 invested in 2025-2027.

Modern life depends on reliable power, fuel, and interconnected systems capable of withstanding increasingly complex physical and cyber threats.

Recognizing this growing challenge, the National Governors Association (NGA), the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) convened state energy leaders, regulators, and advisors for a two-day training in Atlanta.

The event equipped participants with knowledge, partnerships, and practical tools to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions to critical energy systems, enabling states to better safeguard essential services, protect communities, and strengthen resilience against evolving risks.

Day 1

NGA’s Dan Lauf, NARUC’s Lynn Costantini, and NASEO’s Campbell Delahoyde welcomed attendees, emphasizing that critical energy infrastructure serves as the backbone for all other essential services and systems. They noted that securing these systems is becoming increasingly challenging due to their growing interconnectedness, particularly with telecommunications. Collaboration and relationship-building are vital for success, making this meeting especially important.

The program began with an overview of the physical and cyber threats facing the energy sector, focusing on nation-state actors and emerging hazards. Kimberly Denbow, Vice President of Security and Operations, American Gas Association, and Ryan Guest, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager, Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, North American Electric Reliability Corporation, encouraged attendees to monitor external threats, practice rigorous cyber hygiene, and develop comprehensive incident response playbooks for both cyber and physical threats. State-level preparedness is essential, and the best defense relies on education, trusted intelligence-sharing networks, and vigilant human oversight, especially as AI-driven attacks become more prevalent.

Campbell Delahoyde invited Sunny Wescott, Chief Meteorologist – Federal Emergency Response Official, U.S. Department of Homeland Security; Joe Hagerman, Director, Mississippi Development Authority, Energy and Natural Resources Division; and Paul Holloway, Senior Energy Security and Resilience Lead, Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to discuss tools and approaches for forecasting and assessing risks to critical energy infrastructure. The energy security landscape is transforming as severe weather events become more frequent and impactful. States are moving beyond theoretical plans to actionable resilience strategies, such as Mississippi’s county-level resilience reports and Massachusetts’s integration of resilience planning into state hazard mitigation and utility grid modernization plans. These efforts ensure that assessments translate into action rather than remaining as shelf reports.

Mike Robinson, VP, Grid Transformation, Georgia Power Company, delivered a keynote address highlighting the Eastern Interconnection, “the world’s largest machine,” and the deep interconnections among water, gas, energy, and transportation systems. Disruptions in one sector can cascade across others. Robinson advocated for a comprehensive “Three P’s Framework:”

Partnerships with federal, state, and local agencies

Preparedness through risk prediction and cyber-informed engineering

Protection via infrastructure hardening

This approach has proven effective in securing major events such as the Super Bowl and the upcoming World Cup. Robinson emphasized that utilities must be recognized as embedded emergency response partners, essential for maintaining societal stability.

From physical threats to sophisticated cyber-attacks, threats to the nation’s critical energy infrastructure are growing in both scale and complexity. To discuss these issues, Dan Lauf led a panel discussion with Mike Geraghty, Chief Information Security Officer, New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC), and Ryan Guest, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager, E-ISAC. The panel stressed that effective cybersecurity information sharing begins with establishing trust through legal protections, encouraging open communication about security incidents. Proactive notification and large-scale monitoring help identify vulnerabilities before incidents occur. Organizations should monitor threat actors directly, share anonymized lessons learned, and provide actionable intelligence, including remediation guidance and indicators of compromise. Success requires breaking down organizational silos and focusing resources on actively exploited vulnerabilities in critical sectors.

As mentioned in the Keynote address, energy and other infrastructure systems are deeply interconnected. A power outage can quickly impair communications while loss of communications can hinder grid operations, emergency response, and coordination. Water is needed to cool power plants, and power is needed to operate water and wastewater systems. To explore these critical interdependencies and the importance of coordinated planning for effective response, NGA’s Phil Nichols moderated a session with:

Ollie Gagnon, Chief Homeland Security Advisor, Executive Director, Idaho National Laboratory Resilience Optimization Center

Susan Mora, Senior Director, Federal Policy and Stakeholder Relations, Exelon

Chris Boyer, VP Global Public Policy, AT&T

Jon Sparkman, Engineering Director, Tennessee American Water

The panel emphasized that effective energy security requires prioritizing consequence over threat and building resilience rather than merely preventing attacks. Mapping dependencies is complex, but establishing cross-sector relationships is the most practical strategy. The panel discussed the water-energy nexus, infrastructure theft, and the expanding attack surface from wireless and fiber systems.

Just as individuals and communities depend on state and local energy systems, so does defense critical energy infrastructure (DCEI) which plays a vital role in ensuring the readiness and resilience of national defense operations.

NGA’s Jessica Davenport invited the following panelists to provide an overview of DCEI.

Kevin Klein, Director, Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management

Kevin McElyea, Director, Office of Prevention and Security (CIAC), Colorado State Fusion Center

Megan Levy, SLTT Project Manager, Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, U.S. Department of Energy.

Mary Catherine Ott, Associate Principal for Stakeholder Engagement & Partnerships, Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation (OLDCC), Department of War

The session addressed unique risks from physical and cyber threats and highlighted state-federal coordination for security.

To conclude Day 1, Jenna Johnston of NGA spoke with Kristin Coulter, Communications Director, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, and Dee Anne Odom, General Manager, Alabama Power. The speakers emphasized that during disasters, the public seeks clear answers to three questions: What’s happening? What are officials doing? What should I do? Effective crisis communication requires actionable transparency, plain language, and empathy. Coordination among agencies and pre-event planning are essential for managing information demands and supporting communities during emergencies.

Sheri Haugen-Hoffart, Commissioner, North Dakota Public Service Commission, and Sam Hatcher, Executive Counsel, Office of Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, opened Day 2 with a discussion on executive and regulatory authorities relevant to energy security, moderated by Dan Lauf.

Key points included the crucial role of state authorities in energy emergency response. Governors lead by declaring emergencies, which trigger coordinated statewide operations and unlock critical powers, such as lifting truck weight and hours-of-service restrictions to expedite restoration efforts.

While the executive office manages high-level decision-making, federal coordination, and National Guard deployment, regulators focus on technical oversight and utility coordination. Both are united by the principle that their primary role is to support energy companies in restoring service through clear communication and by removing barriers.

Strong coordination is essential during severe events to ensure a prompt and effective response. To explore cross-sector partnerships and highlight strategies and resources for state leaders, Megan Levy sat down with:

Russ Strickland, Secretary, Maryland Department of Emergency Management

Kimberly Denbow, Vice President of Security and Operations, American Gas Association

Kari Heinrich, Energy Security Lead, Wisconsin Public Service Commission

The session emphasized that effective energy security coordination depends on building relationships and establishing procedures before emergencies occur.

Success requires maintaining documented procedures and templates that persist through personnel changes, conducting comprehensive risk assessments that extend beyond internal operations to entire supply chains, and recognizing that regulatory gaps can create systemic vulnerabilities.

These challenges are even greater for remote areas and island communities, which face unique supply chain dynamics. Emerging cybersecurity threats add further complexity to energy security efforts.

To help state officials navigate intra-state and interstate coordination during energy disruptions, Jessica Davenport moderated a session with: A.J. Gary,Director, Homeland Security Advisor, Arkansas Division of Emergency Management, and Kristen Ebert,Director of Business Continuity & Crisis Response, American Electric Power (AEP).

Speakers emphasized that successful energy emergency management depends on building relationships before disasters occur, especially among state energy officials, emergency management directors, and county-level managers. They stressed that emergency requests should flow from the bottom up through proper channels, and that requestors should describe desired outcomes rather than specific resources. This approach allows emergency managers to identify the most effective and cost-efficient solutions.

When state resources are exhausted, the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) enables states to share resources. While some regions also maintain interstate agreements for faster mutual aid without requiring federal declarations.

The energy sector faces increasingly complex cybersecurity challenges that require coordinated, flexible approaches across diverse stakeholders. To address these issues, Lynn Costantini sat down with:

Sharla Artz, Security and Resilience Policy AVP, Xcel Energy

John Ransom, Director of Regulatory Affairs, Grid Security, NRECA

Matt Dale, Chief Cybersecurity Advisors, Virginia State Corporation

The panelists stressed that as an interconnected system where risk to one entity threatens all, the industry must leverage tools to filter overwhelming threat intelligence and distribute actionable mitigations.

Significant resource disparities exist, making one-size-fits-all cybersecurity requirements impractical. This necessitates risk-based, flexible approaches tailored to different utility types and architectures.

Success depends on holistic risk mitigation strategies that address cyber, physical, and environmental threats cost-effectively, as well as more frequent functional exercises to prepare for evolving threats.

In the penultimate session of the day moderator Campbell Delahoyde was joined by Jesse Sythe, E-ISAC GridEx Program Manager, North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and Ben Bolton, Assistant Director, Energy Security, Emergency Preparedness & Resilience, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, for a discussion on planning and learning. Sythe shared that GridEx offers free, customizable tabletop materials that can be implemented quickly, making emergency preparedness accessible to resource-constrained entities. The distributed exercise model reveals critical insights: state-utility coordination exposed significant knowledge gaps about mutual capabilities and resource availability, while exercises consistently highlighted the need for resilient communications.",https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Energy_Security_Readout_Welcome.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:59:51.754435

Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, called the plan a “comprehensive affordability package that will serve as Democrats’ roadmap on cost of living issues next year.” Thompson is the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means tax subcommittee.

Whether the package will go very far is highly uncertain. Republicans control the House, Senate and White House and passed a huge tax relief package in July.

And Democrats are not detailing how they will pay for all their proposed tax breaks, saying that will be up to the committee as it considers the legislation next year.

By Deborah Mary Sophia and Timothy Gardner

Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is getting into the fusion power business through a $6 billion merger of his social media firm and Google-backed TAE Technologies, announced just days after industry leaders met with U.S. Energy Department representatives to urge federal funding.

The all-stock deal ​announced on Thursday is an ambitious bet on the power boom spurred by artificial intelligence data-centers and adds to the Trump family's growing roster of diverse ventures ‌from cryptocurrency to real estate holdings and mobile services.

After his return to office this year, Trump's close relatives have pursued ventures leveraging his political power and policy shifts. The Trump family has, for instance, amassed billions in crypto-related ‌wealth as Trump throws his support behind digital financial assets. Greater support from the federal government could potentially boost the value of this investment, as well.

The news put a charge into shares of the money-losing Trump Media on Thursday, sending them up 35%. The stock, popular with retail traders, had lost more than 70% of its value over the last 12 months following a big surge during the 2024 campaign.

""At face value, this is a Barbenheimer mashup. Trump Media gets a dramatic new growth story tied to the AI power crunch and data-center (hyperscaler) electricity demand, while TAE gets ⁠a fast lane to being publicly traded via an all stock ‌merger valued above $6 billion,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors.

EFFORTS IN FUSION

The growing electricity needs of the technology industry have in recent months revived interest in nuclear power, including restarting fully shuttered reactors, expanding existing plants and signing contracts for future small ‍modular reactors.

Despite decades of global efforts, nuclear fusion, often seen as a cleaner and reliable power source, has yet to produce a commercially viable reactor.

Shareholders of both companies will own about 50% of the combined entity after the deal closes in mid-2026. Trump Media and Technology Group will be the holding company for businesses including Truth Social platform, TAE Power Solutions, and TAE Life Sciences.

Trump has 114 million shares ​in Trump Media, roughly 40% of the company. In the new merger, his ownership stake would be roughly 20%. The company, which mainly generates revenue from advertising on the ‌Truth Social platform, has consistently clocked losses since its inception, including a loss of $54.8 million in its September-end quarter.

Thursday's rally was a salve for some retail investors who have watched the stock's price fizzle for most of 2025. Chad Nedohin, an Edmonton-based pastor and mechanical engineer in the energy sector, leads one of the largest Trump Media retail investor groups on Truth Social, which has more than 190,000 followers.

Up until the past year, Nedohin had been one of Truth Social’s most influential hype men - but has been frustrated as the stock slumped all year. “I can’t sit here and just be excited about a stock that’s done nothing but stupid stuff until today,"" he said. ""But today was awesome, I think it’s a brilliant move.”

WAVE OF THE FUTURE?

Companies ⁠and physicists at national laboratories have been trying for decades to foster fusion reactions, in which light ​atoms are forced together under extreme temperatures to release huge amounts of energy, a process that fuels the sun.

Big ​hurdles to commercialize fusion include getting more energy out of a reaction than what goes into it and developing plants that can withstand streams of fusion reactions to power the grid.

TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer and other fusion company leaders met with U.S. Energy Department officials this month, weeks after the ‍department formed its first ever fusion office.

Trump Media ⁠agreed to provide up to $200 million in cash to TAE at signing and $100 million more upon initial filing of the registration. The deal has been approved by the companies' boards.

The companies plan to build the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant beginning next year. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a brief, eight-minute investor call ⁠that the companies plan to ""quickly seek approvals"" after the deal closes, with siting for the plant expected to begin by 2026 end.

He will be co-CEO of the new company, along with Binderbauer. The two, along with Donald ‌Trump Jr., will sit on the merged company's board.

The Bureau of Reclamation – which manages water in the West under the Interior Department – is on track to release a draft environmental review by early January with a range of options to replace the river’s operating rules, which are set to expire at the end of 2026.

Several elements of the draft were shared during the annual Colorado River Water Users Association’s conference in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace Wednesday.

Negotiations between federal officials and the seven western states that rely on the Colorado River have largely remained behind closed doors since 2023, but any new operating rules will be required to go through a public environmental review process before a final decision can be made.

Interior Department Assistant Secretary for Water and Science, Andrea Travnicek, said the agency is committed to meeting the self-imposed January deadline in order to finalize new rules before the current ones expire.

“The Department of the Interior recognizes a shrinking timeline is in front of us in order to operate under a new potential agreement,” Travnicek said.

In an unusual move, federal water officials said the draft will not identify which set of operating guidelines the federal government would prefer, which is typically included in environmental reviews.

“We will not be identifying a preferred alternative, but we anticipate the identification of that between the draft and the final,” said Bureau of Reclamation’s senior water resource program manager, Carly Jerla.

Instead, the draft environmental review will list a broad range of possible alternatives designed to enable states to continue working towards a seven-state consensus agreement on how to share the river’s shrinking water supply.

“We want to continue to facilitate, but not dictate these operations. The goal here is to inform decision makers and encourage parties to adopt agreements that put consultation and negotiation first,” Jerla continued.

Lower Basin states — California, Arizona, and Nevada — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico — have been at an impasse for months over how to manage the Colorado River’s shrinking water supplies.

Last month, the states missed a federally-imposed deadline to submit a preliminary seven-state consensus plan that could replace the river’s operating guidelines after days of intense closed-door negotiations.

States’ last chance to share a final consensus-based plan will be mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.

The Bureau of Reclamation’s Acting Commissioner Scott Cameron said he and other federal officials have intensified efforts to bring states to a consensus, flying out West every other week since early April to meet with the seven states’ river negotiators.

“There are a number of issues from decades past that some people are having some difficulty getting past,” Cameron said, adding that states must “be willing to set aside previous perceived inequities and unfairness.”

One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.

Lower Basin states want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts.

Despite states missing past deadlines, Cameron said he was “cautiously optimistic” states will reach a consensus deal by the February deadline.

“It’s not unusual in the negotiating process that tougher decisions get made the closer you get to the deadline. And frankly, there are tough decisions that have to be made,” Cameron said.

On Tuesday, California’s biggest water districts said they were willing to “set aside many of their legal positions” in order to reach a seven-state agreement.

The Bureau of Reclamation provided a broad overview of the components that will be included in draft’s range of options, including guidelines to reduce water deliveries from Lake Mead during shortages, coordinated reservoir operations for Lake Mead and Lake Powell, and storage and delivery mechanisms for conserved water.

Jerla, Reclamation’s senior water resource program manager, said the draft alternatives will include some components previously proposed by states.

She said the agency has adopted a number of temporary operational agreements since 2008 to address changing conditions on the river. Those agreements have served as test runs for a long term agreement and emphasized the need for more flexibility when managing the river from year-to-year.

“We want to preserve ourselves the flexibility to come back to the table, to do reviews, to make consensus adjustments if needed,” Jerla said.

That flexibility to operations will likely be needed again this year due to a less-than-average upcoming snow season, that combined with a dry spring or early summer in 2026, could create conditions for another low runoff year.

“We’re monitoring the forecast, and we’re seeing not a great start to water year 2026. It’s still early in the year, but the way things are setting up it isn’t looking good,” Jerla said.

The two biggest reservoirs in the country, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, are currently at a fraction of their full capacity. Lake Mead is at 32% capacity, while Lake Powell is at 28%.

Additionally, water inflow into the reservoirs in 2026 are projected to most likely be 75% of the average, according to the federal agency. The minimum probable inflow forecast for 2026 is 44% of average, indicating a potentially very dry year.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dsc08945-1024x6831766078804.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=4IhLNUN6,N,,2025-12-18 14:01:25.631818

It’s time to pass the SPEED Act and protect America’s future.","WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman published an op-ed in the Washington Times highlighting the importance of the SPEED Act, legislation that will simplify and streamline America’s overly burdensome permitting process. The legislation will allow America to start building again, which will create new jobs, reduce costs, and unleash American energy. Read the full op-ed below or here(link is external).

The SPEED Act: Helping America build again

The economy(link is external) today faces a large but, thankfully, simple problem. Our demand for energy(link is external) is rising faster than our ability to generate it. The solution is also simple: build more infrastructure(link is external) — more power plants, more roads, and pipelines — so we can produce more energy.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it clear that energy dominance is a priority. The private sector is ready to invest billions in energy abundance, and workers are ready to break ground on next-generation infrastructure. Unfortunately, for decades now, shovel-ready projects across the country have been routinely stalled and even strangled by our antiquated federal permitting system.

As AI data centers and reshored manufacturing drive demand higher, Congress has to decide whether the next decade brings the United States an energy crisis or global energy dominance. Permitting reform — specifically the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act — is a generational opportunity to deliver higher wages and real affordability for working families.

At the heart of permitting dysfunction today is the National Environmental Policy Act. Passed in 1969, NEPA used to require federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of any new government construction project. But five decades of bureaucratic mission creep and agenda-driven lawsuits have twisted the original, sensible law into a black hole of costly red tape.

For construction workers to law professors to small business owners, the very word “NEPA” is today more synonymous with waste and abuse than environmental protection. Consider that the average NEPA Environmental Impact Statement from 2013 to 2018 totaled 575 pages and took nearly five years to complete. A quarter of them took six years or more. These delays cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars.

And even when reviews do get completed, approved projects face a gauntlet of expensive, time-consuming lawsuits. NEPA is the nation’s most litigated and frivolously litigated environmental statute. According to research by the Breakthrough Institute, it takes an average of more than four years to resolve legal challenges after publication of NEPA environmental review documents. And where do these lawsuits come from? Ten extremist environmentalist groups are responsible for 35% of all NEPA lawsuits.

The scrapped Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a textbook case. It was a 600-mile, $8 billion project, initially approved in 2015 to deliver affordable natural gas from West Virginia to North Carolina. By the time the project was abandoned in 2020, NEPA had delayed it 894 days, and litigation another 570 days. Billions of dollars’ worth of affordable and reliable energy for one of the fastest-growing regions of the country was lost. And all the jobs, economic development, and tax revenue that went with it disappeared in a tsunami of legal fees and broken promises.

These aren’t failures of planning or engineering. They are failures of policy. And in 2025, the federal government’s tolerance for NEPA’s red tape is becoming existential. If the U.S. cannot build energy and mineral infrastructure, China will surpass us in AI technology — for both civilian and military applications. That would have disastrous economic and strategic consequences for America and our allies. If, due to our policy failures, we cede global leadership to China, America would become a less safe, less affordable, and less free country.

A generation from now, we cannot tell our children that a heavily abused permitting process contributed to losing the AI arms race. If Congress passes the SPEED Act, we won’t have to.

The bill, scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives this week, fixes several of NEPA’s systemic problems by restoring the law to its original purpose: a procedural review for proposed projects.

The SPEED Act would restrict NEPA lawsuits to parties actually affected by a project and establish reasonable filing deadlines.

It would codify key elements of the Supreme Court’s Seven County decision, clarifying judicial review in NEPA cases. It would align judicial remedies with the fact that NEPA is, after all, a procedural statute, not a progress impediment.

Finally, the SPEED Act would reaffirm the scope of NEPA reviews as they were initially intended.

The SPEED Act would establish clear rules and a level playing field for federal projects across all agencies and industries. It enjoys bipartisan sponsorship in the House and support from over 300 NEPA-adjacent industries and organizations.

NEPA was originally written to facilitate thoughtful growth, not reckless obstruction. The SPEED Act restores its proper function and will finally empower the people to build.

From expanding apprenticeship programs to strengthening career pathways, state leaders took decisive action to address workforce shortages, promote economic mobility and prepare workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Governors and their staff also convened regularly to share best practices and forged new partnerships to ensure their workforce systems remain responsive to both employer needs and worker aspirations.

Strengthening Workforce Programs and Systems

Governors invested significant effort in maximizing federal workforce programs that connect job seekers with training, supportive services and employment opportunities. From SNAP E&T to WIOA administration, state leaders worked to make these systems more effective, accessible and responsive to evolving labor market needs.

Transforming Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Systems

In April 2025, NGA released Governors Reshaping Workforce Development: Turning WIOA Challenges into Workforce Solutions, a comprehensive report examining how Governors leverage their authority under WIOA to design, fund and implement effective workforce development strategies. The research, conducted in partnership with the Harvard Project on Workforce, included in-depth interviews with Governors’ policy advisors in 34 states and technical surveys of workforce administrators in 17 states.

Five Major Trends Identified:

States shifting organizational structures to improve workforce governance, with some creating offices within the Governor’s executive office to coordinate policy

States adopting stakeholder-driven approaches to WIOA planning, integrating it into broader economic development strategies

Significant investment in workforce services for high-growth sectors including clean energy, semiconductor manufacturing, broadband and healthcare

Creative funding solutions to address WIOA limitations, including braiding multiple funding sources and using Governor’s Reserve Funds for innovation

Expansion of training programs and supportive services, with over 80 percent of advisors mentioning youth workforce pipeline initiatives

A congressional briefing on the whitepaper brought together state leaders from Arizona and Tennessee to share their innovative approaches with federal policymakers, emphasizing the need for greater flexibility and sustained funding for workforce systems.

SNAP Employment and Training Innovation

The NGA Center, in partnership with Third Sector Capital Partners, launched a Policy Academy to Strengthen SNAP Employment & Training Delivery in 2024 to support state teams in enacting policy and programmatic changes to improve SNAP E&T delivery and enhance participants’ economic wellbeing. In May 2025, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina were selected to participate in the 2025-2026 cohort. These states received targeted technical assistance to identify and overcome obstacles that hinder effective SNAP E&T implementation. By facilitating coordination between Governors’ offices and key workforce and human services agencies, this policy academy will help states unlock opportunities for SNAP recipients to achieve economic self-sufficiency.

Preparing for Workforce Pell Implementation

Recognizing the transformative potential of expanding federal Pell Grant eligibility to short-term workforce programs, NGA launched a Readiness Academy to Support Workforce Pell Implementation. This national project, supported by JPMorgan Chase and developed in partnership with the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, helps states navigate the policy, operational, and strategic choices necessary to make this new funding stream successful. The initiative offers states access to an aligned ecosystem of national support, opportunities to connect with peers, tailored guidance and tools, and a central hub for reliable information from experts and federal partners.

Key Convenings and Policy Institutes

Throughout 2025, NGA convened state workforce leaders for invaluable opportunities for peer learning, federal engagement and the development of innovative solutions to shared challenges.

2025 Winter Workforce Development Policy Institute

The 2025 Winter Workforce Development Policy Institute, held March 12-14 in Washington, D.C., brought together Governors’ workforce development policy advisors, state agency leaders and workforce board chairs from across the nation. The comprehensive three-day program addressed critical topics including disaster response, AI-powered workforce tools, military and veteran career pathways, and performance metrics.

A comprehensive commentary on state and territorial workforce development successes highlighted five major themes emerging from rapid-fire state presentations at the Winter Institute:

Expanding apprenticeship programs for teachers, construction workers, and positions in advanced manufacturing, healthcare, IT and finance

Utilizing AI and innovative technology for workforce service delivery through online career tools and case management systems

Advancing data and accountability systems to track progress toward measurable goals

Implementing strategies to increase labor force participation by addressing barriers like childcare, transportation and housing

Improving workforce system governance through reorganization and better alignment with education systems

Montana Convening: AI and Economic Opportunity

In August 2025, NGA convened state workforce leaders in Montana for the Biannual Workforce Development Policy Institute. Held in Billings August 13-15, this gathering brought together leaders from 37 states and territories to discuss workforce innovation, AI integration and pathways to work.

At the event, Montana Governor Greg Gianforte highlighted his newly-launched 406 JOBS initiative, a unifying framework designed to create four pathways to employment and zero barriers to work, focused on six high-demand sectors. The Institute featured sessions on AI’s impact on the future of work, including presentations from OpenAI’s Chief Economist Dr. Ronnie Chatterji and Pennsylvania’s Director of Digital Strategy Annie Newman, who discussed the state’s pilot program integrating ChatGPT into public sector employee workflows.

Targeted Policy Academies and Initiatives

Throughout 2025, NGA launched and continued several focused policy academies designed to help states develop and implement specific workforce strategies aligned with their Governors’ priorities.

Youth Apprenticeship Expansion

As a national partner in the Partnership to Advance Youth Apprenticeship, NGA launched a Policy Academy to Advance Youth Apprenticeship to help states develop high-quality youth apprenticeship opportunities. Maryland, Montana, North Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, and Washington were selected to participate in this yearlong initiative.

Service-to-Career Pathways

In partnership with the Schultz Family Foundation and Annie E. Casey Foundation, NGA selected six states for a Service-to-Career Pathways Policy Academy: Connecticut, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, and Vermont. Utah Governor Spencer Cox and Maryland Governor Wes Moore co-chair an Advisory Board providing strategic guidance for the initiative.

The initiative gained momentum with a convening in Salt Lake City, Utah that brought together leaders from 24 states to showcase best practices. Governor Cox kicked off the summit highlighting Utah’s innovative One Utah Service Fellowship and employee service requirements for companies receiving state economic development incentives. Attendees also visited Olympus High School to observe Utah’s Volunteer for Good pilot program in action.

State Government as Model Employer for People with Disabilities

In May 2025, NGA released State Government as a Model Employer for People with Disabilities: A Playbook for Governors, a comprehensive guide highlighting six actionable strategies Governors can use to improve state government career paths for people with disabilities. With state governments employing more than 5.5 million workers nationwide, positioning states as model employers for people with disabilities represents a powerful solution to address both workforce shortages and promote economic inclusion.

Looking Ahead

From expanding apprenticeships, strengthening service pathways, and preparing workers for emerging industries, Governors continue to demonstrate remarkable innovation and a strong commitment to economic mobility.

The work of 2025 demonstrated that when Governors lead with vision, invest in evidence-based strategies, and commit to cross-state collaboration, transformative change becomes possible. The foundations laid this year will continue supporting economic opportunity, workforce readiness, and community prosperity for years to come.",https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AdobeStock_1535082983-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-18 15:59:07.254512

Subcommittee Chairman Palmer’s opening statement as prepared for delivery:

“Welcome to today’s hearing before the Subcommittee on Environment. This year, we’ve revisited some of our country’s most important environmental laws and confronted emerging challenges in protecting our environment and promoted a regulatory climate that encourages innovation and economic growth.

“Among other things, we’ve identified shortcomings with the administration of the Toxic Substances Control Act that delay newer, safer chemistries from reaching consumers; explored opportunities to revitalize brownfields sites for crucial infrastructure projects; evaluated the state of technologies to improve our recycling systems; and passed common-sense Clear Air Act reforms.

“Today, we are examining EPA’s decision last year to designate two PFAS chemistries—PFOA and PFOS—as hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as ‘CERCLA’ or the Superfund law. CERLCA was enacted in 1980 to facilitate the cleanup of the most contaminated sites around the country and to establish a scheme to hold liable for cleanup costs the parties responsible for that contamination. Superfund imposes strict, and joint and several liability on parties.

“In other words, a responsible party could be responsible for the entire cost to cleanup a contaminated site even if its contribution to the pollution was minimal. CERCLA includes exemptions as well as defenses to liability for certain parties such as ‘bona fide prospective purchasers’ and ‘innocent landowners,’ as they are referred to. However, in the context of the hazardous substance designations for PFOA and PFOS, there are concerns that the existing exemptions and defenses may not adequately protect a class of parties commonly known as ‘passive receivers’ who did not manufacture or use PFOA or PFOS, but may have acquired, used, or disposed of material containing these chemicals. Today, we will examine the impacts of potential liability for PFAS contamination on these entities. Congress has clarified and expanded liability protections before, such as by passing the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act in 2002. We will consider how concerns about PFAS liability may deter a range of economic activities and whether changes to CERCLA, or other legislative action, are needed.

“Additionally, at our March hearing on reauthorization of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Brownfields Program, we discussed the tremendous potential of the estimated 450,000 brownfields sites in our country for housing important infrastructure such as power generation, semiconductor manufacturing facilities, and data centers.

“We hope to examine whether concerns about liability for PFAS hinder the redevelopment of these sites.

“To this end, we welcome Susan Bodine, who previously served as Assistant Administrator for the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response at EPA during the George W. Bush Administration and then as Assistant Administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance in the first Trump Administration, in addition to senior staff roles in both the House and the Senate.

“We are also joined by Lawrence Falbe, Chair of the International Council of Shopping Centers Environmental and Land Use Policy Committee. Mr. Falbe will share his experience on how potential PFAS contamination impacts real estate transactions for those seeking to reuse those sites.

“Next, Emily Donovan joins us a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, a grassroots community advocacy organization focused on the presence and impact of certain PFAS in communities. We also welcome Tracy Mehan, who represents the American Water Works Association and served as EPA Assistant Administrator for Water, also during the George W. Bush Administration. I thank all of our Members and witnesses for being here, and I look forward to today’s discussion.”

Why are EVs still so expensive? Will prices come down?

The biggest reason EV prices remain high in Canada is insufficient supply, especially of affordable models. Automakers prioritize markets like California, China, and the European Union where strong regulations require them to sell EVs, and without an EVAS, Canada is treated as a lower-priority market. This limited supply drives up prices and wait times, leads carmakers to focus on large, high-profit luxury models instead of affordable ones, and results in a very small used-EV market because new EV availability has been restricted for years.

Although the good news is that EVs are already effectively cheaper over their lifetime due to major savings on fuel and maintenance, most buyers focus on the sticker price instead of long-term costs. Carmakers are not helping either, as many have phased out affordable models such as the Chevy Bolt while shifting toward expensive luxury EVs. Meanwhile, manufacturers like BYD in China are already selling fully electric vehicles for the equivalent of $14,000 CAD.

The reality is that EVs can be affordable, but traditional automakers often prefer to sell high-profit gasoline trucks and SUVs, which now make up eight out of ten new vehicles sold in Canada and have contributed to Canada having the worst on-road vehicle emissions profile in the world. Incentives alone cannot fix this problem, since automakers frequently respond by raising EV prices so they get a portion of the subsidy.

A strong EV Availability Standard directly addresses these issues by requiring automakers to supply more EVs, including affordable models, to the Canadian market. Regulation that forces a shift to 100 percent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035 will push companies to scale production, invest in cost-reducing technology, and bring lower-priced models to Canada, ultimately cutting EV prices by about 20 percent on average and making them far more accessible for consumers.

Will there be enough charging infrastructure?

Canada must expand charging infrastructure, and we are. Thousands of public chargers are being built across the country with federal, provincial, municipal, and private investment. But public charging is only one part of the picture.

Most charging happens at home or at work. Public chargers matter most for long-distance travel, communities without garages or driveways, and equitable access. Charging gaps exist but they’re solvable.

Carmakers claim that without more existing charging infrastructure we will not be able to meet our EV target. Evidence shows that this is false. Our 2023 Report with our partners, shows that expanding public charging universally increases EV market share by only about 1.5%. With the EVAS in place, this number increases significantly. Supply, not charging, is the primary bottleneck.

A strong EVAS improves charging by creating predictable EV demand that attracts private investment. The policy allows automakers to earn compliance credits by funding charging infrastructure, and supporting municipal policies that encourage the installation of charging stations.

Are EV batteries bad for the environment? What about mining?

EV batteries do have environmental impacts, particularly related to mining and manufacturing, but these impacts are significantly smaller than the ongoing damage caused by extracting, refining, and burning fossil fuels. The environmental footprint of gasoline and diesel production is enormous, involving large-scale land destruction, air and water pollution, and the release of billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases every year. In comparison, the materials required for EV batteries are far more limited, and as battery recycling expands, the demand for new mining will continue to decline.

Mining for minerals such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt must be managed responsibly. Environmental Defence supports strong protections for Indigenous rights and local communities, the exclusion of mining from ecologically sensitive areas such as peatlands, and the enforcement of high labour and environmental standards across global supply chains. Ethical sourcing and certification systems can ensure that mining avoids the abuses that have occurred in some parts of the world. It is also important to recognize that the scale of mining required for EVs is small compared to the vast quantities of coal, oil, and gas extracted each year. Unlike fossil fuels, minerals used for batteries can be reused or recovered, which means the need for new mining diminishes over time as recycling systems grow.

Battery manufacturing can be carbon intensive in countries that rely heavily on coal, but this impact is already shrinking. Canada is rapidly expanding EV and battery manufacturing using a much cleaner electricity grid, which reduces the carbon footprint of production. Companies are developing new battery chemistries that use less energy to produce and incorporate more recycled materials. Policies can further reduce emissions by requiring responsible sourcing, cleaner manufacturing processes, and higher recycled content in batteries, all of which strengthen the environmental benefits of EVs.

At the end of their life, EV batteries are not sent to landfills. They can be repurposed for stationary energy storage, where they continue to provide valuable service for many years. Once no longer suitable for reuse, batteries are recycled to recover valuable minerals such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt. This reduces the need for new mining and supports the development of a circular battery economy. Canada is becoming a leader in battery recycling technologies, with new facilities capable of extracting and reusing most of the materials in old batteries.

When all stages are considered, EVs provide a large net environmental benefit. They eliminate tailpipe emissions, dramatically reduce air pollution, and produce far fewer greenhouse gases over their lifetime compared to gasoline vehicles. As Canada’s electricity grid gets cleaner, the environmental advantages of EVs will grow even stronger, while fossil fuel vehicles will continue to pollute every kilometre they are driven.

Will EVs lead to job losses?

No. The transition presents one of the largest economic opportunities in modern Canadian history.

Canada’s auto industry, long centered on the production of gas and diesel vehicles, has stagnated in recent years while global electric vehicle manufacturing is accelerating. With the right policy support, Electric Mobility Canada estimates that up to 600,000 jobs could be created in the e-mobility sector by 2035, a transformative opportunity for a sector in need of renewal.

Despite claims from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle manufacturers that the EVAS threatens their survival, evidence suggests otherwise. Research by Équiterre, Environmental Defence and the David Suzuki Foundation shows that even under a stringent EVAS, the industry’s annual profits are projected to rise by 24 per cent between 2023 and 2035.

How far can EVs travel? Is range still a concern?

Range has increased dramatically and continues to improve. The average range of new battery-electric vehicles rose from under 120 km in 2010 to 349 km in 2021, and many current models exceed 400–500 km.

Most Canadians drive less than 50 kilometres per day, which is well below the range of even modest EVs. While range decreases somewhat in winter, it returns in warmer weather. Public fast chargers also support long-distance travel.

Once drivers switch to EVs, range anxiety typically fades. Surveys consistently show high satisfaction with range and winter performance.

What about public transit? Won’t more EVs lead to more congestion and cars on the road?

Electric vehicles are an important tool for reducing emissions, but they are not a complete solution to transportation challenges such as congestion, car dependence, or urban sprawl. We agree that truly sustainable cities cannot rely on every individual owning a personal vehicle. However, it is also true that many Canadians still need cars today, particularly in suburban and rural areas where public transit is limited or nonexistent. In this context, it is essential that people who must rely on cars have access to cleaner options. High costs and limited availability should not prevent Canadians from choosing electric vehicles, especially since Canada currently has one of the most polluting passenger vehicle fleets in the world.

At the same time, improving and expanding public transit is critical. Investments in frequent, reliable, and affordable transit provide real alternatives to driving, especially in denser urban areas. Better transit service, integrated with active transportation networks, helps reduce congestion, lowers emissions, and improves access to jobs and services. Urban design plays a major role as well. Walkable neighbourhoods, protected bike lanes, and infrastructure for e-bikes and other micro-mobility options make it possible for people to replace short car trips with healthier, lower-carbon choices. This is especially important given that the majority of trips in North America are under ten kilometers, distances that can easily be covered by transit, walking, or cycling if the infrastructure is in place.

For the millions of Canadians who still rely on cars because of where they live or work, EVs remain a valuable transitional tool. They significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from necessary trips and help improve air quality in communities, especially along busy corridors. As cities invest in transit and build more complete, walkable neighbourhoods, the demand for personal vehicles can decline over time. But during this transition, ensuring access to affordable electric vehicles helps reduce emissions from the trips that cannot yet be shifted to other modes.

The most sustainable path forward combines EV adoption for trips that genuinely require a car, strong public transit for longer journeys, and active transportation for short daily travel. It also includes smarter land-use planning that reduces overall travel demand. EVs are necessary, but not sufficient on their own. The long-term goal must be a transportation system that gives people real choices, reduces car dependence, and supports healthier, low-carbon communities.

Why don’t we look at incentives rather than regulations?

We support incentives for the purposes of industrial policy, like the United States implemented under Biden by tying eligibility to having the vehicle made in North America.

However, there are several reasons why purchase incentives are less effective than the EVAS at driving EV sales:

When automakers have their EV sales subsidized, they raise the price of EVs to capture a portion of the incentive instead of lowering the price for you. They then use those subsidies to reduce prices on gas cars.

The automaker’s current recommendations are to triple incentives. This costs the federal government more than $54 billion. While the EV standard costs taxpayers nothing.

Finally, in most cases, incentives financially benefit people who would buy an electric car anyways, regardless of whether the subsidy exists or not.

One interesting case is that China has increasingly shifted away from purchase incentives as their primary driver for EV sales and instead focused more on regulations. Since 2011, the average retail price for an EV in China has decreased by 47%, while it has increased by 28% in Europe and 38% in the United States.

Comprehensive research regarding the transition to electric vehicles and how the auto industry is fighting against clean car regulations is included in our recent report, Profiting from Pollution.

What about hydrogen or other alternative fuels?

We will not solve transportation emissions with hydrogen cars. First of all, hydrogen fuel cell technology in cars is not commercially ready to scale up fast like battery-electric cars are, in the short window of time we have to dramatically reduce carbon emissions. Secondly, passenger transportation is not appropriate for hydrogen because the technology is too costly and inefficient compared to battery-electric alternatives. For example, to drive the same number of kilometers, the amount of renewable energy needed for a fuel cell vehicle is double what is needed for a battery electric vehicle. Third, most hydrogen created today is not actually green, but in fact created by a carbon intensive process using natural gas (methane) – a fossil fuel.

Synthetic fuels, or e-fuels have been proposed by auto industry lobbyists as a false solution in response to efforts to require the phase out of gas vehicles. E-fuels are made through an expensive process which turns electricity into hydrogen and combined with CO2 to create a liquid fuel that could be pumped in a regular gas car. Put simply, this is just a tactic to keep gasoline cars on the road because no technology exists that would prevent someone from filling up a car with gasoline instead of e-fuels.

Trying to decarbonize cars with e-fuels is like showering with champagne – it would be 43 per cent more expensive for an average driver to fill up with e-fuels instead of gas. E-fuels are also in very short supply, one analysis found that there will only be enough e-fuel in Europe to power 2 per cent of the car fleet by 2035. Trying to use e-fuels in cars takes it away from other applications where it may actually be necessary, such as air travel. This makes it a distraction from real solutions.

Conclusion

Electric vehicles are cleaner, cheaper to operate, and increasingly practical for drivers in every region of Canada—from major cities to rural communities. The main barrier is not technology or infrastructure; it is the lack of strong policy requiring automakers to make EVs available and affordable to Canadians.

EPA’s August 2025 SRE decisions were based on determinations of nationwide scope or effect and should be litigated in the D.C. circuit,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor.","DENVER, COLO. and ATLANTA, GA.—Growth Energy, the nation’s largest biofuel trade association, filed briefs in the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 10th and 11th Circuits yesterday urging the courts to reject attempts by refiners to circumvent recent U.S. Supreme Court precedent on venue by bringing challenges to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) August 2025 small refinery exemption (SRE) decision in those two circuits, rather than in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in EPA v. Calumet, which addressed Clean Air Act venue, or, in other words, the proper court in which to bring certain Clean Air Act challenges. The Court held that SRE decisions EPA issued in April and June 2022 were based on determinations that have “nationwide scope or effect,” and therefore must be litigated in the D.C. Circuit, whose decisions on agency actions often cover the entire U.S.

Refiners have now brought new challenges, outside of the D.C. Circuit, to EPA’s August 2025 SRE decisions. The refiners argued that the determinations on which those decisions were based do not fit within the parameters for D.C. Circuit venue established under Calumet. In support of EPA’s own briefing opposing the refiners, Growth Energy argued that the refiners’ challenges rested on a “fundamental misunderstanding” of EPA’s decisions.

“The facts in this case are clear. EPA’s August 2025 SRE decisions were based on determinations of nationwide scope or effect and should be litigated in the D.C. circuit,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “The courts should dismiss or transfer these challenges to the circuit where they belong, and avoid creating a patchwork of inconsistent case law that ultimately increases market uncertainty and undermines the strength of American farmers and biofuel producers.”",https://growthenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-2015396652.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:00:00.081473

The legislation will allow America to start building again, which will create new jobs, reduce costs, and unleash American energy. Read the full op-ed below or here.

The SPEED Act: Helping America build again

The economy today faces a large but, thankfully, simple problem. Our demand for energy is rising faster than our ability to generate it. The solution is also simple: build more infrastructure — more power plants, more roads, and pipelines — so we can produce more energy.

President Donald Trump’s administration has made it clear that energy dominance is a priority. The private sector is ready to invest billions in energy abundance, and workers are ready to break ground on next-generation infrastructure. Unfortunately, for decades now, shovel-ready projects across the country have been routinely stalled and even strangled by our antiquated federal permitting system.

As AI data centers and reshored manufacturing drive demand higher, Congress has to decide whether the next decade brings the United States an energy crisis or global energy dominance. Permitting reform — specifically the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act — is a generational opportunity to deliver higher wages and real affordability for working families.

At the heart of permitting dysfunction today is the National Environmental Policy Act. Passed in 1969, NEPA used to require federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of any new government construction project. But five decades of bureaucratic mission creep and agenda-driven lawsuits have twisted the original, sensible law into a black hole of costly red tape.

For construction workers to law professors to small business owners, the very word “NEPA” is today more synonymous with waste and abuse than environmental protection. Consider that the average NEPA Environmental Impact Statement from 2013 to 2018 totaled 575 pages and took nearly five years to complete. A quarter of them took six years or more. These delays cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars.

And even when reviews do get completed, approved projects face a gauntlet of expensive, time-consuming lawsuits. NEPA is the nation’s most litigated and frivolously litigated environmental statute. According to research by the Breakthrough Institute, it takes an average of more than four years to resolve legal challenges after publication of NEPA environmental review documents. And where do these lawsuits come from? Ten extremist environmentalist groups are responsible for 35% of all NEPA lawsuits.

The scrapped Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a textbook case. It was a 600-mile, $8 billion project, initially approved in 2015 to deliver affordable natural gas from West Virginia to North Carolina. By the time the project was abandoned in 2020, NEPA had delayed it 894 days, and litigation another 570 days. Billions of dollars’ worth of affordable and reliable energy for one of the fastest-growing regions of the country was lost. And all the jobs, economic development, and tax revenue that went with it disappeared in a tsunami of legal fees and broken promises.

These aren’t failures of planning or engineering. They are failures of policy. And in 2025, the federal government’s tolerance for NEPA’s red tape is becoming existential. If the U.S. cannot build energy and mineral infrastructure, China will surpass us in AI technology — for both civilian and military applications. That would have disastrous economic and strategic consequences for America and our allies. If, due to our policy failures, we cede global leadership to China, America would become a less safe, less affordable, and less free country.

A generation from now, we cannot tell our children that a heavily abused permitting process contributed to losing the AI arms race. If Congress passes the SPEED Act, we won’t have to.

The bill, scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives this week, fixes several of NEPA’s systemic problems by restoring the law to its original purpose: a procedural review for proposed projects.

The SPEED Act would restrict NEPA lawsuits to parties actually affected by a project and establish reasonable filing deadlines.

It would codify key elements of the Supreme Court’s Seven County decision, clarifying judicial review in NEPA cases. It would align judicial remedies with the fact that NEPA is, after all, a procedural statute, not a progress impediment.

Finally, the SPEED Act would reaffirm the scope of NEPA reviews as they were initially intended.

The SPEED Act would establish clear rules and a level playing field for federal projects across all agencies and industries. It enjoys bipartisan sponsorship in the House and support from over 300 NEPA-adjacent industries and organizations.

NEPA was originally written to facilitate thoughtful growth, not reckless obstruction. The SPEED Act restores its proper function and will finally empower the people to build. The challenges we face demand that we act. It’s time to pass the SPEED Act and protect America’s future.

RICHMOND, VA – The Virginia Department of Energy today announced awardees for the Southwest Virginia Hydrogen Hub Planning Grants to three projects that will advance clean hydrogen production, storage, and end-use applications while supporting economic revitalization in coalfield communities. GTI Energy,Commonwealth Center for Advanced Logistics Systems, and WireTough Cylinders, LLC, will each receive $250,000 in planning funds to strengthen the emerging hydrogen ecosystem in Southwest Virginia.

“These planning grants represent a pivotal step in transforming Southwest Virginia’s energy landscape, harnessing hydrogen innovation to deliver clean, reliable power while reigniting economic prosperity in our coalfield communities through high-quality jobs and sustainable development,” said Glenn Davis, Director of the Virginia Department of Energy. “By supporting these visionary projects, Virginia Energy is positioning the region as a national leader in the hydrogen economy, leveraging its unique resources and workforce to build a brighter, energy-secure future.”​

Funded through Virginia Energy’s Southwest Virginia Hydrogen Hub initiative under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act State Energy Program, these planning grants are designed to assess opportunities, identify pilot projects, and develop implementation roadmaps that leverage the region’s existing energy assets, industrial sites, and skilled workforce. Each project aligns with the Commonwealth’s All-American, All-of-the-Above Energy Plan and supports the buildout of a hydrogen value chain spanning production, storage, transportation, and end uses in energy, transportation, and advanced manufacturing.

Together, these three planning projects will help quantify economic and environmental benefits, identify priority pilot projects, and inform policy and investment strategies that support reliable, affordable, and clean energy for Southwest Virginia. The work will engage local governments, economic development organizations, educational institutions, and community stakeholders to ensure that hydrogen hub development aligns with regional needs, creates quality jobs, and leverages previously mined lands, energy ready industrial sites, and existing infrastructure.

GTI Energy: VISION H2 Feasibility Study

GTI Energy’s Virginia Infrastructure and Systems Integration Opportunity Navigation for Hydrogen (VISION H2) project will conduct a comprehensive hydrogen feasibility analysis for the coalfield counties of Wise, Buchanan, Dickenson, Tazewell, Russell, and Lee. Leveraging methodologies and data from GTI Energy’s Reliable Affordable Infrastructure for Secure Energy initiative, the study will evaluate at least eight hydrogen production and delivery pathways, including blue and green hydrogen, and assess underground hydrogen storage opportunities to support long-duration, low carbon energy systems. The project will produce a regional hydrogen hub roadmap with technoeconomic, lifecycle emissions, and infrastructure analyses tailored to Southwest Virginia. GTI Energy is based out of Des Plaines, Illinois.

“Virginia is taking a systems-level approach to aligning hydrogen infrastructure with economic priorities, looking at what works, what scales, and what delivers real value,” said Paula Gant, President and CEO, GTI Energy. “Through VISION H2, we will build on the region’s natural gas infrastructure and operational expertise to progress energy system performance, improving reliability, accessibility, and resilience for energy users across Southwest Virginia.”

CCALS: Hydrogen-Hybrid Aviation and Use Cases

The Commonwealth Center for Advanced Logistics Systems (CCALS), based in Petersburg, will identify and build hydrogen and hydrogen hybrid use cases across Southwest Virginia, with a focus on aviation and aviation adjacent applications. Building on previously funded work and a new Energy Centric UAS Center for Critical Infrastructure, CCALS will extend demonstration, testing, and training activities to Lonesome Pine Airport in Wise County and other Southwest localities to create early hydrogen demand, workforce pathways, and supply-chain opportunities in unmanned aircraft systems and advanced air mobility. The project will survey regional industries, deploy minimally viable hydrogen hybrid infrastructure, and host training and demonstration events that connect hydrogen producers, distributors, and end users.

“This award empowers CCALS to pioneer hydrogen-hybrid aviation applications at Lonesome Pine Airport and across Southwest Virginia, forging demand-side markets, workforce pathways, and supply chains that propel the region’s hydrogen ecosystem forward,” said Karen R. Jackson, Senior Fellow, Commonwealth Center for Advanced Logistics Systems.

WireTough Cylinders: Hydrogen Storage Manufacturing Plan

WireTough Cylinders, LLC, based in Bristol, will develop its project titled “A Plan for Hydrogen Storage Manufacturing Made In and For Southwest Virginia and Beyond.” The project will evaluate the feasibility of establishing a manufacturing facility in Southwest Virginia to produce liner cylinders for WireTough’s patented Type II-S pressure vessels and also Type 1 cylinders ready for market, enabling bulk surface storage of hydrogen for regional production and end use applications. Over a 24-month period, WireTough will analyze storage needs, candidate sites in communities such as Bristol and surrounding counties, capital and workforce requirements, and economic impacts. This project will help position Southwest Virginia as a center of excellence for hydrogen storage technology and high-quality advanced manufacturing jobs.

“WireTough is proud to advance hydrogen storage manufacturing in Bristol and surrounding counties, creating high-paying jobs and establishing Southwest Virginia as a center of excellence for innovative, cost-effective bulk hydrogen vessels made right here at home,” said Richard Moore, Strategy and Business Development, WireTough Cylinders, LLC.

Dive Brief:

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed yesterday to vacate and rehear a September panel ruling allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to freeze $20 billion in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants.

“Earlier in the year, EPA Administrator [Lee] Zeldin proudly terminated $20 billion in GGRF funding that was awarded to eight National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator entities as serious concerns were raised regarding self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, and reduced government oversight,” an EPA spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “EPA looks forward to vindicating its rights in court.”

“A court just said the EPA must stop blocking the investments from our Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., posted on social media. “We created this program to support innovation that spurs good-paying jobs & lowers costs for Americans.”

Dive Insight:

Climate United received $6.97 billion in grants from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in April 2024.

The organization used the money to fund “projects across the United States that support domestic clean energy development, build healthy and affordable housing, accelerate American-made electric vehicle manufacturing, and save hard-working Americans money on their bills,” it said in a March 8 lawsuit filed after EPA froze the funding to it and other organizations on March 4.

The EPA stated that the grants were terminated “based on substantial concerns regarding the GGRF program integrity, the award process, wasteful spending, and misalignment with agency’s priorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.”

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued a preliminary injunction rejecting the EPA’s attempts to terminate the grant program on April 15.

EPA appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled 2-1 in September that the district court lacked jurisdiction in the case. Climate United and a group of grantees filed an emergency appeal asking the full court to review that decision on Sept. 11.

Armed men snatched immigrants from front yards, parking lots and work sites, pulled them from cars and threw some to the ground. Anxiety spiked for many of Mecklenburg County’s 175,000 Hispanic residents. Businesses closed. Students stayed home. People who needed medical help were afraid to get it.

Prieto, 71, a naturalized citizen from Colombia, did something he’d never done. “I carried my passport in my pocket for the first time ever,” he said. “These (agents) didn’t respect anyone or anything.”

“Operation Charlotte’s Web” disrupted lives and families and raised concerns throughout the community. It made national headlines. It’s just one of many Trump administration policies that have impacted people here.

Roughly a year into the second Trump administration, changes have frayed federal safety nets and upended practices once taken for granted. They’ve affected housing, health care, food security and education. New policies have impacted how people live and, in at least one case, where they live.

“We need to acknowledge the attack that we’re under and do what we can to support our nonprofit service providers, who are meeting increased need with fewer resources,” said Kathryn Firmin-Sellers, president and CEO of United Way of Greater Charlotte.

The effects aren’t hard to find. Mecklenburg County health officials had to lay off people working to slow the spread of HIV. Housing advocates are scrambling to ensure that people who get federal housing aid don’t lose it. Food banks are coping with the loss of one federal assistance program and cuts to another.

“Ultimately our super-hero cape is not big enough to shoulder the crisis that the federal government has created,” said Tina Postel, CEO of Nourish Up, a local food pantry.

Border Patrol officials said they went after “the worst of the worst,” though offered no proof for most of the more than 400 people detained in Mecklenburg. But the arrest last week by police of an undocumented immigrant for allegedly stabbing a light rail passenger reignited concerns among some – including President Donald Trump.

Some say the federal budget cuts reflect spending constraints as well as philosophical differences in the role of the federal government.

“It may just be a differing view of what the federal government should do going forward,” said Republican Tariq Bokhari, a former Charlotte City Council member who briefly served as deputy administrator of the Federal Transit Administration.

The cuts in federal spending have come at a time when some nonprofits have seen private philanthropic and charitable gifts decline. Tracy Russ, a senior vice president of the Foundation for the Carolinas, calls it a kind of “double whammy” that he expects to get worse.

“What I’m most fearful of is what these impacts look like a year or two from now,” he said.

For many service providers, the “double whammy” comes at a fraught time. With inflation up 25% since 2020, more families are squeezed.

“The need has never been greater in the 50-year history of Crisis Assistance Ministry,” said Carol Hardison, its longtime CEO.

New rules could displace hundreds in Mecklenburg County

Karen Pelletier, director of the county’s Housing Innovation & Stabilization Services, remembers how she felt when she saw November’s email from federal housing officials.

“Helpless and concerned,” she recalls.

The email confirmed that the federal government was making a major change in housing policy by essentially ending Housing First. That program is based on the notion that housing should be a prerequisite for people dealing with addictions or mental illness, not a reward for overcoming them. Advocates say it’s got a track record of success in getting people off the streets and under roofs.

“All the research will tell you that Housing First is the appropriate course of action,” said Firmin-Sellers. “The model is that you get people into Housing First and then you provide the wraparound supports to help them stay there.”

The new policy would enact work requirements and require – not just encourage – addiction or mental health treatment. Federal aid would be temporary and designed to help people transition to private housing. The New York Times called the policy shift “the most consequential in a generation.”

“That completely erases the 10 years of success that we’ve had in Housing First,” Pelletier said.

Devon Kurtz of the conservative Cicero Institute told the New York Times that, “Housing First simultaneously expected too much of people, by assuming everyone was ready for housing, and too little, in terms of the lack of expectations for sobriety and work.”

But nationwide, experts say the new approach could cost 170,000 people their homes, including many who are elderly or disabled. In Mecklenburg, Pelletier said 513 people currently live in so-called “permanent supportive housing.” She said the change could displace hundreds who’ve been stably housed for years.

“Without this assistance, many of them are going to end up back in our homeless system,” Pelletier said. In a community that already has more than 2,300 homeless people, what that means is unclear.

“We don’t have capacity in our shelter system,” Pelletier said.

A fraying public health safety net

Federal budget cuts. Vaccine skeptics. Looming Medicaid cuts. Rising health insurance costs. No single threat keeps Dr. Raynard Washington awake at night.

“They all keep you up,” said Washington, the county’s public health director.

He lost more than a dozen employees to budget cuts or program changes. That includes disease investigation specialists specializing in HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Though some jobs were restored, the interruption led to delays.

“The consequence of that is somebody else gets exposed to a disease,” Washington said.

Chelsea Gulden, executive director of RAIN, a nonprofit focused on HIV, told Qnotes that because of federal budget cuts, “we are poised to see numbers of HIV increase in a way we have not seen in years.”

Washington has seen evidence that more people appear to share Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s skepticism of vaccines. That includes public doubts about an early childhood vaccine that can prevent pertussis, or whooping cough. Washington said the number of pertussis cases, normally around two, jumped to 70 in the past year with outbreaks often concentrated.

Washington said there’s been a rise in the number of families seeking religious exemptions to school vaccine requirements. They “simply don’t know who to trust,” he said.

One out of three Mecklenburg residents – 416,000 – receive benefits from Medicaid, the health care program for the poor. County officials say as many as 31,000 could lose them under new federal work requirements. They say that could grow to more than 80,000 if North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion program ends.

The N.C. General Assembly has yet to act on that program, which serves more than 687,000 North Carolinians.

Then there’s the pending expiration of extended subsidies for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. In Mecklenburg, that’s more than 135,000 people, according to Nicholas Riggs, director of the NC Navigator Consortium. He said premiums could soar.

Carolyn Willey of Indian Trail said her family of three has been paying around $400 a month under the ACA. Because her husband’s income as a general contractor rose to where they would lose their federal subsidy, they would now have to pay $1,200 a month for basic coverage.

“We were shocked to see it was going up that much,” Willey said.

Food assistance shrinks as need surges

On a sunny fall morning, Brittany Mays waited in her car outside an east Charlotte church that doubled as a mobile distribution site for Nourish Up. She’s a mother of four whose husband was laid off from a car dealership. They relied on SNAP – the federal emergency food program – until it was suspended during the 42-day government shutdown.

“With the change in income and not being able to afford the high price of groceries… it means a lot,” she said of the food donation.

The shutdown only exacerbated the challenge for Mecklenburg’s 137,000 SNAP recipients. Federal help has fallen sharply. Nourish Up, for example, has seen a 50% drop in help from the Emergency Food Assistance Program. Another program, which would have provided $11 million to food banks around the state, has ended.

This year Congress added work requirements to the SNAP program and shifted some costs to states and counties. Officials say the work requirements alone could result in 17,000 county residents losing benefits.

“What just baffles me beyond comprehension is the lack of compassion in all these policies for lower- and middle-income people,” said Tina Postel, Nourish Up’s CEO. “How much more cruel can you be to keep food off the plates of children and seniors on fixed income and hard working individuals who just aren’t making a livable wage?”

Policy shifts deepen fears in LGBTQ+ community

Annelise Mennicke has received a lot of research grants in her career, including from the National Institutes of Health. But she never lost one until this year.

Mennicke, who teaches in UNC Charlotte’s School of Social Work, had received a $450,000 grant from the NIH to help members of the LGBTQ+ community who became victims of sexual assault. Mennicke is research director for the university’s Violence Prevention Center.

In March she got a letter from the NIH. “This award no longer effectuates agency priorities,” it read. “Research programs based on gender identity … do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.” Such studies, it added, ignore “biological realities.”

One of Trump’s first executive orders said, “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.”

Mennicke’s was one of 19 federally funded grants terminated at UNC Charlotte, according to school officials. Her grant was restored this summer when the U.S. Supreme Court issued a mixed ruling in a case brought by the American Public Health Association.

But for Mennicke, “‘emotional roller coaster’ doesn’t begin to describe this experience.”

“I’ve been having panic attacks,” she said. “I’ve had trouble being present with my family. I’ve spiraled into existential crises around whether I can stay in academia, in North Carolina, or even in the United States. My grandmother fled Germany in 1939 to flee the Nazis … How did she know it was time to flee? How will I know?”

Amanda Dumas knew.

She was a Huntersville town commissioner until this fall when she and her 14-year-old transgender son moved to Canada. Like many members of the LGBTQ+ community and their families, she saw an increasingly threatening political environment. Then, she said, Atrium Health stopped offering gender affirming care this summer.

“That was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Dumas, who has dual citizenship. “There’s no reason for us to stay if we can no longer even access health care.”

DEI rollbacks reverberate through local institutions

On the day he took office, Trump signed an executive order calling Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs “illegal and immoral.”

“That ends today,” it said.

Ra’Shawn Flournoy, executive director of a health care center that caters to Black members of the LGBTQ+ community, has said DEI caused the center to lose a grant dealing with prevention of sexually transmitted infections.

“Our STI grant was cut,” he told Qnotes, “and because of the DEI mandate … the administration had actually even called us and said because we had language that had DEI in it, we had 48 hours to change it before we lost all of our funding.”

UNC Charlotte had already closed three DEI-related offices in 2024 to comply with system-wide UNC policies. Money and staff were reassigned to other programs.

This year, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools lost about $6.8 million in grants to support teacher development and recruitment because they were perceived to foster DEI. Board Chair Stephanie Sneed said CMS still has to deal with the diversity of a district where 146 languages are spoken.

“Our district is majority-minority, and that demands that we lead with intentionality,” she said. “Programs that support multilingual learners, cultural diversity, and student-specific needs are not optional – they are essential to ensuring every child has access to rigorous instruction and real opportunity.”

Sneed said her more immediate concern is the well-being of the system’s 44,000 Hispanic students. With federal agents in town, some kids went to school with handwritten notes attached to their book bags saying, “I am a citizen.”

“It is the emotional impact that this has had on our families, which affects the ability to learn,” Sneed said. As many as 30,000 students missed school on one day during the crackdown. Sneed worries that they might not have had the breakfast or lunch they can get at school.

“It’s a cascading impact,” she said. “It contributes to our children being successful in our school district.”

Funding cuts undermine Charlotte's mobility gains

Opportunity – or the lack of it – was the theme of a 2014 study by Harvard researcher Raj Chetty. It ranked Charlotte and its surrounding area last among 50 U.S. cities in upward mobility. It was a wake-up call that prompted a concerted community effort to improve. The Charlotte area rose to 38th in last year’s Chetty rating.

Tonya Jameson, director of Civic Advancement for Leading on Opportunity, a nonprofit created to foster mobility, said the federal cuts don’t help.

“If a mother or father can’t feed their family, how can we expect them to be able to go to work and advance economically?” she said. “Now you’re forced to just be in survival mode.”

A survey of around 200 nonprofits by UNC Charlotte’s Urban Institute for the Foundation for the Carolinas and United Way of Greater Charlotte found that 30% reported cuts in public funding this year. Forty-seven percent reported losses from other sources.

The survey found that while most reported greater need for services and resources, 31% were serving fewer clients. “A growing barrier to community access of (nonprofit) services and resources was fear, particularly among marginalized communities,” the survey found. The full report has yet to be released.

“The threats are not just the federal budget cuts but … people aren’t giving as much generally,” said Tracy Russ of the Foundation for the Carolinas.

Ivan Canada, president and CEO of the N.C. Center for Nonprofits, said individual giving to many of the state’s 14,000 nonprofits has declined since Covid. One reason is that with higher standard tax deductions, there’s less incentive for some to give.

By some measures Americans are still generous. Giving by individuals, philanthropies and corporations rose to $592 billion in 2024, up 6.3% from the year before, according to Giving USA. But there are warning signs.

“There’s been a decline in trust in institutions in general and also with nonprofits,” said Michael Thatcher, CEO of Charity Navigator, a national ratings agency. “For the first time ever in 2024 the trust in nonprofits dropped below that of for-profit institutions. That’s new.”

It’s not just local funding cuts that affect Mecklenburg.

The end of solar tax credits could cost jobs in Mecklenburg’s clean energy industry, said Zach Amittay of E2, an advocacy group. It says the county has nearly 20,000 clean energy jobs.

And Internal Revenue Service cuts could cause delays in the free tax preparation services offered by the Davidson-based Ada Jenkins Center. Marsha Clark, director of the center’s asset building program, expects to help 3,200 clients next year.

“The bottom line is slowdowns,” she said.

Despite challenges, Charlotte's resilience endures

In late November, Manolo Betancur, whose Central Avenue bakery became an unofficial center for protests during the immigration crackdown, spoke at Myers Park Baptist Church.

“We used to feel alone,” he said. “I never thought we’d see this army of friends.”

During the crackdown people with camera phones videoed agents making arrests. Parents showed up at school parking lots to ensure students were safe. Churches and volunteers across the city collected and delivered food to families holed up at home. Students at several high schools walked out to protest the federal action.

“Allies are learning how to help their neighbors,” Stefanía Arteaga, co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network, told the Guardian newspaper. “(W)here this administration is trying to sow division, we see an organic movement of community members trying to provide support and assistance.”

Like the volunteers, people in the business of helping others believe Charlotte is a resilient community. Nonprofits coping with reduced budgets and other challenges have been working together.

In September, representatives from groups that included many non-profits packed a room in the Government Center. They shared their challenges and talked about ways to deal with them. They know, as Firmin-Sellers said, “There is no amount of philanthropy that can fill the gap that is being created.”

“We’re a tough bunch,” Firmin-Sellers said. “And we’re an optimistic bunch (or) we wouldn’t be doing this. “And so in spite of all the challenges, I think leaders are more engaged and more determined to continue to do as much good as we can with what we’ve got.

“The nonprofit leaders in this community continue to inspire me. And they should inspire us all.”

A new report from the UK-based nonprofit organization Centre for Net Zero, to which RMI contributed, considers the next phase of the global electric vehicle (EV) transition: mass adoption. This phase comes after years of targeted policy support, falling battery costs, and expanding global supply chains. It represents the steep part of the “S-curve” of technology adoption and is characterized by rapid cost reductions, improvements in quality, and stiffening competition.

Exhibit 1. EVs on the Technology S-Curve

This step involves overcoming challenges and embracing the opportunities that come with a rapidly scaling industry as well as the requirements for infrastructure integration. Three clear goals stand out: ensuring the transition is rapid, that it is equitable, and that it is systemically integrated with clean energy networks.

EV policy today, and what comes next

One in five new cars sold worldwide is already electric, and even though the US market is facing headwinds, global sales are continuing to accelerate rapidly. But this momentum is not enough to secure a cleaner transportation future. As with the rise of the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, which was supported by massive investment in roads, highways, and shifting city planning and zoning policies, today’s transition is driven by policy and technology. Without decisive policy, investment, and coordination, feedback loops could slow or reverse, lock in fossil fuel dependency for longer, or result in the build-out of supply chain, energy, and other infrastructure that is either too slow or not fit-for-purpose. Policy consistency is key to boosting market competitiveness and encouraging consumer confidence.

This article highlights four actions that can form the basis for a new strategy for the next phase of rapid growth:

Close the purchase price gap

Expand access to affordable charging

Prepare the electricity grid

Invest in circular and efficient manufacturing

Close the purchase price gap

In terms of new vehicles, EVs offer lower running costs than ICE vehicles, but this advantage is partially offset by higher upfront costs. 2024 saw global battery pack prices fall by 20 percent even as average size increased, but this hasn’t fully translated to lower retail prices for consumers. In China, a 30 percent fall in battery prices translated into a 10 percent decline in electric SUV prices; in Germany, EV retail prices rose slightly despite a 20 percent battery cost drop.

We expect costs to continue falling due to fundamental dynamics such as technological learning and economies, but subsidies and tax incentives can also play a role in closing the gap sooner. Policymakers will increasingly need to consider more targeted support for those who need it most. Examples of innovative financing models that can broaden access include blended finance models, ‘pay-as-you-drive’ schemes, flexible leasing, green bonds and concessional loans, and battery-as-a-service offerings.

Expand access to affordable charging

Without a reliable, accessible, and affordable public charging network, EVs cannot scale. Public charging is consistently cited as a key barrier, particularly among marginal adopters who prioritize convenience, accessibility, and range confidence. Survey data confirms that purchase intent rises sharply when public charging is perceived to match the ease of refueling an ICE vehicle.

Public charging is significantly more expensive than home charging — up to 10 times so in some countries. Yet, as EVs go mainstream, those dependent on the public charging network will form a growing share of users. For example, in Los Angeles, analysis by NREL finds that, by 2035, public charging could cost an additional $300/year for the 20 percent of households who will lack at-home charging access. Parallel efforts on expanding access to home charging and increasing the affordability of public charging are needed.

Smart public charging — matching demand with cheaper electricity supply — can also help close the affordability gap by delivering cheap off-peak charging to households, as it does in domestic settings.

Centre for Net Zero’s research shows that dynamic pricing can encourage drivers charging outside of their homes to do so when electricity costs are cheaper, reducing EV running costs below those of petrol cars. Lower-income areas showed the strongest behavioral response, indicating that they may stand to gain the most.

Prepare the electricity grid

The need to expand and reinforce grid capacity is well understood. But simply building up the grid is not enough. Existing approaches to utility planning are creating bottlenecks for charging infrastructure expansion. A modern, EV-ready connection regime must prioritize speed, transparency, and flexibility for vehicles of all sizes.

On the supply side:

Current regulatory models, based on cost prudence and recovery, often cause investment timelines for grid upgrades to be mismatched with the needs of EV charging installations. While EV charging sites can usually be built in less than six months, distribution system upgrades can take two to five years.

Better forecasting, guided by tools such as RMI’s GridUp, can help grid planning shift from reactive to proactive. Anticipatory investment in grid upgrades, reforms to connection processes, and increased utilization of grid flexibility are all solutions that can help the grid better meet EV charging demand.

Flexible service connections can allow charging sites to make more efficient use of existing grid infrastructure. By working with the capacity that is typically available outside of a few peak hours of the year, these alternatives can power charging a majority of the time without creating a need for more investment in the grid. This allows charging to become available faster at less cost to the utility.

On the demand side:

If left unmanaged, widespread charging will exacerbate existing grid constraints, leading to instability, rising infrastructure costs, and higher bills for consumers.

Managed charging will be a key solution. RMI analysis shows that managed charging could reduce EV charging contribution to peak demand by nearly a third in New York State. EVs could also absorb surplus renewable energy and ease congestion, ultimately lowering system costs. Similarly, Centre for Net Zero analysis shows managed charging at home can shift the entirety of EV demand to low-cost, low-emission off-peak periods. Where dynamic pricing exists, these cost savings can be passed through to consumers — around £650 for UK customers compared to flat-rate tariffs.

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology — which allows consumers to export electricity back to the grid from their EVs — could provide even more of the same system benefits but will require bi-directional capability. In the UK, Center for Net Zero finds that widespread V2G adoption could absorb larger volumes of variable renewable generation, leading to a reduction in average wholesale electricity prices of up to 10 percent by 2030.

Invest in circular and efficient manufacturing

EVs already have a structural advantage over ICE vehicles: while both require material inputs, EVs rely on a one-time extraction of battery minerals, whereas ICE vehicles lock in a perpetual dependence on fossil extraction.

Nonetheless, the rising demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel raises legitimate sustainability concerns. One answer is battery recycling, which is already advancing rapidly: In 2019, 59 percent of lithium-ion batteries were recycled globally, and estimates now suggest this figure could be approaching 90 percent. Modern processes can recover from 80 to 95 percent of minerals, and this is expected to rise to 95–99 percent within a decade. Announced recycling capacity is already sufficient to manage all end-of-life batteries through 2030.

Exhibit 5. Total battery mineral ore needed to sustain EVs vs. oil extracted each year for non-electric vehicles

Source: RMI

The need for critical minerals, and even new battery recycling capacity, can also be reduced by improving vehicle efficiency. This can be achieved in several ways, including improved aerodynamics, the use of lighter materials, and vehicle size. Smaller EVs require smaller batteries — which have the added benefit of lower costs. For example, the already heavyweight GMC Hummer EV requires a 246 kWh battery that weighs as much as a sedan itself, while the compact Chevrolet Bolt EV only needs a 66 kWh battery. Unfortunately, efficiency is not always top of consumer minds: demand for ever bigger cars continues to rise.

The goal is no longer simply more EVs, but smarter, fairer, and more sustainable deployment — ensuring that EVs work with, not against, the systems they depend on. The four actions above are not comprehensive but represent the priority areas where stakeholders should seek to align as EVs enter this critical next stage. Getting this right will make the difference for a healthy environment, stronger economy, and a sustainably sourced future for cars.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-1393199281.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 14:59:56.488336

The company says that the charger targets a 98 percent uptime, supported by its “Uptime Assurance” premium service, which is intended to maximize throughput and reduce failed charging events.

The platform is intended to minimize the complexity retailers face when adopting ultra-fast EV charging by delivering a consistent customer experience and reducing the need for multiple apps, hardware and vendor solutions.

The system is available now for pilot deployments and commercial orders, with retailers and energy partners invited to request demonstrations or technical briefings.

“EV charging becomes complicated when applications, payment systems and vendors differ from traditional fueling operations,” said Merrick Glass, President of Konect at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. “Our All-in-One 400 kW EV Charger is a game changer. It delivers an ultra-fast charge, while integrating consistent payment and software management systems that make electrification intuitive for both drivers and operators.”

Trump Media & Technology Group, the company which owns the US president's social media platform Truth Social, has bought a fusion power company for $US6 billion ($9 billion).

Fusion energy, which is different from nuclear energy, has long been hoped to generate vast amounts of energy with little danger but has so far not been commercially viable.

The unusual tie-up comes as the Trump administration pushes power-hungry AI technology that will require a massive build-out of energy sources.

Trump Media & Technology Group, the struggling company that owns the US president's Truth Social platform, has announced a $US6 billion ($9 billion) merger with fusion power company TAE Technologies, in an unexpected pivot into energy technology.

The all-stock transaction will see shareholders of each company hold approximately 50 per cent of the combined entity, which plans to begin construction of what it calls the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant in 2026.

Trump Media's share price has slumped by about 70 per cent in the past year but was up nearly 25 per cent after the announcement.

Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican legislator, said the deal represents ""a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America's global energy dominance for generations.""

Fusion power plants would generate electricity through the same process that powers the Sun, a goal long pursued by researchers, though no commercially viable project has yet been built despite decades of research.

The unusual tie-up comes as the Trump administration pushes power-hungry AI technology that will require a massive build-out of energy sources.

AI data centres are posing an increasing burden on US power grids, and the White House is encouraging the fast-tracking of energy projects to meet demand.

Trump Media generates only $US1.7m in revenue

TAE Technologies, founded in 1998, says its fusion technology could provide abundant electricity to power AI infrastructure.

The California-based company has built five fusion reactors and employs over 400 people, including 62 Ph.D. holders, a statement said.

The company has raised more than $US1.3 billion from investors including Google, Chevron and Goldman Sachs. Trump Media has agreed to provide up to $US300 million in cash to TAE.

Trump Media has launched several projects in recent months, including cryptocurrency-related financial products and a video streaming platform, but generated only $US1.7 million in revenue in the first half of 2025.

Mr Nunes and TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company, while Michael Schwab of Big Sky Partners is expected to chair a nine-member board that will include Donald Trump Jr., the president's son.

The transaction requires shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to close by mid-2026.

About Per Scholas As Per Scholas celebrates 30 years of impact, we are charting an ambitious path forward— expanding access to high-growth tech careers and fostering economic mobility nationwide.","New data shows 339 learners trained statewide through the grant, earning an average of 2.6X their pre-program income

Graduation ceremony held today in Uptown Charlotte celebrated gradates on pathways to tech careers

Charlotte, NC — December 18, 2025 — Today, free tech-training program Per Scholas North Carolina and The BlackRock Foundation celebrated a major milestone: 339 North Carolinians trained in less than one year through their IT workforce training initiative. New data shows graduates are earning, on average, 2.6 times their pre-program income, representing an estimated $100 million in lifetime earnings uplift.

Earlier this year, The BlackRock Foundation committed $1 million to Per Scholas North Carolina to expand access to high-quality tech training and prepare more North Carolinians for in-demand jobs. Less than a year into the partnership, the initiative is well on track to meet its two-year goal of training 530 learners, with graduates earning industry-recognized credentials and already securing in-demand jobs across the technology sector including Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, and Data Analytics.

The program is reaching those who stand to benefit most: 38% of graduates hold only a high school diploma, and 42% are parents with children under 18. The resulting estimated income gains are helping families build long-term financial stability.

“As a proud North Carolina resident, I’m thrilled to see The BlackRock Foundation partnering with Per Scholas to expand opportunity in the community,” said Carrie Schroen, a BlackRock Managing Director. “Helping more people experience financial well-being – including building the foundation for a secure retirement – is central to BlackRock’s purpose. We’re honored to invest in the region’s future. These students are not only building careers, they’re paving the way toward lasting financial security and I’m excited to see the impact they will make in our communities.”

One of today’s graduates, Tim Kinsey, enrolled in Per Scholas Western North Carolina’s IT Support course in June 2025 while he was juggling a series of hourly service jobs and earning below the region’s basic living-wage thresholds. Today, he graduated and has already secured a full-time Computer Support Technician I role with Henderson County, earning an annual salary nearly double his previous income and beginning a stable career track rarely accessible in rural counties without formal tech training.

“Before Per Scholas, I was piecing together several jobs just to get by,” said Tim Kinsey, Per Scholas North Carolina Graduate. “Now I’m stepping into a career with real growth, benefits, and the chance to build a future for my family — all while staying in the community I love.”

The program’s impact is especially significant in Western NC, where typical entry-level wages are $15–$17 per hour. Launched in partnership with Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College after Hurricane Helene, Per Scholas Western NC is creating pathways into resilient, higher-wage tech careers and is on track to train 100 rural learners by 2026.

“We’re just getting started in rural North Carolina, and the results already speak for themselves. When learners double or even triple their income, that’s not only life-changing for their families — it strengthens entire communities,” stated Per Scholas North Carolina Senior Managing Director Mike Terrell. “These are dollars that stay local, support small businesses, and help rural economies grow. Thanks to The BlackRock Foundation’s grant we’re proving what’s possible when talent meets opportunity.”

In North Carolina—where BlackRock has invested over $100 billion in NC-based public companies on behalf of clients—the BlackRock Foundation is partnering with Per Scholas to fuel greater economic opportunity. Through the firm’s investments on behalf of clients and The Foundation’s philanthropic support, BlackRock is supporting North Carolina families in taking steps to secure their financial futures.

“Tim’s story exemplifies the mission of The BlackRock Foundation,” said Claire Chamberlain, President of The BlackRock Foundation. “By ensuring people have the skills for in-demand jobs, Per Scholas is helping more North Carolinians get on the path to thriving wage careers in their own communities so they can support their families and build financial security.”

Today’s ceremony in Uptown Charlotte celebrated graduates’ achievements and featured remarks from Per Scholas alumni living in Charlotte and Western North Carolina, and from BlackRock Managing Director, Carrie Schroen.

Per Scholas also announced the launch of its third cohort in January, continuing its momentum and opening doors for even more North Carolinians in 2026. To register for the next cohort, check out the Per Scholas North Carolina registration page: https://perscholas.org/locations/northcarolina/.

Since launching in 2020, Per Scholas North Carolina has trained more than 1,000 learners, equipping them with critical tech skills such as Cybersecurity, End User Support and Salesforce Administrator. Alumni have earned jobs at employers including Capgemini, Humana, and Wells Fargo.

By Sheila Kennedy

December 18, 2025

Heather Cox Richardson recently explored the success of Trump’s “sales pitch,” which she attributed to his ability to leverage a belief in the victimization of White folks that Republicans have increasingly embraced since the 1980s. As she put it, the message boiled down to “the reason certain white Americans were being left behind in the modern world was not that Republican policies had transferred more than $50 trillion from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%, but that lazy and undeserving Black and Brown Americans and women were taking handouts from the government rather than working.”

I think this is exactly right.

After all, as a man and a candidate, Trump is repulsive. His “policies” are laughable when they aren’t appalling, raising the question why anyone would support him. Political scholarship has answered that question by linking his ability to generate votes to “racial resentment,” and that link becomes more obvious every time he talks about “shithole” countries, calls Black immigrants “garbage,” or attacks “woke-ism” or DEI. But it isn’t just race–Trump and MAGA have built their appeal on resentment of every American who isn’t a White Christian male: the “uppity” women who’ve forgotten their proper role, the LGBTQ+ folks who had the nerve to open the closet door, Jews and Muslims. Etc.

The base of the appeal, as the Richardson quote suggests, is the festering anger of victimhood. There are thousands of White “Christian” nationalists whose lives haven’t gone the way they wanted or intended. Perhaps it’s that they haven’t accumulated the wealth they once thought they’d enjoy, or generated the admiration or applause or familial love to which they felt entitled. Perhaps they’re among the self-described Incels.

We have all encountered people nursing these grievances. Sometimes, their complaints are very understandable; other times, disconnected from their public-facing financial or social positions. Whatever these White “Christian” men feel is missing, whatever the nature of the deeply-felt disappointment, their lives aren’t providing something to which they feel entitled. Not only do they resent the fact that their lives have failed to meet their expectations, they need to believe that–whatever it is–it simply cannot be their own fault.

They need to see themselves as victims.",https://indianacitizen.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/resized.sheila_kennedy.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 13:01:13.187088

The decision would allow Sugar Camp Mine to mine over 20,000 acres of TVA-owned coal now, and allow TVA to privatize the entire 60,000 acres of underground federal coal reserves in Franklin, Hamilton, and Jefferson counties.
“Mining at this site has wreaked havoc on the lives of Southern Illinois residents for years,” said Amanda Pankau, Director of Energy and Community Resiliency at Prairie Rivers Network.

The decision would allow Sugar Camp Mine to mine over 20,000 acres of TVA-owned coal now, and allow TVA to privatize the entire 60,000 acres of underground federal coal reserves in Franklin, Hamilton, and Jefferson counties. The Trump administration’s promises to resurrect coal largely ignore the economic realities of the industry’s decades-long decline, however the administration's efforts are already harming the health and safety of miners and leading to more air and water pollution.

The current mine operators and their parent company, Foresight, have a long history of noncompliance with mining and worker safety protections, including negligence leading to miner deaths and numerous water quality violations from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Specifically, the operator misused toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) firefighting foam in an attempt to put out a mine fire, and they criminally failed to notify workers working in the mine while the fire burned.

“Mining at this site has wreaked havoc on the lives of Southern Illinois residents for years,” said Amanda Pankau, Director of Energy and Community Resiliency at Prairie Rivers Network. “Not only do mining discharges threaten their ability to enjoy Illinois' beautiful natural spaces, but residents have also experienced damage to their homes and properties, faced exposure to harmful chemicals like PFAS, and worry every day about potential impacts to their own health.”

The TVA proposal would significantly increase the state’s climate and health harming coal extraction at a time when Illinois is taking nation-leading action to reduce its carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.

“Illinois is making bold progress on the climate crisis, and is creating thousands of good jobs building clean energy to replace coal in our power supply,” said Jack Darin, Director of the Sierra Club, Illinois Chapter. “We cannot let the federal government take us backward with a massive expansion of coal mining, especially at a site where the operator is already in flagrant violation of environmental laws and guilty of polluting the groundwater with forever toxins.”

The complaint was filed in federal court for the Southern District of Illinois. Prairie Rivers Network is represented in the matter by Rob Weinstock of the Northwestern Environmental Advocacy Center, and Sierra Club Illinois is represented by Albert Ettinger.

“TVA’s actions are unlawful, arbitrary, and irresponsible. Its choices fail the standards set by Congress in the National Environmental Policy Act and Administrative Procedures Act and are set to devastate rural communities and ecosystems.” said Robert Weinstock of the Northwestern Environmental Advocacy Center.

“TVA’s decision to allow the mining and burning of this coal will contribute substantially to flooding, extreme weather, extinction of wildlife, and other known effects of climate change,” Pankau said. “The people of Southern Illinois deserve better.”

Instead, the F-150 Lightning nameplate will live on and be used for an all-new range-extender hybrid (EREV) version of its full-size F-150 ute.

The new F-150 Lightning EREV will be built at Ford’s Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, on the same production line as the outgoing truck.

Combining a petrol engine that acts as a generator with an all-electric powertrain, Ford claims the new F-150 Hybrid can drive more than 700 miles (1126km) with a full tank of fuel and topped-up battery.

As well as the all-electric F-150 Lightning replacement, Ford has also admitted its electric replacement for the E-Transit van due in 2028 has been put on ice.

Work is already underway to re-engineer it for petrol and hybrid power.

One EV Ford is racing to launch is the small mid-size Ranchero. The Ranger-sized all-electric ute set to be the first of a new family of affordable EVs based on Ford’s new low-cost universal EV platform.

The same architecture is allegedly destined by 2030 to underpin as much as half of all Fords sold globally.

Helping boost its appeal, when it lands in early 2027, the new Ranchero will “cater to customers who want more for their money – more range, more utility, [and] more usability”.

Back in Australia, Ford still struggles to sell EVs, with volumes of the Mustang Mach-E having fallen by 31.9 per cent to just 435.

It is currently outsold by the Toyota bZ4X three-to-one.

Meanwhile, the battery-electric E-Transit is said to only account for seven per cent of total Transit sales.

From now on Ford said it would focus its resources on rolling out smaller more affordable EVs all built on the new Universal EV platform.

Finally, to fulfil its 2030 ambitions that more than 50 per cent of all vehicles sold will either an EV, hybrid or range-extender hybrid, Ford says it will launch a new hybrid version of every current series models it makes.

As well as F-150 Lightning EREV, Ford will also introduce a Bronco EREV that should offer a larger all-electric range with near unmatched off-road capability.

Backed by global leaders such as Google and Chevron, as well as multiple Nobel laureates, TAE’s unique approach to fusion has been technically validated through milestones, including the achievement of extreme plasma temperatures. Unlike other ventures, TAE’s strategy offers two paths to success: its premium, advanced fuel source or a robust “tritium parachute” that still provides a projected 100 times economic advantage over mainstream rivals. This revolutionary dual-path strategy dramatically reduces the capital investment risk, offering a high-reward future with a solid safety net, and placing TAE on a plausible roadmap for commercial energy deployment in the early to mid-2030s.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this home construction supplier have returned +12.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Building Products - Wood industry, to which Louisiana-Pacific belongs, has gained 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Louisiana-Pacific is expected to post earnings of $0.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -94.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.

The consensus earnings estimate of $2.69 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -54.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.8 indicates a change of +41.4% from what Louisiana-Pacific is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Assuming ample battery and hydraulic storage can be provided, these clean energy sources are part of the future energy mix.","As 2025 draws to a close, the Trump White House, Department of Energy, Department of Interior, the EPA, and numerous other federal agencies involved in regulating energy and the environment have shifted away from the Biden Administration’s emphasis on “green transitions” and expensive renewables, and towards an approach that prioritizes conventional energy sources and energy security. The climate change assumptions of the Obama-Biden era that guided U.S. energy policy since 2008 are no longer influential. Today, energy security is paramount, and economic efficiency takes precedence over other concerns, with federal efforts to decarbonize and move toward a clean energy economy being replaced by initiatives that expand oil and gas production and accelerate the development of traditional energy sources — hydrocarbons and nuclear.

Beyond its domestic priorities, Washington has highlighted reliance on and export of energy as a tool of geopolitical leverage and influence. Collectively, these policy shifts demonstrate how Trump II is shaping the current U.S. energy landscape. Entering 2026 and the remainder of Trump’s term, key questions remain regarding the strategies and other provisions the administration will enact, as well as how it will further enforce this energy reorientation. While hydrocarbon production and sales are ramping up (particularly LNG), America needs to up its game to catch up to China in the nuclear arena. The U.S. should also not rule out renewables if, when, and where they make sense, as capital markets demonstrated enthusiasm about the renewables.

1: A National Energy Emergency

One of the earliest policy initiatives of this year was the January 20th declaration of a National Energy Emergency. Issued the day of President Trump’s inauguration, this Executive Order directed a strong focus on hydrocarbons to increase energy and infrastructure development. Citing the National Emergencies Act and stressing the need to expand domestic energy sources and wean the nation off reliance on foreign energy imports, Trump urged the Federal government to prioritize the development of the nation's fossil fuels and nuclear energy infrastructure.

The “Unleashing American Energy” directives, also announced immediately following the inauguration, directed a broader, national-scale approach to fossil fuel development as a companion piece to the National Energy Emergency declaration. Although it did not entirely reject clean energy policies or projects, it set a clear tone for energy policy in 2025: Clean energy would sink or swim on its own merits, while hydrocarbons would receive more support for geostrategic reasons. So far, the markets are more enthusiastic about renewables than about fossil fuels.

2: Redirection of Renewable Energy and EV Incentives

Before the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill, tax incentives under the Biden Administration supported the purchase of electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy technology. This year, the credits and incentives for EVs and clean-energy charging stations were eliminated as of September 30th. Rescaling, restructuring, or a complete lapse of clean energy credits and programs has occurred. Such incentives are not central to the current administration’s energy strategy.

On a broader scale, government support for clean energy projects, including the development of wind and solar infrastructure, has also declined. Licensing for conventional energy development projects has not slowed, but permits for renewable energy projects have been stalled, many awaiting federal action and approval in 2025. Without subsidies or tax credits, some of these projects will likely incur negative ROI, while others will remain profitable, as the companies’ market performance suggests. The federal focus on financial incentives for individuals and corporations has shifted to those that support market-driven and conventional energy approaches.

3: U.S. Expansion of Offshore Energy Exploration

A notable resurgence of offshore oil and gas exploration and leasing occurred in 2025. In November, the Department of the Interior launched an “expansive” 11th national offshore leasing program, “Unleashing American Offshore Energy,” under an Order from Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum that terminates the National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program established under the Biden Administration. This program plans for as many as 34 potential offshore lease sales across multiple U.S. regions.

Late this year, leasing got underway. In 2023, a sale of federal Gulf of America (formerly Gulf of Mexico) oil and gas leases became the subject of a court battle, with the Biden Administration and environmental groups claiming concerns about the endangered Rice’s Whale, on the one hand, and oil and gas companies as well as legislators from energy-producing states, citing the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, on the other. This December, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management held its first major offshore lease sale since then, offering tens of millions of acres in the Gulf of America.

These developments reflect the broader push by the Trump Administration to increase fossil fuel production and expand offshore energy exploration after years in which offshore expansion had de facto been rendered taboo. Major oil companies such as BP and Chevron participated in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s December bidding process. They will likely be part of this attempt to increase U.S. energy production in the Gulf of America and other areas.

4: U.S. LNG Exports Surge on Global Markets

One of the most pronounced effects of the Trump administration's shift in energy policy has been the growth of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. American developers signed a series of sales and purchase agreements that significantly increased U.S. LNG’s impact in global markets. The growing demand for U.S. LNG broke the $5/mmbtu threshold for future shipments in December, which had not been reached in several years. Part of this expansion stems from the immediate lifting of restrictions imposed by the Biden administration to permit trade, including countries without a free trade agreement with the U.S.

There has been considerable growth in demand in European markets, driven by limited gas supply and storage from Europe’s traditional supplier, Russia, as the Russia-Ukraine war drags on. According to the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, in 2025 “…LNG imports surpassed pipeline gas imports in the EU for the first time. During this period, U.S. LNG accounted for 28% of total EU gas imports and 55% of LNG imports, on track to reach record levels by the end of 2025.” As these energy constraints from Russia endure, reducing supply to Europe, demand for U.S. LNG in European markets is expected to grow. Whatever qualms the Europeans may have about Trump, they have far greater reservations about Putin and Russian aggression.

5: The Nuclear Renaissance Needs More Research and Innovation

Nuclear energy also received renewed attention in 2025, as policymakers have reconsidered its role in supporting reliable energy and building grid reliability. As a result, Executive Orders were issued in May to remove regulatory barriers established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that have stalled U.S. nuclear energy expansion and to advance atomic power research. However, nuclear power development depends on economics, financing, proven technology breakthroughs (especially in the Small Modular Reactor industry), and a benign regulatory climate that eschews the “Not in My Back Yard” approach of many American states.

Moving Forward

Under Trump, the U.S. increased energy production and sought to make its industry more competitive with those of all other G-7 members. The U.S. and China supply energy at approximately 8c/kWh for industrial consumers. Europe is lagging, with costs for industrial consumers roughly twice as high. However, the U.S. is falling behind China, which has 32 nuclear reactors approved for construction, while the U.S. has only two.

With AI and data center expansion, transportation electrification, and population growth in the country’s south, the U.S. needs to secure ample and affordable electricity with a minimal carbon footprint. While the American shale oil and natural gas supply remains safe and secure, at least until 2028, the time has come for a major redesign and push for a reliable, safe, and affordable nuclear reactor fleet made in the U.S.A.

Additionally, America should not dismiss solar, wind, and other renewables, such as geothermal, when they make economic sense. Assuming ample battery and hydraulic storage can be provided, these clean energy sources are part of the future energy mix. For now, China leads the clean energy industries, from PV panels to storage batteries. It is time to engage in full-bore competition to further America’s energy dominance.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/694309c287ea3cbc42ca8a05/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-18 10:59:57.926932

Arizona Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

SB1749, Arizona's budget bill, contained several provisions pertaining to veterans. It made changes regarding the determination of veterans' income. As of the 2026 tax year, payments from any veterans’ pensions, not just veteran disability pensions, will be excluded from the calculation of income from all sources for the purpose of the exemption income cap.

SB1749 also included property tax provisions for veterans. The property of a veteran with a service-connected disability whose Veterans Affairs (VA) disability rating is 100 percent will now be fully exempt from property taxes. The provisions also allow the surviving spouse of a veteran with a service-connected disability whose VA disability rating is 100 percent to continue to claim the full property tax exemptionA tax exemption excludes certain income, revenue, or even taxpayers from tax altogether. For example, nonprofits that fulfill certain requirements are granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), preventing them from having to pay income tax. if the spouse does not remarry and the property is used as the spouse's primary residence. Additionally, it removes the requirement that the property of a veteran with a service or nonservice-connected disability be valued below the statutory property assessment limit of $31,347 to qualify for the exemption.

Under SB1749, the total amount of adoption expenses, including unreimbursed medical and hospital costs, adoption counseling, legal fees, and agency fees, that can be subtracted to determine Arizona adjusted gross incomeFor individuals, gross income is the total of all income received from any source before taxes or deductions. It includes wages, salaries, tips, interest, dividends, capital gains, rental income, alimony, pensions, and other forms of income.

SB1749 also reduces tax and compliance burdens for many Arizona businesses as the business personal property tax exemption increases from $269,905 to $500,000 in 2026.

Arkansas Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Under Act 485 of 2023, Arkansas is phasing out its throwback rule in an attempt to encourage investment in Arkansas by multistate enterprises. For tax year 2026, throwback sales are sourced 57.13 percent within Arkansas and 42.87 percent outside of Arkansas, compared to 71.42 percent within Arkansas and 28.58 percent outside of Arkansas in 2025. Sales are to be sourced 100 percent outside of Arkansas as of January 1, 2030.

2025’s SB567 adopts market-based sourcing provisions in lieu of the current cost-of-performance (COP) methodology for receipts other than tangible personal property (services and intangibles) for purposes of the Arkansas corporate income tax sales factor. Under COP, receipts are sourced to Arkansas if the income-producing activities, measured by costs, are performed in Arkansas. Market-based sourcing shifts the focus from where the service is performed to where the customer receives the benefit (the market).

Additionally, SB567 adopts an economic nexus threshold providing that non-resident corporations without a physical presence in the state will be subject to the state’s corporate income tax only if Arkansas-sourced receipts exceed $250,000 annually.

Under HB1685, the Grocery Tax Relief Act, food and food ingredients will be exempt from state sales tax effective January 1, 2026, but these items will remain subject to local sales tax.

HB1809 allows for property owned by a trust or a limited liability company to qualify as a homestead for purposes of the property tax exemption for disabled veterans and surviving spouses and minor dependent children of disabled veterans in certain circumstances beginning in 2026.

California Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

SB1215 from 2022 imposes a new covered battery-embedded (CBE) waste recycling fee beginning January 1, 2026. A CBE product is one that contains a battery that is not designed to be easily removed by the user with common household tools. Smartphones are expected to represent over 65 percent of the new revenue. The fee is imposed on consumers and collected by retailers at the time of the retail sale or lease of a CBE product and has been set at 1.5 percent of the retail sale price up to $15 per product. Manufacturers will be required to send notices to all California retailers.

AB330 delays the sunset of the state’s Local Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services (MTS) Collection Act that was set to expire on January 1, 2026, to January 1, 2031. The act requires retailers to collect surcharges for local emergency services, such as 911 and 988.

Colorado Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Colorado’s HB25-1296 ends the income tax credit for business personal property taxes paid, effective as of the 2026 tax year.

HB25B-1001 permanently extends the requirement that taxpayers add back their federal section 199A qualified business asset investment (QBAI) deduction for small business income when calculating their Colorado taxable income. Because of its federal taxable income starting point, Colorado would have incorporated this Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provision absent its addback, whereas it was never part of the tax code in most states.

HB25B-1002 changes how Colorado treats certain foreign income beginning in 2026. The state expanded its list of tax havens to include Hong Kong, Ireland, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, and Singapore. The law also requires corporations to add back the federal deduction for foreign-derived income. Originally created under the TCJA as the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction and renamed the foreign-derived deduction-eligible income (FDDEI) deduction under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the provision will no longer reduce Colorado taxable income starting January 1, 2026.

Connecticut Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Connecticut’s budget bill, HB7287, contained income tax provisions beginning January 1, 2026. Eligible farmers and corporations will be entitled to a 20 percent refundable investment tax credit against corporate and personal income tax. An eligible farmer can receive the 20 percent investment tax credit on machinery and equipment acquired by purchase on or after January 1, 2026, as well as buildings and structural components of buildings that meet certain eligibility requirements. Federal gross income from farming must be at least two-thirds of excess federal gross income to qualify for the credit.

The bill also establishes a $500 income tax credit for any taxpayer who owns a state-licensed “family childcare home."" If the credit exceeds the eligible taxpayer’s income tax liability in a given taxable year, the excess amount is treated as an overpayment and is to be refunded without interest.

HB7287 extends the 10 percent corporation business tax surcharge (which increases the corporate income tax rate) for an additional three years, to the 2026 through 2028 tax years. However, under the act, the surcharge that applies to the capital base (capital stock) tax component of the corporation business tax applies only for the 2026 and 2027 tax years because that component is scheduled to be eliminated starting in 2028.

Delaware Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Delaware passed HB255, which decouples from some of the expensing provisions of the OBBBA, particularly § 168(k), which allows for permanent full expensingFull expensing allows businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of certain investments in new or improved technology, equipment, or buildings. It alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more, which, in the long run, raises worker productivity, boosts wages, and creates more jobs. for machinery and equipment, as well as § 168(n), which allows for full expensing for qualified production property. While the decoupling from §§ 168(k) and 168(n) is effective for tax year 2025 for C corporations, the decoupling does not take effect for S corporations and partnerships until January 1, 2026.

The Hazardous Substance Cleanup Act tax is levied on the gross receipts from sales of petroleum or petroleum products. The rate of the tax is adjusted automatically in proportion to collections in a lookback period of the previous year relative to $15 million. Beginning January 1, 2026, the tax will increase from 1.12 percent to 1.1902 percent.

Florida Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Florida’s HB7031 included several tax provisions that go into effect on January 1, 2026. It created the Home Away from Home Tax Credit program to provide $13 million in annual tax credits to Florida businesses that contribute to charitable organizations that house families of critically ill children at little or no cost to the family while traveling so the child can receive care. Credits can be applied to corporate income, insurance premiums, or beverage taxes.

HB7031 also amended the definition of “corporation” so that charitable trusts are no longer treated as taxable corporations for Florida corporate income tax purposes.

Additionally, under HB7031, jet fuel, undyed kerosene, and aviation fuel will no longer be subject to the tax of 4.27 cents per gallon.

New language in HB7031 treats certain leased flight simulation training devices used in pilot training (where a government entity ultimately becomes the owner under the lease/contract) as exempt from ad valorem taxation.

Indiana Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Indiana’s flat-rate individual income tax will decrease from 3 percent to 2.95 percent as of January 1, 2026, because of legislation passed in 2023 (HB1001), with a further rate reduction to 2.9 percent on January 1, 2027. On April 16, 2025, SB451 was signed into law, representing a continued commitment to reducing tax burdens for its residents by lowering its flat individual income tax rate to a potential 2.55 percent in 0.05 percent increments in even-numbered years beginning January 1, 2030, provided revenue thresholds are met.

HB1427 increases the business personal property tax exemption from $80,000 to $2 million.

SB1 phases down the current standard homestead deduction (currently $48,000 or 60 percent of assessed value, whichever is less) to $40,000 in 2026, with a phaseout in 2030. This phaseout reflects a transition to the supplemental homestead deduction, which increases from the current 35 percent of assessed value to 43 percent in 2026, further increasing to 66.7 percent through 2031.

SB1 provides for an additional homestead credit equal to 10 percent of an owner’s property tax bill up to $300 beginning with the 2026 tax year.

SB1 also provides for new stackable credits of $150 for qualifying fixed-income seniors, $125 for blind and disabled homeowners, and $250 for disabled veterans beginning with the 2026 tax year.

Additionally, SB1 adds a new property tax deduction for agricultural land and non-homestead property. For 2026, the rate will be 7 percent of assessed value, with a continued phase-up occurring through 2031, up to 33.3 percent.

Iowa Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

SF605 provides that winnings from sports wagering are considered earned income. The bill requires the withholding of state income tax from such winnings by payors if federal income tax withholding is also required under the Internal Revenue Code.

The state's franchise tax is imposed on the income of state banks, national banking associations, trust companies, federally and state-chartered savings and loan associations, financial institutions chartered by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and production credit associations. SF2367, passed in 2022, phases down the original rate of 5 percent to a rate of 3.8 percent in 2026 and to a permanent rate of 3.5 percent for tax year 2027 and beyond.

Additionally, pass-through entities are required to remit Iowa composite tax on their nonresident members’ Iowa-source income from the pass-through entity. This composite tax represents Iowa income or franchise tax paid on behalf of the nonresident member, and each nonresident member receives a refundable Iowa tax credit for the tax paid. Like the franchise tax, the composite tax is set to be reduced to 3.8 percent for tax year 2026 and then 3.5 percent for tax year 2027 and beyond.

Maine Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

LD936 reforms Maine’s mining excise tax laws by establishing a new excise tax calculation for mining companies, which will now be calculated as 5 percent of their gross process effective January 1, 2026.

Maine’s budget bill, LD210, includes several excise tax changes. Effective January 5, 2026, the tax on cigarettes will increase from $2.00 to $3.50 per pack; the tax on smokeless tobacco will increase from $2.02 to $3.54 per package; and the tax on other nicotine products, including vapor, will increase from 43 percent to 75 percent of the cost price.

Additionally, LD210 makes changes to the taxation of cannabis. The excise taxes on adult-use cannabis will decrease on January 1, 2026. The per pound tax on cannabis flower will decrease from $335 to $223, the tax per pound of cannabis trim will decrease from $94 to $63, the tax on immature cannabis plants or seedlings will decrease from $1.50 to $1.00, the tax on mature cannabis plants will decrease from $35 to $23, and the tax on cannabis seeds will decrease from 30 cents to 20 cents. At the same time, the sales tax on cannabis will increase from 10 percent to 14 percent.

Maryland Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Several provisions in Maryland's budget bill, HB352, have already taken effect, but on January 1, 2026, Marylanders will pay an increased tire recycling fee of $1 per tire in addition to a new $5 fee on all new tires sold as part of new or used motor vehicles, trailers, farm implements, and similar machinery. The fees will be adjusted every two years for inflationInflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy, reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets. The same paycheck covers less goods, services, and bills. It is sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax,” as it leaves taxpayers less well-off due to higher costs and “bracket creep,” while increasing the government’s spendin.

Michigan Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

On October 7, 2025, Michigan’s fiscal year 2025-2026 budget bill, HB4961, was signed into law. The finalized budget decouples from several provisions of the OBBBA to which Michigan had previously been conformed, including § 168(n), § 174, and § 179. Michigan's allowable bonus depreciationDepreciation is a measurement of the “useful life” of a business asset, such as machinery or a factory, to determine the multiyear period over which the cost of that asset can be deducted from taxable income. Instead of allowing businesses to deduct the cost of investments immediately (i.e., full expensing), depreciation requires deductions to be taken over time, reducing their value and disco will continue to phase out over the following two years, meaning only 20 percent bonus depreciation is available for 2026 machinery and equipment purchases, and no bonus depreciation is available in 2027 and thereafter.

The bill also creates temporary state income tax deductions from Michigan's 4.25 percent personal income tax rate for tipped income and overtime pay for tax years 2026 through 2028.

Additionally, HB4961 reverses the requirement to offset the standard deductionThe standard deduction reduces a taxpayer’s taxable income by a set amount determined by the government. Taxpayers who take the standard deduction cannot also itemize their deductions; it serves as an alternative. by the deduction taken for Social Security income for taxpayers born after 1952 who have reached the age of 67. This reversal applies for tax years 2026 through 2028. The result is that these taxpayers may receive the benefit of both the standard deduction and the Social Security deduction in tax years 2026 through 2028.

A package of four bills was signed into law that changes how Michigan taxes gasoline and diesel beginning January 1, 2026. HB4180 amends the General Sales Tax Act to exempt motor fuel from state sales tax. HB4181 amends the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Revenue Equalization Act to exempt interstate motor carriers from the state sales tax on motor fuels and alternative fuels. HB4182 amends the Use Tax Act and exempts motor fuel from the state use tax. HB4183 amends the Motor Fuel Tax Act to increase the tax on gasoline and diesel fuel from 31 cents per gallon to 51 cents per gallon, with adjustments for inflation in future years. Under Michigan state law, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and electric vehicle registration fees increase by $2.50 and $5.00, respectively, for each 1 cent increase above 19 cents per gallon.

HB4951 takes effect on January 1, 2026, and imposes a new 24 percent wholesale tax on cannabis.

Minnesota Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Excise taxes on fuel will increase on January 1, 2026. For gasoline and diesel, the tax will increase from 31.8 to 32.6 cents per gallon. Alternative fuels will also see corresponding tax increases.

The Petroleum Tax Tank Cleanup Fee is set to expire temporarily on January 1, 2026, as that is when the current four-month period ends. This 2 cents per gallon fee will no longer be collected, but will return for another four-month period when the Petroleum Tank Fund falls below $4 million again.

The sales tax on cigarettes will increase from 78.6 cents per pack to 84.0 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes on January 1, 2026. The additional $3.04 per pack excise tax will not change, bringing the total tax per pack from $3.826 to $3.880.

Mississippi Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Mississippi will implement several tax changes impacting individual taxpayers and businesses. The state will make a final reduction as part of a scheduled multiyear phase-down of its individual income tax from 4.4 percent in 2025 to 4 percent as of January 1, 2026. Future rate reductions are possible under separately enacted tax triggers.

Mississippi is also phasing out its economically harmful corporate franchise tax, a capital stock tax, which affects firms with significant property held within Mississippi. The 2025 corporate franchise tax rate of 75 cents per $1,000 in excess capital will decrease to 50 cents per $1,000 of capital in excess of $100,000 as of January 1, 2026. This reduction continues the gradual elimination of the tax, with full repeal scheduled for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2028.

SB2835 levies an emergency communications service charge for prepaid wireless telecommunications services purchased in a retail transaction. The current prepaid wireless telecommunications charge of $1.00 per transaction is repealed as of December 31, 2025, and is replaced with a new $2.00 per transaction fee beginning with retail transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2026.

Missouri Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

HB594, passed in 2025, made Missouri the first income-taxing state in the nation to repeal its tax on capital gains, effective January 1, 2025. The passage of HB754 additionally repeals the taxation of capital gains on the sale or exchange of specie (currency made of precious metals such as gold and silver) as of January 1, 2026.

Additionally, HB754 establishes that Missouri resident irrevocable trusts and estates will no longer be subject to state income tax on income (ordinary and capital gains) that is not sourced from Missouri.

Numerous changes to the Senior Property Tax Credit are included in HB594. Those changes include increases in the income limits that qualify for the credit, increased credit awarded amounts, inflation adjustments to the income limits and credit amounts, and changes to the formula calculating the credit awarded.

HB594 also grants a state and local sales and use tax exemption for all machinery and equipment used to provide broadband communication services.

Beginning January 1, 2026, Missouri’s excise tax on beer and malt liquor will be reduced significantly for beer or malt liquor made within the US. Domestically made beer will be taxed at 2 cents per gallon rather than 6 cents per gallon as a result of the passage of HB1041.

Montana Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

HB337 makes several changes to Montana's individual income tax code. The top marginal rate of 5.9 percent will be reduced to 5.65 percent in 2026, with a further reduction to 5.4 percent in 2027. The lower rate, 4.7 percent, remains unchanged. The bill also expands the bracket for the lower rate. (Beginning in 2028, a modified inflation factor will be used to adjust brackets.) Also in 2026, the earned income tax credit will increase to 20 percent (from 10 percent) of the federal credit. The rates on long-term capital gains remain at 3.0 percent and 4.1 percent; however, HB337 adjusts the brackets to match the new thresholds for ordinary income.

In an attempt to provide property tax relief, Montana lawmakers further split the state’s property tax roll with the passage of two bills, HB231 and SB542. The package introduced a progressive property tax structure with lower-valued properties paying a lower rate, and, conversely, higher-valued properties paying a higher rate as of the 2025 property tax year. Beginning in 2026, owner-occupied primary residences and long-term residential rental properties will receive preferential treatment under the split roll, while second homes, cabins, and short-term rentals will see a tax increase relative to previous years. What was intended to be property tax relief actually resulted in a shifted burden and a less competitive property tax system.

New Jersey Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

New Jersey enacted SB3189 in 2025, which makes changes to the Angel Investor Tax Credit Program effective January 1, 2026. The program award amount will increase from 20 percent to 35 percent of the qualified investment made by an investor in a New Jersey emerging technology business. The tax credit award may receive an increase of 5 percent if the business is certified minority or women-owned or located in either an Opportunity Zone or New Markets Tax Credit Census Tract for a total award of up to 40 percent. The total amount of Angel Investor Tax Credit Program awards that can be approved annually will be reduced from a maximum cumulative total of $35 million in any calendar year to a maximum cumulative total of $25 million in any calendar year.

As part of the FY 2026 budget (A4455), New Jersey adopted a Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exclusion, similar to federal rules (IRC § 1202), which provides a capital gains exemption on the sale of eligible small business stock, effective January 1, 2026.

New York Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

The 2025 budget bill, A3009, includes several income tax changes effective January 1, 2026, including further extension of the temporary surtaxes on high earners. Additionally, the child tax credit increases to $1,000 per child up to three years old and $500 per child aged 4 to under 17, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, and before January 1, 2028.

The threshold for the mandatory first installment of estimated tax payments for corporate taxpayers increases from $1,000 to $5,000.

The Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax (MCTMT) threshold for self-employed individuals increases to net earnings over $150,000, with rates of 0.60 percent in Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District Zone 1 and 0.34 percent in Zone 2.

Ohio Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

Several major state tax changes for 2026 were enacted under Ohio's main budget bill, HB96. On January 1, 2026, the individual income tax moves to a flat rate of 2.75 percent for all nonbusiness income over $26,050. While the bill reduces the overall tax rate, it tightens eligibility for certain credits and exemptions. In 2026, the joint filing credit and personal and dependent exemptions will be available only to taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $500,000 or less.

The school district income tax on estates is repealed effective January 1, 2026.

Several sales and use tax exemptions are repealed as of January 1, 2026, including loaner car rentals, sales of refrigerated food vending machines; advertising materials and items used for printing and receiving orders; property used in acquiring, formatting, editing, storing, and disseminating information by electronic publishing; qualified call center telecommunication services; and the 25 percent refund of the sales tax paid by electronic information service providers to purchase computers and related electronic equipment.

Oregon Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

HB3991 increases the payroll taxA payroll tax is a tax paid on the wages and salaries of employees to finance social insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. Payroll taxes are social insurance taxes that comprise 24.8 percent of combined federal, state, and local government revenue, the second largest source of that combined tax revenue. to 0.2 percent as of January 1, 2026, and then decreases it to 0.1 percent as of January 1, 2028.

HB3991 also makes significant changes to transportation funding in Oregon. Beginning January 1, 2026, the tax on fuels will increase from 40 cents to 46 cents, and diesel will be subject to the motor vehicle fuel tax.

HB3940 levies a new tax on oral nicotine products beginning January 1, 2026, at 3.25 cents per unit with a 65 cents per package minimum.

It also increases the Forest Products Harvest Tax from $0.625 to $1.00 per thousand board feet beginning January 1, 2026, for the payment of benefits related to fire suppression. This tax will also begin to be automatically adjusted for consumer price inflation. Other surcharges related to fire suppression and preparedness will also increase.

Pennsylvania Tax Changes Effective January 1, 2026

As part of a scheduled series of reductions, Pennsylvania’s corporate income tax rate will decrease to 7.49 percent on January 1, down from 7.99 percent in 2025. The rate is set to decline to 4.99 percent by 2031.

Pennsylvania corporations with net operating losses (NOLs) have historically been able to carry those losses forward for up to 20 years, but the annual deduction has been capped at an amount equal to 40 percent of taxable income. In 2024, Pennsylvania’s budget bill (SB654) provided for a phase-up in the cap for post-2024 losses, reaching 80 percent of taxable income for tax years beginning in 2029. The phase-up of the NOL cap begins in 2026, allowing total NOL usage up to 50 percent of taxable income for post-2024 losses (with pre-2025 losses still capped at 40 percent).

Beginning January 1, 2026, there will be a new bailment warehousing fee on wine and spirits imposed by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. The fee will be $1 per case.",https://taxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AdobeStock_1838645845-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-18 12:01:22.579658

Whether families face massive premium increases in 2026 depends on Senate action.","More than 20 million Americans with marketplace coverage are approaching an affordability cliff. The expiration of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits on December 31, 2025, will cause average premium costs to more than double in 2026.

After months of congressional Republican obstruction, a discharge petition will now force the House to vote on a clean, three-year extension of the enhanced premium tax credits in January. That vote creates a clear path forward to preserving affordability. However, preventing massive premium increases in 2026 will ultimately depend on whether the Senate acts to protect families from higher health insurance costs.

A new analysis by the Center for American Progress Action Fund finds that 2026 ACA health insurance marketplace premium costs will increase by thousands of dollars in 13 states where Republican senators could face accountability from voters, are retiring, or may otherwise be persuadable.

A hypothetical family of four (40- and 38-year-old parents of two children, ages 14 and 12) with an annual income of $161,000 in Anchorage, Alaska, would pay more than $25,100 in annual additional premium costs if the tax credits expire.

The financial strain would extend to single-parent households as well. A 55-year-old parent with an 18-year-old earning $85,000 annually in Portland, Maine, would face a $12,700 increase in annual premiums.

Young adults would also see higher costs. In Huntsville, Alabama, a 27-year-old earning $63,000 annually would need to pay an additional $1,365 to keep their marketplace coverage.

Older adults would face the steepest increases. For instance, in Charleston, West Virginia, premiums for a 62-year-old couple making $85,000 could surge by nearly $52,000.

Conclusion

The House vote is now unavoidable. Whether families face massive premium increases in 2026 depends on Senate action.

The National Petroleum Council’s (“NPC”) Committee on Oil and Natural Gas Infrastructure Permitting issued a December 3rd draft report titled:

Bottleneck to Breakthrough: A Permitting Blueprint to Build (“Report”).

NPC describes the Report as providing:

… practical solutions to modernize permitting and catalyze investment in America’s energy infrastructure.

The Report was prepared at the request of Secretary of Energy Chris Wright asking that the NPC undertake a Future Energy Systems study to provide advice on ensuring the availability of affordable, reliable, and secure energy for American consumers and allies. The request is stated to have specifically called for the delivery of a short-term study on streamlining and expediting oil and natural gas infrastructure permitting to meet future energy needs.

What are described as “focal points” of the permitting study include:

Recent major economic and geopolitical developments affecting energy delivery and demand.

Inefficiencies experienced under existing permitting laws, processes, and coordination efforts.

Administrative and legislative reforms to accelerate approvals without compromising environmental protections.

What are described as systemic permitting barriers delaying timely approvals and hindering efficient construction of energy infrastructure are stated to include:

Lengthy, fragmented reviews.

Litigation-driven delays.

Regulatory inconsistency.

Capacity shortfalls.

Infrastructure bottlenecks.

By way of summary of conclusions, the Report proposes what is described as a “two-pronged approach” that includes:

Immediate reforms to streamline existing processes, referencing clarification of National Environmental Policy Act reviews and reducing procedural delays.

Development of a new, standardized permitting framework for qualified projects.

The study team preparing the report is described as approximately 110 experts from over 40 organizations. Some of the participants are stated to have originated from outside of the oil and gas industry.

NPC describes itself as an organization whose sole purpose it to provide advice to the federal government. There are about 200 NPC members which are appointed by the Department of Energy’s Secretary that include:

All segments of the oil and natural gas industry.

All segments of the country.

Large and small companies.

With a major radius of 8 meters, Helios is the most compact optimized stellarator power plant architecture, according to the company.
Next steps: In the next few years, Thea Energy plans to verify and de-risk the operation of the plasma and subsystems in its large-scale demonstration facility, Eos, which is scheduled to be operational by 2030.
Quotables: “Helios does not rely on future scientific breakthroughs,” said David Gates, cofounder and chief technology officer of Thea Energy.
Other innovations include the power handling scheme, where a topology closely related to the conventional tokamak solution has been found for the first time in a stellarator power plant design.”","Formerly Princeton Stellarators, Thea Energy is a spin-out of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Princeton University and was one of eight companies selected in 2023 for the Department of Energy’s Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program. According to the company, the completion of the preconceptual Helios design meets the last major milestone in the initial phase of the DOE’s public-private program to develop fusion pilot plant designs and resolve related scientific and technological challenges.

Paper reactor: Thea Energy has released an unpublished paper, “Overview of the Helios Design: A Practical Planar Coil Stellarator Fusion Power Plant,” that details the Helios design. According to the company, the system combines software-controlled magnet coils that are adaptable to real-world conditions, a stellarator divertor exhaust system capable of fusion power operations, and a sector-based maintenance scheme enabling long-term plant viability.

Based on a planar coil stellarator architecture, Helios has a thermal power output of 1.1 GW, with the capability of producing 390 MW of net electric power. The electromagnetic coil set is high-temperature superconducting and consists of 12 large, plasma-encircling coils, like the toroidal field coils of a tokamak, and 324 smaller, field-shaping coils. The coils have a maximum magnetic field strength of 20 tesla.

With a major radius of 8 meters, Helios is the most compact optimized stellarator power plant architecture, according to the company.

Next steps: In the next few years, Thea Energy plans to verify and de-risk the operation of the plasma and subsystems in its large-scale demonstration facility, Eos, which is scheduled to be operational by 2030.

Thea Energy said it is currently in conversations with five states for the siting of Eos and expects to select and announce a location for the integrated system in 2026. The company added that it is on track to operate Helios in the 2030s.

Quotables: “Helios does not rely on future scientific breakthroughs,” said David Gates, cofounder and chief technology officer of Thea Energy. “Helios is designed to combine the inherent benefits of the stellarator—steady-state operation, no risk of damaging disruptions, and high efficiency—with programmable, planar magnets. This is the evolution of the stellarator for commercialization. Our proprietary architecture can individually control hundreds of magnets using a software stack to configure stellarator magnetic fields, while accounting for manufacturing and assembly errors as well as system wear and tear over its operational lifetime.”

Carlos Paz-Soldan, associate professor of applied physics and applied mathematics at Columbia University, added, “Thea Energy’s design presents several significant innovations on the conventional approach to build stellarators. The planar coils are easier to manufacture and promise to reduce overall system complexity. They also provide new flexibility to the concept and facilitate plant maintenance. Other innovations include the power handling scheme, where a topology closely related to the conventional tokamak solution has been found for the first time in a stellarator power plant design.”",https://www.ans.org/file/23003/l/Picture1.png,N,,2025-12-18 11:00:11.027566

The Lionheart Project aims to produce 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) per year. This refined form of lithium is used in batteries and the projected output will be enough to power around 500,000 electric vehicles annually.

Vulcan’s approach combines lithium extraction with the generation of renewable energy, aiming to deliver 275 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity and 560 GWh of heat.

This dual output supports both industrial operations and contributes to broader clean energy goals.

The integrated nature of the facility means that Vulcan can supply lithium and renewable energy from a single project location, offering a more sustainable option for downstream manufacturers.

The company has already secured agreements to supply lithium from 2028 for 10 years to major companies including Stellantis, LG Corp, Umicore and Glencore. These offtake agreements are designed to support a stable supply of lithium for battery manufacturing across Europe.

Speaking to Reuters, Francis Wedin, Executive Chair of Vulcan Energy, said construction was now fully funded and set to begin immediately. He confirmed the project would take two-and-a-half years, with full-scale operations expected once commissioning is complete.

Multi-layered financing

Vulcan’s funding package totals US$2.56bn and combines equity, grants and debt. The equity component includes up to US$709m raised through institutional placements and entitlement offers at a fixed price of US$2.63 per new share.

This financing is backed by 13 financial institutions including the European Investment Bank, five export credit agencies and seven commercial banks. Vulcan has also received US$122m in German government grants as part of Berlin’s strategy to reduce reliance on imported raw materials and strengthen domestic electric vehicle production.

The partnership with ABB stems from a Memorandum of Understanding signed back in April 2024. It aims to streamline engineering, optimise supply chains and reduce project costs. Under the agreement, ABB’s electrification expertise supports Vulcan’s renewable lithium process.

Cris Moreno, Managing Director and CEO at Vulcan Energy, comments: ""ABB’s expertise and systems give us the certainty to scale efficiently. Together, we are establishing a robust model for industrial lithium production to meet market momentum while enabling battery supply chain decarbonisation at scale.”

ABB technology to underpin clean energy goals

ABB’s scope covers high-, medium- and low-voltage electrical systems, including switchgear, transformers, protection equipment and uninterruptible power supplies. The goal is to ensure a stable and efficient flow of electricity from the 110 kilovolt (kV) grid through to every process within the facility.

By handling the design, engineering, manufacturing, testing and delivery, ABB ensures that every aspect of electrical performance aligns with both safety and sustainability standards. The company’s MNS low-voltage switchgear, already used across mining and industrial sites worldwide, is a central part of the infrastructure.

As Vulcan prepares for full-scale construction, ABB’s electrical systems will play a critical role in delivering power safely and reliably.

With lithium output backed by long-term contracts and supported by a network of institutional investors, the Lionheart Project is positioned to become a cornerstone in Europe’s transition to clean energy and sustainable mobility.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/03fa87a5f7d02e71a87a239d771dfdac:6cb6d2a37d15db2177412515609bfed2/vulcan-groundbreaking.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:59:54.757501

Residential rate hikes are higher, in part, because they fund distribution upgrades that don’t serve industrial customers, according to Duke Energy.

“This comes after a year during which Duke Energy made record profits,” Cohen said.
Duke Energy announced $1.4 billion in profits last quarter, up 11% from last fall.","Under the proposal, residential rates for Duke Energy Carolinas customers would increase nearly 12%, and by more than 14% for Duke Energy Progress customers. This is what Duke is proposing:

Residential rates for DEC customers would increase 11.9% in 2027 and 4% in 2028.

Residential rates for DEP customers would increase 14.1% in 2027 and 3.5% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEC customers would increase 8.7% in 2027 and 3.9% in 2028.

Commercial rates for DEP customers would increase 9.2% in 2027 and 4.6% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEC customers would increase 6.3% in 2027 and 3.4% in 2028.

Industrial rates for DEP customers would increase 7.4% in 2027 and 4.3% in 2028.

Residential rate hikes are higher, in part, because they fund distribution upgrades that don’t serve industrial customers, according to Duke Energy. That includes the lines that deliver power to homes and neighborhoods.

Shannon Binns, executive director of Sustain Charlotte, said low- to moderate-income households are being squeezed from both sides.

“It is harder to pay the bills when all the bills keep going up, and income is not going up in the same way,” Binns said. His nonprofit returned a $10,000 sponsorship to Duke Energy early this year. The move came after Binns learned that the utility signed on to a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin requesting that the federal agency roll back carbon and coal ash regulations.

Asheville resident Rachel Cohen expressed a similar sentiment toward the rate hikes during a public utility hearing Tuesday night.

“This comes after a year during which Duke Energy made record profits,” Cohen said.

Duke Energy announced $1.4 billion in profits last quarter, up 11% from last fall. The rate increases will need approval from state regulators.

“It was shocking in a sense that they would be so brazen as to ask for such a dramatic increase, which, of course, higher electric bills fall much harder on low- and middle-income households and seniors and people on fixed incomes, given that they just had a record year for profits,” Binns said.

Binns said recent legislation, such as SB 266, has made it easier for the utility to build riskier new nuclear facilities, as well as new natural gas plants, “adding more fossil fuels and the gases that are heating up our planet.”

Duke Energy proposed a new resource plan earlier that would allow the utility to build 9,650 megawatts of new natural gas capacity over the next decade. Duke representatives said the company still aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, relying on new nuclear facilities to replace energy generated by new natural gas turbines.

Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton said these rate hikes are going toward funding grid hardening and “smart-healing technology.” These projects include “the steel poles along the Swannanoa River that withstood Hurricane Helene.”

“Such grid investments are the majority of the current rate review request,” Norton said in a written response to WFAE. “Other factors in the rate request include weatherization and reliability upgrades for our existing power plants, as well as solar already approved and installed under the initial Carbon Plan. Those are applicable to the current rate case, not to future resource plan projections.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41646e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7214x3787+0+135/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2e%2F49%2Fa07aaf414a1eab92e6c7a6132501%2Fduke-energy-lineman-at-work02-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:00:44.332868

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email.
While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom.","Calls are mounting for the largest U.S. grid operator to make electricity more affordable after power costs again surged to a new high.

Households and businesses from New Jersey to Chicago will pay a record of $16.4 billion to secure electricity starting in the year starting June 2027, according to PJM Interconnection LLC, which operates the 13-state grid that serves nearly one-fifth of Americans, including customers in southwest Michigan. That fee will come on top of what consumers pay for the power they actually use, plus other line items on their bills such as charges for maintaining and expanding the power lines.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid. The results released Wednesday show the daily cost of those payouts rose to $333.44 per megawatt from $329.17, which will show up in users’ monthly utility bills. Prices were as low as $29 a megawatt in 2023.

“The amount of pressure on PJM is enormous,” said Daniel Palken, director of infrastructure for energy and permitting at philanthropy Arnold Ventures. “The people’s hackles are up.”

It’s the third consecutive record-breaking auction held by PJM, a process that has emerged as a focus of the national debate on affordability. Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory. Meanwhile, governors across the region have called on PJM to make changes to lower the cost of electricity amid a massive buildout of AI data centers that has fueled record demand and prices.

The biggest beneficiaries of the auction will be independent power generators. Vistra Corp., which rose as much as 2.7% in early trading Thursday, earned $1.29 billion in the auction. Talen Energy Corp. cleared $1.07 billion and saw shares jump 5.6%. Constellation Energy Corp. earned $2.19 billion, with shares up 2.7%.

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email. “I’m angry. it didn’t have to be this way.”

Constellation is responding to high prices by investing billions in adding capacity, spokesperson Paul Adams said in an email. The firm has also proposed adding 5,800 megawatts of supplies, including storage, in Maryland and increasing output from its existing nuclear fleet by about 1,000 megawatts.

“The increased demand necessitated by America’s national security imperative of winning the AI race is challenging PJM’s system reserve requirement in this most recent auction,” Adams said.

Vistra and Talen didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog. And in the latest auction, it comprised the majority of new demand, Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy, said on a call with reporters Wednesday.

“The energy market is not capable of meeting unlimited growth in a short amount of time without having massive price increases accompany that,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy in Indiana.

In spite of the skyrocketing costs, the auction for a second year didn’t manage to secure enough supply to meet projected demand. While the grid needs a 20% reserve margin to ensure reliability, the auction only cleared 14.8%.

That means the grid will be 6.6 gigawatts short — the equivalent of six big nuclear reactors — versus about 200 megawatts in the previous auction. PJM will need to procure more supplies through incremental follow-up auctions, Bresler said.

Costs would be even higher if not for a price cap negotiated last year. But PJM hasn’t decided whether to extend that price ceiling to further auctions. With Wednesday’s results hitting the limit, the grid operator will be more likely to move forward with an extension, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

“I think this price cap is in place indefinitely for the time being,” said Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Preserving the cap is controversial, though. While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory. While six governors have asked for an extension, Citigroup analyst Ryan Levine said it’s unlikely.

Pennsylvania consumers will pay about $126 for the 12-month period starting June 2027, according to a statement. In the next auction, the price cap — typically based on the cost of building new gas plants — is set to more than double to $776, but PJM is seeking approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adjust how it prices supplies, which could cut that cap to about $550. Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.

PJM’s board is working on a proposal to integrate data centers to help them connect to the grid faster and potentially mitigate the impact on consumers. A dozen proposals failed to pass last month. FERC could provide guidance as early as Thursday on how to divvy up transmission charges for certain data center projects co-located with power plants.

The tech giants building those facilities — Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. — will closely be watched to see if they step up to help alleviate that pressure.

In the meantime, the impact of the rising auction prices will be felt most in states like New Jersey and Maryland where utilities rely heavily on the capacity market, said Mark Christie, former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman. But even Virginia, which can pay for power plants through utility rates, is seeing its own “generation deficit grow rapidly” as data center growth accelerates there, he said.

Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers. PJM is in the processing of finalizing an $11.6 billion plan to build out the wires, substations and other related infrastructure largely to meet soaring demand from data centers, which would be paid for by consumers.

“PJM needs real reform and they are running out of time to protect consumers from their inaction,” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement after the auction.

Here's a New Estimate,"Dan Gearino, Nicholas Kusnetz",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18122025/inside-clean-energy-rooftop-solar-electricity-rates/,"The larger point is that rooftop solar increases costs for other consumers while EVs lower them; the size of these effects is likely to increase as market share for solar and EVs rises, according to Linn.
He argues that policymakers should understand the amount of the cost shift to make informed decisions when crafting policies related to rooftop solar.
I asked John Farrell, a rooftop solar advocate and co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Relience, to read and respond to the paper.
I think we need to continually monitor how the growth in rooftop solar and EVs will affect the electricity system and the prices paid by other consumers.
To put it another way, the cost shifts linked to rooftop solar are not near the top of my list of problems to be solved right now.","One of the most divisive topics among environmental advocates and researchers is the claim that the growth of rooftop solar leads to a concerning transfer of costs from households that have solar to those that don’t.

Most people who have studied this agree there is some shift in costs, but they disagree on how much and whether it’s too much.

A recent working paper from economists at the University of Maryland offers a novel way of looking at this issue by examining how rooftop solar and electric vehicles affect electricity demand for the population as a whole, and how each contributes to changes in electricity costs for the public as a whole.

The results, I suspect, will be frustrating for solar advocates and encouraging for EV advocates. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

The paper was written by a team that includes Joshua Linn, who teaches economics at the University of Maryland and is a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that studies energy and the environment. As is common for economics research, the authors are gathering feedback and will revise the paper with the aim of publishing a peer-reviewed version.

Linn and his co-authors found that adoption of rooftop solar has led to a 2.35 percent decrease in electricity utilities’ revenue, which the companies have partially recovered by increasing customer rates by 1.48 percent.

Those are small numbers. But they become more significant when the authors zoom in on the effects on low-income households without solar. The upshot is that these households experience, by far, the most significant negative effects, while high-income households have a net benefit because they gain a large share of the cost savings from using rooftop solar.

The authors found that the use of EVs helps to reduce electricity rates for all consumers, with utilities benefitting from a 0.44 percent increase in revenue and consumers a 0.23 decrease in costs.

Again, small numbers. The larger point is that rooftop solar increases costs for other consumers while EVs lower them; the size of these effects is likely to increase as market share for solar and EVs rises, according to Linn.

The analysis looks at electricity consumers as a whole, including some with solar and some with EVs, some with both, and a large majority that have neither.

“When you put solar panels on your home, you’re imposing a cost on somebody else,” Linn said in an interview.

Linn is not suggesting that the costs exceed the environmental benefits. He argues that policymakers should understand the amount of the cost shift to make informed decisions when crafting policies related to rooftop solar.

The authors make clear that their findings should be understood as short-term effects which cover two to three years. So, we cannot extrapolate the effects on rates in a decade or more.

One of my initial reactions was that the findings could be used to justify policies that support the business interests of utility companies. Utilities tend to oppose rooftop solar and want to encourage EVs, and the companies have used their lobbying power to change net metering policies in states such as California, reducing the financial benefits of solar.

Linn said he doesn’t intend to support any industry’s agenda and that this research didn’t receive any corporate funding. His larger concern, he said, was quantifying how solar and EVs affect the roughly 95 percent of consumers who have neither.

I asked John Farrell, a rooftop solar advocate and co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Relience, to read and respond to the paper. His organization views customer-owned energy resources as essential for creating a more equitable economy and counteracting the harm often done by monopoly utilities.

Farrell said that the paper’s focus on short-term effects is a serious flaw because investments in rooftop solar and other energy-saving technologies yield benefits best understood in timelines that are decades long.

“In a short timeframe, my purchase of solar panels or an energy-efficient fridge will reduce demand and (very slightly) increase the necessary rates to recover costs,” he said, in an email. “But over the lifetime of that investment, the utility can reduce supply contracts, defer transformer upgrades, etc.”

His conclusion: “Doing this study is an interesting intellectual exercise but … it loses sight of the forest for the trees.”

I wouldn’t go that far. I think we need to continually monitor how the growth in rooftop solar and EVs will affect the electricity system and the prices paid by other consumers.

It’s worth noting that the cost shifts in the paper appear small relative to the large rate increases that have happened this year as utilities upgrade their systems to accommodate data centers and other large users.

To put it another way, the cost shifts linked to rooftop solar are not near the top of my list of problems to be solved right now. But 10 years from now, following more consumer adoption, it may be a different story.

So many unprecedented things have happened, that historians will have no shortage of harrowing lessons to be learned from this era.

In the clean energy space, the Trump administration launched attack after attack to slow down the clean energy in favor of fossil fuels, killing projects, investments, and jobs. By rescinding clean energy funding, pushing to abolish tax credits, coordinating across the administration to interfere with wind and solar, and so much more, they’ve set us up for bitter harvests for years to come.

And yet…

Clean energy is strong. And in 2025, it showed its strength in some really notable ways, as momentum, economics, policies, and people carried clean energy progress forward, despite it all. And it seems all the more important to celebrate it this year.

So, here are clean energy bright spots worthy of resounding cheers.

Powering up

One pillar of progress has been growth in renewable energy capacity, for more clean electricity and all the other benefits clean energy brings. And one clear shining star for 2025 is the US solar sector:

2025 looks set to land just a hair’s breadth away from breaking the record for new US solar installations set in 2024. Texas continued to be the leader in new solar, followed by California and—wait for it—Indiana (up from 15th two years ago). Overall, July to September 2025 was the third best quarter ever for new solar installations.

Solar accounted for almost 80% of new electrical generating capacity through September (and 58% of all new electrical capacity, with energy storage included).

All that installation progress helped push solar electricity to new heights: solar generation from January to September 2025 was 29% higher than in the same period in 2024.

US solar manufacturing also grew: module manufacturing capacity increased 42% over the first three quarters of 2025, new capacity to make the solar cells that go into modules came to life in South Carolina, and new capacity to make the wafers that become the solar cells sprang forth in Michigan.

Energy storage was another fount of progress in 2025, with installations for the year projected to be more than 50% higher than in 2024, led by Texas, California, and Arizona.

All told, says the American Clean Power Association, 2025 looks “firmly on pace to surpass 2024 as the biggest clean power deployment year in history.”

Realizing possibilities

Where solar, storage, and other clean energy technologies really shine is in what they make possible in electricity markets around the country. Some examples:

In California, gas electricity generation has fallen as solar generation has risen, and solar in the state, up 13% year-over-year for the first three quarters of 2025, looked set to surpass gas on an annual basis for the first time.

In Texas, where electricity demand is growing fastest, clean energy played a huge role in meeting that increased demand in 2025. Solar generation January-September was 42% higher than in the same period in 2024, and solar seems poised to overtake coal in the state in 2026. The grid operator covering most of the state reported having added 20 times as much battery, solar, and wind capacity as new gas in its service territory since last winter.

In New England, having clean energy available to meet peaks in electricity demand helped send the region’s last coal plant out to pasture. New England solar generation was almost a fifth higher in Q1-Q3.

Even on the water

Though the challenges were unprecedented for offshore wind, 2025 also brought noteworthy happenings in that space. Construction progressed on the next generation of projects, aimed at serving Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia, and several large-scale ones should reach full power in 2026 (if I didn’t just jinx it…). In service in Virginia to aid the work is the Charybdis, the brand-new wind turbine installation vessel that is the first built in the United States (Texas). Virginia’s offshore wind project will be one of the world’s largest when completed next year, capable of producing enough energy for more than 600,000 Virginian households.

As some of the Trump administration’s spurious excuses to halt under-construction offshore wind projects failed to stand up to legal scrutiny, the importance of offshore wind for economies—not just as a source of clean electrons—was even clearer than usual in the range of voices pushing back and speaking out in opposition to the administration’s monkeying. Those included labor unions, business networks, and even the Republican member of Congress for the Virginia project staging area and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.

Meanwhile, the first operating large-scale US offshore wind project, serving Long Island, showed strong results in its first year—including in the winter months, when offshore wind power comes in particularly handy. New England too was benefitting from offshore turbines, before the projects themselves even reached completion: injections of electricity into the region’s grid led to wind generation from January to early December 2025 that was 26% higher than in the same period in 2024, and led in mid-December to a record for peak wind production that was 29% higher than 2024’s peak.

Lots more to come

As technology moves forward, so do some leading states. Despite—or because of—the federal moves in the wrong direction, multiple states doubled down on their moves toward a clean energy economy in 2025. Maine, for example, committed to 100% clean electricity by 2040. California extended and strengthened its “cap and invest” program. Illinois passed a comprehensive clean energy package. And, because clean energy matters at all scales, it’s worth celebrating Michigan’s moves to make it easier for customers to connect distributed renewable energy systems (think rooftop solar) to the electric grid, and Utah’s embrace of balcony solar.

And there’s a lot more to come for clean energy, despite the even rougher seas ahead in the near term under this administration. Continuing affordability concerns will guide even some slow-to-come-around people to recognize solar and wind as often the cheapest source of new electricity generation. Decision makers and the rest of us who care about good jobs and economic development will continue to push for more policies to accelerate the move to clean energy. Innovation, economies of scale in products and projects, and continued international progress will all make clean energy even more attractive.

There’s a lot about 2025 I’d really like to be able to undo, or forget. But clean energy’s progress despite all that the Trump administration threw at it is notable, and it seems important to celebrate those accomplishments as we go into the new year. Not least to keep reminding ourselves of the enormity of what’s already possible and what’s yielding dividends right now, today, and will be long into the future.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog-Thumbnail-Solar-panels-walking-men-in-the-middle.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:02:18.780930

Rising electricity demand, growing reliability pressures and deeper renewable penetration are exposing the limitations of cost-only metrics such as Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”). This paper introduces a value-based framework using two new and complementary measures: Levelized Value of Energy (“LVOE”), which reflects the total value a project can create for its owners, and Levelized Net Benefit (“LNB”), which quantifies the broader value a project can deliver to the overall system. We applied this framework to contrast comparably sized advanced nuclear and solar projects in two separate U.S. power markets - which showed that nuclear, despite a higher LCOE, delivers substantially greater owner and system value. The resulting value difference highlights nuclear’s unpriced contribution to system reliability, fuel savings and long-term cost containment. The findings also challenge the common narrative that nuclear is an expensive option when other, lower-cost solutions are available.1

Grid Pressures Are Driving Renewed Interest in Nuclear

The nuclear energy sector is experiencing a level of momentum that would have seemed improbable just a few years ago. Rapid growth in electricity demand from electrification, digital infrastructure build-out, and industrial re-shoring is intersecting with rising reliability concerns and increasingly severe weather events. These pressures are elevating the importance of firm, clean, long-duration capacity.

In this environment, nuclear is re-emerging through life extensions, restarts and uprates of the existing reactor fleet while advanced reactor developers continue to move through licensing, demonstration and early commercial deployment. Corporate buyers, seeking large scale 24/7 carbon-free electricity, have begun signing long-term agreements for nuclear supply. States are positioning themselves as early hosts for next-generation reactor projects and federal support and financing programs have meaningfully expanded over the last few years. Taken together, these developments reflect a renewed recognition of the growing value of firm, clean resources in meeting future capacity growth and reliability needs, yet our evaluation tools have not kept pace with this shift.

Generation technologies across the industry are typically evaluated using LCOE, a metric developed in an era during which energy was largely interchangeable across hours and seasons. LCOE combines capital costs, operating costs, and energy production into a single dollar-per-megawatt-hour figure.2 It is a simple calculation, familiar and internally consistent as a measure of cost. But it is only a cost metric; it provides no information on the value a resource delivers to the grid.

As renewable penetration has deepened, the economic and reliability value of energy has become far more variable. A firm megawatt-hour delivered during a strained evening peak or a weather-driven emergency has a fundamentally different value than a solar megawatt-hour delivered during midday conditions when supply is abundant.

Today’s planning problem is not simply finding the lowest-cost marginal megawatt-hour but designing portfolios that deliver the required reliability and decarbonization outcomes at the lowest system cost.3 That distinction is at the heart of the nuclear value gap — the difference between the total value that nuclear provides to a system and the amount of value that it can capture through current energy market structures.

The Value Gap: From Cost to System Benefit

LCOE was an effective screening tool when grids were dominated by thermal generation; renewable penetration was modest and intraday variability was limited. In that context, the timing, flexibility and duration of output mattered far less for system cost and reliability than they do today. In the contemporary grid, several structural shifts undermine the usefulness of simple cost-only metrics such as LCOE:

Temporal value divergence: Energy value now varies sharply by hour and season, and capture prices depend heavily on when a resource generates.

Adequacy and resilience constraints: More frequent and deeper stress events make firm, multi-day availability increasingly critical for reliability.

Divergent lifetimes: Nuclear and hydro operate for 60+ years, while solar and wind require multiple reinvestments, creating very different long-term system costs.

FTI Consulting Introduces Two Related Value-Based Metrics: LVOE and LNB

To address these gaps, consider two new metrics: LVOE and LNB. The first metric, LVOE, measures the net economic value a project owner can capture for each megawatt hour (“MWh”) produced over the full life of a plant. Like LCOE, it uses a standard levelizing approach: all future cash flows are discounted to present value and divided by the plant’s discounted lifetime generation.

The key difference between LVOE and LCOE is that LVOE adds revenue instead of totaling costs. It incorporates all monetized value streams a project can earn (energy sales, capacity payments, ancillary services and, where applicable, carbon credits) and subtracts the full set of project costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, fuel, refurbishment cycles and decommissioning. In effect, LVOE is the value-based counterpart to LCOE. While LCOE shows what a resource costs per MWh, LVOE shows the net value a project can realize per MWh under current and future market structures.

The second metric, LNB, measures the discounted net economic benefit of a plant to the system. LNB starts with LVOE and adds quantified system-wide cost reductions not compensated in markets, including avoided investment in additional capacity and avoided system fuel costs. Because retail rates are ultimately driven by total system costs rather than the LCOE of individual resources, LNB provides the metric most linked to long-term rate impacts.

The difference between LNB and LVOE, is the unpriced value. A technology (such as solar) that is fully compensated for the value it delivers will show minimal difference between LVOE and LNB. In contrast, nuclear delivers significant reliability, adequacy, and system cost reductions beyond the compensation it receives.

These types of metrics have not historically been part of standard practice. FTI’s novel approach and modeling capabilities now enable credible, technology-specific valuation of both project revenues and system benefits.

Our Methodology and Modeling Approach

To evaluate nuclear’s value relative to solar on a consistent basis, we combine long-term market modeling with project-level financial analysis. For the market modeling, we use PLEXOS,® a commercial optimization platform widely employed by utilities, system operators and regulators for capacity expansion and production cost modeling.

The PLEXOS® model runs on an internally maintained U.S. zonal dataset that includes updated demand projections, existing fleet characteristics and retirements, technology cost trajectories, fuel price paths, transmission constraints and applicable policy requirements. PLEXOS® produces long-term investment outcomes and hourly dispatch results under reliability and resource constraints.

Technology cost and performance assumptions are drawn from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Annual Technology Baseline.4

Figure 1: Overview of Our Cost and Value Modeling Approach

The nuclear case reflects a representative 1 gigawatt (“GW”) advanced reactor, modeled with a multi-year construction profile, major refurbishment cycles, and a 60-year operating life. The comparison case is a utility-scale solar portfolio sized to match the nuclear plant’s total 60-year energy production, including full rebuilds in years 20 and 40.

For our comparison, we selected the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”), the independent system operator for most of Texas, and PJM, a large regional transmission organization spanning multiple Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states, because ERCOT and PJM represent two of the most important (and contrasting) power market structures in the U.S. ERCOT is a large, energy-only, predominantly merchant market with high renewable penetration, making it a natural test bed for how new firm resources compete on price and system value. PJM, by contrast, combines an energy market with a robust capacity market, operates under tighter regulatory oversight and faces strong decarbonization and reliability pressures alongside growing renewables. These systems are both expected to see sustained long-term electric demand growth, so insights from ERCOT and PJM are especially relevant for future energy generation investment and planning decisions.

All metrics in our comparison are expressed in real dollars using discount rates aligned with the LCOE inputs (6% real for nuclear and 3% real for solar), reflecting differences in financing assumptions and technology risk. We focus on two contrasting regions: ERCOT, an energy-only market with high renewable penetration and weather-driven stress events, and PJM, a capacity-market region with a more diversified resource mix and distinct policy dynamics, using a capacity price assumption of $250/megawatt per day.5

Our analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we use PLEXOS® to generate technology-specific hourly prices, captured energy revenues, curtailment and capacity contributions for each region under decarbonizing system conditions. Second, we combine these outputs with cost profiles in our detailed project finance model to compute discounted cash flows and derive LCOE and LVOE for an illustrative 1 GW plant; although illustrative, the results reflect realistic operational and market outcomes. Third, we calculate system-wide avoided costs (primarily foregone gas peaker capital expenditures and lower system fuel operating expenditures) by comparing scenarios with and without the 1 GW nuclear unit.6 We then convert these avoided costs into a discounted per-MWh value and add that number to LVOE to produce LNB.

To reflect climate policy considerations, we compute carbon value at an illustrative $30/ton carbon dioxide (“CO₂”).7 This represents the avoided emissions benefit of nuclear — valued at $30 for every ton of CO₂ displaced relative to a gas generator in a base case. The results of this modeling framework are summarized below for both ERCOT and PJM.

Results: Comparing Nuclear and Solar Across Cost and Value Metrics

A traditional LCOE comparison produces the expected outcome: solar appears less expensive than nuclear on a cost-per-MWh basis in both ERCOT and PJM. This reflects the lower upfront capital cost of solar, but it does not account for differences in timing, durability or reliability.

Figure 2: Solar and Nuclear LCOE Comparison in ERCOT and PJM8

However, once we evaluate monetized net value using LVOE, the comparison shifts. Nuclear generates materially higher owner-level net value per MWh than solar in both regions, driven by its high captured energy value during peak and scarcity times, its firm capacity contribution and its long-lived production profile that avoids multiple reinvestment cycles. The solar LVOE is lower because its captured prices decline with penetration, its effective load carrying capability falls sharply over time and it requires full rebuilds to maintain output over the 60-year period.

Figure 3: Solar and Nuclear LVOE Comparison in ERCOT and PJM9

When we incorporate unpriced system benefits, the divergence becomes even more pronounced. Nuclear reduces the need for additional peaking capacity, lowers system fuel consumption and improves reliability during stressed conditions. These avoided costs materially increase the nuclear LNB. In contrast, the solar LNB is essentially identical to its LVOE because most of its contribution is already monetized in existing market structures, and its integration needs to offset remaining system benefits.

Figure 4: Breakdown of Nuclear Value Components (LVOE to LNB)

The resulting value gap (unpriced system value) captures nuclear’s unpriced contribution to the grid, including long-duration firm capacity, extreme-weather resilience and avoided system expenditures. This gap explains why nuclear can lower long-term system costs even with a higher LCOE, whereas solar’s low LCOE does not automatically translate into lower system costs once firming, storage and integration needs are considered. Put simply: rates follow system cost, not project cost — and nuclear lowers system cost.

Even a modest carbon price further widens this gap, adding meaningful value to nuclear, which can accrue either to the project (through credits) or to the system (through avoided emissions). In Figure 4, the carbon value is included in the LNB figures for simplicity and completeness. Although carbon is not the driver of the results, it reinforces the conclusion: cost-only metrics understate the total value that nuclear provides.

Implications for Developers, Investors, Utilities and Policymakers

This novel LVOE and LNB approach highlight several important implications for stakeholders across the nuclear value chain and broader energy system.

For developers and technology vendors, the findings support commercial strategy and business development efforts by better quantifying the full nuclear value proposition. Demonstrating avoided system costs, resilience benefits and long-lived output enables developers to communicate a clearer, more compelling case to customers and regulators, moving beyond cost-only comparisons toward a value-centered narrative.

For investors and project owners, the analysis provides improved visibility into project economics under realistic market and dispatch conditions. A better understanding of the unpriced system value can inform discussions on commercial structuring, risk allocation and long-term contracting approaches. At a time when investors are starting to express concerns that nuclear could be the next “bubble,” this clarity can help unlock additional capital by aligning project economics with the value nuclear provides to the system.

For utilities and large energy buyers, LVOE and LNB provide clearer visibility into both project-level value and system-level benefits. These metrics help identify how firm, clean resources contribute to overall portfolio performance, reliability and long-term cost trajectories. By understanding the full value delivered by each resource (not just its cost), utilities and buyers can make more informed portfolio choices, balance reliability and decarbonization goals, and avoid future system costs associated with firming, storage and adequacy requirements.

For policymakers and system operators, this approach provides clearer insight into the system value that nuclear can deliver and how it shapes long-term cost trajectories. By quantifying LVOE and LNB, the framework helps inform integrated resource planning efforts, regulatory design and energy policy decisions that recognize resources that reduce future spending on capacity, fuel and integration. This is particularly important today as state governments are increasingly reviewing prior energy policy decisions and their impacts on ratepayers. Incorporating these insights can support more efficient planning, strengthen reliability and ultimately help moderate long-term rate pressures.

In conclusion, these results demonstrate that cost-only comparisons are no longer sufficient — durable, least-cost outcomes emerge only when both monetized and unpriced system value are fully reflected in investment, planning and policy decisions.

Summer Nuclear Station could deliver long-term economic, workforce, and energy infrastructure benefits for South Carolina, reinforcing the state’s role in the next phase of U.S. nuclear deployment.

The study, conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and released by Westinghouse Electric Company, evaluates the economic impact of completing two partially built AP1000 reactors at the V.C. Summer site in Jenkinsville. PwC’s assessment concludes that the project would generate billions in economic activity during construction and sustain thousands of high-skill jobs once operational.

Construction Phase Drives Near-Term Economic Impact

According to PwC, the seven-year construction period—expected to run from 2026 through 2032—would contribute an estimated $7.3 billion to South Carolina’s gross domestic product. During this phase, the project would support an average of approximately 7,300 jobs annually, totaling more than 51,000 person-years of employment across engineering, manufacturing, construction, and project management roles.

Labor income during construction is projected at $4.1 billion statewide, with tax revenues reaching approximately $1.6 billion when federal, state, and local impacts are included. PwC notes that leveraging the existing partially built infrastructure at V.C. Summer significantly reduces both construction costs and deployment timelines compared with greenfield nuclear projects.

Beyond South Carolina, the national economic footprint during construction would be even larger. PwC estimates $13.8 billion in U.S. GDP and nearly 13,000 jobs supported annually across the broader supply chain, underscoring the project’s relevance to domestic manufacturing and industrial policy objectives.

Long-Term Operations Deliver Sustained Employment

Once operational, the two AP1000 units would provide approximately 2,300 megawatts of nuclear capacity—enough to power at least 1.5 million homes in South Carolina. PwC projects that ongoing plant operations would generate $1.6 billion in annual state GDP and support roughly 2,700 jobs each year over a minimum operating life of 80 years.

Cumulatively, long-term operations are estimated to produce more than $130 billion in state GDP, alongside $30 billion in labor income and $31 billion in tax revenues. Nationally, operational impacts would reach $2.1 billion in annual GDP and support approximately 3,700 jobs across the U.S. economy.

Workforce Development and Nuclear Cluster Effects

PwC’s analysis emphasizes that economic impacts extend beyond direct employment. The project would require approximately 1,000 permanent, highly skilled workers onsite, including engineers, nuclear technicians, chemists, and operations specialists. Westinghouse plans to invest heavily in workforce training and partnerships with educational institutions to ensure a qualified labor pipeline.

South Carolina already hosts a significant nuclear energy cluster, employing more than 16,000 workers statewide. Completing the V.C. Summer reactors would reinforce this ecosystem, strengthening supplier networks, attracting related industries, and anchoring advanced energy skills in the region.

Infrastructure, Grid Reliability, and Policy Context

The report situates the V.C. Summer restart within broader national energy policy trends. The project aligns with federal efforts to expand nuclear capacity as a tool for grid reliability, energy security, and industrial competitiveness. The AP1000 technology is currently the only Generation III+ reactor operating commercially with fully passive safety systems and an established global deployment track record.

With electricity demand rising from data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification, the analysis frames large-scale nuclear projects as foundational infrastructure rather than standalone generation assets. By reactivating a partially completed site, South Carolina could accelerate deployment while minimizing land use and construction risk relative to new builds.

A Long-Horizon Infrastructure Decision

PwC’s findings present the V.C. Summer restart as a multi-decade infrastructure investment with implications well beyond short-term job creation. The combination of construction-phase stimulus, long-term operational employment, and grid-scale carbon-free power positions the project as both an economic development and energy resilience strategy for the state.

While final investment and regulatory decisions remain ahead, the report concludes that completing the two AP1000 units would represent one of the most consequential energy infrastructure investments in South Carolina in decades—one with measurable impacts on jobs, GDP, and the future structure of the state’s power system.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251217-113218-54e-Gen%20III%2B%20AP1000%20reactor.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:04:03.855842

Consequently, numerous companies have developed VPP programmes, which frequently offer solar or battery systems at no cost or a reduced price in exchange for leveraging these systems to help maintain grid frequency and reliability.

Energy-Storage.news looks at recent news from Sunrun and NRG Energy, Haven Energy, and Leap and Enel North America as the companies advance VPP programmes across the US.

Sunrun and NRG partner to provide residential storage in Texas

US residential solar and energy storage installer Sunrun and energy supplier NRG Energy have announced a multi-year partnership aimed at accelerating residential energy storage in Texas.

Texas residents will have access to a home energy solution that combines Sunrun’s solar-plus-storage systems with “optimised rate plans and smart battery programming,” provided by NRG Energy’s retail electricity provider, Reliant.

As new and existing Sunrun customers sign up with Reliant, the total capacity will be leveraged to address the rising demand in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market.

The companies will collaborate to develop offers that aggregate and dispatch distributed power assets, supplying electricity to Texas’s grid during peak demand times. Sunrun will receive payment for aggregating capacity, while Reliant customers who participate will be compensated by Sunrun for sharing their stored solar energy.

In November, Sunrun reported a revenue of US$724.6 million for the third quarter of this year, as the company pursued its “storage-first strategy”.

Sunrun has achieved its third consecutive quarter of revenue growth. The company’s revenue rose from US$569 million in the previous quarter, and the Q3 figure reflects a 35% year-over-year increase compared to US$537.2 million in Q3 2024.

The company also took part in California’s Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) distributed storage programme. During a test on 29 July, DSGS helped lower the net load on the state’s grid. However, shortly afterwards, California Governor Gavin Newsom’s office reduced the programme’s funding.

In May, VPP provider Sonnen collaborated with Abundance Energy and Energywell Technology Licensing to create a battery-enabled VPP in Texas. This VPP enables Abundance Energy customers to utilise sonnenConnect residential battery systems to enhance grid stability and reduce electricity expenses.

Haven Energy secures US$40 million to expand VPP networks

Haven Energy, a home battery systems company, has raised US$40 million to boost its partnerships with utility companies and community choice aggregators (CCAs). The funds will allow expansion of its leasing model, enhance its Channel Partner Programme for local installers, and support the ongoing development of “one of the nation’s largest VPP networks.”

The US$40 million comprises an equity round led by Giant Ventures and a debt facility from Turtle Hill, with further equity investments from California Infrastructure Bank, Carnrite Ventures, Chaac Ventures, Comcast Ventures, and Lerer Hippeau.

Haven states that US energy demand is expected to increase by 15% by 2030, growing faster than new generation and transmission infrastructure can be developed. This will lead to higher costs, increased outages, and greater pressure on the grid.

The company states it is tackling this challenge by working with utilities to install home solar and battery systems for its customers. These DERs provide utilities with flexible, local capacity that enhances the grid’s stability and contributes to lowering energy costs.

Haven also claims it has installed over 10MW of distributed capacity with more than 50MW in development for 2026, with over US$75 million worth of projects in its pipeline.

This capacity underpins both Haven’s expanding VPP and the utility-run programs that Haven develops for its utility partners. Current partners include Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Clean Power Alliance (CPA), San Jose Clean Energy (SJCE), Clean Energy Alliance (CEA), and Peninsula Clean Energy (PCE).

The funding will also facilitate the growth of Haven’s leasing model and Channel Partner Programme. This programme allows trusted local installers to provide Haven’s solar and battery solutions directly to homeowners and incorporate these installations into the company’s VPP. Haven handles financing, operations, and performance, allowing installers to focus on installation.

In June, Haven and CEA collaborated to offer California homeowners BESS without any purchase or installation expenses. The Battery Bonus Connect programme will serve around 300 homeowners and is financed through California’s US$280 million Self-Generation Incentive Program Residential Solar & Storage Equity (SGIP RSSE) initiative.

Leap and Enel partner on nationwide VPP growth

Leap, a software provider for aggregating DERs, and independent power producer (IPP) Enel North America have announced a partnership to expand the connection of commercial and industrial (C&I) DERs to utility demand response programmes across the country.

Together, Enel and Leap will utilise existing C&I capacity on the grid to manage energy demand in real time across Enel’s utility network, while generating additional revenue for Leap’s C&I partners.

The collaboration will start with three utility programmes managed by Enel in Washington, Arizona, and the Tennessee Valley, and will gradually expand to other markets nationwide.

Enel states that collaborating with Leap enables the company to rapidly increase capacity enrollment in its demand response programmes, while offering C&I customers new opportunities to generate revenue by aiding grid stability.

Leap, meanwhile, sees a wider expansion into vertically integrated utility markets, offering its technology partners additional revenue opportunities for the C&I resources the company sells and manages.

In February, Leap announced its expansion into the PJM Interconnection wholesale market. PJM, a regional transmission organisation (RTO), manages the flow of electricity across parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

The work relates to Phase One of the Lionheart development, located in the Upper Rhine Valley, a region with significant geothermal potential that underpins Vulcan Energy’s integrated renewable lithium production model.

The Lionheart Project is designed to combine renewable energy generation with lithium extraction and downstream processing. Once operational, the project will supply battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LHM) to the European electric vehicle sector, supporting regional battery manufacturing and reducing reliance on imported raw materials. At full Phase One capacity, Lionheart is expected to produce approximately 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate annually—sufficient to support the production of around 500,000 electric vehicles each year. In parallel, the integrated system will generate about 275 GWh of renewable electricity and 560 GWh of renewable heat, reinforcing the project’s low-carbon credentials.

Under three separate contracts with a combined value of €46 million, ABB will act as the main electrical contractor for the project. Its responsibilities span the entire electrical scope, including detailed design, engineering, manufacturing, testing, and final delivery of critical electrical systems. The contracts cover multiple facilities central to the Lionheart value chain, including the lithium extraction plant in Landau, the central lithium processing facility at Industriepark Höchst, as well as associated geothermal well sites distributed across the Upper Rhine Valley.

The electrification package encompasses high-, medium-, and low-voltage distribution systems, transformers, variable speed drives, uninterruptible power supplies, and advanced protection equipment. Together, these components will ensure a stable, reliable, and efficient supply of electricity, distributing power seamlessly from the regional 110 kV grid down to individual process units and building-level operations. This robust electrical backbone is essential to maintaining continuous production and meeting the stringent quality requirements for battery-grade lithium products.

The latest contracts build on a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the two companies in April 2024. That agreement aimed to simplify engineering workflows and strengthen project execution by aligning design optimization, supply-chain coordination, and cost performance. By formalizing this collaboration, the partners are laying the groundwork for what is expected to become Europe’s first fully integrated renewable lithium operation.

Senior executives from both sides emphasized the broader strategic importance of the project. ABB highlighted Lionheart as a model for how clean energy systems and advanced electrification can be combined to strengthen Europe’s battery materials supply chain at a time of rapidly growing electric vehicle demand. Vulcan Energy, meanwhile, underlined the importance of reliable, scalable electrical systems in enabling industrial-scale lithium production while keeping emissions low and supporting supply chain decarbonization.

The execution of these contracts is also a key condition for project financing. Vulcan Energy has indicated that it is targeting financial close, along with the completion of additional project and financing agreements, in the fourth quarter of 2025. Once finalized, the Lionheart Project is expected to play a pivotal role in supporting Europe’s transition to clean mobility through locally produced, low-carbon lithium.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 10:59:51.515689

This Market Intel is a special policy analysis on the recently proposed waters of the United States rule.

Key Takeaways:

For decades, the definition of “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act has been unclear, leading to regulatory uncertainty. Five rule changes since 2015 and conflicting court decisions created a “ping-pong” effect, leaving farmers unsure which water features on their land fall under federal jurisdiction.

In their ruling in Sackett v. EPA, the Supreme Court eliminated the “significant nexus” test, which broadened the federal government’s jurisdictional reach. The ruling clarified that only relatively permanent waters and wetlands with a continuous surface connection to regulated waters fall under federal jurisdiction. This decision was widely praised for providing the clearest legal standard in decades.

The Trump administration’s proposed WOTUS rule adopts Sackett’s framework, excluding isolated ponds, disconnected wetlands, and most ditches. It shifts the burden of proof from landowners to the federal government and allows states to regulate beyond federal standards. While the rule aims for clarity, challenges remain — such as proving sustained flow during wet seasons.

For years, farmers and ranchers have worked their land with a close eye on the weather, volatile markets, farm policy and the many regulations that shape everyday business decisions. Among the most influential, and often most confusing of these rules, is the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS). Over the past decade, frequent regulatory changes and court decisions have left many farmers questioning what WOTUS really means for their operations. From the start of this debate, the American Farm Bureau Federation has been the leading voice across industry sectors, consistently advocating for clear, practical regulations that protect farmers while ensuring environmental stewardship.

The Evolving Definition of WOTUS

Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), the term WOTUS serves as the threshold that determines which water bodies fall under federal jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the statute offers little clarity on where that jurisdictional line should be drawn. Over the years, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the agencies) have exploited this ambiguity, expanding their authority far beyond what Congress intended when drafting the law.

From the mid-1980s onward, the agencies operated under a regulatory definition that broadly interpreted WOTUS to include many waters. This expansive interpretation repeatedly ran up against judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court’s decisions on the limits of the federal government’s regulatory reach, in cases such as Riverside Bayview Homes, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County, and Rapanos, often created more questions than answers.

For example, the Supreme Court’s 4-1-4 split in Rapanos created conflicting standards for federal jurisdiction. Justice Scalia’s plurality introduced the “relatively permanent waters” test, while Justice Kennedy’s concurrence advanced the “significant nexus” test. With no majority opinion, this fractured guidance left regulators and courts without a clear rule, fueling years of litigation and inconsistent interpretations as successive administrations struggled to define WOTUS.

Beginning in 2015, the regulatory uncertainty was exacerbated as different presidential administrations attempted to make sweeping changes, creating a swinging pendulum of regulations. Consequently, the definition of WOTUS became a legal and regulatory maze — one in which wetlands, ditches, seasonal streams, drainage features or even ephemeral streams (low spots in a farm field) could be regulated. Over the last decade, there have been five different rulemakings on WOTUS. The ping-ponging of definitions has produced anxiety and uncertainty for farmers and ranchers whose decisions on the farm depend heavily on clear rules.

Sackett v. EPA: A Turning Point for WOTUS Clarity and Certainty

The 2023 Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA marked one of the most consequential shifts in federal water regulations since the passage of the CWA. This decision greatly narrowed the types of water features and wetlands regulated as a WOTUS and simplified compliance for landowners. The Supreme Court accomplished this by unanimously eliminating the troubling “significant nexus” test, which allowed the federal government to set up a case-by-case regulatory regime that expanded their jurisdictional reach beyond legal boundaries.

Additionally, the ruling greatly restricted the types of wetlands that fall under federal authority by providing proper guardrails for “adjacent wetland.” Farmers and ranchers across the country praised the Court’s decision because it is the clearest, most decisive legal standard for WOTUS in decades and appropriately reigns in the federal government’s authority.

Understanding the Proposed WOTUS Rule

On Nov. 17, 2025, the Trump administration proposed a new WOTUS definition that implements the Sackett decision and upholds congressional intent under the CWA. The rule represents the greatest narrowing of the federal government’s jurisdictional reach over private property. As directed by the Supreme Court, the proposal only regulates water bodies that are “relatively permanent” — meaning surface waters that flow or stand year-round or those that flow throughout the wet season — and wetlands that are directly abutting a regulated tributary and have a continuous surface connection.

As an example, features like isolated ponds, field-edge depressions, disconnected wetlands, groundwater and many ditches or prior-converted cropland would be excluded. The rule also proposes to define key terms (like “tributary,” “ditch,” “prior converted cropland,” etc.) to bring consistency and predictability to what is “in” and what is “out.” This also reduces the amount of land subject to the regulation, cutting down regulatory costs across the industry.

Most importantly, this rule shifts the burden of proof away from the landowner and places this responsibility squarely on the federal government, meaning a farmer no longer must prove that they do not have a WOTUS on their property to use their land.

It is critical to recognize that this rule upholds the cooperative federalism objective of the CWA by allowing states to serve as the primary authority in regulating water. State governments can regulate far beyond the definition of WOTUS and impose their own, more stringent rules. In many states, just because a water feature is not regulated by the federal government, does not necessarily mean that it goes unregulated.

While this rule is an important step forward in creating a legally durable definition of WOTUS, implementation of the rule may present some challenges. One potential hurdle for some landowners will be determining if there is sustained flow throughout the wet season. In some instances, field-level data may need to be collected, which could significantly slow down the jurisdictional determination process. This also impedes farmers’ ability to use their land, potentially cutting their production and revenue capacity.

The Cost of Compliance

Ensuring compliance under WOTUS for farmers can include several major components that impact a farmer’s cost of production:

Obtaining Clean Water Act federal permits for activities like fencing, drainage or pond construction;

Hiring consultants and technical experts for wetland determinations;

Experiencing operational delays while waiting for permit approvals; and

The cost of mitigation activities which can often be substantial.

Because Clean Water Act compliance carries significant civil and criminal liabilities — up to $64,000 per day or even jail time — it is critical that farmers fully understand the rules to avoid inadvertent violations.

How WOTUS Shapes Everyday Farm Decisions

Farmers care about the definition of WOTUS because it determines which ditches, wetlands and water features on their land fall under federal regulation — and therefore which everyday activities may require permits, carry compliance obligations or expose them to legal risk and regulatory costs to ensure compliance. Whether they are installing tile, building a fence, cleaning out a ditch, expanding cropland or managing drainage after heavy rains, the scope of WOTUS directly influences what farmers can do without federal oversight.",https://www.fb.org/imgz/Analysis/MarketIntel/MI-Graphics/_socialwFacebook/250926/WOTUS_16x9-twitter.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:03:16.510470

Opponents of the plan warned that it puts existing ratepayers -- including residents and large companies -- at risk of higher electricity costs. The policy approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission comes in the wake of projects like Meta's $27 billion data center announced last year and a facility for Anthropic announced Wednesday.

Gov. Jeff Landry's ""Lightning Speed"" executive order to reduce red tape inspired the new amendment. Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan proposed the initiative as a way to ""accelerate the timelines required for major employers to invest, build and grow in Louisiana.""

""We have been last in so many things for far too long and we're seeing some material success in growth across sectors,"" Coussan said at the commission's monthly meeting.

This change will exempt utilities trying to build new infrastructure for data centers from going through a process that requires them to prove the new generation is the cheapest and most reliable option on the market. It also directs the regulators to vote on new projects within eight months of an application, faster than the typical yearlong timeline.

In order for a project to qualify for the streamlined process, a company must meet requirements including a letter from the state's economic development agency ""confirming the customer's interest and the importance of power availability"" and a contract of at least 15 years.

The amendment passed by a 4-1 vote, with only Commissioner Davante Lewis opposing. Lewis called the new policy a ""dangerous precedent"" that ""lowers the standards"" for projects trying to get new infrastructure on the grid. He noted that the new policy criteria are less stringent than the power plan approved for Meta, a monthslong regulatory process that faced significant pushback from environmental, consumer and industrial groups.

Meta's northeast Louisiana data center, the company's biggest yet, will require roughly three times the amount of electricity that New Orleans uses on an annual basis. Entergy is building three new gas-fired power plants to meet the demand.

The commission meeting grew tense at times, with commissioners talking over and interrupting each other.

What's the new rule?

A utility can go through the fast-tracked ""lightning"" route as long as the customer pays for half of its infrastructure costs, the new rule stipulates. Meta, for instance, is paying for the full annual revenue of the electricity plants that will power the facility, though not for all of the new infrastructure needed.

Lewis was the only commissioner to vote against the plan for Meta's center, on the grounds that the agreement left fundamental questions on the table, including the lack of a competitive bid process. On Wednesday, he proposed a separate framework to address issues that large-scale data centers are presenting to regulators.

That proposal aims to ""ensure that the public interest is considered in a transparent and deliberative process, while balancing economic development, improving grid reliability, and protecting affordable rates."" It was deferred to the next commission meeting, with all four of the other regulators voting to delay.

'Decades of sharply increasing bills'

Advocacy groups opposed Coussan's proposal, arguing that the policy removes needed guardrails and fails to give regulators enough time to assess the impact of future projects. Logan Burke, who runs the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said that removing protections will mean ""decades of sharply increasing bills.""

""Understanding the amount of pressure that you are receiving from other elected bodies, but you are five duly elected decision makers who get to make these decisions,"" Burke said.

A coalition of some of the largest industrial users in the state, including chemical manufacturers and oil companies, also objected to key aspects of the new policy. Randy Young, a lawyer for the Louisiana Energy Users Group, wrote a letter to the regulators earlier this week saying that waiving the typical regulatory process ""adds significant risk and potential costs to the ratepayers.""

Regarding the Meta deal, Entergy says the new power plants will not lead to higher bills for average ratepayers.

For Buckingham, the investment the United States is making into the mining of these materials will be well worth the initial costs.","SERRA BLANCA, Texas (NewsNation) — An otherwise nondescript mountainside in West Texas could be part of the Trump administration’s solution to ending the United States’ reliance on countries like China for rare-earth materials that are essential to building missiles, fighter jets and technology.

NewsNation received an exclusive look at one key location that is being targeted for mining these rare materials. Locating these minerals could provide the United States with economic independence from China. Officials have gone as far as characterizing the issue as a matter of national security and say that mining operations could begin as early as 2028.

The Trump administration has announced plans to launch a coalition of partners on Friday, when the Pax Silica Declaration will be signed. The pact will unite Singapore, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Israel and is designed to address deficits in critical minerals access, which will edge out China’s massive investment in its critical minerals and tech sector, officials say.

Tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump have been instrumental in China’s restriction of exports of rare-earth materials to the United States. Meanwhile, Trump has struck deals with Australia, Malaysia, Cambodia and Japan.

The Guardian recently reported that the United States and China have brokered a trade truce on rare-earth materials. However, China currently controls about 70% of global mining and more than 90% of global processing capacity. That has put the U.S. behind the 8-ball in trying to source more of these materials in places like Round Top Mountain in West Texas.

It has also allowed China to take control of the rare-earth supply chain and being able to manipulate geopolitical markets that the United States is now attempting to tap into. But to do so, work must be done to ensure the U.S. has enough natural resources at its disposal to make the kind of dent it is seeking to create.

“China has a corner on this market,” Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham told NewsNation. “We think this is the only and largest complete set of rare earth minerals not under China’s control in the world. These are important for our jets to fly. It’s national security. It’s everyday convenience. It’s taking away this economic play from China.”

To accomplish that, more mining is expected to take place in locations like Round Top Mountain, where Dysprosium and Terbium, which are two critical rare-earth materials. Dysprosium is valued largely for its magnetic properties, which are used primarily in everyday electronics like smartphones and speakers, but also in defense systems.

Terbium, meanwhile, is another rare-earth material that is known for its bright green luminescence, which is used for lighting displays and high-performance magnets for electronics such as wind turbines, electric vehicles and sonar systems.

Buckingham says that Round Top Mountain is one of the most unique mining sites in the country. Inside the mountain, 17 rare-earth materials can be found that will be critical in helping eliminate China’s monopoly on the rare-earth market. All of the land where these materials can be found is state-owned but is then leased to mining companies such as USA Rare Earth.

Alex Moyes, the company’s vice president of mining, told NewsNation that the company has already conducted smaller-scale pilot programs that are helping locate rare-earth materials. He said that the magnets that are made from these valuable materials are critical in national security. For example, magnets are used in missile motors and to control the steering capabilities of the missile.

“So, if all of a sudden the magnet that’s steering your guided missile demagnetizes, you no longer have control of where your missile’s going to go,” Moyes told NewsNation.

Initially, the cost to mine these materials from the earth may be more expensive than paying for those in China. However, in time, the costs will drop as the supply chain scales and the U.S. conducts more rare-earth business with countries with which it has struck deals. For Buckingham, the investment the United States is making into the mining of these materials will be well worth the initial costs.

“(It’s about) our energy independence — that elemental independence — making sure our jets can fly, our missiles can work, our phones function, everything we need to educate our children,” Buckingham said. “It’s important to invest in America.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/12/snapshot-4-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-18 12:00:36.740362

The PSC’s vote continues a wave of action by regulators, policymakers, utilities and grid operators to meet the growing electricity needs of artificial intelligence data centers. The new directive allows utilities that want to supply new “large load” customers to bypass a competitive bidding requirement for new generation that PSC established decades ago to ensure consumers benefited from the lowest-cost energy source.

DOE has issued emergency orders to keep coal plants from retiring, part of its focus on fossil fuels. And it’s pushing to expand the data center boom.

“It’s been a massive swing,” said Tom Pyle, president of the fossil-fuel-supporting, free-market group American Energy Alliance.

In a heavily divided nation, the Trump agenda at DOE is triggering applause from conservatives and fossil fuel supporters and consternation among environmentalists. Climate activists and public health advocates say the DOE under Wright is advancing policies that raise energy prices and expose Americans to harmful pollution tied to fossil fuel emissions.

“Chris Wright has fully embraced Donald Trump’s war on renewables, and that’s extremely significant,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program. “Almost on a weekly basis, Secretary Wright posts social media content from his official government accounts spreading complete misinformation and lies about renewable energy and particularly about solar.”

Wright himself is a major change-maker in the federal government and energy world. As a former CEO of fracking services company Liberty Energy, Wright is steeped in data on energy systems and a frequent guest on media outlets like Fox News. At an event last week, Trump called Wright the “greatest oil man anywhere in the world.”

Despite some apparent rifts with the White House of late, including the firing of a top DOE official closely tied to Trump world, conservatives are fully behind Wright.

“Secretary Wright is just a really, really knowledgeable person. He’s extremely well qualified for this job,” said Pyle.

Heading into the next year, many questions remain about how the Trump administration intends to execute its energy policy: What specific loans will be offered to energy companies? How many more billions of dollars might be cut from Biden-era projects?

All of these questions come as electricity demand is projected to increase dramatically, along with utility bills for everyday Americans.

DOE did not respond to requests for comment.

Are the changes durable?

Some of the changes at DOE under Wright are likely to have a short shelf life if a new Democratic administration takes power, including the renaming and shuffling of offices. Other changes could have more staying power.

Critics of the administration say the layoffs and grant cuts, more of which could be in the offing over the coming months, will cause companies and American workers to think twice about teaming up with the federal government in the future.

“I had convinced a bunch of people to go into the department, who then all got fired and now say they would never go back to work for the federal government. So that, I think, is a huge loss,” said Kate Gordon, CEO of the non-profit California Forward and a former adviser to Secretary Jennifer Granholm under Biden. “It might be generational. We worked incredibly hard in the administration to try to make it exciting for people to go into government. It’s hard to do.”

Staffing cuts will also have “long-term consequences” because of the large amounts of money the department is tasked with moving out the door, said Alex Kizer, an executive vice president at the EFI Foundation and a former DOE staffer during the Obama administration.

It’s unclear if DOE will aim to address the staffing crunch with contractors or new hires with specific skill sets, he said.

The administration’s push to add dramatically more power to the electricity grid could also have staying power.

“Now everyone is talking about the need for more energy for AI and to stay ahead of China,” said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment at the Heritage Foundation. “I think that that is going to stick with people because that seems to be nonpartisan. Everyone wants us to have the best AI and data centers. Both parties want us to stay ahead of China in that.”

Reorganization and funding cuts

A reorganization last month at DOE moved the decades-old Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to a new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation. It also cut the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, which was created by Congress in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, and renamed the Loan Programs Office the Office of Energy Dominance Financing.

Gordon said the cut to OCED and grant cancellations, most of which stem from the infrastructure law, flout U.S. laws.

“We organized partly around deployment, which is something that the agency didn’t do. Trump just got rid of that [OCED], which I don’t think is allowed because it was created in a bill by Congress. But what does ‘it’s not allowed’ mean anymore?” she said. “What we’re seeing now is just a complete separation of the executive from the will of Congress and that is a very strange and disturbing thing to see.”

Some changes could be reversed easily in the future, considering that Biden and the first Trump administration also reorganized offices.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a megalaw signed by Trump in July, rescinded the “unobligated balances” of Inflation Reduction Act funding for the OCED, along with other programs at DOE. The administration’s supporters say that paved the way for DOE to retool priorities.

“I don’t think the department should be in the business of deployment. It should be in the business of research and development,” said Pyle, referencing DOE’s historic R&D role in energy development.

Jessie Stolark, executive director at the Carbon Capture Coalition, said from the group’s understanding, “under the recent DOE reorganization, unspent OCED funds are being reprogrammed to other offices within the department.”

Claire Cody, an analyst at Clean Tomorrow who worked at DOE earlier this year, said parts of OCED will likely be split up, although the office was authorized as a distinct entity. “We’ll have to see what Congress does about that,” she said.

Typically, deobligated funds are returned to the Treasury if they are not being challenged by affected companies, but there are restrictions on how they can be reused. For example, DOE is supposed to only reobligate funds that are still within their appropriation window and that are tapped for their original statutory purpose directed by Congress.

Kizer said he suspected that billions of dollars of funding could be reprogrammed by the Trump administration, but it is a “big area of uncertainty.”

Efficiency no more

DOE is proposing to roll back dozens of regulations, including a laundry list of appliance efficiency rules, which force manufacturers to sell products that use less energy. Lawsuits on the efficiency rollbacks are expected once DOE issues finalized rules.

The Trump administration also proposed cutting the Weatherization Assistance Program, a 50-year-old initiative that subsidizes equipment efficiency upgrades for low-income households, while EPA is waffling on whether to continue Energy Star, a program that certifies efficient household equipment and buildings.

Meanwhile, the OBBB cut tax credits for homeowner efficiency upgrades. Efficiency advocates say the rules help to meet load growth and reduce Americans exposure to pollutants.

“These rollbacks would just increase bills for families and businesses and add extra strain on the electric grid,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “The only folks who might benefit are companies making and selling super-inefficient products overseas who could send them here.”

Furchtgott-Roth and other conservatives say the efficiency rules deprive Americans of market choice.

“We’ve moved from an energy scarcity era in the Biden administration to an energy abundance era in the Trump administration,” she said. “There’s no need for the government to set rules for efficiency.”

Efficiency advocates say the federal rollbacks put the onus on the states. But states like Arizona are also nixing efficiency funding.

A new report from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said the efficiency rules are “raising prices, limiting product choice, and undermining performance, reliability, and longevity.”

More fossil fuels and nuclear

Supporters of Wright and Trump also say the embrace of fossil fuels increases U.S. energy security and stature globally as an energy exporter.

“By taking the steps President Trump is, he’s detaching us from China. He’s making us independent,” said Furchtgott-Roth. “If we were to have gone the Biden route, we would have been dependent on these renewables and batteries.”

While environmentalists are critical of the administration’s dismantling of climate policy, some note that DOE is not going full steam ahead on liquefied natural gas exports.

“The Department of Energy has actually been proceeding much more cautiously because I think industry advised them that they need to,” said Slocum. “If you approve an LNG application in a hasty or sloppy manner, it could be undone by courts and things could get tied up for a long time.”

Slocum said a recent approval of the CP2 LNG export project “was very careful and really went through the protesters’ arguments in pretty significant detail.”

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has pushed aggressively for more LNG commitments in U.S. trade deals. But the trade deals announced this year are not the traditional pacts approved by Congress with the force of law.

“The trade and tariff associated LNG push that Secretary Wright has been intimately involved in … when you start to put a microscope on it, it’s a big nothing burger so far,” said Slocum.

Even still, the proposed Alaska LNG project — despite the Trump administration’s zealous support for it — has yet to reach a final investment decision on the project’s 807-mile natural gas pipeline. Trump officials have touted several nonbinding agreements for the project.

On the homefront, Wright has used emergency authorities to force utilities to operate fossil fuel plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington. And new policies to boost fossil fuels keep rolling in. In early December, for instance, Wright teased new rules to use fossil-fuel-based backup generators to meet demand growth.

Meanwhile, nuclear energy is a major priority for the administration. The White House has pledged to quadruple nuclear energy in the United States by 2050 and is pushing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite license approvals.

DOE is poised to fund new uranium enrichment projects in the U.S., with a deadline approaching on a cutoff for Russian imports that are vital to the U.S. nuclear sector. But so far, utilities are moving sluggishly — if at all — to contract to build new nuclear plants.

AI, renewables and clean tech

A central question lingering over DOE in the coming months is what will happen to emerging technologies that could either advance or stall depending on federal funding. DOE has played a significant role in the past in commercializing technologies such as utility-scale solar through its loan office and other grants.

“We haven’t seen the most aggressive RFIs and requests for proposals … compared to how much funding they have available. Will there be new areas that emerge?” Kizer asked.

He said he is also watching closely how DOE taps nonmonetary tools to advance technologies, citing the department’s move in October to take a 5 percent stake in Lithium Americas.

Wright has framed much of DOE’s strategy around the push for AI, including plans to build data centers on federal land and implement the “Genesis Mission” on supercomputing.

One technology with a murky future is “clean” hydrogen, which was a focus of the Biden administration and backed by $8 billion under the infrastructure law. DOE has since moved to cancel two hydrogen hubs on the West Coast tied to producing fuel with renewables, but the fate of six other hubs — and billions of dollars from the law — remains up in the air.

What DOE decides will be particularly important for “blue” hydrogen produced with natural gas tied to carbon capture. According to analysts, that form of hydrogen is likely to be the focus in the U.S. partly because of rollbacks in federal support for renewables that would bolster “green” hydrogen.

But blue hydrogen has shown signs of struggling, underscoring the importance of the infrastructure law funding for the industry. Last month, Exxon Mobil said it was pausing plans for a major blue hydrogen project in Baytown, Texas, because of weak customer demand.

Environmentalists also have been raising concerns that administration changes to DOE models could allow hydrogen companies receiving federal tax credits to release more methane emissions with projects than previously envisioned.

With other emerging technologies, like fusion, funding is also a critical issue. Wright has been pushing for fusion — which envisions power plants using the same reaction powering the sun — and the recent DOE reorganization created a new office for the industry. The move will help gear the department more toward commercialization of projects, but details are being sorted out, said Andrew Holland, CEO of the Fusion Industry Association.

The new office shows the “administration takes seriously the goal and challenges of getting fusion energy commercialized,” said Holland, who met with Dario Gil, DOE’s undersecretary for science, this month.

But “there’s a reality that we’re in a budget-constrained environment,” he said in an interview. The fusion office currently is funded at around $800 million, and the industry is pushing for funding closer to $1 billion annually.

“We’re confident if the administration asked for it, Congress would support them,” Holland said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d8/fc/65d3ee274f048e4f384ae6b95a21/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2239622469,N,,2025-12-18 10:02:36.099346

This has become especially true in the hydrogen and ammonia market due to the slow and insufficient investments in infrastructure. Air Products, a market-leading hydrogen and ammonia company with substantial assets, has developed a plan with Yara International, a global ammonia and crop nutrition company, to combine their significant assets to increase hydrogen and ammonia output across the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Hydrogen and ammonia production have become the belle of the renewable energy ball

The international energy market has been developing frameworks to increase the production capacity of the hydrogen and ammonia market. Amid the calls to diversify energy assets and phase out reliance on fossil fuel-based energy generation, hydrogen has emerged as the undisputed king of the renewable energy market and has now been boosted by the news that Air Products and Yara are joining forces on two new hydrogen projects in the US and Saudi Arabia.

The pair of companies aims to integrate Air Products’ hydrogen and ammonia production capabilities with Yara’s market-leading ammonia supply network. The world has been consumed by the need to reduce emissions in the energy market and increase renewable energy generation over the coming years.

The Louisiana Clean Energy Complex is one of the projects targeted by Air Products and Yara

Air Products is exemplifying its substantial expertise in the hydrogen market by developing what will become the largest low-carbon energy complex anywhere in the world. The Louisiana Clean Energy Complex in the United States has been designed to produce approximately 750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen.

While Air Products is the project developer, Yara will be waiting in the wings to acquire the ammonia production once it reaches acceptable levels. Yara will also take over the necessary storage and transport of the ammonia produced for roughly 25% of the total project costs. Next up for the pair of companies will be the NEOM hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia.

“We are pleased to be working with Yara, the world’s leading fertilizer company, as we advance the global low-emission ammonia market and maximize value from our projects in Louisiana and Saudi Arabia,” – Air Products’ Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Menezes.

The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project is set to reshape the global energy market

Seeing as though the NEOM hydrogen project has reached a critical point, with over 90% of construction being completed, the next step is to offer an offtake agreement for the hydrogen and ammonia produced. Air Products has been selected as the sole offtaker for the reported 1.2 million tonnes per year of renewable ammonia at the site.

Transporting hydrogen and ammonia can be exceedingly expensive, and Yara will handle the transportation of the energy resources through its vast maritime transport vessels that will boost the sector globally. Both companies are targeting final investment decisions for the two projects by 2026.

“Air Products’ two advanced projects are a strong strategic fit with Yara’s flexible nitrogen system – enabling energy diversification and profitable decarbonization while aligning with our disciplined capital allocation policy. – Yara’s CEO Svein Tore Holsether

The global hydrogen and ammonia production market is growing at an incredible pace

With the progress made at the NEOM Green Hydrogen and ammonia facility in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Louisiana Clean Energy Complex, Yara and Air Products are set to bring in the new year with a renewed sense of optimism. The need to diversify the international energy market has become paramount for the global community.

That reduction coincides with a case backlog TCEQ faces.
As of August, the agency reported a backlog of 1,480 enforcement cases.
In the past, the EPA would help investigate state claims, but as the federal agency faces its own cuts, state cannot rely as much as in year prior.
These state budget numbers that come out are not per capita of the total budget.","The Texas Commission for Environmental Quality has struggled to keep up with enforcement claims amid years of cuts to the state environmental agency's budget, according to a recent study.

When adjusted for inflation, TCEQ’s budget was cut by roughly one-third between 2010 and 2024, even as the number of regulated industrial facilities in the state increased, according to an analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project.

The agency in 2010 had a budget of $539 million. The agency most recently worked on a $407 million budget in 2024.

That reduction coincides with a case backlog TCEQ faces. As of August, the agency reported a backlog of 1,480 enforcement cases.

In some cases, claims remain untouched for several years, said Kathryn Guerra, a former TCEQ employee who now works as an agency watchdog with the nonprofit group Public Citizen.

“Historically, the agency's own enforcement policy was to hold enforcement cases for several years,” said Guerra, who also worked with EIP for their Texas analysis. “And that unfortunately created for the TCEQ a really extensive backlog of pretty complex cases. In one instance, very recently, we saw an enforcement case go before the commissioners for approval, that was 10 years of enforcement action.”

According to the TCEQ, of the 9,198 complaints filed in 2025, just 6% of claims were investigated within five days. Nearly 55% of claims took a month or more to address.

That could leave some communities without recourse, said Andrew Quicksall with SMU’s environmental health and compliance quality program.

“It's like any other sort of enforcement or investigation that you may do,” Quicksall said. “Eventually things get backlogged to a point where you can't address them. And we have those problems where we have environmental claims that go without investigation because the backlog is so large.”

Quicksall also said cuts at the federal level have also strained the TCEQ's enforcement bandwidth. In the past, the EPA would help investigate state claims, but as the federal agency faces its own cuts, state cannot rely as much as in year prior.

The EIP's report also found that during the last legislative session, TCEQ requested nearly $60 million in additional funding and over 150 new staff positions to address its growing workload.

Following the 2025 Legislative Session, lawmakers only approved part of TCEQ’s $60 million and increased staffing request only granting the agency 67 new positions and a $47 million budget.

That limited funding can shape how vigorously the agency pursues enforcement, Guerra said.

“TCEQ has discretion to implement its own enforcement policies, and we're seeing those policies be very lenient towards industry,” he said. “The agency can be its own worst enemy with those enforcement policies because they've created a really complex backlog of cases by just holding them. Ultimately, what that means is that the communities that are suffering from environmental harm are not seeing any relief.”

TCEQ declined to provide a comment for this story, but the agency did send its annual enforcement policy report. In that report the agency says nearly a third of complaints are never investigated by the TCEQ but are either referred to another agency or are closed because of insufficient information.

The agency does acknowledge in its report that it has steered away investigators from enforcing new complaints because they were assigned to reducing its backlog.

Texas has seen a boom in industry and population in recent years. Advocates warn that if those trends continue, the reduced TCEQ budget may not be able to keep up with new enforcement claims in both existing and new sectors like data centers coming into the state.

In North Texas, Google already has two data centers in Red Oak and Midlothian with plans to build two more centers in the coming years. Google alone plans to invest $40 billion in Texas over the next two years. Other companies have also made plans in recent months, with millions of dollars coming to the state.

While state leaders have been eager to bring in these facilities, the massive centers use a significant amount of energy and water.

TCEQ, in a letter to the state legislature, warned increases in permits and new technologies like AI data centers could strain the agency’s operation.

""Without additional resources, it will be difficult for TCEQ to meet the increasing demands placed on the agency, including emerging technologies, and maintain state primacy for many of its programs.” the agency told lawmakers ahead of this year's session.

Guerra worries growing industry could strain the already stretched investigators.

""I'm very concerned about the TCEQ's capacity to regulate the industries it presently regulates and with this really booming expansion of AI and data centers that, by nature, take up significant resources and thereby need regulating,"" said Guerra.

Despite seeing a marginal increase in the past few years, the TCEQ is not positioned to handle growing demand, according to SMU's Quicksall.

“Our population is exploding,” Quicksall said. “And that's kind of a hidden issue here. We should be increasing [the budget] because of our increasing population. These state budget numbers that come out are not per capita of the total budget. But of course, our emissions, our environmental needs, roughly, are per capita. And so while you see the last three and now four years as increases, in reality, we've only just now gotten back to where we were 15 years ago.”

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email.
While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory.
Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.
Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers.","Calls are mounting for the largest US grid operator to make electricity more affordable after power costs again surged to a new high.

Households and businesses from New Jersey to Chicago will pay a record $16.4 billion to secure electricity starting in 2027, according PJM Interconnection LLC, which operates the 13-state grid that serves nearly one-fifth of Americans. The fee is a charge to ensure access to supplies, but doesn’t include the costs of power used.

PJM’s so-called capacity auction determines how much generators will get paid for being available to the grid. The results released Wednesday show the daily cost of those payouts rose to $333.44 per megawatt from $329.17, which will show up in users’ monthly utility bills. Prices were as low as $29 a megawatt in 2023.

“The amount of pressure on PJM is enormous,” said Daniel Palken, director of infrastructure for energy and permitting at philanthropy Arnold Ventures. “The people’s hackles are up.”

It’s the third consecutive record-breaking auction held by PJM, a process that has emerged as a focus of the national debate on affordability. Democrats campaigning on lower energy prices won victories in Virginia and New Jersey — two states within the grid’s territory. Meanwhile, governors across the region have called on PJM to make changes to lower the cost of electricity amid a massive build-out of AI data centers that has fueled record demand and prices.

The biggest beneficiaries of the auction will be independent power generators, Vistra Corp., which rose 1.9% in late trading Wednesday, earned $1.29 billion in the auction. Talen Energy Corp. cleared $1.07 billion and saw shares jump 5.1%. Constellation Energy Corp. earned $2.19 billion.

“This auction remains a wealth transfer from our struggling rate-payers to incumbent generators who would continue operating regardless of the auction prices,” Maryland lawmaker Lorig Charkoudian said in an email. “I’m angry. it didn’t have to be this way.”

Constellation is responding to high prices by investing billions in adding capacity, spokesman Paul Adams said in an email. The firm has also proposed adding 5,800 megawatts of supplies, including storage, in Maryland and increasing output from its existing nuclear fleet by about 1,000 megawatts.

“The increased demand necessitated by America’s national security imperative of winning the AI race is challenging PJM’s system reserve requirement in this most recent auction,” Adams said.

Vistra and Talen didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

While capacity is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s among the fastest growing due to the AI boom. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog. And in the latest auction, it comprised the majority of new demand, Stu Bresler, PJM’s executive vice president of market services and strategy, said on a call with reporters Wednesday.

“The energy market is not capable of meeting unlimited growth in a short amount of time without having massive price increases accompany that,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy in Indiana.

In spite of the skyrocketing costs, the auction for a second year didn’t manage to secure enough supply to meet projected demand. While the grid needs a 20% reserve margin to ensure reliability, the auction only cleared 14.8%.

That means the grid will be 6.6 gigawatts short — the equivalent of six big nuclear reactors — versus about 200 megawatts in the previous auction. PJM will need to procure more supplies through incremental follow-up auctions, Bresler said.

Costs would be even higher if not for a price cap negotiated last year. But PJM hasn’t decided whether to extend that price ceiling to further auctions. With Wednesday’s results hitting the limit, the grid operator will be more likely to move forward with an extension, according to ClearView Energy Partners.

“I think this price cap is in place indefinitely for the time being,” said Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith.

Preserving the cap is controversial, though. While it would limit consumer costs, developers argue it would prevent them from covering their own soaring costs with energy-hungry data centers spreading across PJM’s territory. While six governors have asked for an extension, Citigroup analyst Ryan Levine said it’s unlikely.

Pennsylvania consumers will pay about $126 for the 12-month period starting June 2027, according to a statement. In the next auction, the price cap — typically based on the cost of building new gas plants — is set to more than double to $776, but PJM is seeking approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adjust how it prices supplies, which could cut that cap to about $550. Either option points to much higher capacity cost given the projected demand from data centers.

PJM’s board is working on a proposal to integrate data centers to help them connect to the grid faster and potentially mitigate the impact on consumers. A dozen proposals failed to pass last month. FERC could provide guidance as early as Thursday on how to divvy up transmission charges for certain data center projects co-located with power plants.

The tech giants building those facilities – Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. – will closely be watched to see if they step up to help alleviate that pressure.

In the meantime, the impact of the rising auction prices will be felt most in states like New Jersey and Maryland where utilities rely heavily on the capacity market, said Mark Christie, former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman. But even Virginia, which can pay for power plants through utility rates, is seeing its own “generation deficit grow rapidly” as data center growth accelerates there, he said.

Data centers are also adding costs to the high-voltage transmission system that moves the electrons to consumers. PJM is in the processing of finalizing an $11.6 billion plan to build out the wires, substations and other related infrastructure largely to meet soaring demand from data centers, which would be paid for by consumers.

“PJM needs real reform and they are running out of time to protect consumers from their inaction,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said in a statement after the auction.

In addition to climate science, researchers based there study Earth and space weather, atmospheric chemistry, and their impacts on the environment and humans.","On Tuesday, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, announced that a major climate research center will be “broken up.” The National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR, is a significant contributor to research on the weather, climate, and other atmospheric phenomena. The move will be a crippling blow to climate research in the US and is being widely decried by scientists.

Vought initially gave a statement regarding NCAR to USA Today and later confirmed the outlet’s reporting on social media. Calling it “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” Vought also decried what he termed “woke” activities at NCAR. These appear to be fairly typical efforts made to attract underrepresented groups to the sciences—efforts that were uncontroversial prior to the current administration.

NCAR is primarily based in a complex on the outskirts of Boulder, Colorado, and maintains a supercomputing center in Wyoming. Much of its funding comes from the National Science Foundation, but the day-to-day management is handled by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a nonprofit that represents 130 individual educational institutions. In addition to climate science, researchers based there study Earth and space weather, atmospheric chemistry, and their impacts on the environment and humans. NCAR hosts a series of webpages that explain its research and all the ways it helps society.

Vought indicates that the government will specifically target what were termed “green new scam research activities,” while moving other aspects of the center’s work to different institutions. The government doesn’t directly manage activities at NCAR, though, and it’s not clear whether its agreement with UCAR allows it to directly order these sorts of changes. The NSF has since released a statement that suggests it’s ready to do as ordered; it references preserving a list of critical functions that does not include climate change, and discusses divesting NCAR resources like its supercomputing center and research aircraft.

UCAR, for its part, has issued a statement indicating that the USA Today article was the first it has heard of the matter.

In many cases where the administration has attempted to take drastic actions like this, courts have ruled that they run afoul of a legal prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” federal actions. That said, courtroom losses haven’t inhibited the administration’s willingness to try, and the time spent waiting for legal certainty can often accomplish many of its aims, such as disrupting research on politically disfavored subjects and forcing scientists to look elsewhere for career stability.

Scientists, meanwhile, are reacting with dismay. “Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet,” said Texas Tech climate researcher Katharine Hayhoe. “Everyone who works in climate and weather has passed through its doors and benefited from its incredible resources.”

Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, called NCAR a “unique and valuable asset” and emphasized the wide range of research conducted there.

Obviously, shutting down one source of information about climate change won’t alter what’s happening—greenhouse gases will continue to behave as physics dictates, raising global temperatures. But the Trump administration seemingly views everything through the lens of ideology. It has concluded that scientists are its ideological opponents and thus that its own ideologically driven conclusions are equal to the facts produced by science. Because of that perspective, it has been willing to harm scientists, even if the cost will eventually be felt by the public that Trump ostensibly represents.

Carol Howle, current Executive Vice-President, Supply, Trading & Shipping, will serve as interim CEO until April. Auchincloss will serve in an advisory role until December 2026.

O’Neill, currently CEO of Woodside Energy, oversaw the acquisition of BHP Petroleum International. Before joining Woodside Energy in 2018, she spent 23 years at ExxonMobil in technical, operational and leadership positions.

Albert Manifold, Chair of BP, said her “relentless focus” on business improvement will prepare the multinational firm for its next growth phase.

“The board believes this transition creates an opportunity to accelerate our strategic vision to become a simpler, leaner, and more profitable company,” he said.

Auchincloss said after more than three decades with BP, now is the right time to hand the reins to a new leader, and despite the announcement taking the markets by surprise, insisted it has been in his plans.

“When Albert became Chair (in July), I expressed my openness to step down were an appropriate leader identified who could accelerate delivery of bp’s strategy,” he said.

Auchincloss, who took over as CEO from Bernard Looney last year, was responsible for a fundamental reset of BP’s strategy, scaling back some ambitious low-carbon energy investments and increasing focus on oil and gas production to boost returns and compete with rivals.

Despite the strategic changes, BP’s share price performance lagged its rivals, and the stock was 16% lower at the end of his first year as permanent CEO than at the start. This underperformance led to criticism and pressure from activist investors such as Elliott.

BP recently pulled out from the H2Teesside blue hydrogen project in a fresh set back to the UK’s hydrogen industry and government’s net zero push.

BP exited the Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) in Pilbara, Australia, in July, as it pivoted to fossil fuels.

At the end of April, BP announced it will supply natural gas to Woodside for its Louisiana LNG project, marking Woodside’s first secured tranche of feed gas for the site.

Alongside the merger with BHP Petroleum, Woodside Energy said O’Neill led the company to final investment decision (FID) on the Scarborough Energy Project, startup of the Sangomar Project, FID for the Louisiana LNG Project, and the Beaumont New Ammonia acquisition, among others.

Emboldened by the 2024 election results that resulted in full GOP control of Washington, Republicans began the year on a political high, but it’s been rough going since then. President Donald Trump’s job ratings have slipped back into mediocrity, and Democrats have consistently overperformed in elections around the country.

It’s possible that voter sentiment will improve from a rebounding economy, helping Republicans narrowly salvage their majorities in Congress. But what’s more likely is the political environment gets worse for the GOP, allowing Democrats to experience sizable midterm gains.

While it’s wise to be open-minded about a wide range of outcomes, particularly more than 10 months from an election, there are two most likely scenarios for 2026.

A GOP squeaker

Republicans are aware of the historical midterm trends: In recent weeks, both Speaker Mike Johnson and National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson have mentioned defying them. The president’s party has lost House seats in 20 of the past 22 midterm elections, and the fewest number of seats lost in those cycles were four (1962) and five (1986). House Republicans can’t afford to lose more than two next year.

But the conditions during the two midterm outliers, 2002 and 1998, don’t match the current environment.

In 2002, Republicans gained eight House seats, bolstered by President George W. Bush’s 68 percent job approval rating during the first midterm. And Democrats gained five House seats in 1998, when President Bill Clinton’s job approval was at 66 percent. Trump’s job approval rating is 43 percent, according to Nate Silver’s national average.

Even if Trump were to abandon his tariffs and the economy bounces back, his job approval is unlikely to get much higher. That’s just not what happens to presidents of either party at a similar point. Typically, presidents become less popular as midterms approach. More specifically, the average drop is 8 points off their job approval rating.

The most encouraging midterm scenario for Republicans might also be the most recent. President Joe Biden’s job approval rating was 40 percent for the 2022 elections, according to Gallup, and yet Democrats lost a modest nine House seats and even gained a Senate seat. The Republican gains were, of course, enough for the House majority, but the cycle could have been much worse for Democrats given Biden’s political condition. This cycle, a nine-seat loss might be enough for Republicans to hold on to the House if the outstanding redistricting efforts break in their party’s favor. And anything less than a four-seat Democratic gain in the Senate would preserve GOP control of that chamber.

But, on the current trajectory, the midterms are likely to get more difficult for Republicans.

A GOP wipeout

It’s clear that GOP strategists believe the current political environment is poor when a common refrain heard is “There’s still time.” Not only should that be added to the list of “Things Losing Candidates Say,” but there’s little evidence that time will help Republicans since the current trend line is working against them.

Trump’s job approval rating has been on a steady decline from 52 percent at the beginning of his term to 43 percent now, according to Nate Silver. That tracks closely with his previous White House stint, when his approval rating was at 38 percent during the 2018 midterms, according to Gallup, and Democrats had a net gain of 41 seats. Over those four years in office, his popularity didn’t improve demonstrably.

Democrats currently have a narrow advantage on the generic ballot, 44 percent to 41 percent, according to the Decision Desk HQ average. And, maybe more importantly, they’ve been consistently overperforming their 2024 margins in a variety of real races and places, from coast to coast, over the past year. Their candidates overperformed in Democratic areas (Virginia, New Jersey, California), Republican areas (Tennessee’s 7th District, Florida’s 1st and 6th) and swing areas (Georgia).

Republicans can try to explain away individual contests, but the trend is clear. And even the Republican wins in 2025 should be concerning for the party because of the reduced margins, sometimes even with good turnout.

A similar overperformance in November would deliver the House to Democrats with plenty of seats to spare and put the Senate within reach. Republicans should win GOP-leaning states such as Ohio, Iowa, Texas and Alaska under normal political conditions. But if 2026 is extraordinary for Democrats, the elections could feel closer to 2018, 2010 or 2006 than to 2022.

More than the president literally putting his name on midterm ballots as he suggested this week, Republicans need Trump’s political standing to improve. They need voters to feel better about the economy, cost of living and direction of the country with Republicans in power. Time is running out on their ability to blame Barack Obama for the high cost of health care and Biden for the economy, particularly when both are so far out of the public eye.

There are plenty of other potential pitfalls for the GOP, including the rising costs of health care (especially if the Affordable Care Act subsidies expire and there’s no alternative), Trump’s immigration tactics and retribution tour, the Epstein files, the president’s age, a war with Venezuela that no one knew was necessary and a White House ballroom no one knew was needed. Even good economic news would have a tough time cutting through all the other noise.

The bottom line is that the Republican Party doesn’t do well in elections in which President Donald Trump is the focus. And by nature of his personality and being the incumbent president, the GOP is on track for that scenario to repeat itself. When recent outcomes match up with historical trends, it’s up to the other party to demonstrate how this cycle is going to be an aberration.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/house_gop_458_121625.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:02:39.995995

""The Plastics Industry Association thanks Congressman Weber for introducing the PACK Act,"" said Matt Seaholm, PLASTICS President and CEO.
Seaholm emphasized that the PACK Act would establish a clear national framework under the FTC, reducing uncertainty and supporting businesses operating across state lines.","US Rep. Randy Weber, R-TX, has introduced the Packaging and Claims Knowledge (PACK) Act of 2025, a bill aimed at establishing voluntary federal standards for environmental claims on packaging.

The legislation seeks to eliminate misleading labels that confuse consumers about recycling and composting, while promoting transparency and consistency across the industry.

Across the United States, a patchwork of state regulations has allowed unverified claims such as ""recyclable,"" ""compostable,"" and ""reusable"" to appear on packaging, often without any connection to real-world recycling or composting systems. This inconsistency has made it harder for consumers to determine what can actually be recycled and has undermined legitimate environmental initiatives.

""Americans want to do the right thing, but misleading labels make that harder,"" Weber said in a statement. ""The PACK Act cuts through that confusion. It's pro-environment, pro-business, and rooted in common sense, all while holding companies accountable and giving consumers clear, honest information they can trust.""

Issues & challenges

Packaging and labeling standards in the United States are increasingly shaped by state-level regulations, particularly those adopted in California. Due to the size of California's market, the state's standards often have national implications for manufacturers, supply chains, and consumers, even when companies operate primarily outside of California. This dynamic has raised concerns about regulatory consistency and the impact of state-specific requirements on interstate commerce.

The PACK Act would require environmental claims on packaging to be scientifically verified and recognized by existing recycling programs. By ensuring claims are backed by credible evidence, the bill aims to build consumer trust in environmentally friendly packaging without imposing additional mandates on companies. Industry leaders have expressed strong support for the initiative, emphasizing its potential to create a clear, national framework for packaging regulations.

Currently, packaging regulations vary significantly across states, creating confusion for consumers and challenges for businesses navigating inconsistent requirements. Industry representatives have commended the PACK Act for addressing these regulatory inconsistencies. They believe the bill will help streamline compliance, reduce consumer confusion, and support the adoption of sustainable packaging practices.

If passed, the PACK Act could mark a significant step forward in aligning environmental claims with scientific standards, fostering greater transparency, and enhancing consumer confidence in recycling and composting efforts.

Groups offer support

Lynn Dyer, president of Ameripen, praised Weber for introducing the PACK Act and expressed the organization's support for the bill's creation of a federal framework for recyclable, compostable, and reusable claims under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

""This new framework will address concerns with the patchwork of state regulations and its negative effect on interstate commerce and consumer awareness regarding management of consumer packaging,"" Dyer said. ""Ameripen will continue to support Congressman Weber as he moves this critical legislation through the House of Representatives.""

The Plastics Industry Association also voiced its support for Weber and the PACK Act.

""The Plastics Industry Association thanks Congressman Weber for introducing the PACK Act,"" said Matt Seaholm, PLASTICS President and CEO. ""Plastic packaging is essential to modern life — protecting products, keeping food fresh, and ensuring medical supplies arrive safely — yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable, and reusable packaging claims. This growing patchwork not only creates regulatory uncertainty but also has the potential to increase costs and contribute to broader affordability concerns.""

Seaholm emphasized that the PACK Act would establish a clear national framework under the FTC, reducing uncertainty and supporting businesses operating across state lines.

""As an industry that employs more than one million Americans, we appreciate Congressman Weber's leadership on this important issue that strengthens US manufacturing and consumer confidence,"" Seaholm concluded.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt08823f5db61ded5d/blt1b0889e6d697ef2f/694313a2fad0bfe41e34fe4f/CapitolHill.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-18 10:04:52.147840

For years, there was no comparison between Tesla and any American EV start-up, but the company's current struggles have led some investors to consider alternative plays. While the electric vehicle industry has a long road ahead, I think investing in Rivian could be a better choice right now. Here's why.

Tesla is losing steam

Tesla is by no means finished in the EV market, but the benefits that came from its early lead in electric vehicles are certainly starting to fade.

For one, Tesla faces immense competitive pressure, both from Chinese automakers abroad and at home. The company continues to lose market share around the world and, in the U.S., Tesla's vehicle sales reached a nearly four-year low in November.

Moreover, Tesla's financial picture is no longer as strong as it once was. The company's revenue rose just 12% in the third quarter to $28.1 billion, largely due to some customers rushing to purchase a Tesla before the EV tax credits expired. Even with the temporary bump, Tesla's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income fell 37% from the year-ago quarter to $1.4 billion.

That decline came as Tesla's operating expenses rose 50% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, a significant increase for such an established company. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has set his sights on autonomy and robotics as the future of the company, and that's starting to fuel more spending.

I don't think it's misguided for Tesla to incorporate these goals into its future plans. After all, automated vehicles (AVs) could be worth an estimated $1.4 trillion by 2040, and humanoid robots may be worth an estimated $5 trillion by 2050. But they're also unproven markets that will take billions of dollars to develop over the coming years.

Add all of this up, and Tesla is spending more at the same time its lead in EVs is tumbling -- a bad combination.

Rivian has big ambitions, but success isn't guaranteed

Investors looking for a sure bet won't find it in Rivian, I'm sorry to say. The company, like Tesla, faces rising competition, and unlike Tesla, it isn't profitable. Rivian reported a net loss of $1.2 billion in the third quarter, with operating expenses increasing nearly 30% to $1 billion.

But one thing I think Rivian has going for is that it appears to have a solid plan for attracting customers with smaller budgets. The company's smaller R2 SUV will go on sale next year, starting at just $45,000. And in 2027, it plans to launch an even cheaper R3, priced around $40,000.

If Rivian can hold to this price tag, the R2 will be $5,000 cheaper than the average new car price -- traditional combustion engine vehicles included -- and the R3 will be $10,000 cheaper. The one nagging reason why car buyers avoid EVs is because of their cost, so if Rivian can continue to lower its prices it could potentially attract more customers.

“Each iteration of the state energy plan has focused on addressing immediate needs and proactively addressing challenges on the horizon.
This is why this State energy plan is so important.","With an eye on 2040, the State Energy Planning Board voted unanimously to approve a State Energy Plan, which is based on findings from more than a year-long assessment of current systems and future energy needs that will guide the energy-related decision making.

Its objectives include ensuring affordable, abundant, reliable, and clean energy while supporting economic development, equity, and a healthy environment. The plan also embraces a continued commitment to renewables while also noting that a variety of energy sources, like advanced nuclear and natural gas, will be needed to help New York meet its overall energy needs over the next 15 years.

“The State Energy Plan is the product of a pragmatic and objective process that comes at a critical yet challenging time for energy planning in New York as we continue to build out renewable resources while factoring in new energy demands and confronting federal headwinds,” said Doreen M. Harris, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and chief executive officer. “I commend my fellow Board members and state agency staff for their dedication to developing this Plan, which identifies specific actions to advance over the next several years while maintaining resource diversity – which is key to continued energy reliability and affordability for all New Yorkers.”

The plan was developed at a time when the energy sector faces significant uncertainty stemming from economic pressures and a shift in federal priorities and policies away from renewable energy projects. The analyses conducted for the Plan have been updated to reflect the latest available data and federal actions since modelling was completed for the Draft Plan released in July. Updates also included further focus on energy affordability considerations and strategies to manage system costs, including through demand-side flexibility and added discussion of new, large loads and ways to manage associated grid and cost impacts.

The analyses inform five primary planning goals and associated actions to continue to meet New York’s energy needs which include:

— Delivering abundant, reliable, resilient and clean energy through a diverse mix of resources and supply infrastructure, while supporting energy efficiency and load flexibility.

— Providing affordable energy to households and equitable benefits – with a focus on reducing the upfront costs of efficiency and clean energy choices to help cut spending and lessen the burden for lower-income households.

— Supporting economic growth and competitiveness by investing in workforce development, meeting the needs of large energy users, and attracting new industry, including clean energy leaders.

— Strengthening partnerships across New York’s innovation ecosystem to foster economic development, create jobs, and provide greater leverage for State investments.

— Continuing progress toward decarbonization and a clean energy economy.

One of Western New York’s largest providers showed its support for the plan. “NYSERDA and the State Energy Planning Board demonstrated strong, thoughtful leadership in their 2025 State Energy Plan, expanding on Governor Hochul’s call for an all-of-the above approach,” said National Grid New York President Sally Librera in a statement. “Importantly, the plan recognizes critical electric and natural gas infrastructure investments are needed to meet the growing demands of our customers, including businesses that power our economy. National Grid stands ready to support the next phase of policy making that will ensure New York’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy future.”

The process to update the State Energy Plan was announced in August 2024. The State Energy Planning Board, comprised of the heads of 10 state agencies and authorities, appointees from the governor, Senate, and Assembly, and the president of the New York Independent System Operator, commenced its work to assess and compile data to inform the Draft State Energy Plan, which was released in July for public review and comment.

The release of the Plan follows a public comment period which included 10 public hearings, seven in-person and three virtual, and written comments. The State Energy Planning Board received and considered nearly 15,000 written comments and more than 1,000 people attended public hearings, with nearly 450 providing oral comments – which were also considered. The Board received input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including individual New Yorkers, environmental organizations, utilities and energy companies, labor unions, and trade and business organizations, underscoring the importance of the Plan’s focus on energy affordability and maintaining an abundant and diverse mix of energy sources and supply infrastructure.

“Energy planning is far from a simple endeavor,” said New York State Public Service Commission Chair Rory M. Christian said. “Each iteration of the state energy plan has focused on addressing immediate needs and proactively addressing challenges on the horizon. Today, we have many challenges. Rapid load growth, increasingly frequent severe weather driven by climate change and a constantly evolving federal landscape that is absent of the stability needed to ensure energy security. This is why this State energy plan is so important. Through this effort, we chart a path toward a cleaner, sustainable energy future.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.post-journal.com/images/2016/10/31144144/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 04:00:36.284439

Top Gear’s latest deep-dive on next-generation EV tech finally puts some honest timelines on the table, and they’re not what most prospective buyers want to hear.

Here’s what you need to know:

What: Rimac Technology revealed its solid-state battery prototype at the Munich IAA show, developed with ProLogium and Mitsubishi

When: Test car by 2028, production car (likely a Bugatti) around 2030, price parity with conventional batteries by 2035

The specs: 25% more energy density, 10-80% charging in 6-10 minutes, non-flammable, retains 95% capacity at -4°F (-20°C)

Why it matters: If you’re waiting for solid-state batteries to hit mainstream EVs, you’re looking at a decade-long wait

The Timeline Problem Nobody Wants to Discuss

Rimac COO Nurdin Pitarević was unusually candid in his assessment. “It’ll take until 2028 before there’s a battery in a test car, and around 2030 before it’s in a production car,” he told Top Gear’s Paul Horrell. And that production car? Almost certainly a multi-million dollar Bugatti, not something you or I will be cross-shopping against a Model Y.

The 2035 price parity target is the number that should grab your attention. That’s when Pitarević expects solid-state batteries to cost the same as today’s NMC lithium-ion packs. For context, that’s the same year the EU plans to ban new combustion engine sales.

This tracks with what we’ve seen from every major SSB announcement. Toyota has been promising solid-state batteries since 2020, pushing the target from 2023 to 2026 to now 2027-2028. QuantumScape, backed by Volkswagen, just demonstrated their technology in a Ducati motorcycle at IAA Munich, but actual cars remain years away.

The Semi-Solid Reality Check: Nio Already Tried This

Here’s something the solid-state hype machine doesn’t want you to know: Nio already shipped semi-solid batteries, and they discontinued them.

The Chinese automaker’s 150 kWh semi-solid battery pack, developed with WeLion, promised 650+ miles of range and hit the market in late 2023. It worked. CEO William Li personally live-streamed a 14-hour, 1,044 km (650 mile) drive to prove it.

Then they stopped making it.

“We deployed the battery packs providing our users the option to flexibly upgrade to the 150kWh [and] found that actually they are not using this pack as often as we expected,” Li explained to EV media in November 2025. Translation: when you have good charging infrastructure (Nio operates 2,300+ battery swap stations in China), nobody wants to pay premium prices for extreme range.

The 150 kWh pack’s subscription fee was prohibitive, and only a few hundred units were ever produced. It wasn’t a technology failure, it was a market failure. Customers voted with their wallets, and they chose convenience over capacity.

The Players: Who’s Actually Close to Production?

The solid-state landscape breaks down into three tiers:

Tier 1: Actually demonstrated in vehicles

QuantumScape and VW’s PowerCo debuted their QSE-5 cells in a modified Ducati V21L motorcycle at IAA Munich. The specs are impressive: 844 Wh/L energy density and 12.2 minutes from 10-80% charge. But a motorcycle and a mass-market car are very different animals. PowerCo has a license to produce up to 40 GWh per year when the technology matures, enough for roughly one million vehicles.

Tier 2: Validated cells, no vehicles yet

Factorial Energy has validated 77Ah cells with Stellantis and Mercedes, claiming 375 Wh/kg energy density and 18-minute charging from 15-90%. Mercedes drove a modified EQS 750 miles on a single charge using Factorial’s quasi-solid-state batteries. A demonstration fleet is planned for 2026, but Factorial’s true solid-state “Solstice” technology isn’t expected until the end of the decade.

Tier 3: Big promises, long timelines

Chery claims 600 Wh/kg energy density and 808 miles of range, targeting pilot production in 2026 and mass production in 2027. Toyota continues to promise 621+ miles of range and 40-year battery lifespans, but has yet to put solid-state cells in a production vehicle despite a decade of announcements.

Range Extenders: The Technology That Actually Works Today

While the industry chases solid-state dreams, a simpler solution is quietly taking over.

Range extenders (REX) use a small gasoline engine purely as a generator to charge the battery, never directly powering the wheels. The technology had its moment a decade ago with the BMW i3 REX and Chevrolet Volt, then largely disappeared from Western markets.

Now it’s back, and Chinese automakers are leading the charge. Li Auto built its entire business on extended-range EVs, running on batteries 95% of the time with a small engine for backup. BYD’s DM-i models, Yangwang’s U8, and Mazda’s MX-30 all use the technology.

The Western response is coming. BMW plans to launch the iX5 Rex by 2026 with a targeted 621-mile total range. The company is also considering range extenders for the X5 and 7-Series in China, where its sales have collapsed 30% as local manufacturers dominate with exactly this technology.

Supplier ZF has developed a plug-and-play range extender solution that could be used to retrofit existing battery electric cars, expected from next year. VW’s Scout brand will offer range-extended SUVs in the US, and Ram is preparing a range-extended 1500 REV pickup targeting 690 miles of total range.

Why Range Extenders Make Sense Right Now

The math favors range extenders in the near term:

Smaller battery, lower cost: A REX vehicle can use a 30-40 kWh battery instead of 80-100 kWh, dramatically reducing the most expensive component.

No range anxiety: When the battery depletes, the engine kicks in as a generator. You can refuel anywhere, not just at charging stations.

Peak efficiency: Unlike a traditional hybrid where the engine powers the wheels at varying RPMs, a REX engine runs only at its optimal efficiency point. This makes the “depleted battery” phase more efficient than a standard hybrid.

Electric driving experience: Because the engine never directly powers the wheels, you still get the smooth, quiet electric driving experience 95%+ of the time.

The downside? When you’re flat out on an autobahn or towing uphill after the battery is depleted, you’re limited to whatever power that small engine can generate. For most driving scenarios, this is never an issue.

EVXL’s Take

I’ve watched solid-state battery promises for nearly a decade now, and I’ve developed a simple rule: take any announced timeline and add five years. Toyota promised production SSBs by 2020. It’s 2025, and they’re now targeting 2027-2028. Rimac is refreshingly honest about 2030 being realistic for hypercars, with mainstream affordability pushed to 2035.

Here’s what I expect: Range extenders will become the dominant “bridge technology” for the next 5-7 years, especially in markets with limited charging infrastructure. We’ll see semi-solid batteries (like Factorial’s FEST technology) hit premium vehicles by 2026-2027. True solid-state won’t reach mainstream affordable EVs until the early 2030s.

For prospective buyers, the practical advice is straightforward: If you’re buying an EV in 2025-2026, don’t wait for solid-state. If range anxiety is your primary concern and you’re considering a pure BEV, take a serious look at extended-range options from Chinese manufacturers or wait for BMW’s iX5 Rex in 2026.

The Nio 150 kWh experiment proved something important: extreme range isn’t what most EV owners actually want when they have convenient charging. What they want is the confidence that they won’t be stranded. Range extenders deliver that confidence today, without waiting for battery chemistry breakthroughs that remain years away.

On December 11, JPMorgan lowered the firm’s price target on DTE Energy to $145 from $151 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. This sentiment was posted as the firm broadly updated models in its North American utilities group.

Earlier in its Q3 2025 earnings report, the company disclosed total operating earnings of $468 million, translating to an EPS of $2.25, which beat Street estimates by $0.14. The company’s total revenue totaled $3.53 billion in Q3, which was a 21.37% year-over-year increase and beat estimates by $295.19 million.

DTE Electric was the standout performer, achieving $541 million in operating earnings, a substantial $104 million increase compared to Q3 2024. However, the DTE Gas segment reported an unfavorable operating earnings result of $38 million, which was $25 million lower than Q3 2024, mainly due to higher O&M and rate-based costs. Separately, DTE Vantage delivered $41 million in operating earnings, an $8 million increase from 2024, while Energy Trading contributed $23 million for the quarter.

The company also announced a major increase to its capital plan and strategic initiatives driven by significant deals in the data center market. DTE finalized an agreement with a leading hyperscaler to support 1.4 gigawatts of data center load, a key milestone in its growth strategy.

The move is especially welcome for Democrats who said that the cuts — part of broader attacks from President Donald Trump on climate programs and clean energy funding — would slash projects boosting the electric grid, threaten thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs, and send Americans’ energy costs soaring.

The government’s lawyers confirmed in a court filing this week — in response to a lawsuit by several clean energy groups and the city of St. Paul over the canceled funding — that the selection of grants in fact, “was influenced by whether a grantee’s address was located in a State that tends to elect … Democratic candidates in state and national elections (so-called “Blue States”).”

That contradicts the Energy Department’s earlier assertion that partisanship was not part of the cuts.

Sarah Nelson, acting inspector general for the Energy Department, said in a letter to members of Congress on Wednesday that the audit of the canceled funds will review “whether those cancellations were in accordance with established criteria.”

“This work will help ensure that these activities are conducted consistently with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental policies and procedures,” Nelson added.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In October, the Energy Department announced that 321 funding awards across 223 projects were terminated, saying that after review, they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

At the time, White House budget director Russell Vought said awards across California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state would be cut. All 16 targeted states supported Harris, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright initially said the cuts were “business decisions on whether it’s a good use of the taxpayer money or not.”

More than two dozen Democratic members of Congress from California, led by California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, wrote a letter to the acting inspector general in late October requesting a formal investigation into the canceled funding, saying that the cuts “based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias.”

The letter said because the project funding came from the bipartisan infrastructure law, passed by Congress under former President Joe Biden, that the Department does not have the authority to terminate awards and that the decisions are “unlawful and will cause harm to Americans.”

Schiff said in a statement he was pleased to see the investigation into what he called “clear political targeting … intended to punish blue states.”

The cuts, which hit California the hardest, include more than $1 billion for a hydrogen hub there.

ALGA President Mayor Matt Burnett said: “We are pleased that climate and energy ministers recognise that local governments play key roles in reducing emissions and incorporating climate considerations into how we plan, build and live.”

“Future-proofing communities from the changing climate continues to be a national priority, and Australia’s councils are leading the way by investing heavily in climate resilience solutions,” Mayor Burnett said.

ALGA’s research shows that Australia’s councils are already delivering more than $400 million per year in projects to prepare their communities for the changing climate needs and will invest about $2 billion in adaptation over the next five years.

“We are calling for an Adaptation Fund that councils can rely on, so they can scale up their projects and protect their communities. Enabling local investments supports the resilience of our infrastructure, health system and natural environment to climate impacts across our nation.”

Ministers have also committed to working with councils where decisions affect local communities.

As a wave of data center developers further their plans to set up shop in Michigan, two bipartisan Michigan lawmakers want to repeal the tax breaks that are luring them.

State Rep. Jim DeSana, R-Carleton, announced Tuesday during an anti-data center rally at the Capitol that he and Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, are sponsoring a three-bill package to overturn the sales and use tax exemptions that lawmakers narrowly approved last session in hopes of enticing tech companies to build massive “hyperscale” data centers in Michigan.

Since then, no fewer than 14 hyperscale proposals have cropped up from west Michigan to metro Detroit, prompting cheers from business leaders and outcry from residents who worry the massive, energy-hungry facilities will despoil communities and strain the power grid.

“I’d like to think that some people are having second thoughts” about their vote to approve the tax breaks, said DeSana.

Still, he predicted the repeal effort would face an uphill battle in the Legislature, given the massive lobbying power of monopoly utilities that stand to ink profitable energy contracts with data center developers.

But DeSana noted that mounting public opposition to the facilities could change political dynamics. Thousands of people have filed public comments opposing Michigan’s first major hyperscale data center proposal in Washtenaw County’s Saline Township, and dozens turned out on the Capitol lawn Tuesday to call for a statewide moratorium on data center development.

Protestors chanted “no secret deals” in objection to DTE Energy’s quest to gain state approval of a 19-year power contract for the Saline Township development without publicly disclosing full terms of the contract.

A DTE spokesperson said that company still was reviewing the proposed tax break elimination and couldn’t comment.

Consumers Energy spokesperson Katie Carey said the utility is “committed to providing reliable, affordable energy that makes growth possible – helping our communities thrive today and for generations to come. Repealing this policy will put Michigan further behind other states and hinder our ability to support Michigan’s economy and long-term growth.”

On farmland in the community south of Ann Arbor, tech giants OpenAI, Oracle and Related Digital plan to build a $7 billion, 1.4-gigawatt Stargate facility that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has hailed as “the largest economic project in Michigan history.”

Other developers far along in the planning process for proposed data centers include Microsoft, which last year purchased two separate plots of industrially zoned land in Kent and Allegan counties, and a Google-connected developer that has received approval to build a six-building facility in Oakland County’s Lyon Township.

The state’s largest utilities, DTE and Consumers Energy, have told investors that, in addition to the Saline Township proposal, they are in late-stage talks with data center developers looking to secure a total of 5 gigawatts of power capacity. That amounts to between four and six average-sized hyperscale facilities. If all come to fruition, Michigan’s peak energy demand could surge 39%.

But for seemingly every newly announced proposal recently, a proposed project has been cancelled or postponed as local communities fight the massive developments.

Opponents fear lost farmland and destroyed habitat, noise pollution from thousands of humming servers, strain on the electric grid and higher bills as utilities spend mightily on infrastructure to power the facilities, and strain on rivers and aquifers amid data centers’ use of water to cool servers.

“Our resources are at risk,” said Kathryn Haushalter, who lives next to the property slated for the Stargate facility. Rather than selling too, she promised to “stay and fight” the development.

In Howell Township, public outcry and a newly passed moratorium on data centers prompted developers to withdraw a proposal to rezone farmland for a $1 billion facility. Project backers said in a Facebook post they wanted to “give the Township and its residents the time needed to develop thoughtful, well-considered regulations for any future data centers.”

Proposals in Kalkaska and in Monroe County’s Dundee Township were similarly shelved amid public pushback.

The churn of announcements and cancellations also points to the speculative nature of the data center business. Developers often pitch their plans in multiple communities, but only move forward in the community that presents the quickest pathway to approval, said Douglas Jester, managing partner at the energy consulting firm 5 Lakes Energy.

“It’s very clear that data centers are shopping for locations,” Jester said Tuesday during a forum hosted by the Michigan State University Institute for Public Policy & Social Research.

As opposition to the facilities mounts, several local governments have placed preemptive moratoriums on data center development, aiming to give local leaders time to craft regulations dictating where and how the industry can set up shop.

Beyond tax breaks, Michigan’s climate, abundant water and excess capacity on its utility grid make the state appealing to data center developers, said Dong Zhao, a Michigan State University associate professor of construction management and civil engineering who spoke during Tuesday’s forum.

“We have energy and we have water and we have the cold weather,” which can help dissipate the heat generated by running thousands of computers 24/7, he said.

Data center advocates argue the industry can bring needed benefits to Michigan, such as new revenue to help cover the costs of poles, wires and pipes that deliver electricity and water. Many communities are struggling to maintain their utility infrastructure after decades of industrial decline left systems overbuilt and underfunded.

Officials in the Benton Harbor area, for instance, have said they hope to lure a data center to bolster the customer base of a water system that struggles to cover basic maintenance after the closure of large factories that once helped pay the bills.

Officials in Augusta Township, likewise, say they have plenty of water to supply a proposed data center because the water system was built to provide millions of gallons a day to a since-closed General Motors plant.

If contracts are structured appropriately, data center developments can bring similar benefits to electricity customers, said Lucas Fykes, energy policy director for the Data Center Coalition, an industry lobbying group.

“As you add on large-load customers, you’re able to spread out those fixed costs,” Fykes said. “It puts downward pressure on rates for all the other residential customers.”

The Saline Township proposal

Utility regulators on the Michigan Public Service Commission could decide within days whether to approve power contracts for the Saline Township data center.

DTE Energy is seeking ex parte approval of a 19-year deal to supply power to the facility.

Utility officials contend that the data center will pay for more than its fair share of utility costs, resulting in $300 million in annual savings for other customers. They have urged commissioners to swiftly approve the contracts, warning that their agreement with project developers includes the option for the developers to terminate the project if power isn’t secured by Dec. 19.

The commission’s next meeting is Thursday, Dec. 18.

“Our discussions with the developer and customer have indicated they need to start construction at the beginning of the year to move forward with the project site,” DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot told Bridge Michigan last month.

Ratepayer advocacy groups, environmentalists and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel have urged commissioners to instead open up a so-called contested case, a lengthy review process that would allow deeper public scrutiny of the proposed deal. They contend the publicly available version of DTE’s application is so heavily redacted, it’s impossible to know whether it’s a good deal for ratepayers.

Holding up an oversized version of the blacked-out document during Tuesday’s protest, Nessel asked the crowd, “Does that seem transparent to you?

“We’re not asking the Public Service Commission just to completely destroy this project,” Nessel said. “We just want to know … what the hell is going on and what that will mean for the people of our state.”

In addition to the utility contract, developers need permits from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to install diesel-powered backup generators and begin construction activities that would impact wetlands and the Saline River.

Data center opponents are mobilizing to fight the wetlands request, citing “red flags,” including potential harm to endangered species, destruction of wetlands and what they say is insufficient proof that the data center’s stormwater discharge won’t pollute the Saline River.

“EGLE and EPA staff are under undue influence from state and federal administrations to approve these permits quickly, without proper due diligence, and without regard for proper regulatory compliance,” states a release from the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance of Michigan.

State environmental regulators have said there’s no firm timeline for when they will decide whether to grant the environmental permits, but the process could take several months.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iStock-160559367.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:00:23.941098

Timely and Efficient Compliance EPA staff are directed to focus on rapid resolution of violations, with compliance – not punishment – as the North Star.
Legal disputes over novel or ambiguous regulatory interpretations should be elevated to national leadership, potentially providing regulated entities with a new escalation pathway.","On December 5, 2025, Craig J. Pritzlaff, Acting Assistant Administrator of the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), issued an internal memorandum instituting a “Compliance First” approach, immediately effective for all civil enforcement and compliance activities. This memo claims to introduce a policy shift: prioritizing timely and effective compliance over punitive enforcement and expansive regulatory interpretations. EPA’s goal is clear, swift, and efficient compliance, achieved by the “clearest, most defensible interpretations of our statutory and regulatory mandates.”

Key Elements of the “Compliance First” Policy

Compliance Assistance Toolkit

Enforcement is not the only tool. Proactive outreach, technical assistance, voluntary audits, and self-reporting are highlighted as means to encourage regulated entities to “find and fix” issues before enforcement becomes necessary.

State and Tribal Coordination

The EPA is committed to deferential, collaborative engagement with authorized states and tribes. Civil enforcement activities will avoid duplication and promote consistency by coordinating closely with local agencies, providing them with technical support, and ensuring states lead where they have primary jurisdiction.

Transparent Communication and “No Surprises”

Open, transparent dialogue is mandated throughout inspections and enforcement. The EPA pledges a “no surprises” approach and wants regulated entities to proactively identify and address potential compliance issues, building trust, and avoiding unexpected enforcement escalation.

Clarity and Legal Precision in Findings

Findings of violation must be “clear and unambiguous” and based on the “best reading” of statutes and regulations. Expansive or creative interpretations that create uncertainty or deviate from precedent are expressly rejected, especially in light of recent Supreme Court decisions. Material legal ambiguities must be elevated to national EPA leadership for resolution, ensuring consistent application across regions.

Timely and Efficient Compliance

EPA staff are directed to focus on rapid resolution of violations, with compliance – not punishment – as the North Star. Prolonged or punitive strategies are deemphasized to avoid delaying environmental protection and economic operations. Formal enforcement and injunctive relief (such as administrative or judicial action) will be used only when informal or compliance assistance measures are insufficient or in emergencies. Remedies must be narrowly tailored, directly tied to specific violations, and based on clear legal requirements. EPA’s April 26, 2021 memorandum (Using All Appropriate Injunctive Relief Tools in Civil Enforcement Settlements), which focused on expansive injunctive measures and supplemental environmental projects (SEPs), is also rescinded, pending new guidance. OECA Assistant Administrator approval is required for non-standard remedies like third-party audits.

Reasoned, Transparent Decisions Using LEAPS

The memo introduces the LEAPS framework for enforcement decisions:

Law: Use the clearest statutory/regulatory interpretation;

Evidence: Rely on solid, unequivocal facts;

Analysis: Apply logic and connect facts with law;

Programmatic Impact: Consider effects on EPA programs; and

Stakeholder Impact: Assess how actions affect states, tribes, and regulated entities

The memo states that EPA is aiming for transparent, reasoned decisions anchored in LEAPS to make enforcement predictable and defensible.

Practical Implications for the Regulated Community

Potential for more opportunities for rapid, voluntary compliance and proactive technical assistance.

Legal disputes over novel or ambiguous regulatory interpretations should be elevated to national leadership, potentially providing regulated entities with a new escalation pathway.

Formal remedies such as SEPs and wide-ranging monitoring should be restricted, and enforcement actions should now be both more predictable and tied tightly to statutory requirements.

EPA will soon issue a single guidance document to harmonize enforcement practices agency-wide, offering more clarity and consistency for regulated parties.

Final Thoughts

While this “new” policy shares similarities with prior EPA enforcement guidance and does not create legally binding rights, the intent appears to portray a shift in EPA enforcement philosophy to prioritizing clarity, efficiency, and cooperation over adversarial posturing or creative statutory interpretations. While it is too early to know what practical implications this will have for enforcement actions, EPA’s memo is a helpful reminder for regulated entities to review their compliance programs, prepare for inspections, and document legal positions carefully to align with the “best reading” standard now embedded in EPA practice.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16139_0319.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 00:00:25.525657

Over 30 people from the Seattle area and beyond, all volunteers with Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), joined a nationwide lobbying push the week of Nov. 17–21 to urge support for affordable clean energy and promote a policy that combats wildfire risk. CCL is a national, nonpartisan, grassroots nonprofit dedicated to growing the political will for a liveable world.

Americans, including households in Washington State, are increasingly experiencing rising electricity costs driven by escalating climate extremes and the rapid growth of energy-intensive data centers.

At the same time, we have seen firsthand the impacts of a changing climate – forest fires making the air unhealthy to breathe, unprecedented heat waves, impacts on seasonal rainfall and snow pack, droughts in key agricultural regions, and flooding—underscoring the need for policies to address the climate crisis.

During meetings with the offices of Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell as well as 9 out of 10 Washington Representatives, citizen lobbyists from across the state appealed for Congressional action to fast-track comprehensive, bi-partisan energy permitting reform to get more affordable clean electricity onto the grid as the cost of living skyrockets. More than 95% of the projects awaiting permits are clean energy.

According to the Clean Energy Power Association:

“Today, the average timeline for a project to obtain necessary National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews is 4.5 years. For transmission projects, the average timeline is even longer – 6.5 years.”

CCL advocated for comprehensive, bipartisan, permitting reform and pointed to the Problem Solvers Caucus’ Framework for Permitting Reform as a good start on the policies that could be in such a bill.

CCL volunteers also promoted the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA, S.1462), a bill that recently passed the Senate Agriculture Committee on a strong bipartisan vote of 18-5. It would ensure U.S. forests are well-maintained and resilient in the face of increasing wildfires. Wildfire smoke contributes to the deaths of about 40,000 people a year in the U.S., according to a study by Nature. Alarmingly, that number is projected to rise to 70,000 people by 2050.

A previous version of FOFA passed the House (H.R.471) 279-141 in January. CCL believes that the Senate version is even stronger and has earned the endorsements of important environmental groups, including National Audubon Society, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund, and of course, CCL. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA), one of the Senate bill’s co-sponsors said, “As increasingly frequent and catastrophic wildfires in California make clear, we need durable solutions to confront the growing impacts of the wildfire crisis.”

“Burien and every local neighborhood will benefit if Congress passes bi-partisan permitting reform and forest health laws that lead to more affordable electricity and air less polluted by wildfire smoke,” said Larry Steele, a CCL liaison to Senator Murray who lives in Des Moines and who met with her staff this week.

“These issues make sense to a lot of people, so support is growing for bi-partisan action in Congress. This is a great time for people to message our Senators and Representatives to show support for cheaper energy, clean air, and protection for the forests we love.”

“It’s exciting to exercise the skills of democracy at such a turbulent time,” Steele added. “The opportunity to talk directly with our representatives and their staff feels very empowering. I was amazed that CCL can take ordinary concerned citizens like me and train them to do something so important.”

Prior to lobby meetings, local volunteers with Citizens’ Climate Lobby attended CCL’s virtual Fall Conference on Nov. 14–15, featuring empowering speakers and training opportunities to build common ground across political divides.

“CCL’s willingness to reach across divides and build bridges is what sets us apart, and we’re needed more than ever these days,” said Ricky Bradley, CCL’s Interim Executive Director. “I’m excited about the ways we will help move the conversation forward on clean energy through federal permitting reform, and I’m proud of our ongoing commitment to do this work in a nonpartisan way.”

Nationwide, CCL volunteers have generated tens of thousands of messages and calls this year urging Congress to advance durable, bipartisan climate policies.",https://b-townblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SKM-CitizensClimateLobbyLogo25.avif,N,,2025-12-18 01:08:11.568562

The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

Everyone — politicians and the public — is talking about energy costs. In particular, they’re talking about data centers that drive artificial intelligence systems and their increasing energy demand, electricity costs and strain on the nation’s already overloaded energy grid.

As a former state energy official and utility executive, I know that many of the underlying questions involving energy affordability are very complex and have been festering for decades, in part because of how many groups are involved. Energy projects are expensive and take a long time to build. Where to build them is often also a difficult, even controversial, question. Consumers, regulators, utilities and developers all value energy reliability but have different interests, cost sensitivities and time frames in mind.

The problem of high energy prices is not new, but it is urgent. And it comes at a time when the U.S. is deeply divided on its approaches to energy policy and the politics of solving collective problems.

Rising costs

From September 2024 to September 2025, average U.S. residential electricity prices have risen 7.4%, from 16.8 to 18 cents per kilowatt-hour. Government analysts expect prices will continue to rise and outpace inflation in 2026.

With household earnings basically flat when adjusted for inflation, these increases hit consumers hard. They take up higher percentages of household expenses — especially for lower-income households. Electricity prices have effects throughout the economy, both directly on consumers’ budgets and indirectly by raising operating costs for business and industry, which pass them along to customers by raising prices for goods and services.

The problem

By 2030, energy analysts expect U.S. electricity demand to rise about 25%, and McKinsey estimates that data centers’ energy use could nearly triple from current levels by that year, using as much as 11.7% of all electricity in the U.S. — more than double their current share.

The nation’s current electricity grid is not ready to supply all that energy. And even if the electricity could be generated, transmission lines are aging and not up to carrying all that power. Their capacity would need to be expanded by about 60% by 2050.

Orders of key generating equipment often face multiyear delays. And construction of new and expanded transmission lines has been very slow.

A Brattle Group analysis estimates all that new and upgraded equipment could cost between US$760 billion and $1.4 trillion in the next 25 years.

The reasons

The enormous scale of the work needed is a result of a lack of investment over time and delays in the investments that have been made.

For instance, since at least 2011 there has been an effort to bring Canadian hydropower to the New England electricity grid. Political opposition to cutting a path for a transmission line through forestland meant the project was subjected to a statewide referendum in Maine — and then a court case that overturned the referendum results. During those delays, inflation raised the estimated price of the project by half, from $1 billion to $1.5 billion — an added cost that will be paid by Massachusetts electricity customers.

That multiyear effort is just one example of how the vast web of companies that generate power, transmit it from power plants to communities, and distribute it to homes and businesses complicates attempts to make changes to the power grid.

State and federal government agencies have roles in these processes. States’ public utilities commissions oversee the utility companies that distribute power to customers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission oversees connections of power generators to the grid and the transmission lines that move electricity across state lines.

Often, those efforts aren’t aligned with each other, leading to delays over jurisdiction and decision-making.

For instance, as new generators prepare to operate, whether they are solar farms or gas-fired power plants, they need permission from FERC to connect to the transmission grid. The commission typically requests technical engineering studies to determine how the project would affect the existing system. Delays in this process increase the timeline and cost of development and postpone adding new capacity to the grid.

The costs

A key question for regulators and consumers alike is who should pay for adding more electricity to the grid and making the system more reliable.

Utilities traditionally charge customers for the costs of generating and delivering power. And it’s not clear how much power the data centers will ultimately require.

Some large data centers have taken to paying to build their own on-site power plants, though often they can supply energy to the grid as well.

In some states, efforts have begun to address public concern about electricity bills. In November 2025, two utility commissioners in Georgia, who had consistently approved electricity rate hikes over the previous two years, were voted out of office in a landslide.

New Jersey’s Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill has pledged to declare a utility-price emergency and freeze costs for a year.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul has paused implementation of state law, driven by environmental concerns, requiring that all new buildings over seven stories tall only use electricity and not natural gas or other energy sources. Hochul has said that requirement would increase electricity demand too much, raising prices and making the grid less stable.

In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healey has filed legislation seeking to provide energy affordability, including eliminating some charges from utility bills, capping bill increases and barring utility companies from charging customers for advertisement costs.

The solutions

Clearly, there are no quick fixes or easy solutions to this complex situation.

However, innovation in regulation, combined with new technologies and even AI itself, may enable creative regulatory and technical solutions. For instance, devices that can be programmed to use energy efficiently, time-sensitive pricing and demand monitoring to smooth out peaks and valleys in electricity use can potentially ease both grid load and customers’ bills. But those solutions will work only if all the players are willing to cooperate.

There are a lot of ideas about how to lower the public’s burden of paying for data centers’ power. New ideas like this need careful scrutiny and possible revisions to ensure they are effective at lowering costs and increasing reliability.

As the country grapples with the effort to upgrade the grid, perform long-deferred maintenance and build new power plants, consumers’ costs are likely to continue to rise, further increasing pressure on Americans. Existing regulations and government oversight may no longer lower electricity costs immediately or help people plan for the rising costs over the long term.

For example, the United States typically welcomes between 25 million and 30 million real Christmas trees each holiday season, and each one reflects years of care.
In Oregon’s Willamette Valley, North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains, and across Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Christmas growers nurture trees for nearly a decade before harvest.
The result is a steady, well paced logistics environment that helps holiday tree markets in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee flourish.
The entire system closes the year with a sense of renewal rather than waste, reinforcing the positive environmental value of real Christmas trees.","Every December, Christmas trees do more than brighten our living rooms and anchor memorable family traditions. They set in motion a vibrant seasonal economy that energizes farms, retailers, transportation companies, and even segments of the construction industry. The holiday tree supply chain is fast, coordinated, and remarkably spirited, connecting tree growers, rural providers, busy logistics hubs, and joyful cities in one of the most cheerful commercial rhythms of the year. What looks like a simple holiday symbol is a nice story of craftsmanship, teamwork, and wintertime momentum across multiple sectors.

For example, the United States typically welcomes between 25 million and 30 million real Christmas trees each holiday season, and each one reflects years of care. In Oregon’s Willamette Valley, North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains, and across Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Christmas growers nurture trees for nearly a decade before harvest. These farms rely on wood products not just at the end of the cycle, but throughout it. Wooden stakes help young trees grow straight and strong, racks and pallets crafted from pine and hardwoods transport them to market, and lumber-framed stands welcome customers at retail lots. The entire journey has a warm, hands-on feel — an intersection of agriculture and woodworking that fits perfectly with the spirit of the season.

What makes this annual movement remarkable is how smoothly it integrates into winter business cycles. In the Pacific Northwest, for example, massive tree shipments often align with a natural tapering of outdoor construction activity as weather cools. Many transportation carriers pivot from moving heavy building materials to helping deliver holiday trees, creating an efficient seasonal flow that keeps trucks, drivers, and distribution centers productive during the transition from late fall to winter. Rather than competing, these industries complement each other for a few weeks, balancing freight demand in a way that keeps the regional economy humming.

In the Upper Midwest, the winter season creates an especially harmonious pattern. As temperatures drop in states like Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, outdoor construction helps free up some of the trucking capacity that tree farms need most. It’s a positive synergy, while some people and even some businesses shift toward indoor renovation work, transportation companies stay busy through tree shipments, and local retailers receive their seasonal inventory right on time. The result is a steady, well paced logistics environment that helps holiday tree markets in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee flourish.

The Southeast brings a different but equally encouraging dynamic. North Carolina, home to the popular Fraser fir, supplies millions of trees to states such as Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee. Construction activity remains strong in these regions during December, yet the coordination between tree growers, transportation companies, and large retailers has grown incredibly efficient. Many carriers build Christmas tree shipments into their holiday scheduling each year, ensuring that deliveries arrive fresh, consistent, and ready for families to bring home. Major retailers like Home Depot, Lowe’s, Menards, Costco, Target and Walmart have developed highly polished seasonal systems, including dedicated pallet inventories, specialized staging areas, and coordinated distribution plans. It’s an impressive display of planning that showcases how well American retail logistics adapt to holiday traditions.

These big box retailers are a particularly important part of the uplifting story. They become lively community hubs during December, not only in tree sales but in the shared sense of excitement as families pick the tree that will define their holiday memories. Behind the scenes, these retailers collaborate with growers and pallet manufacturers to ensure everything arrives safely and beautifully displayed. Pallet yards increase production in November, sawmills supply the softwood needed for racks and stands, and distribution centers transform into cheerful staging grounds full of fresh seasonal fragrance. It is one of the rare moments each year when an entire supply chain feels connected to something joyful.

Weather, which often poses challenges for construction, adds a positive seasonal rhythm to the Christmas tree economy. Northern states naturally shift toward different projects or year end planning as snow begins to fall, yet this frees time, talent, and trucks that can redirect into holiday commerce. Southern states benefit from mild winters that allow both construction and Christmas tree deliveries to proceed smoothly. Even snowy regions often turn winter weather into a festive advantage, families bundle up, head to tree lots for hot cocoa and fresh evergreens, and retail centers feel more alive with holiday energy.

The end of the holiday season also brings a thoughtful, eco-friendly cycle that highlights the industry’s sustainability. Different towns and cities across the country collect millions of trees in early January for recycling, mulching, and composting. Many communities turn these trees into material used for parks, gardens, wildlife habitats, and erosion control projects. The wood infrastructure used in shipping, pallets, racks, and stakes, is often reused or repurposed, creating another layer of efficiency. The entire system closes the year with a sense of renewal rather than waste, reinforcing the positive environmental value of real Christmas trees.

At the same time, the construction industry enters the new year with fresh budgets and a renewed sense of momentum. As tree farms wind down their season, building suppliers ramp up deliveries for January starts, and transportation companies transition smoothly into their next busy cycle. Rather than creating conflicts, the seasonal tide and flow between construction and Christmas tree logistics helps stabilize staffing, freight demand, and revenue across multiple industries during what could otherwise be a slower winter period.

When viewed through this lens, the Christmas tree industry becomes far more than a charming holiday tradition. It is a vibrant seasonal engine that supports growers, sawmills, pallet makers, drivers, distribution centers, retailers, and construction adjacent suppliers. It brings rural and urban communities together, strengthens local economies, and adds warmth to one of the coldest times of year. What begins as a small seedling on a hillside eventually becomes a centerpiece in a family’s home and along the way, it boosts industries, powers logistics networks, and creates a positive, collaborative rhythm that defines December commerce.

In many ways, the Christmas tree is an uplifting intersection of wood, construction, and holiday celebration. Its journey reflects care, planning, teamwork, and craftsmanship, reminding us that the best parts of the holiday season often grow quietly behind the scenes, connecting people and industries in ways we don’t often stop to appreciate.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/pictures/2025-08/large-Robit-PLC-img-2022-Felipe-Martinez-001-MBN.jpg?h=da92c94c&itok=hkHCKp7_,N,,2025-12-18 10:04:07.599171

By partnering with Wärtsilä for technology, and WHC for construction services, we are delivering cutting-edge technology with top safety and security track records and best-in-class execution,"" said Hagen Lee, CEO of Peregrine Energy Solutions.

""Peregrine's vision and the dedication of its team have been instrumental in bringing the Mallard project to life. At Wärtsilä, we believe that decarbonization and efficiency go hand in hand, and this project exemplifies what's possible when innovative leaders come together. Mallard demonstrates how advanced technology and partnerships between organizations with conviction can accelerate the transition to a global renewable energy future,"" said Tamara de Gruyter, President of Wärtsilä Energy Storage.
