“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said.
Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.","There were some highs amid a lot of lows in a roller coaster year for clean energy as President Donald Trump worked to boost polluting fuels while blocking wind and solar, according to dozens of energy developers, experts and politicians.

Surveyed by The Associated Press, many described 2025 as turbulent and challenging for clean energy, though there was progress as projects connected to the electric grid. They said clean energy must continue to grow to meet skyrocketing demand for electricity to power data centers and to lower Americans’ utility bills.

Solar builder and operator Jorge Vargas said it has been “a very tough year for clean energy” as Trump often made headlines criticizing renewable energy and Republicans muscled a tax and spending cut bill through Congress in July that dramatically rolled back tax breaks for clean energy.

“There was a cooldown effect this year,” said Vargas, cofounder and CEO of Aspen Power. “Having said that, we are a resilient industry.”

Plug Power president Jose Luis Crespo said the developments — both policy recalibration and technological progress — will shape clean energy’s trajectory for years to come.

Energy policy whiplash in 2025

Much of clean energy’s fate in 2025 was driven by booster Joe Biden’s exit from the White House.

The year began with ample federal subsidies for clean energy technologies, a growing number of U.S.-based companies making parts and materials for projects and a lot of demand from states and corporations, said Tom Harper, partner at global consultant Baringa.

It ends with subsidies stripped back, a weakened supply chain, higher costs from tariffs and some customers questioning their commitment to clean energy, Harper said. He described the year as “paradigm shifting.”

Trump called wind and solar power “the scam of the century” and vowed not to approve new projects. The federal government canceled grants for hundreds of projects.

The Republicans’ tax bill reversed or steeply curtailed clean energy programs established through the Democrats’ flagship climate and health care bill in 2022. Wayne Winegarden, at the Pacific Research Institute think tank, said the time has come for alternative energy to demonstrate viability without subsidies. ( Fossil fuels also receive subsidies.)

Many energy executives said this was the most consequential policy shift. The bill reshaped the economics of clean energy projects, drove a rush to start construction before incentives expire and forced developers to reassess their strategies for acquiring parts and materials, Lennart Hinrichs said. He leads the expansion of TWAICE in the Americas, providing analytics software for battery energy storage systems.

Companies can’t make billion-dollar investments with so much policy uncertainty, said American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet.

Consequently, greenhouse gas emissions will fall at a much lower rate than previously projected in the U.S., said Brian Murray, director of the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at Duke University.

Still, solar and battery storage are booming

Solar and storage accounted for 85% of the new power added to the grid in the first nine months of the Trump administration, according to Wood Mackenzie research.

That’s because the economics remain strong, demand is high and the technologies can be deployed quickly, said Mike Hall, CEO of Anza Renewables.

Solar energy company Sol Systems said it had a record year as it brought its largest utility-scale project online and grew its business. The energy storage systems company CMBlu Energy said storage clearly stands out as a winner this year too, moving from optional to essential.

“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said. “The direction is still all good.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association said that no matter the policies in Washington, solar and storage will grow as the backbone of the nation’s energy future.

Nuclear and geothermal had a good year, too

Democrats and Republicans have supported investing to keep nuclear reactors online, restart previously closed reactors and deploy new, advanced reactor designs. Nuclear power is a carbon-free source of electricity, though not typically labeled as green energy like other renewables.

“Who had ‘restart Three Mile Island’ on their 2025 Bingo card?” questioned Baringa partner David Shepheard. The Pennsylvania plant was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The Energy Department is loaning $1 billion to help finance a restart.

Everyone loves nuclear, said Darrin Kayser, executive vice president at Edelman. It helps that the technology for small, modular reactors is starting to come to fruition, Kayser added.

Benton Arnett, a senior director at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that as the need for clean, reliable power intensifies, “we will look back on the actions being taken now as laying the foundation.”

The Trump administration also supports geothermal energy, and the tax bill largely preserved geothermal tax credits. The Geothermal Rising association said technologies continue to mature and produce, making 2025 a breakthrough year.

Offshore wind had a terrible year

Momentum for offshore wind in the United States came to a grinding halt just as the industry was starting to gain traction, said Joey Lange, a senior managing director at Trio, a global sustainability and energy advisory company.

The Trump administration stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped federal funding for offshore wind projects.

That has decimated the projects, developers and tech innovators, and no one in wind is raising or spending capital, said Eric Fischgrund, founder and CEO at FischTank PR. Still, Fischgrund said he remains optimistic because the world is transitioning to cleaner energy.

More clean energy needed in 2026

An energy strategy with a diverse mix of sources is the only way forward as demand grows from data centers and other sources, and as people demand affordable, reliable electricity, said former Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.

Experts expect solar and battery storage to continue growing in 2026 to add a lot of power to the grid quickly and cheaply. The market will continue to ensure that most new electricity is renewable, said Amanda Levin, policy analysis director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Hillary Bright, executive director of Turn Forward, thinks offshore wind will still play an important role too. It is both ready and needed to help address the demand for electricity in the new year, which will become increasingly clear “to all audiences,” she said. Turn Forward advocates for offshore wind.

That skyrocketing demand “is shaking up the political calculus that drove the administration’s early policy decisions around renewables,” she said.

BlueWave CEO Sean Finnerty thinks that states, feeling the pressure to deliver affordable, reliable electricity, will increasingly drive clean energy momentum in 2026 by streamlining permitting and the process of connecting to the grid, and by reducing costs for things like permits and fees.

Ed Gunn, Lunar Energy’s vice president for revenue, said the industry has weathered tough years before.

“The fundamentals are unchanged,” Gunn said, “there is massive value in clean energy.”

The signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB Act) by President Donald Trump on 4 July marks a pivotal shift in the United States’ climate and energy trajectory.

The sweeping legislation dismantles much of the clean energy incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while expanding support for fossil fuel activities.

The act radically alters tax credit timelines and access, setting off a rush among developers to start construction before new deadlines in 2025 and 2026.

Redwood Materials Inc., a battery recycling venture led by Tesla Inc. co-founder JB Straubel, has begun operations at a $3.5 billion factory in South Carolina that will supply badly needed critical materials.

The company has brought a system online that’s capable of recovering 20,000 metric tons of critical minerals annually, said Straubel. Initially founded to fill a gap in the electric vehicle battery supply chain, Redwood is in the midst of a broader shift in strategy as it navigates an expected slowdown in EV demand.

The pivot also comes at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing to onshore the supply chain for materials essential to US national security.

Taking into account Redwood’s existing recycling plant in Sparks, Nevada, which recovers 60,000 tons of critical minerals annually, the firm says it is now the only major domestic source of cobalt and produces as much nickel and lithium as the largest mines in the US.

The South Carolina facility isn’t operating at full capacity, and the company declined to set a ramp-up timeline. It also declined to provide a breakdown of how much of each mineral it’s recovering at the facility.

Redwood was founded in 2017 to recycle EV batteries and produce materials like cathodes and copper foils for anodes. The company had said in 2022 that it planned to produce enough materials for a million EVs annually by 2025 and 5 million by 2030, and it had agreements with Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volvo, among others.

Yet its commercial cathode production facility in Nevada, which was slated to open in 2024 and produce 100 gigawatt-hours of battery components by this year, is still under construction with no announced opening date. While the company had planned to expand copper foil production at both of its facilities, it stopped producing it in Nevada and no longer plans to do so in South Carolina.

The industry has also faced challenges from the Trump administration, which recently canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to other battery recyclers. With the administration’s attacks on EVs further impacting the industry, including winding down federal incentives in September, Redwood has increased its focus on finding other buyers. The bulk of the critical minerals the company produces are going to customers outside the EV sector, Straubel said.

“The nickel and cobalt markets are largely not driven by batteries. They’re not the biggest consumers of those particular elements,” Straubel said.

Nickel is used in stainless steel; specialty alloys, or a custom metal blend for niche applications; and industrial chemicals, while cobalt is also used in a number of high-performance alloys like those found in jet engines. While he declined to name them, Straubel said Redwood sells its critical minerals to about 20 to 30 companies, including large industrial customers using the materials in products and mining companies that process and refine them.

The company has also shifted its focus to serving data centers’ burgeoning power demand, starting a new unit this year called Redwood Energy that turns degraded EV batteries into grid-scale energy storage systems. Retired EV batteries can still work for large-scale energy storage because those systems put less strain on the hardware. In June, it unveiled a modest 63 megawatt-hour system – the equivalent of about 800 EV battery packs – paired with 12 megawatts of solar on its Nevada campus, powering a 2,000 GPU data center.

Redwood raised a $350 million Series E at a valuation of more than $6 billion last month in part to speed up energy storage deployment. That side of the business is “growing faster” and is “a new focus that we didn’t really know we were going to have a few years ago,” Straubel said.

But if an administration is defined by what it does, this White House has been anything but transparent and accessible.

In February, the Trump administration barred AP reporters and photographers from covering White House events for not obeying the president’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. A federal court declared the banishment a violation of the organization’s free speech rights.

In September, the Department of Defense required journalists to sign a document promising not to use any material, classified or unclassified, that was not approved for publication by officials. Those who refused lost physical access to the Pentagon. A lawsuit by The New York Times claims the policy prevents “scrutiny by independent news organizations for the public benefit,” in violation of the 1st Amendment.

In December, the Inspector General for the Pentagon found that by sharing information on an unsecure messaging app about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth risked the safety of U.S. forces. Hegseth refused to sit for an interview with Inspector General Steven Stebbins. In a written statement, Hegseth said he had a right to declassify the information but did not indicate that he had done so. A Pentagon official claimed the report constituted “a total exoneration.”

Not coincidentally, President Trump himself has broken with historic norms, by firing 17 inspectors general, leaving 75 percent of presidentially appointed inspector general positions vacant, and blocking funds appropriated by Congress for the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. The administration, which has been slow to respond to Freedom of Information requests, is apparently about to impose a rule ending long-standing legal protection for whistleblowers employed by the federal government.

Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Department of Justice to release Office of Legal Counsel documents arguing that airstrikes on alleged drug smugglers are legal. “Prompt disclosure of these records,” the plaintiffs assert, “is critically important to ensuring informed public disclosure about the U.S. military’s unprecedented strikes.”

Legal experts, Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and some U.S. military personnel have expressed concerns that drug trafficking doesn’t meet accepted definitions of threats to national security, armed conflict or foreign terrorism. Smugglers haven’t attacked U.S. citizens, have due process rights, and aren’t subject to a death penalty; the alleged list of targets reportedly includes cartels not heretofore designated as terrorist organizations; and most drugs enter the United States through Mexico. Because the U.S. is not in an armed conflict with drug traffickers, critics believe the strikes constitute “extrajudicial killings” — or, more simply, murder.

Nonetheless, the Pentagon has rebuffed requests from members of Congress to review the OLC opinion. The Constitution, U.S. Army general counsel Charles Young maintains, gives the president discretion over releasing information. Young didn’t explain why Trump didn’t exercise that discretion as part of his commitment to transparency.

Asked whether he supported releasing the unedited video of the second strike on a boat that killed two shipwrecked survivors on Sept. 2, Trump replied, “I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have, we’d certainly release, no problem.” A few days later, he asserted, “I didn’t say that. That is ABC fake news.” He then attacked the “obnoxious” reporter who asked him about it. This week, Secretary Hegseth said he would not publicly release the full video.

We have seen this movie before. As he pleaded for the administration to be “as transparent as possible” on the airstrikes, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) made the connection explicit: “We’ve got to release the video. Look, we [also] have to get the Epstein files released.”

Asked in June 2024 whether he would declassify the controversial Epstein files if re-elected as president, Trump, who knew that MAGA influencers including Elon Musk, Laura Loomer, Alex Jones and Kash Patel were leading the charge, said “yeah, yeah, I would.” In September, he repeated, “I’d do the Epstein. I’d have no problem with it.”

In February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi declared Epstein files were “sitting on my desk right now to review. That’s been a directive by President Trump.” She then released “the first phase” of documents, most of them already in the public domain.

Trump then changed his mind. Bondi said there was “no client list.” Fake news networks, Democrats and “soft and foolish Republicans,” the president claimed, were focusing on “this creep” to undermine his agenda.

The files , he said, “were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama. They were made up by Biden.” The FBI should investigate other things, like voter fraud, and “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein.” A lot of people “could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be,” Trump said. While insisting, “I don’t care about it, released or not,” he pressured Republicans in the House to refuse to sign or withdraw their names from a discharge petition requiring a vote on a bill compelling the Justice Department to release all the files.

When that effort failed, Trump took credit for telling Republicans to do what they had already decided to do: “Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous.”

“President Trump has been consistently calling for transparency related to the Epstein files for years,” a White House spokesperson asserted, and calling for “investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends.”

Once upon a time, Trump appeared to be a born-again proponent of transparency. His lack of faith, however, has been far more frequent, long-lasting and consequential.

“Without additional investments, it becomes very difficult to build the resilient supply chain that is vital for European jobs, European prosperity and European security,” Filosa told the FT.

As Brussels continues to refine its industrial and climate agenda, the warning from one of Europe’s largest automakers points to the stakes.
For companies like Stellantis, the challenge is not only adapting to new technologies, but deciding whether Europe remains a place where long-term automotive investment makes economic and strategic sense.","Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa has issued a blunt warning that the European Union’s latest package of measures for the auto industry could undermine long-term investment in the region, deepening uncertainty for manufacturers already under pressure from weak demand, high costs, and intensifying global competition.

Speaking to the Financial Times in an interview published on Saturday, Filosa said the proposals unveiled by the European Commission earlier this week lack the urgency and coherence needed to revive growth in Europe’s automotive sector, which remains one of the bloc’s most strategically important industries.

“There are none of the urgent measures needed to return the European automotive sector to growth,” Filosa said. “Without growth, it becomes very difficult to think about investing more.”

The Commission’s plan, announced on Tuesday, includes a controversial shift on climate policy by effectively dropping the EU’s planned ban on the sale of new combustion-engine cars from 2035.

The move has exposed deep divisions within the industry and among policymakers. While some automakers and member states argue that easing the rule offers breathing space amid slowing electric vehicle adoption and infrastructure gaps, others fear it dilutes regulatory clarity and weakens Europe’s credibility in the global transition to cleaner transport.

For Stellantis, which operates 14 brands including Peugeot, Fiat, Opel, Citroën, Jeep, and Alfa Romeo, the concern goes beyond the fate of internal combustion engines. Filosa framed the issue as one of strategic certainty and industrial confidence, arguing that frequent policy shifts make it harder for companies to commit capital to European factories, suppliers, and innovation hubs.

He said that without sustained and predictable investment, Europe risks losing its ability to build a resilient automotive supply chain, something he linked directly to employment, competitiveness, and security.

“Without additional investments, it becomes very difficult to build the resilient supply chain that is vital for European jobs, European prosperity and European security,” Filosa told the FT.

In an official statement released after the Commission’s announcement, Stellantis said the proposals failed to tackle several structural challenges facing the sector. The company pointed to the absence of a clear and comprehensive roadmap for light commercial vehicles, a segment that underpins logistics, trades, and small businesses across the continent. It also criticized the lack of flexibility around the EU’s 2030 emissions targets for passenger cars, which it said do not adequately reflect market realities or consumer affordability concerns.

The criticism comes at a delicate moment for Europe’s car industry. Automakers are grappling with slowing vehicle sales, stubbornly high energy and labor costs, and fierce competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, many of which benefit from lower production costs and strong state backing. At the same time, European manufacturers are being asked to fund multiple transitions at once: electrification, software-driven vehicles, autonomous technologies, and ever-stricter environmental and safety standards.

Industry executives have repeatedly argued that regulation alone cannot drive the transition. They have called for stronger demand-side measures, including purchase incentives, accelerated deployment of charging infrastructure, and policies to lower the cost of energy and raw materials. Without such support, they warn, consumers will delay purchases and manufacturers will struggle to justify large-scale investments.

The contrast with other regions has become increasingly stark. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has unlocked billions of dollars in subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles, batteries, and clean manufacturing, attracting major investment from global automakers and suppliers. Filosa’s remarks echo a growing concern among European executives that capital could increasingly flow to markets offering clearer incentives and more stable policy frameworks.

While the Commission has argued that its revised approach aims to balance climate goals with industrial competitiveness, Stellantis’ response highlights fears that the package delivers neither decisively. Easing the 2035 combustion-engine deadline may reduce near-term pressure, but Filosa suggested that without a credible growth strategy, it risks prolonging uncertainty rather than resolving it.

Looking Toward a Sustainable Future Radiant Nuclear’s microreactors hold promise for a more sustainable energy future.","Radiant Nuclear, based in El Segundo, California, is making significant strides in the nuclear energy sector with its 1-MW microreactors. The company recently secured $300 million to advance its commercialization efforts and is planning to establish a reactor factory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, by 2026. This facility aims to produce 50 Kaleidos microreactors annually, with shipments to customers beginning in 2028. With over half a billion dollars in funding, Radiant is positioning itself as a key player in the competitive race to deliver compact nuclear reactors, leveraging advanced technology and strategic partnerships.

Revolutionizing Energy with Microreactors

The Kaleidos microreactor represents a breakthrough in portable nuclear energy technology. Designed to be compact and highly efficient, each reactor is equipped with TRISO fuel—ceramic-coated uranium particles that ensure safety and stability by preventing meltdowns. The use of helium cooling systems further enhances the reactor’s operational safety. This innovative approach allows the reactors to adapt to varying energy demands while maintaining real-time performance monitoring.

These reactors are delivered fully assembled, fueled, and tested, ready to generate power the day after arrival. Capable of producing 1.9 MW of thermal power, they are ideal for industrial heating applications. The ability to daisy chain multiple units creates scalable power solutions for diverse settings, from remote communities to disaster areas. This flexibility makes them a viable alternative to traditional diesel generators.

Strategic Partnerships and Market Expansion

Radiant Nuclear is actively forming strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. The company recently signed an agreement to supply a US military base with a Kaleidos reactor by 2028. Additionally, a deal with Equinix, a major data center operator, will see dozens of reactors deployed to support energy-intensive facilities. These partnerships underscore the potential for microreactors to transform energy supply chains and enhance energy security.

Next year, the Kaleidos will undergo a fueled test using high-assay low-enriched uranium, marking a significant milestone as the first new commercial reactor design to be tested in the US in over five decades. Radiant’s exclusive access to this advanced fuel positions it advantageously in a competitive market. The planned demonstration at Idaho National Laboratory’s DOME research facility will further validate the reactor’s capabilities.

But as temperatures rise, this quintessential winter holiday scene is transforming (in the Northern Hemisphere at least). The snowstorm you were picturing is actually more likely to be a chilly rain in many areas. Cocoa crops around the world are failing, making chocolate drinks and desserts increasingly expensive. Global warming is even coming for Rudolph, recent research shows.

Climate change is threatening Christmas and winter traditions – and in some cases, holiday trends are fueling it.

Christmas Crops

Holiday spirit in December is underpinned by a multitude of global supply chains churning throughout the year. And I'm not just talking about markets that support presents like clothes and electronics; many of the most lucrative Christmas commodities are grown.

Take chocolate: As many as 6 million small-holder farmers in Africa, Asia and Latin America grow and harvest 90 percent of the world's cocoa, which go into all sorts of holiday classics – from yule log cakes to marshmallow-topped cocoa. Cacao, the plant that is processed to make cocoa, thrives in tropical climates with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall. But in 2023 and 2024, the weather was too warm and wet – then too dry – in African countries like Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana for healthy cacao crops. Yields plummeted to record lows.

This extreme weather was caused partially by the El Niño weather pattern. But an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central found that human-caused climate change added six weeks' worth of days above 89 degrees Fahrenheit in 71 percent of cacao-producing areas across much of West Africa in 2024. The low output led to staggeringly high chocolate prices around the world, surging from about $2,500 to more than $10,000 per metric ton that year.

Though prices have since fallen a bit, scientists at Harvard University say this cocoa volatility likely represents a ""new normal."" Unpredictable weather is affecting other holiday baking necessities like sugarcane and cinnamon crops – both essential for any snickerdoodle fan.

Long-term temperature rise and compounding weather disasters are also hurting the most iconic holiday crop: Christmas trees. As I reported in January, Oregon and North Carolina produce the most Christmas trees in the United States, but warmer winters and longer growing seasons are leading to stunted growth and a surge in pest outbreaks that can decimate supplies.

""When we grow Christmas trees, we typically are taking them out of their natural habitat, particularly with Fraser fir,"" Justin Whitehill, a forestry researcher at North Carolina State University who studies Christmas trees, told me a year ago.

""Taking them out of their sort of natural range, we're already putting a lot of stress on them,"" and climate-fueled warming only adds to that, he added. Whitehill and other scientists – including an entire Christmas tree program at Oregon State University – are experimenting with new breeds or genetic modifications to help make the trees more resistant to pests and heat.

Pro tip: Researchers also told me that once the holiday season is over, you can donate your natural Christmas tree (after you've removed the ornaments and tinsel) to wildlife agencies around the country. They use them to help provide crucial habitats for freshwater fish.

Climate Scrooge

The subjects of some of the most famous Christmas carols are also at risk as global temperatures rise. Reindeer – also known as caribou in North America – face over a 50 percent decline by the end of the century due to climate-fueled habitat loss and overheating, according to a study published in August.

These antlered creatures thrive in Arctic habitats such as tundra and boreal forests, where they help maintain vegetation and plant diversity. Using fossils and ancient DNA, researchers simulated how warming events over the past 21,000 years affected reindeer populations to help predict how they will do in the future under different warming scenarios.

They found that modern-day rates of temperature rise could decimate reindeer populations more than any of those in the past.

""Continued losses will likely further exacerbate climatic warming through release of soil carbon to the atmosphere, which, of course, would further threaten reindeer and caribou, as well as ourselves,"" study co-author Eric Post, a professor at the University of California, Davis, said in a statement. ""For thousands of years, the well-being of our own species has benefited directly from healthy reindeer and caribou populations. Now more than ever, we need to ensure their well-being in turn.""

Meanwhile, Frosty the Snowman and the white Christmas you may be dreaming of are also disappearing amid rapid warming. The chances of having at least one inch of snow on Christmas Day – the metric for what the National Weather Service deems a ""white Christmas"" – are ""gradually decreasing across the Southern United States, and this trend is slowly moving north,"" according to the federal government. It's important to note that snow was never that common on Christmas Day for many states, Time magazine reports.

""People tend to remember that one snowy Christmas, and they forget that it was surrounded by five Christmases that weren't,"" David Robinson, New Jersey's state climatologist and a Rutgers University professor whose research focuses on snow cover, told Time.

But records reveal a clear trend of warming winters overall, with average temperatures rising nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit in almost 250 U.S. cities since 1970, according to an analysis of federal data by Climate Central. Holiday shopping may be accelerating this trend, with millions of emissions generated each year due to product manufacturing, packaging, shipping and waste.

It doesn't end there: Roughly 15 percent of purchases made during the holiday season are returned. I reported on this ""reverse supply chain"" last year and was shocked to learn how returns' carbon pollution compares to that of the initial deliveries.",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/hot_chocolate_climate.76af3cfb.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 09:58:40.285290

LIMÓN INDANZA, Ecuador—Long drifts of mist settle between the mountain peaks in this region, almost indistinguishable from clouds. Underneath, species found only here depend on the intricacies of this high-altitude rainforest, one of the most biodiverse places on the planet.

Like many parts of the Amazon, this fragile and abundant wilderness is imperiled—and not only by the usual dangers of development and climate change. Mounting sovereign debt has become one of the Ecuadorian Amazon’s biggest threats, pushing the government to expand oil and mining to keep public finances afloat.

Ecuador owes $49 billion to foreign creditors and is paying billions more just to service the debt that instead could be spent on urgently needed environmental protections.

But today, an effort is underway that could transform this liability into a tool for conservation. In 2024, through a deal known as a debt-for-nature swap, the Ecuadorian government was able to refinance some of its costliest, privately held debt for pennies on the dollar and replace it with a lower-interest, longer-maturity bond. In return, Ecuador agreed to expand protections across its Amazonian region, which spans about half the country.

Debt swaps—for nature, development projects and more—are not new. Western creditors have been experimenting with versions of them since the 1980s. In recent years, countries such as Seychelles and Barbados have executed deals with private creditors like commercial banks, mobilizing hundreds of millions of dollars for conservation. Now, a small chorus of academics and policy thinkers is looking beyond traditional lenders to one with massive and untapped leverage: China.

Through its $1.3 trillion Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing has become the world’s largest bilateral creditor by financing mines, ports, power plants and infrastructure in countries across the developing world. China’s opaque lending practices make it difficult to know exactly how much these countries owe, but experts say it could exceed hundreds of billions of dollars.

Those massive figures caught the attention of economist and China expert Christoph Nedopil Wang, who was among the first researchers to see an opportunity in them. In 2021, he and his colleagues wrote a paper advancing the idea that China could help countries redirect some of that debt into conservation efforts.

China took notice. The central bank’s Green Finance Committee commissioned Nedopil Wang to do a special study on the topic, as did the United Nations Development Programme. And while Beijing has yet to do a debt-for-nature deal, it’s discussing another form of debt swap with Egypt and other increasingly sophisticated financial transactions to alleviate debt.

Rebecca Ray, an economist at Boston University who is among the pioneering thinkers on China and debt swaps, argues such new approaches are overdue. “One cyclone can wipe out multiple years of export earnings, and that kind of climate shock is making debt crises more common,” she said.

China’s Belt and Road spending spree has unlocked development funding for cash-strapped countries like Ecuador but has also left behind a trail of environmental destruction while contributing to ballooning debt burdens further strained by rising interest rates and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Today, the world’s poorest countries, many of which owe debt to China, spend twice as much servicing debt as they receive in climate funding. Unless debt burdens ease, the financial pressure on those countries could drive them toward greater resource extraction, further imperiling some of the most critical ecosystems on Earth.

Supporters of Chinese participation in debt-for-nature swaps say the model offers a way to relieve some of that burden while redirecting Beijing’s influence toward repairing the landscapes its projects damaged.

Proponents view these deals as win-wins, but some environmental economists and scholars remain deeply skeptical. They note Beijing’s reluctance to write off debt for fear of triggering demands for similar treatment from other borrowers, and say other creditors like multilateral development banks and private debt holders—which, collectively, hold the majority of most developing countries’ external debt—should be first in line to take a loss.

“China feels, from its perspective, ‘Why should we be the ones?’” said Elizabeth Losos, executive in residence at Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability. “They don’t want to set a precedent.”

The flip side, she noted, is that China is carrying a portfolio of borrowers that aren’t able to pay back their debts on time. Many have been forced to roll over their loans, reducing the debt’s ultimate value. In that context, accepting an immediate payment rather than uncertain payments in the future—while also accruing geopolitical goodwill at a moment when the United States is retreating from climate and environmental cooperation—may be the more strategic choice, Losos said.

For now, China’s willingness to use its financial clout for conservation or other sustainable development goals remains uncertain. Even if Beijing were to embrace debt swaps more broadly, its environmental legacy across many Belt and Road countries raises doubts.

In Ecuador, Chinese firms have dammed rivers, mined mountains and drilled pristine rainforest. That track record makes it hard for many Ecuadorians to imagine China as a sudden champion of global conservation.

Julio Prieto, a Quito-based environmental lawyer, recently sued a Chinese firm over a sprawling waste pit at one of its mines. Along with civil society groups, Prieto has criticized Chinese companies for steamrolling over local objections in communities where it has built major projects. He questions China’s will to establish a complex conservation deal that would respect human rights.

“If the Chinese government and Chinese companies are not willing to be transparent about something as basic as their construction plans,” Prieto said, “I’d be surprised if they were open to taking a fundamentally different approach on debt swaps.”

Leaning In

When Nedopil Wang first contemplated a China-backed debt swap, the reaction from many China watchers at the time was dismissive: “‘OK, you’re crazy. What even is this?’” he recalled them saying.

Beijing’s interest was clearly piqued. The powerful Ministry of Commerce, responsible for overseas development assistance, conducted its own research and Chinese officials began showing up to Nedopil Wang’s presentations. Yet, what the Communist Party’s top leadership ultimately thinks of those ideas remains unknowable.

“It’s a fantastically closed system,” Nedopil Wang said.

But China’s debt-swap discussion with Egypt suggests Beijing is at least interested in testing the idea.

In 2023, the countries opened negotiations to swap some of Cairo’s $8 billion debt to China for interest-free loans financing a broad sweep of projects, including renewable energy and healthcare development. Ray calls this trial run “China’s proof of concept.”

Nedopil Wang explained that Egypt approached China and said, “Here’s an opportunity for you as a creditor to support our development through swaps.” he said the details of the deal are still unclear. “It remains to be seen how it’s going to be applied, but it seems the focus is on interest-free debt,” he added.

Negotiators rarely disclose details of debt swaps in advance because any information surrounding a possible deal could influence financial markets. But policy analysts have identified a slate of countries as strong candidates for Chinese debt restructuring.

Pakistan is a key example. China has become its largest creditor after kicking off a massive project known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. One of the central pillars of the Belt and Road Initiative, it aims to secure road and water routes from western China to the Middle East and has fast-tracked the construction of seven coal-fired power plants, with another planned. Pakistan owes China just under $30 billion—more than any other country.

“Pakistan has such a high debt level where China plays such a big, big role, and there are multiple underperforming assets that make the debt payment sometimes difficult,” Nedopil Wang explained. “There’s also a huge opportunity to do … a debt-for-renewables swap in this case. So I think this is a space to watch.”

The Chinese-backed coal plants there have underperformed because of lower demand from consumers, making it more difficult for Pakistan to repay the debt. Under a debt-for-renewables swap, in theory, Pakistan and China would agree to refinance coal plants with lower interest and retire them earlier than planned with a promise by Pakistan to move toward a greater percentage of renewables to meet demand. That would reduce the risk of default for Chinese creditors, Nedopil Wang said, while accelerating Pakistan’s transition to renewable and cheaper sources of energy.

“You have loans at risk of non-performance, and a bank might want to get rid of them. Rather than having to write those loans down, a bank can get rid of them at 70 percent and thus actually make money,” Nedopil Wang said, noting that, in the case of a swap, the plants would still operate, but for a shorter period of time, providing revenue to pay back the new lower-priced debt.

An official at one of the country’s primary business lobbies recently urged the government to seek debt-for-nature swaps with China as the two countries discuss debt relief. And Aneel Salman, chair of economic security at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, noted that the country’s new sustainable financing framework explicitly says the government could consider the swaps as part of a blended finance deal. Pakistan’s finance minister has been actively talking about debt-for-nature swaps in public addresses, he added.

“We have shown our eagerness,” Salman said.

Ray also noted that a debt swap could be used to help the flood-prone country adapt to increasingly extreme weather.

A swap in Mongolia, meanwhile, would offer an unique opportunity for reforestation along the Chinese border to mitigate the sandstorms that blow into Beijing, Nedopil Wang said.

If China does pursue these swaps, it would join a growing trend. Countries have struck at least 10 debt-for-nature deals in recent years as climate change-induced extreme weather and the pandemic worsened the debt load in lower-income countries already struggling to pay back loans. In 2024, external debt in lower-income countries hit a record high of $8.9 trillion, while around 88 percent of the world’s most endangered ecosystems lie in debt-distressed nations.

Even the most ardent proponents of swaps don’t see them as a complete fix. They won’t close the world’s $700 billion annual financing shortfall for conserving biodiversity, nor the roughly $4 trillion gap for achieving the U.N.’s sustainable development goals, including greater access to clean energy and less poverty. But advocates argue they can meaningfully chip away at these problems by converting financial distress into public benefits.

The model could be particularly promising in parts of Africa, where Chinese companies have spent the past two decades mining the minerals that power the global renewable-energy transition, said Jean-Marc Malambwe Kilolo, an economist with the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa who has advised governments on debt-swap proposals.

Many African countries want to move beyond extraction and into higher-value refining and manufacturing for technologies like electric vehicles, he said. Well-designed debt-for-development swaps could support that shift while also benefiting local communities.

With roughly 43 percent of Africans lacking access to electricity, many households rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking and heat. “People need to be incentivized not to cut trees—to preserve and conserve green spaces,” Malambwe Kilolo said. “If there is no economic benefit, then what’s the point of doing conservation?”

In Ecuador, the same needs—and incentives—could translate to conservation.

“Our Currency Is Our Biodiversity”

On a bright November afternoon, perched above the narrow streets of Cuenca, former Ecuadorian environment and foreign affairs minister Gustavo Manrique Miranda cradles a glass of red wine and lays out the philosophy that shaped his time in office.

“I really believe that we are as rich as any country in the world, but our currency is our biodiversity,” he said. “The challenge is how to create value from biodiversity while keeping it alive.”

For Manrique Miranda, debt-for-nature swaps became a way to do just that. During his tenure from 2021 to 2023 under President Guillermo Lasso, he helped engineer Ecuador’s first modern swap: reducing $1.63 billion in debt held by Credit Suisse (now UBS) to $656 million, while establishing a large marine reserve near the Galápagos Islands and a $323 million conservation fund to protect it. He then set in motion the discussions that would evolve into Ecuador’s ambitious Amazon debt swap, known as the Amazonian Biocorridor Fund.

As Manrique Miranda was negotiating those deals with bondholders, nonprofits and other Ecuadorian ministries, President Lasso was making his own appeal abroad—flying to Beijing to plead for relief from Chinese banks. Years of heavy borrowing under his predecessor, much of it backed by Ecuadorian oil, had left the country locked into continued extraction and owing more than $5 billion to China.

Lasso returned claiming a modest victory: China agreed to push back repayment deadlines and trim interest rates. Such incremental renegotiations have become a hallmark of how Beijing manages its sweeping amount of distressed debtors, reflecting the Communist Party’s generally inward-facing priorities and commercial-driven approach to lending.

Those working to bring China around to debt swaps say the appeal for creditors is twofold: They can move troubled debt off their balance sheets while securing some ready cash now. Institutions like the Inter-American Development Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. have played a pivotal role by providing political-risk insurance and other credit enhancements that de-risk the transactions—making the deals financially viable in the first place.

For nation-state creditors, the benefits extend beyond balance sheets. The swaps provide a reputational boost that can translate into political leverage down the road, all while broadcasting the creditor government’s environmental bona fides on the world stage.

Back in Cuenca, an Andean gateway to the Amazon, Manrique Miranda said that even if Beijing won’t step in as a creditor, he believes it could contribute in ways similar to the United States’ support for the Galápagos and Amazon Biocorridor deals—providing critically important political-risk insurance.

Manrique Miranda has ideas in mind, pointing to an unprotected marine zone north of the Galápagos, mangrove forests along the mainland coast and gold reserves that could remain unmined if a future deal made conservation the better option.

“China,” he said, “could be a player.”

Others who share Manrique Miranda’s cautious optimism see another factor at work: Chinese President Xi Jinping has spent recent years casting his country as a global champion of biodiversity and the architect of a new “ecological civilization.”

An Ecological Contradiction

At a global biodiversity summit hosted by China in 2021, Xi appeared on a massive video screen to unveil a bold new idea: a world where humans and nature coexist in harmony. He invoked images of panda sanctuaries and sprawling national parks where elephants and tigers roam, framing conservation as both noble and achievable.

That vision is not just rhetoric. Under Xi’s rule, the concept of an “ecological civilization” has been written into China’s constitution alongside provisions cementing his own indefinite rule. On the international stage, Xi presents himself as an environmental visionary, repeating one of his favorite slogans: “Green mountains are gold and silver mountains”—in other words, protecting nature pays.

For many outside China—especially in the United States, where conservative lawmakers invoke China as a foil to justify America’s own pollution-heavy industries—the country still conjures images of smog-choked skylines and blackened rivers. But that picture is increasingly outdated.

After decades of severe industrial pollution, Beijing has imposed some of the world’s strictest environmental regulations. It has outspent every other nation on renewable energy, built a vast corpus of environmental scientists and created national parks and protected areas on a scale larger than Yosemite and Yellowstone combined.

Over the past 40 years, China has become one of the most re-forested parts of Earth after Chinese officials ordered the planting of millions of trees to combat flooding, deforestation and the encroachment of the Gobi Desert in the northern part of the country. This effort, known as the “Great Green Wall,” has made China one of the world’s leading technical experts in “greening” land that’s been degraded or overused.

But China’s environmental turnaround within its borders has led to a growing ecological footprint abroad as the country shifts its extraction to forests, mountains and seascapes in Belt and Road Initiative partner countries.

To longtime China scholar, Judith Shapiro, this transformation is both impressive and troubling.

“There’s been real progress—air quality has improved, pollution enforcement is far stronger, and ecological restoration is happening at a scale few other countries could pull off,” she said.

“But the approach is extremely technocratic and top-down. It doesn’t involve public participation, community oversight or grassroots decision-making,” she added.

That’s a consequence, Shapiro said, of the ruling Communist Party’s authoritarian governance and control over its citizens, which has only intensified under Xi.

The human cost has been stark. One of the clearest examples is China’s “Ecological Conservation Redlines,” a sweeping system that designates large swaths of land for protection and restricts industrial and residential use. While the policy has helped revive degraded ecosystems, it has also displaced millions from rural areas into cities, creating a new class of urban poor.

“It’s a form of quiet dispossession,” said Jesse Rodenbiker, who has conducted extensive field research in rural China. “People wake up one day and find they can no longer farm the land they’ve lived on for generations.”

Despite the social costs, the Communist Party hails ecological redlining as a triumph, an efficient way to conserve land by urbanizing rural populations and giving some people residency status. The model echoes the United States’ early conservation history, when Native Americans were forcibly removed to create national parks such as Yosemite. That “fortress conservation” philosophy was later exported overseas with more devastating human-rights consequences.

As the global conservation community increasingly reckons with these legacies, Beijing is positioning elements of its model as an export. Through the Kunming Biodiversity Fund announced at the 2021 summit, China has pledged more than $230 million to help developing countries meet their biodiversity goals. Coupled with a rapidly expanding web of technical exchanges, training programs and environmental assistance, China has cultivated what scholars describe as “green soft power”—a strategy that bolsters its influence in the Global South.

“China,” Rodenbiker said, “is offering resources others aren’t.”

A Black Box

On a sun-streaked cafe patio in Quito, Prieto leaned forward in a plastic chair, the environmental lawyer’s energy unflagging after a long day of meetings. Nearby, the capital’s late-afternoon traffic snaked around colonial edifices and plazas, fusing the tang of exhaust fumes with roasting coffee beans in the high Andean air.

Prieto was eager to talk. He has spent years grappling with the consequences of extractive foreign investment in Ecuador, projects promising beneficial development but leaving rivers slick with oil, forests razed and Indigenous communities displaced. His work has included a landmark case against Chevron, whose predecessor Texaco dumped millions of gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon.

“I understand well how Western companies operate,” Prieto said, referring to the mechanisms he’s used to try to hold those firms accountable. “China, though, is a black box for us.”

Today, Prieto is president of the Quito-based Center for Economic and Social Rights (CDES), a nonprofit critical of Ecuador’s debt swaps, alleging they lacked transparency and public participation. In 2024, Prieto and CDES won concessions from the Inter-American Development Bank, a guarantor of the Galápagos transaction, to improve public access to information about the deal’s conservation fund.

Prieto has broader concerns about the deals: “They don’t help sustainability or protect nature effectively,” he said, noting that their complexity and drawn-out structure tend to generate substantial income to lawyers and administrators. He also takes issue with how communities are treated.

“In the Galápagos and now in the Amazon, Indigenous communities are often sidelined,” he added. “Only a small, select group is consulted.”

More than a million Indigenous people call Ecuador home. Many live in the Amazon and do not identify with the umbrella organizations typically brought to the negotiating table. That mismatch has long dogged both extractive and conservation efforts in Ecuador, resulting in processes that often overlook the diverse realities and consent of the communities involved.

Prieto said the lack of transparency surrounding environmental decisions in Ecuador is troubling, noting that the state-owned Chinese mining company he is currently suing has refused to release its waste pit construction plans. It cited a confidentiality clause it negotiated with the Ecuadorian government. Earlier this year another Chinese mining firm’s waste pit collapsed in Zambia, causing catastrophic destruction. Advocates there have also struggled to obtain that company’s planning documents.

Prieto worries that the details of any potential debt-for-nature deal could be similarly obscured.

According to Prieto and news reports, communities near the Amazonian mine have faced displacement, environmental contamination and other abuses, including violence against Indigenous women. “Communities feel they have no recourse,” Prieto said.

Many of those communities, academics and advocates also have ethical objections to debt-for-nature deals, which they argue has led to the “financialization of conservation”—treating nature as an asset to be priced rather than as a living system with inherent value. (Ecuador’s constitution is the only one in the world to recognize that nature, like humans, has rights to exist).

Even as China considers debt swaps for renewables or development—investments that can offer Beijing a clear financial return—tying debt relief to conservation could be a nonstarter, said Junjie Zhang, an environmental economist with Duke Kunshan University. China’s priority, he said, has always been development, not aid.

Most Chinese officials, he added, believe struggling countries must first “make a living” before tackling anything else. Debt swaps for conservation strike them as risky, even counterproductive.

“If you swap debt for nature, what about in the future? Can the country generate enough revenue? Then you again ask for money,” Zhang said.

And China, with its fiercely competitive economic culture and domestic sensitivity to giving money away, is wary of assuming the role of global green financier.

“China doesn’t want to be a leader,” he said. “A leader needs to pay.”

Yunnan Chen, a research fellow with the London-based overseas development think tank ODI Global (formerly Overseas Development Institute), pointed out that China went into debt when it pursued its own industrialization.

“It doesn’t necessarily see debt as inherently a bad thing. It sees it as a necessary phase that developing countries have to go through to make the right kinds of productive investments in order to then generate growth. And that is also why I think it’s resistant to giving that kind of concession or debt relief.”

When China extends debt relief—zero-interest loans or loan write-offs—it’s subsidized by the country’s foreign aid budget. “It’s a tiny, tiny proportion of the portfolio and it’s usually only the ones that are at the end of their maturity,” Chen said. “And it’s kind of a tick-the-box exercise for the news headline.”

Kevin Koenig, who has tracked China’s footprint in Ecuador for more than a decade, is blunt about the prospect of Beijing stepping into the conservation arena.

“I don’t want to call it greenwashing,” he said. “But if there were a real interest in biodiversity protection or debt cancellation, you’d do that differently, not: ‘We’re going to continue extraction, and on the side we’ll do a debt-for-nature deal’ very far away from the places their investment projects are destroying.”

Koenig sees the same contradictory elements in Ecuador’s existing debt-for-nature deals. They may channel money into protected areas, he said, but they don’t touch the forces driving deforestation and emissions in the first place. Even as the government celebrates the Amazonian Biocorridor debt-swap, it has continued to expand mining and approve new oil production blocks across the Amazon.

“These swaps won’t solve the fossil fuel or climate problem,” Koenig said. “They might save certain areas on paper, but they’re full of contradictions—countries promising a transition while doubling down on extraction.”

An Open Door

Since Ecuador pioneered one of the earliest debt-for-nature swaps in the late 1980s, the model for the deals has changed dramatically. After a period in which wealthy countries forgave portions of developing nations’ debt, the swaps have shifted into far more intricate, privately financed transactions. Today’s versions are vastly larger, often restructuring hundreds of millions or even more than a billion dollars in sovereign debt, and requiring layers of legal, financial and political coordination.

Ecuador’s Amazon swap, backed by The Nature Conservancy and public financial institutions, cut Ecuador’s debt obligation to some private bondholders from $1.53 billion to $730 million, while directing part of each payment into a conservation fund expected to raise $460 million over 17 years. The proceeds will go to Indigenous communities and conservation projects.

Speaking from a glassy high-rise in downtown Quito, Galo Medina, The Nature Conservancy’s Ecuador director, recalled just how arduous it was to pull off the deal. Initiated in 2022, the transaction outlasted two presidents and five environment ministers. Beyond the financial restructuring, the government codified new conservation commitments into law and, with The Nature Conservancy and other partners, established an independent trust fund to manage the money.

Medina insisted the trust fund is legally bound to fulfill conservation requirements set by the Ecuadorian government—not creditors who participated in the transaction or any other party. The fund also has to comply with Ecuadorian law, including the requirement that local communities are consulted about activities that could impact them.

The trust fund, he explained, is overseen by an independent board, including a representative from an Amazonian Indigenous organization. Once the fund is fully operational, he expects it to distribute roughly $17 million annually for conservation. The first call for proposals is expected toward the end of January.

“The main aspect that we’re looking for is the involvement and direct participation of local and Indigenous communities in the Amazon,” Medina said.

But he also acknowledged the tension at the heart of the effort—that the region the fund aims to protect is also where the government is expanding oil production and mining. His colleague, financial specialist Mónica Chávez, underscored the broader context: Developing countries would like to invest more heavily in conservation and climate commitments even as they face severe fiscal constraints.

“Then comes something like this, a debt-for-nature swap, and offers the chance for our country to send money for conservation that would be impossible in other circumstances,” she said. “This is an opportunity for Ecuador.”

As for whether Ecuador might one day participate in a swap with China, Chávez chose her words carefully.

“If it was an open door,” she said, “maybe we’d explore that.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2241478719-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 05:58:00.222164
