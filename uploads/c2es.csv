The CBO “score” of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act says there are $5.3 trillion in tax cuts, offset by $2.9 trillion in tax increases and spending reductions.

Passage of the bill resulted in a quickly escalating rupture of the political alliance between President Trump and Elon Musk. Musk called the bill a “disgusting abomination” and urged his followers on X to “KILL the BILL.” The president replied that Musk suffered from “Trump derangement syndrome.”

While it made for entertaining political theater, the Trump-Musk insults did nothing to enlighten anyone about content in the 1,116-page bill.

According to an analysis done by the respected Tax Foundation, a leading independent tax policy nonprofit, the bill makes some smart tax cuts and revenue increases. Most of the good tax policy aligns with the Tax Foundation’s principle of stability.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act extends many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). It permanently extends the rates and brackets of the 2017 individual tax cuts.

The bill also permanently extends the larger standard deduction (now $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for married couples filing jointly) and the alternative minimum tax threshold that were only temporary in the TCJA. Those two provisions have greatly simplified the tax code for millions of taxpayers.

Regarding the estate and gift tax, the bill institutes a permanent (and inflation-adjusted) exemption level of $15 million beginning in 2026, also enhancing stability.

The bill makes some good policies that raise revenue relative to current law by reducing some of the tax code’s many credits, deductions, and other preferences. The largest area of reform is the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) green energy tax credits; the bill raises about $500 billion over 10 years, cutting the cost of those credits in half.

Several IRA credits are also repealed – like those for electric vehicles (EVs) and residential energy products, which are expensive and ineffective.

The bill spends far too much on political gimmicks and carveouts for Trump’s pet tax cuts (on tips: cost $39.7 billion), overtime ($124 billion), a $4,000 additional special deduction for seniors ($65.5 billion), and car loan interest ($57.7 billion). All violate basic tax policy of treating taxpayers equally and do nothing to boost growth.

These four provisions combined cost $300 billion over the four years they are in effect, and if eventually extended, the cost would more than double over the next decade.

No tax on tips, overtime and car loans comes with conditions that will require hundreds of pages of IRS guidance to interpret.

Scrap one or all of these and the bill would add less to the deficit. The Senate should also reduce the $40,000 state-and-local tax deduction cap.

Republicans are taking heat for modest reforms to Medicaid that will spend 33% more next year than it did in 2019.

The bill would cut Medicaid spending by $700 billion over the next decade, according to the CBO. The federal government admits it made $543 billion in inappropriate Medicaid payments from 2015 through 2024.

The bill mandates an 80-hour-per-month work requirement that would attach to benefits for able-bodied adults ages 19-64. Volunteer work and school would count toward the work requirement.

Medicaid covers about 800,000 Nevadans. It’s estimated the new work rules would cause about 13% of the state’s Medicaid population to drop coverage. The House GOP budget avoids the biggest fears concerning Medicaid cuts.

The legislation targets states that permit illegal aliens to enroll in Medicaid and verifies eligibility more frequently.

Failure to pass a budget reconciliation bill is not an option for Congressional Republicans. If this bill fails, taxes will rise $4.5 trillion next year.

The clean mobility wave sweeping across the world is being quietly shaped by something far less clean: hard geopolitics. In recent weeks, a subtle shift in the availability of rare-earth magnets has begun to ripple across India’s electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem. The magnets, essential to making EV motors run, are sourced predominantly from China. And China, many suspect, may be tightening the taps.

The timing has raised eyebrows. Just months after India denied Chinese giant BYD permission to set up an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in the country, reports have emerged of sudden delays and complications in magnet supplies to Indian manufacturers. No formal ban, no official announcement, just the kind of slow squeeze that is hard to pin down but even harder to ignore.

So is this payback for BYD’s rejection? Or is it something more calculated, a strategic negotiation using the world’s EV ambitions as leverage?

Magnets: The Quiet Force Behind Every Electric Motor

To understand why this matters, it helps to know how crucial these magnets are. Rare-earth magnets, particularly neodymium-based ones, sit at the heart of most modern EV motors. Without them, performance drops, efficiency suffers, and manufacturers are forced to look for heavier or bulkier alternatives.

China currently produces around 90 percent of the global supply of these magnets. This gives it immense, and mostly invisible, control over the pace and cost of the global EV transition. And as some Indian automakers are now discovering, that control can be exercised subtly but effectively.

Negotiation by Discomfort

Insiders in the automotive and policy circles suggest that this may not be outright retaliation but rather negotiation through discomfort. The logic is simple. Deny Chinese carmakers access to a growing EV market like India, and the response won’t be a headline-grabbing embargo but a quiet tightening of the noose in places that hurt, like access to critical minerals.

It wouldn’t be the first time. When the United States clamped down on Chinese access to advanced chipmaking tech, China responded by restricting gallium and germanium exports. Once trade talks resumed and certain understandings were reached, those restrictions were lifted. The pattern seems consistent: pressure first, concessions later.

And India may now be caught in a similar loop, not necessarily because it matters deeply to China’s overall economic play, but because it’s a smaller fish that can be used to set an example.

Not Just BYD: Other Signs of Strategic Obstruction

This theory gains more weight when viewed alongside China’s approach to other foreign players. Take Foxconn, for instance. The Taiwanese firm has been a key Apple supplier and a vital part of India’s ambitions to become a major electronics manufacturing hub.

But its efforts to ramp up production in India have faced unexplained hurdles, including restrictions on Chinese engineers travelling to train Indian workers. China reportedly barred its own citizens from helping build the talent pipeline India needs.

It’s the same pressure through disruption playbook, and it appears to be designed not just to retaliate, but to slow down competing ecosystems before they take off.

India’s Strategic Blind Spot

What’s troubling is how little public conversation there has been around rare-earth magnet dependency. While the country has focused on battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and EV incentives, the quiet reliance on China for magnets has remained largely unaddressed.

If China is indeed using magnet supplies as a pressure valve, it reveals a major strategic gap. India needs to diversify sources, fast-track local magnet manufacturing, and invest in alternatives such as induction motors or magnet recycling technologies. This won’t be easy or cheap, but the cost of continuing dependence could be far higher.

A Future Negotiated Behind the Scenes

In this unfolding geopolitical drama, China may not even need to say anything out loud. The signal is already clear. Want steady magnet supplies? Rethink your position on Chinese automakers. Approve BYD, or at least reopen talks. Allow deeper trade access in return for smoother supply chains.

That might explain why the disruption hasn’t triggered a diplomatic standoff. It’s subtle, deniable, and utterly effective.

The bigger question now is whether India will bend or build. Will it negotiate, retaliate, or quietly absorb the discomfort? The answers may define not just the future of EVs here, but the nature of how small economies navigate their electric ambitions under the shadow of a global power that controls the magnets.",https://cdn.cartoq.com/photos/062025/rare_earth_magnets_india_vs_china_featured_6871e4cc68.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 00:01:07.797134

To measure a forest's carbon cycle, a calculation of forest aboveground biomass is needed.
Though effective, traditional ground-based methods for estimating forest aboveground biomass are labor-intensive, time-consuming and limited in spatial coverage abilities, Zurqani said.
The support vector machine algorithm struggled, Zurqani said, highlighting that not all AI models are equally suited for estimating aboveground forest biomass in this study.
Why it matters Zurqani said that accurate forest biomass mapping has real-world implications for better accounting of carbon and improved forest management on a global scale.","Understanding this carbon cycle is key to climate change research, according to Hamdi Zurqani, an assistant professor of geospatial science for the Arkansas Forest Resources Center and the College of Forestry, Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of Arkansas at Monticello. The center is headquartered at UAM and conducts research and extension activities through the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station and the Cooperative Extension Service, the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture's research and outreach arms.

""Forests are often called the lungs of our planet, and for good reason,"" Zurqani said. ""They store roughly 80 percent of the world's terrestrial carbon and play a critical role in regulating Earth's climate.""

To measure a forest's carbon cycle, a calculation of forest aboveground biomass is needed. Though effective, traditional ground-based methods for estimating forest aboveground biomass are labor-intensive, time-consuming and limited in spatial coverage abilities, Zurqani said.

In a study recently published in Ecological Informatics, Zurqani shows how information from open-access satellites can be integrated on Google Earth Engine with artificial intelligence algorithms to quickly and accurately map large-scale forest aboveground biomass, even in remote areas where accessibility is often an issue.

Zurqani's novel approach uses data from NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation LiDAR, also known as GEDI LiDAR, which includes three lasers installed on the International Space Station. The system can precisely measure three-dimensional forest canopy height, canopy vertical structure and surface elevation. LiDAR stands for ""light detection and ranging"" and uses light pulses to measure distance and create 3D models.

Zurqani also used imagery data from the European Space Agency's collection of Earth observation Copernicus Sentinel satellites -- Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Combining the 3D imagery from GEDI and the optical imagery from the Sentinels, Zurqani improved the accuracy of biomass estimations.

The study tested four machine learning algorithms to analyze the data: Gradient tree boosting, random forest, classification and regression trees, or CART, and support vector machine. Gradient tree boosting achieved the highest accuracy score and the lowest error rates. Random forest came in second, proving reliable but slightly less precise. CART provided reasonable estimates but tended to focus on a smaller subset. The support vector machine algorithm struggled, Zurqani said, highlighting that not all AI models are equally suited for estimating aboveground forest biomass in this study.

The most accurate predictions, Zurqani said, came from combining Sentinel-2 optical data, vegetation indices, topographic features, and canopy height with the GEDI LiDAR dataset serving as the reference input for both training and testing the machine learning models, showing that multi-source data integration is critical for reliable biomass mapping.

Why it matters

Zurqani said that accurate forest biomass mapping has real-world implications for better accounting of carbon and improved forest management on a global scale. With more accurate assessments, governments and organizations can more precisely track carbon sequestration and emissions from deforestation to inform policy decisions.

The road ahead

While the study marks a leap forward in measuring aboveground forest biomass, Zurqani said the challenges remaining include the impact weather can have on satellite data. Some regions still lack high-resolution LiDAR coverage. He added that future research may explore deeper AI models, such as neural networks, to refine predictions further.

""One thing is clear,"" Zurqani said. ""As climate change intensifies, technology like this will be indispensable in safeguarding our forests and the planet.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/Planet-Earth-Forests.webp,N,,2025-06-15 00:02:50.404045

First Solar’s proprietary CdTe technology and advancements in TOPCon panels provide a significant competitive advantage in the solar market.","First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: ), the largest US-based solar module manufacturer with a market capitalization of $18.8 billion, finds itself at a critical juncture as it navigates a complex landscape of tariffs, technological advancements, and policy uncertainties. The company’s unique position as a domestic producer with proprietary technology has garnered significant attention from investors and analysts alike, particularly given its strong financial health. According to InvestingPro data, First Solar maintains robust liquidity with a current ratio of 1.93 and operates with minimal leverage, sporting a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.08.

Market Position and Competitive Advantages

First Solar has established itself as a leader in the US solar market, benefiting from its strong domestic manufacturing footprint and the incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The company specializes in cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film solar panels, which differ from the more common silicon-based panels produced by many of its competitors.

One of First Solar’s key competitive advantages lies in its proprietary technology, particularly its advancements in TOPCon (Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact) technology. Analysts note that this gives the company a significant edge over other US cell manufacturers who are limited to using less efficient PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) technology. This technological moat has allowed First Solar to maintain stronger pricing power and potentially higher margins compared to its peers.

Tariff Impacts and Policy Uncertainties

The solar industry has been significantly impacted by recent trade policies, particularly the imposition of tariffs on imported solar modules. For First Solar, this presents both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, the company benefits from its domestic production capabilities, which shield it from the full impact of these tariffs. On the other hand, the broader market uncertainty created by these policies has led to some hesitation among customers and potential project delays.

In April 2025, the US Department of Commerce made final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations on crystalline photovoltaic cells from several Southeast Asian countries. The resulting tariffs, with an all-in weighted average rate of approximately 330%, have created a complex competitive landscape. While these tariffs potentially benefit First Solar by increasing the costs for its foreign competitors, they also introduce uncertainty into the broader solar market.

First Solar’s management has indicated that the company’s contracts are structured to avoid directly absorbing tariff costs. However, the potential for reciprocal tariffs on its facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia poses a long-term challenge. Analysts estimate that First Solar would need to increase its average selling price (ASP) by approximately $0.02/watt to offset the tariff impact, which is significantly less than what its competitors would need to do.

Technology and Manufacturing Capabilities

First Solar continues to invest in its technological capabilities and manufacturing capacity. The company has begun limited commercial production of its CuRe ( Replacement) modules at its Ohio facility, with full deployment expected after testing. Additionally, First Solar is working on perovskites technology and a next-generation tandem device, which could further enhance its competitive position in the future.

The company plans to achieve 25 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity by 2026, with expansion plans in India, Alabama, Louisiana, and Ohio. This growth in capacity is expected to drive future revenue and potentially improve economies of scale.

However, First Solar has faced some challenges with its Series 7 modules, which have experienced manufacturing issues. While the company reports that these issues have been resolved for current production, there is a potential for warranty losses of up to $100 million related to previously produced modules.

Financial Outlook and Guidance

First Solar’s financial performance and guidance have been subject to significant scrutiny in recent months. In its latest earnings report, the company exceeded revenue expectations but missed gross margin targets due to various factors, including IRA credit sales, warranty charges, module shipment delays, and increased warehousing costs.

For fiscal year 2025, First Solar has revised its guidance downward, reflecting the uncertainties in the market. The company now expects revenue in the range of $4.5-5.5 billion, down from the previous guidance of $5.3-5.8 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) guidance has been reduced to $12.50-17.50 from the previous $17-20 range. Despite these adjustments, InvestingPro analysis suggests the stock is currently trading at an attractive valuation with a P/E ratio of 14.94, which appears modest given the company’s growth trajectory and robust gross margin of 43.61%.

Despite these near-term challenges, analysts remain generally optimistic about First Solar’s long-term prospects. The company’s strong backlog, which extends through 2030, provides significant visibility into future revenues. Additionally, the potential for stable or increasing ASPs, even in the face of potential changes to tax credits and tariffs, supports a positive outlook for profitability.

Bear Case

How might changes to IRA provisions impact First Solar’s competitive advantage?

First Solar’s current competitive position is significantly bolstered by the incentives provided under the Inflation Reduction Act, particularly the 45X manufacturing tax credits. If these provisions were to be altered or eliminated under a future administration, it could substantially impact First Solar’s cost structure and profitability.

The company’s earnings are heavily tied to these credits, with some analysts estimating that they contribute significantly to the EPS forecast. A phase-out or removal of these credits could lead to a sharp decline in profitability, potentially eroding First Solar’s competitive advantage over foreign manufacturers who operate with lower cost structures.

Furthermore, any changes to the domestic content requirements for solar projects eligible for tax credits could reduce the demand for First Solar’s US-made panels, potentially leading to overcapacity and margin pressure.

What risks does First Solar face from potential supply chain disruptions?

First Solar’s reliance on specific materials, particularly tellurium for its CdTe panels, exposes the company to supply chain risks. Recent export controls imposed by China on tellurium have highlighted this vulnerability. While First Solar is taking steps to diversify its sourcing to countries like Peru and Canada, this transition could lead to increased costs and potential production disruptions in the near term.

Additionally, the company’s global manufacturing footprint, with facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia, exposes it to geopolitical risks and potential trade disputes. Any disruptions to production or increased costs due to tariffs or trade barriers could negatively impact First Solar’s ability to meet demand and maintain its competitive pricing.

Bull Case

How could First Solar’s technological edge in CdTe and TOPCon panels drive future growth?

First Solar’s proprietary CdTe technology and advancements in TOPCon panels provide a significant competitive advantage in the solar market. These technologies offer higher efficiency and potentially lower production costs compared to traditional silicon-based panels.

As the solar industry continues to grow and demand for high-efficiency panels increases, First Solar’s technological edge could allow it to capture a larger market share and command premium pricing. The company’s ongoing research into perovskites and next-generation tandem devices could further extend this technological lead, potentially opening up new market segments and applications for its products.

Moreover, as environmental concerns become increasingly important to consumers and policymakers, First Solar’s CdTe technology, which has a lower carbon footprint and energy payback time compared to silicon-based panels, could become even more attractive in the market.

What opportunities does First Solar have to expand its market share domestically and internationally?

First Solar’s strong position in the US market, combined with its planned capacity expansions, positions the company well to capitalize on the growing demand for solar energy. The company’s domestic manufacturing capabilities align well with the increasing focus on ""Made in America"" products and energy security concerns.

Internationally, First Solar has opportunities to expand its presence in growing markets such as India and the Middle East. The company’s plans to establish manufacturing facilities in India could allow it to tap into one of the world’s fastest-growing solar markets while potentially benefiting from local incentives and avoiding import tariffs.

Furthermore, as global efforts to combat climate change intensify, many countries are setting ambitious renewable energy targets. First Solar’s reputation as a technology leader and its experience in utility-scale projects could make it a preferred partner for large-scale solar deployments worldwide, driving significant growth in its international business.

""We want to encourage the supporting industries to grow alongside the EV industry.","JAKARTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Partnerships with countries experienced in electric vehicles (EV) development, particularly China, will be essential for the Indonesian EV industry, an Indonesian business leader told Xinhua.

Indonesia's automotive industry has developed rapidly over the past 50 years and has been undergoing a shift toward cleaner energy vehicles. With the swift adoption of EVs, the country has emerged as a promising destination for nickel investment.

Kukuh Kumara, secretary general of the Association of Indonesia Automotive Industries (GAIKINDO), told Xinhua in an interview that the transition toward EVs has drawn significant attention from the Indonesian public, supported by the government's strong push for the nickel downstream industry. However, building a complete downstream ecosystem requires many more components.

""From the mining process to ready-to-use batteries, there is a huge process involved. There are three main components in EVs: batteries, electromotors, and semiconductor chips for battery management. Moreover, EV batteries are very specific. Even EVs from the same brand can use different types of batteries, each containing numerous components,"" Kumara said.

As Southeast Asia's largest economy, Indonesia is currently attracting numerous international EV automakers and nickel miners.

From 2024 to March 2025, seven EV manufacturers, including BYD, Citron, Geely, and VinFast, have invested in the country, with a total investment value of 15 trillion rupiahs (921.9 million U.S. dollars), according to the Ministry of Investment and Downstream Industry. Together, these companies have brought a combined production capacity of up to 280,000 units per year.

Currently, Indonesia is home to nine electric car manufacturers, seven electric bus production facilities, and 63 two- and three-wheeled electric vehicle factories. According to data from the Ministry of Industry, the annual production capacities are 70,600 units for electric cars, 3,100 units for electric buses, and 2.28 million units for two- and three-wheeled electric motorcycles.

In terms of raw materials, Indonesia remains the world's largest holder of nickel reserves, accounting for 40 percent to 45 percent of global supply.

As of 2023, Indonesia had nickel resources in the form of ore amounting to 18.5 billion tons, with total reserves reaching 5.3 billion tons, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. By January 2024, 54 nickel smelters were in active operation across the country.

While many companies have already invested in mining and EV manufacturing, Kumara emphasized the need to focus more on battery component industries.

""We need to expand the industry, especially in the three main components, including the electromotor, which we are still importing. Also, semiconductors for battery management systems are not yet produced locally,"" he said.

""We want to encourage the supporting industries to grow alongside the EV industry. That's why we should begin identifying which components can be manufactured locally,"" Kumara added.

He noted that by building more industries related to the EV supply chain, Indonesia could strengthen its downstream capabilities, create job opportunities, and facilitate knowledge transfer. For this reason, ""It's interesting because China is known for its strong EV component industry. We encourage our local companies to learn from Chinese firms."" Kumara said.

From 2024 to March 2025, seven EV manufacturers, including BYD, Citron, Geely, and VinFast, have invested in the country, with a total investment value of 15 trillion rupiahs (921.9 million U.S. dollars), according to the Ministry of Investment and Downstream Industry. Together, these companies have brought a combined production capacity of up to 280,000 units per year.

Currently, Indonesia is home to nine electric car manufacturers, seven electric bus production facilities, and 63 two- and three-wheeled electric vehicle factories. According to data from the Ministry of Industry, the annual production capacities are 70,600 units for electric cars, 3,100 units for electric buses, and 2.28 million units for two- and three-wheeled electric motorcycles.

In terms of raw materials, Indonesia remains the world's largest holder of nickel reserves, accounting for 40 percent to 45 percent of global supply.

As of 2023, Indonesia had nickel resources in the form of ore amounting to 18.5 billion tons, with total reserves reaching 5.3 billion tons, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. By January 2024, 54 nickel smelters were in active operation across the country.

While many companies have already invested in mining and EV manufacturing, Kumara emphasized the need to focus more on battery component industries.

""We need to expand the industry, especially in the three main components, including the electromotor, which we are still importing. Also, semiconductors for battery management systems are not yet produced locally,"" he said.

""We want to encourage the supporting industries to grow alongside the EV industry. That's why we should begin identifying which components can be manufactured locally,"" Kumara added.

He noted that by building more industries related to the EV supply chain, Indonesia could strengthen its downstream capabilities, create job opportunities, and facilitate knowledge transfer.

Indonesia's automotive industry has developed rapidly over the past 50 years and has been undergoing a shift toward cleaner energy vehicles. With the swift adoption of EVs, the country has emerged as a promising destination for nickel investment.

Kukuh Kumara, secretary general of the Association of Indonesia Automotive Industries (GAIKINDO), told Xinhua in an interview that the transition toward EVs has drawn significant attention from the Indonesian public, supported by the government's strong push for the nickel downstream industry. However, building a complete downstream ecosystem requires many more components.

""From the mining process to ready-to-use batteries, there is a huge process involved. There are three main components in EVs: batteries, electromotors, and semiconductor chips for battery management. Moreover, EV batteries are very specific.

Over 100,000 Santa Cruz County residents — almost one in three — depend on Medi-Cal for critical health care services, including preventive care, prescriptions and mental health support.
Yvette Lopez Brooks is CEO, United Way Santa Cruz County.","By Yvette Lopez Brooks

At United Way of Santa Cruz County, we envision a community where every person, regardless of income, race or ZIP code, has the opportunity to thrive. Every child deserves access to nutritious meals, every senior deserves quality health care and every family should have the support they need to be financially secure. Since 1941, United Way has united community members, nonprofits, businesses and government agencies to improve lives through education, health and financial stability.

But that future is now at risk.

Congress is currently considering H.R. 1, the “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which proposes deep cuts to foundational programs like Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California), CalFresh (SNAP) and the Child and Earned Income Tax Credits. These programs are not excesses or luxuries. They are lifelines for many in Santa Cruz County.

This is not a partisan issue. It is a community issue.

The proposed cuts would have devastating impacts across the Central Coast. Consider the following:

In Santa Cruz County alone, more than 42,000 people — including children, low-wage workers and older adults — rely on CalFresh to afford groceries.

Nearly 80,000 working families across Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties benefit from the Child and Earned Income Tax Credits, which help pay for child care, rent, school supplies and transportation.

Over 100,000 Santa Cruz County residents — almost one in three — depend on Medi-Cal for critical health care services, including preventive care, prescriptions and mental health support.

These are not handouts. They are investments in people. CalFresh helps kids focus in school instead of on hunger. Medi-Cal helps workers stay healthy enough to keep their jobs. Tax credits allow parents to stay employed while managing rising costs.

At United Way, we see the real impact of these programs every day. Our 211 Santa Cruz County helpline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to connect people with food, housing, mental health support and medical care. If you or someone you know needs help, call 211 to be connected with trusted local resources.

When families call in crisis, they are not looking for charity. They are trying to hold things together. If H.R. 1 becomes law, we anticipate a sharp increase in these calls — but our local safety nets are already stretched thin.

This is more than a policy debate. It is a test of who we are as a community. Do we believe that working families, children and seniors deserve stability? Do we respond to hardship with compassion or indifference?

As I often remind our partners, “United Way is not here to serve just one part of the community. We are here to lift the whole community. When we protect the most vulnerable, we strengthen the foundation for everyone.”

I urge every reader to contact their congressional representatives today. Tell them:

“I am deeply concerned about the impact of H.R. 1 on my community. These cuts are too deep, too fast and too harmful. We need policies that support, not punish, our working families, children and seniors.”

Find your representative at congress.gov/members/find-your-member.

At United Way of Santa Cruz County, we remain committed to connecting families with resources, empowering youth through United4Youth and building a more resilient safety net through United4Community. But we cannot do it alone.

Your voice matters. Together, we can ensure that compassion, not cuts, guides our path forward.

The Class VI program is the lynchpin to scaling geologic storage of captured CO2 to meet the anticipated storage demand from the growing carbon management industry.
“Today, 60 projects have submitted 175 Class VI well applications to the EPA for review, and the queue continues to grow.
“The Coalition urges EPA to continue timely and comprehensive reviews of state primacy applications and individual well applications.","The following statement may be attributed to Christian Flinn, public policy manager at the Carbon Capture Coalition (the Coalition), a non-partisan collaboration of companies, labor unions, and NGOs building support for carbon management policies. It is on the recent announcement that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed granting primary enforcement authority over Class VI wells to the state of Texas:

“The Carbon Capture Coalition welcomes the recent announcement from the EPA that they have proposed granting primary enforcement authority (primacy) over Class VI wells to Texas, after a public comment and hearing process this summer. Texas would join Wyoming, North Dakota, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Arizona as the sixth state in the nation to be granted authority over Class VI wells. Granting primacy empowers states to manage and regulate Class VI injection wells within their jurisdiction, which importantly must meet or exceed the EPA’s requirements to qualify for Class VI primacy.

“The EPA oversees the Class VI program to ensure that geologic carbon storage is carried out in a manner that protects human health and underground sources of drinking water, while permanently storing carbon dioxide captured from industry and power facilities, as well as directly from the atmosphere. The Class VI program is the lynchpin to scaling geologic storage of captured CO2 to meet the anticipated storage demand from the growing carbon management industry.

“Today, 60 projects have submitted 175 Class VI well applications to the EPA for review, and the queue continues to grow. Meanwhile, states with primacy are currently reviewing more than 30 Class VI well applications. By expanding the number of states granted primacy over Class VI wells, EPA can reduce its backlog of applications and dramatically accelerate the necessary build-out of carbon management projects throughout the country.

“The Coalition urges EPA to continue timely and comprehensive reviews of state primacy applications and individual well applications. We look forward to working with the administration and bipartisan members of Congress to ensure the Class VI program has the necessary resources, technology, and training to efficiently complete a growing number of primacy and individual well reviews in the critical months and years ahead.”

Calvin Trostle, Ph.D.,Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service agronomist and statewide hemp and alternative crop specialist, Lubbock, said markets may be limited for alternative crops like sunflowers, sesame, Sudan grass and canola, but Texas producers are taking advantage of cropping opportunities.
For producers, alternative crops can serve as primary summer crops or provide supplemental income.
“Alternative crops are a small piece of Texas ag production,” Trostle said.
“It takes experience and building relationships with potential buyers to enter some of these alternative crop markets.","Texas farmers continue to find ways to add value to their operations through alternative crops like oilseeds and cover crop forages.

Calvin Trostle, Ph.D.,Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service agronomist and statewide hemp and alternative crop specialist, Lubbock, said markets may be limited for alternative crops like sunflowers, sesame, Sudan grass and canola, but Texas producers are taking advantage of cropping opportunities.

For producers, alternative crops can serve as primary summer crops or provide supplemental income. They can also provide the benefits of a cover crop during the cool season.

“Alternative crops are a small piece of Texas ag production,” Trostle said. “But for producers looking for opportunities to supplement their primary crop production, they can really be a value-added component.”

Sunflowers show potential

Trostle said total acres for sunflowers in the Rio Grande Valley increased slightly but remained static in other regions of the state. Growers typically engage with buyers before acres are planted to fill contracts at set prices. Seeds are grown for two markets – as bird food and for oil extraction.

Per pound prices were good for both markets, he said. Seeds bound for “crushing” end up in oil form for various products, but primarily for cooking, especially in large-scale food manufacturing.

Sunflower seeds’ high-oleic content makes them more shelf-stable and better for cooking and frying, but their monounsaturated fats retain healthy attributes, he said.

Trostle said there may be growth potential in the demand for crushing-seeds for oil but the demand for them as bird food remained steady.

“Sunflowers seem to provide some price security and safety for growers, and it has the potential for premiums based on oil content,” he said. “It takes experience and building relationships with potential buyers to enter some of these alternative crop markets. That’s why we recommend growers dedicate some acres each season to experiment with growing options that might have potential for their operation.”

Finding markets for alternative crops

Production capacity in other alternative crops slipped or made gains based on regional demands, Trostle said.

Sesame seed acres remained close to last year, but demand dropped when a contractor pulled out of the Texas market, he said. As a result, prices have not been strong enough to generate interest in expansion among producers. It remains an alternative crop that is on a contract basis and filled by established growers.

Canola for oil production also experienced a decline in demand, even in surrounding states like Oklahoma, as acres moved to other states, Trostle said. However, some growers are finding a market for the cool-season crop as a high-value forage for dairy production in the Panhandle. Canola is a brassica, which are fast-growing, high yielding forage and cover crops, and its silage’s high nutritive value outperforms grasses like wheat and ryegrass.

Trostle said wheat, triticale and Sudan grass, which is a forage sorghum variety, have generated increased interest among producers. They are seeing the harvest and post-harvest value in these cool-season crops.

They can be grazed or grown as forage but also provide excellent cover-crop residue for growers who might follow with cotton or other warm-season commodities.

Trostle saidTexas A&M AgriLife Research and AgriLife Extension scientists continue to research the versatility of these cool-season options and provide valuable information and recommendations to growers.

“A new major educational effort for me this year is the advent of prussic acid-free sorghums,” he said. “There are first-time sorghum/Sudan hybrids that eliminate prussic acid poisoning in stressed or frostbitten sorghums.”

Trostle said that for now, those seeds cost more, and there are first-year limited seed supplies.",http://www.ntxe-news.com/images/icons/fb_logo.gif,N,,2025-06-15 00:02:46.568822

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' first patent application, method and system for battery pack adjustment, introduces a novel solution to address the common issue of imbalanced battery cells within a battery pack - an issue that leads to reduced capacity, safety concerns, and shortened lifespan. In most battery packs, cells charge and discharge at different rates due to variations in manufacturing, internal resistance, and temperature, which causes some cells to reach full charge or depletion before others. As a result, traditional battery management systems (BMS) cut off charging or discharging based on the weakest cell, wasting the remaining potential of other cells. This invention solves that problem through a smart system that continuously monitors and adjusts the state of charge (SOC) of each group of cells (referred to as ""strings""). The system includes a display controller (which manages operations), a charger and discharger (handling overall energy flow), and an equalizer (which precisely adjusts each string). By allocating charge and discharge intelligently across the cells, the system ensures they all reach full capacity and deplete evenly, thereby maximizing usable energy, detecting early signs of degradation, enhancing safety, and extending the overall life of the battery pack.

The second patent application, for two-wire charging and remote voltage detection, presents a streamlined method to charge a battery and measure its voltage using only two wires-significantly reducing system complexity and hardware costs. In conventional battery systems, separate wires or sensors are typically required to monitor voltage during charging, which adds material costs and design challenges, especially in large-scale applications like electric vehicles or grid storage. This invention enables both functions over the same wire pair by briefly pausing the charge current, opening a switch, and using that moment to measure the battery's voltage through the same lines. A pulse isolation drive circuit is used to manage this operation safely and reliably, even when voltage levels are floating or unstable. The result is a simplified yet highly accurate system that maintains the integrity of voltage readings while eliminating the need for redundant hardware. This two-wire approach offers a more efficient and cost-effective solution for modern battery systems that demand reliability, safety, and scalability.

The decision was agreed by the bank’s board of directors at their recent semiannual meeting in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, and was taken in response to prolonged drought conditions throughout the U.S.-Mexico border region.

“The Rio Grande River is facing severe water shortages from prolonged drought and outdated infrastructure. The two southernmost counties in Texas have declared emergencies due to dwindling supplies,” John Beckham, NADBank’s managing director, told the Rio Grande Guardian International News Service. “With the new Water Resiliency Fund, NADBank will invest in conservation and diversification projects for local, regional, and binational stakeholders, offering critical relief.”

Beckham said NADBank will welcome input from the public on the Water Resilience Fund (WRF) during a 30-day public comment period, after which the Board will consider its final approval.

Through the WRF, Beckham said, NADBank will allocate up to US$100 million in retained earnings over the next five years for concessional financing, as well as make up to US$300 million available for low-interest loans from its established lending resources. He said NADBank may also supplement these instruments with market-rate financing to further expand the reach and impact of available resources.

The creation of WRF is the latest action taken by the NADBank Board of Directors to enable the Bank to invest in infrastructure that addresses critical water shortages across the region, Beckham explained. He said that through innovative financial tools such as this fund, NADBank seeks to boost efforts that promote water conservation and diversification, as well as close infrastructure gaps in access to basic water and wastewater services.

“This approach is designed to strengthen the overall investment ecosystem and accelerate the implementation of high-priority water infrastructure projects,” Beckham said. “Available resources will be allocated equally between the U.S. and Mexico to ensure equitable distribution of support across the border region.”

Beckham also noted that “the initial phase of WRF financing is expected to prioritize projects that address urgent drought-related needs in the agriculture sector.”

The Board also held a hybrid public meeting with approximately 100 people attending in person or via videoconference. Representatives of border communities, public and private stakeholders, project developers and non-governmental organizations shared their comments on environmental issues and proposed projects for their communities.

Quaise Energy has taken a major step forward by demonstrating its new drilling technology on a full-scale oil rig just outside Houston. The company, founded only seven years ago, is now working to show that clean, renewable geothermal energy has the potential to power the world, according to CEO and co-founder Carlos Araque.

“Geothermal energy is available everywhere on massive scales,” said Araque. “If you take all fossil, all nuclear, and all other forms of renewable energy combined, they’re not even a millionth of a millionth of the thermal stores of energy below the Earth’s surface.” “It’s mind-boggling, and to get it, we only have to go down two to twelve miles. That’s how close we are to infinite clean energy no matter where you are in the world.”

Araque spoke on May 21 during the first public demonstration of the company’s drilling technology at a full-scale oil rig owned by Nabors, one of the largest oil and gas drilling companies in the world. About 50 people attended the event, including reporters, potential investors, and prospective Quaise customers. Among them were William Restrepo, CFO of Nabors and a member of Quaise’s board, and Lauren Boyd, director of the Geothermal Technologies Office at the U.S. Department of Energy.

Superhot, Superdeep

Geothermal energy—the heat beneath our feet—has existed for a long time, but it contributes very little to today’s overall energy supply. “That’s because the true geothermal resource, the one that matters, is not very accessible. Getting to it is beyond the economic reach of the conventional tool set of oil and gas,” said Araque.

The largest source of geothermal energy lies about two to 12 miles beneath the Earth’s surface, where the rock is so hot that if water could be pumped there, it would become supercritical—a steam-like phase unfamiliar to most people. (More familiar phases include liquid water, ice, and vapor.) Supercritical water can carry five to ten times more energy than regular hot water, making it an extremely efficient energy source if it could be brought to the surface and used to power turbines that generate electricity.

Currently, these deep resources are out of reach, except in rare places like Iceland where they lie closer to the surface. The main barrier is drilling. Conventional oil and gas drills cannot withstand the extreme temperatures and pressures found miles underground without costs rising dramatically with depth.

Quaise is developing an alternative approach that replaces mechanical drill bits with millimeter-wave energy, which is similar to the microwaves used in kitchens. These waves melt and then vaporize rock, allowing for the creation of increasingly deep boreholes.

Steady Progress

The May demonstration at the Nabors facility marks the latest step in what Araque describes as an aggressive timeline to validate Quaise’s drilling technology. His long-term vision is to create a renewable energy source that can compete directly with oil and gas. “This is not a company built to develop a cool drilling gadget. We aim to become a geothermal developer. Our product is not a drill bit. Our product is clean heat and energy that is abundant, reliable, and affordable on a global scale,” Araque said.

The core concept behind Quaise’s drilling method was developed at MIT over some 15 years. Researchers there proved that millimeter waves could drill through basalt, a rock type that, along with granite, makes up most of the deep subsurface. The gyrotron device that generates these millimeter waves isn’t new—it has been used for about 70 years in nuclear fusion research.

Building on that foundation, Quaise has been refining the technology to reach greater depths. At MIT, the original holes were only two inches wide and two inches deep. Earlier this year, engineers at Quaise’s Houston facility drilled a hole four inches wide and 10 feet deep.

Andres Calabressi, Head of Manufacturing at Quaise, emceed the Quaise demonstration with a microphone to communicate over the steady rumble of powerful equipment. He explained that beginning in March, the company lowered columns of granite about nine inches in diameter into a conventionally drilled hole under the rig. Together, those columns made a core some 80 feet long that sits inside a metal casing. The latter is outfitted with ports to monitor parameters like heat and pressure, data that allow the team to test recipes for optimal drilling.

The Quaise engineers then integrated the millimeter-wave technology with the rig. In the May 21 demo, they shot millimeter waves into the granite column, deepening a hole four inches in diameter that they’d already drilled to ten feet. (The next week, the team successfully drilled to 30 feet for the first time; the next goal on this phase of the work is 40 feet.)

During the demonstration, Calabressi was flanked by three large flat screens showing different dimensions of the work. One tracked key parameters like rock temperature, while another showed a video close-up of the millimeter waves melting rock. (The latter was taken previously in the Quaise lab since those interactions were not visible at the Nabors rig.)

Araque noted that the demo was “full scale in size, but not in power.” The gyrotron involved produced 100 kilowatts of power. “That’s a tenth of the power that will be commercially relevant, and is roughly equivalent to the power of the car you drove to this demonstration.”

Next month, Quaise expects the delivery of a much larger gyrotron capable of producing one megawatt of power. “That is commercially relevant. We aim to get it to the field over the next two years,” Araque said.

In the meantime, the company is preparing for another demonstration planned for July in Marble Falls, Texas. There, the team aims to drill multiple holes 130 meters (about 425 feet) deep into an actual granite outcrop for the first time. Henry Phan is Vice President of Engineering at Quaise. He explained that the Marble Falls rig will be smaller, “allowing us to be more nimble in terms of moving from one hole to another.”

Additional Advances

Quaise has also been tackling other scientific and engineering challenges associated with harvesting the energy from superhot, superdeep rock. Trenton Cladouhos, vice president of geothermal resource development at Quaise, described several of those challenges and advances toward solving them in a talk the day before the Quaise demo at the Geothermal Transition Summit North America in Houston.

Cladouhos said that Quaise is working with vendors and universities “to push them to consider higher and higher temperatures.” For example, last year a team at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédéral de Lausanne reported new insights into what happens when superhot, superdeep rock is exposed to water that can eventually transfer the rocks’ heat to the surface. The work, supported in part by Quaise, was published in the journal Nature Communications. It confirmed earlier modeling work also supported by Quaise.

In addition, Cladouhos noted that Quaise has an in-house engineer who has been working on the design of superhot geothermal power plants. Earlier this year, Senior Mechanical Engineer Daniel Dichter reported insights to that end in two papers.

Toward the Future

Araque concluded his presentation at the demo by describing the company’s blueprint for developing a superhot, superdeep geothermal resource available around the globe. It involves dividing the world into three tiers based on geothermal gradient, or how close the resource is to the surface. Tier 1, for example, will focus on relatively accessible superhot rock. This means that the first Quaise power plant will probably be located in the American West, perhaps near the Newberry Volcano site in Oregon. Newberry has a long history of geothermal exploration.

Although still a ways off, Tier III sites, which will involve drilling as much as 12 miles down, “hold the key to making superhot geothermal a truly global energy source. Tier III sites could provide power to more than 90% of humanity.”

Superhot Team

Araque described Quaise’s goal of unlocking superhot, superdeep energy for the world as “a moonshot. But it is not a moonshot.” The people working to “pioneer this transformative approach to clean energy have transitioned from careers in oil, gas, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion,” and all have histories of achievement.

For example, several were involved in the invention and development of Manara, a production and reservoir management solution developed at Schlumberger to substantially increase the recovery of oil from complex production systems. And among them, Quaise team members hold several patents.

“So I’m confident that together we can make this work,” Araque concludes.

The initiative aimed at raising environmental awareness and encouraging responsible practices, culminated in a special event at Hindon Honda, Ghaziabad, in the presence of HMSI’s senior leadership including Mr. Sheshank Razdan, General Manger, Regional Business Central and Mr. Ravikumar Annasaheb Firagannavar, General Manger, Regional Business Central-Customer Service.

This year’s World Environment Day theme, ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’ shaped the direction of the on-ground activities. As part of the week-long celebration, HMSI’s dealerships and service outlets across India actively engaged with customers and local communities.

Key activities included distribution of saplings to all customers visiting at dealership, awareness campaigns on the harmful impact of plastic pollution and 1,25,000 tree plantation drives across multiple cities and towns. Free Pollution Under Control (PUC) check-up camps were also conducted to promote cleaner and more efficient vehicle usage.

In its 25th year of operations in India, HMSI has reached a significant production milestone, crossing 70 million units of cumulative production since the start of local manufacturing in 2001. This milestone contributes to Honda’s achievement of cumulative global production of motorcycles which has reached 500 million units, since 1949.

As the production scales, HMSI remains aligned with Honda’s global vision of realising zero environmental impact not only with its products, but throughout the entire product lifecycle including all corporate activities, through its Triple Action to ZERO initiative focusing on carbon neutrality, clean energy and resource circulation.

The company continues to strengthen operational efficiencies while promoting cleaner technologies and manufacturing processes across its facilities. The Environment Week initiative highlights the role of collective participation- from customers and dealers to employees and leadership- in shaping a cleaner, greener tomorrow.

These efforts were designed to create grassroot impact, reinforcing the message that even small, everyday actions can contribute meaningfully to environmental health. The event brought together HMSI associates and local representatives for a tree plantation drive and an employee awareness session which focussed on integrating sustainability into workplace and community practices.

In parallel to these on-ground efforts, HMSI continues to integrate sustainability into its operations. The company’s third factory in Narsapura, Karnataka currently meets 98% of its energy requirements through renewable sources. Across all manufacturing locations, HMSI is expanding its capability to source over half of its total energy needs from renewable inputs.

To reduce dependency on freshwater sources and promote long-term environmental resilience, HMSI continues its journey toward water conservation by adopting advanced rainwater harvesting techniques at all its factories. The Third factory at Narsapura (Bangalore) meets its maximum water requirements through rainwater alone. All four manufacturing plants operate as Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) facilities.

All HMSI plants have been awarded the prestigious GreenCo World Class rating, achieving Platinum and Platinum plus levels. The company has also received several national accolades, including the National Energy and Water Awards, in recognition of its unwavering commitment to sustainability.

With both on-ground and long-term investments in clean manufacturing, HMSI’s celebration highlights a broader approach to supporting a sustainable future through awareness, action and innovation.

Trump's Bill Would End EV Subsidies: Is Rivian in Trouble?","Key Points

Rivian is prepared to grow sales significantly regardless of tax incentives.

But eliminating tax incentives could have an odd effect on Rivian's competitiveness.

10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›

Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) has a very promising future. Starting in early 2026, management expects to start production of three new affordable electric vehicles (EVs). Making affordable EVs priced under $50,000 is a huge milestone for an automaker. When Tesla released its affordable Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, sales boomed. Today, those two vehicles account for more than 90% of Tesla's auto sales.

Some recent news, however, could be a giant blow to Rivian's growth plans. President Donald Trump's new bill proposes cutting federal EV tax credits, which would make electric vehicles $4,000 to $7,500 more expensive to buyers. How much will Rivian suffer? The answer might surprise you.

Rivian can afford to reach its next growth catalyst

Many investors are looking over electric car stocks to find the next Tesla. It's a worthy mission. Tesla shares have risen 23,000% in value since 2010. What's the key to spotting the next Tesla? Look for companies that can launch affordable models priced under $50,000. As mentioned, reaching this milestone creates a gigantic growth catalyst, making the automakers' models affordable to tens of millions of new buyers.

Right now, Rivian is right on track. After releasing two luxury models with premium price tags -- very similar to what Tesla achieved with its Model S and Model X vehicles -- Rivian is preparing to start production of three new affordable models: the R2, R3, and R3X. Production is slated to begin in early 2026, but I'm not expecting full production of all three models until 2027 or 2028. Still, there's no doubt that Rivian is prepared to hit its biggest growth milestone in years. With $4.7 billion in cash on the books, plus a deal with Volkswagen that could deliver several more billion dollars in capital, Rivian looks like it has the means to get these vehicles to market. That will allow sales to surge, and also provide significantly more operational leverage, likely improving profit margins.

Regardless of whether the EV tax credits are eliminated, Rivian has the capital to reach this growth catalyst, meaning sales growth should be expected whatever the future brings. Right now, Rivian's vehicles are priced between $70,000 and $100,000 depending on the exact package. If the company can price three new vehicles under the $50,000 mark, that makes its lineup significantly more affordable even without a tax incentive. In fact, eliminating the EV tax credit could end up helping Rivian long-term.

Could the Trump bill actually help Rivian?

It should be stressed that Trump's bill to eliminate EV tax credits is only a bill right now. It has a long way yet to becoming law. But if these eliminations are put into place, expect EV demand to drop over the near term. EVs are already struggling to maintain cost competitiveness versus gas or diesel engines. Adding $4,000 to $7,500 to the final cost should eliminate many potential buyers, especially those seeking long-term cost savings. Rivian also generates ""free"" income by selling automotive regulatory credits -- a major factor in the company achieving positive gross margins in recent quarters. Like Tesla, however, most of these credits are earned by state programs like California's, making them unlikely to be cut anytime soon.

The important thing to note here is that most North American automakers don't yet have an affordable electric vehicle on the market, though most are trying. Consider Lucid Group, which aims to release several new mass market vehicles over the coming years. The company has less than $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet, and will almost certainly need more capital to get these cars to market. If its existing luxury models become even more expensive, that could lower demand and access to capital, making it harder for the company to actually get its affordable models to market. It's very possible the company could face severe financial uncertainty should these tax incentives be eliminated.

Rivian, meanwhile, is already profitable on a gross margin basis, unlike Lucid, though it does partially rely on federal automotive regulatory credits to achieve this.. It's also much further along in the development of its affordable models than Lucid, making it much more likely it actually gets these models to market. If other competitors struggle financially due to lower EV tax incentives, it's possible Rivian could gain long-term. However, it should be noted that over the short term, Rivian should take a direct demand hit.

The result is a mixed bag for Rivian. Demand would fall near-term due to higher costs for consumers. But a lessening of competition and investment by peers like Lucid Group could open up more long-term market share.

According to the Liberal government’s own estimate, as of April 2023 it had spent or committed over $200 billion of taxpayers’ money to 149 government programs addressing climate change.

In terms of the primary goal of this spending, reducing Canada’s industrial greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030, the latest available government data from 2023 shows emissions were just 8.5% below 2005 levels.

Achieving the Liberals’ 2030 target will require the equivalent of eliminating all annual emissions from Canada’s transportation and building sectors in seven years, which would inevitably cause a massive recession.

When environmental commissioner Jerry V. DeMarco audited 20 of the government’s 149 programs, he found fewer than half were on track to achieve their goals and of 32 additional measures the government claimed would assist in reaching the 2030 target, only seven were new.

His audit uncovered examples where two different government programs were funding the same projects and reporting the same expected emission cuts, raising the possibility of double counting.

DeMarco said the government’s lack of transparency in reporting emissions made it impossible for the average citizen to understand its claims.

The computer modelling used to estimate emissions was also out of date and “recent decreases to projected 2030 emissions were not due to climate action taken by governments, but were instead because of revisions to the data used in modelling.”

DeMarco noted that aside from falling far short of its emission targets, Canada has the worst record of reducing emissions of any member of the G7, including the U.S.

The U.S. has cut emissions at almost double Canada’s rate, without imposing a national carbon tax.

In terms of getting value for money, auditor general Karen Hogan reported last year that in one of the government’s 149 climate programs – the now-disbanded $1-billion Sustainable Development Technology Fund – there were 90 cases where conflict-of-interest rules were ignored in awarding $76 million worth of government contracts and 10 cases where $56 million was awarded to ineligible projects.

DeMarco reported last week that despite spending over $6.6 billion on government programs to help Canadians adapt to more severe weather caused by climate change since 2015, the Liberals’ national adaptation strategy, released in 2023, lacked essential elements to make it effective and progress since then has been slow.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux last year estimated the cost of government subsidies to Canada’s auto sector to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries at up to $52.5 billion on 13 major projects – $31.4 billion, or 60%, paid by federal taxpayers and $21.1 billion, or 40%, paid by provincial taxpayers in Ontario and Quebec.

That’s $6.3 billion more than the announced investments of $46.1 billion the auto sector is contributing to these projects, with many now delayed due to slower than anticipated EV sales.

While Canada’s employment rate and economic growth are influenced by many factors, the Liberals have repeatedly promised since coming to power in 2015 that government spending on their climate policies would lead to significant increases in jobs and economic growth, which has not been the case.

Statistics Canada reported earlier this month that Canada’s unemployment rate rose to 7% in May, the highest it’s been since September 2016, excluding the 2020 and 2021 pandemic years, and a 12.9% increase from 6.2% a year ago in May.

When DeMarco reported in 2023 on the Liberals’ so-called “just transition” plan to assist energy sector workers to retrain for Canada’s new green economy, he concluded it didn’t exist, despite the government having promised it in 2019.

“We found that as Canada shifts focus to low-carbon alternatives, the government is not prepared to provide appropriate support to … workers in the fossil fuel sector,” DeMarco said.

“The transition was being handled on a business-as-usual basis, relying on existing program mechanisms such as the employment insurance program to deliver support.”

(Eventually the Liberals passed what they called the Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act in 2024, with many of these concerns still outstanding.)

In terms of economic growth, Statistics Canada reported earlier this year that Canada’s real GDP per capita, which measures economic output per person, adjusted for inflation, and is a widely accepted metric for measuring the standard of living, fell by 1.4% in 2024, following a decline of 1.3% in 2023.

Over its near-decade in power, Canada’s economic growth under the Liberals has been the lowest since the government of R.B. Bennett during the Great Depression.

As the country strives to meet its ambitious targets, integrating energy storage solutions and smart grid technologies is becoming increasingly vital.

1. Solar energy storage: A critical enabler

Energy storage systems (ESS) are essential for addressing the intermittent nature of solar power. They store excess energy generated during peak sunlight hours and release it during periods of low generation or high demand, ensuring a stable and reliable power supply.

Recent developments

Delhi’s 20-MW Battery Energy Storage System: In a significant move, Delhi inaugurated South Asia’s largest 20-MW ESS at the BRPL substation in Kilokari. This system, capable of delivering 40 MWh, will provide four hours of reliable power daily, benefiting over 100,000 residents in south Delhi’s densely populated Kilokari area. The lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology ensures thermal stability, safety, and durability, operating efficiently under Delhi’s varied climates.

Kerala’s Battery Storage Initiative: The Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission (KSERC) has set a 12-year lifespan for standalone ESS and introduced a streamlined registration process for renewable energy projects. This move aims to enhance the efficiency and adoption of ESS in the state.

Policy support

The Indian government has recognised the importance of ESS in the renewable energy sector:

Mandatory Co-location of ESS with Solar Projects: The Ministry of Power has mandated that all renewable energy implementing agencies and state utilities incorporate a minimum of two-hour co-located ESS, equivalent to 10 per cent of the installed solar project capacity, in future solar tenders. This requirement aims to mitigate intermittency issues and provide critical support during peak demand periods. The government expects around 14 GW/28 GWh of storage to be installed by 2030.

Financial Incentives: The government has allocated INR 19,500 crore for solar PV modules in the 2024 Union budget, a 143 per cent increase from the previous year. Additionally, a 10 per cent customs duty on solar glass imports is set to commence in October 2024, with exemptions for certain components to encourage domestic manufacturing.

2. Smart grids: The backbone of modern energy systems

Smart grids integrate digital technology into the electricity network, enabling real-time monitoring, control, and optimisation of the generation, distribution, and consumption of electricity. They play a crucial role in accommodating the variable nature of solar energy and enhancing grid resilience.

Key initiatives

Lakshadweep decarbonisation plan: The Central Electricity Authority is preparing a comprehensive decarbonisation strategy for the Lakshadweep islands, incorporating renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, along with ESS, to ensure efficient energy storage and reliability.

Gujarat hybrid renewable energy park: Under construction in Kutch district, this park aims to be the world’s largest hybrid renewable energy park, generating 30 GW from solar panels and wind turbines. The integration of smart grid technologies will facilitate efficient energy distribution and management across the vast area.

Challenges and solutions

Grid infrastructure: The existing grid infrastructure in many parts of India is outdated and ill-equipped to handle the influx of decentralised solar power. Upgrading and modernising the grid is essential to accommodate the growing share of renewable energy.

Data management: Smart grids generate vast amounts of data that need to be processed and analysed in real time. Investing in advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence can enhance decision-making and grid optimisation.

The road ahead

India’s commitment to expanding its solar energy capacity is evident in its policies and initiatives. The integration of ESS and smart grid technologies is pivotal to achieving a reliable, efficient, and sustainable energy system. Continued investment in infrastructure, technology, and human capital will be crucial in realising the full potential of solar energy in India",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/06/14/Kamini-Gupta-Communication-Manager-AXITEC-Energy-India-Pvt.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 17:04:25.425906

The investment confirmed in the Spending Review is a major boost to the UK’s ambitions to become a clean energy superpower and to support industrial regions including Teesside, Merseyside, the Humber and Scotland.

The development of a hydrogen transport and storage network is essential for building a UK-wide market, connecting production with end users such as power stations and industrial clusters. This infrastructure is the foundation for scaling up both hydrogen produced with carbon capture and hydrogen produced with electrolysis, and for repurposing much of the UK’s existing natural gas infrastructure.

Today’s funding can help unlock long-term secure jobs in manufacturing, engineering, and the wider energy supply chain. OEUK’s members are already investing in carbon capture and hydrogen projects that could support thousands of skilled roles across the country, particularly in places where economic renewal is needed most.

But to make hydrogen competitive, early investments must be supported by a clear regulatory framework and investable business models.

That’s why OEUK is now calling on government to work with industry to ensure this funding has the best possible impact and accelerates enabling policies that reduce costs and de-risk private investment

Hydrogen will play a vital role in decarbonising sectors such as steel, glass, ceramics, and refining but it will only succeed if a stable market is created that attracts investors.

OEUK is ready to work with government and industry partners to deliver the next phase, turning this funding into real-world jobs, projects, and progress toward net zero.

Commenting, OEUK’s Head of Energy Policy, Enrique Cornejo, said:

'If we are serious about getting to net zero hydrogen must be a key piece of the puzzle for decarbonising heavy industry, power, and enabling energy storage but it must be made affordable and attractive to the companies that need to bring it to life.

'Because it is expensive the government is right to focus deployment in sectors where it offers most value. For hydrogen to become competitive there must be cost reductions which will only be achieved if we initiate early investments and learn from them.

'Developing a strong hydrogen sector is critical to our industrial future, and the UK’s oil and gas supply chain has the skills and capabilities to accelerate progress.'

Currently about $1.2 billion a year goes toward ocean protection globally.
Activists have been pushing the French government to announce a ban on bottom trawling in its marine protected areas.
This falls short of an existing European Union goal of placing 10 percent of its waters under “strict protection,” without commercial fishing of any kind.
John Kerry, the former special presidential envoy for climate under President Biden, said he didn’t know what role the United States would play in ocean protection now.","Remote coral atolls in the Caribbean. Habitat for threatened sharks and rays around a Tanzanian island in the Indian Ocean. And 900,000 square kilometers of the Pacific Ocean around French Polynesia.

These are some of the millions of acres of water now set aside as part of an international goal to protect 30 percent of the ocean by 2030. More than 20 new marine protected areas were announced at the third United Nations Ocean Conference, which ended on Friday in France.

Countries and territories pledging new areas included Chile; Colombia; French Polynesia; Portugal; Samoa; Sao Tome and Principe; the Solomon Islands; Tanzania; and Vanuatu.

“Protecting the ocean is beginning to become fashionable,” said Sylvia Earle, a marine biologist and oceanographer who served as chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the 1990s, at an event celebrating a network of protected areas around the Azores.

The new designations come at a time when the United States, which sent only two observers to the conference, has moved to reopen the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument to commercial fishing. The country is also seeking to unilaterally authorize mining of the seafloor in international waters.

France, which hosted the conference with Costa Rica, pushed for a moratorium on deep sea mining, with four new countries pledging their support this week, bringing the total to 37 countries.

Less than 3 percent of the ocean is currently fully protected from “extractive” activities like commercial fishing and mining, according to the Marine Protection Atlas.

In order to reach the goal, the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement, also known as the High Seas Treaty, needs to be enforced with at least 60 countries ratifying it. At the conference, 19 new countries ratified the treaty, bringing the total to 50 individual countries plus the European Union. Once active, the treaty would provide a pathway toward protecting stretches of the ocean beyond individual countries’ borders.

And in coastal waters within those borders, much remains to be done. A study published in May found that the average marine protected area today is about 10 square kilometers, meaning about 188,000 more areas of that size are needed — or 85 new marine protected areas a day.

These numbers are “super daunting,” said the report’s lead author Kristin Rechberger, who is chief executive of the conservation organization Dynamic Planet. She wants countries to break through the challenge by decentralizing marine protection and allowing coastal communities to create their own small protected areas at a faster pace.

A separate report published last week found that countries need to raise $15.8 billion a year in order to protect 30 percent of the ocean. Currently about $1.2 billion a year goes toward ocean protection globally.

Questions also remain about how meaningful existing protections are.

Activists have been pushing the French government to announce a ban on bottom trawling in its marine protected areas. President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would place 4 percent of its mainland waters under “strong protection,” limiting bottom trawling, a fishing process that drags nets along the seafloor. This falls short of an existing European Union goal of placing 10 percent of its waters under “strict protection,” without commercial fishing of any kind.

“Allowing destructive bottom trawling in most of France’s so-called ‘protected’ areas makes a mockery of ocean protection,” said Alexandra Cousteau, senior adviser to Oceana and granddaughter of the ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, in a written statement. “It’s like building a fence around a forest and then bulldozing it anyway.”

Even where protections from commercial fishing exist around the world, enforcement is often lacking.

Zafer Kizilkaya, president of the Mediterranean Conservation Society, has worked with local fishing communities to create and patrol a marine protected area at Gokova Bay in Turkey, allowing endangered monk seals to return. Community members — including former fishers — serve as marine rangers, reporting illegal commercial fishing to the Turkish Coast Guard, which follows up with fines.

Mr. Kizilkaya is not seeking greater percentages of protected marine areas at this point, but rather “serious enforcement and management,” he said. “That will make a huge difference.”

The United States did not send an official delegation to the conference. Two representatives from the the administration’s Environmental Advisory Task Force, including Ed Russo, the chairman, attended as what the State Department called “government observers.”

The day before the conference began, Mr. Russo wrote an opinion piece in Time magazine with Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce and owner of Time, outlining ideas for a “focused, global effort to restore coral reefs.”

“We believe that addressing coral-reef health is a smart place to focus — not because it is the only crisis,” they wrote, “but because it offers a clear, actionable, achievable goal that can unite governments and ocean advocates.”

Mr. Russo and Mr. Benioff did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Russo is chief executive of RussKap Water, president of the Florida Keys Environmental Coalition and a board member of Reef Relief.

Mr. Benioff, who during the first Trump administration raised Republican support for an initiative to plant a trillion trees, has funded a center for marine conservation called the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Salesforce was a major sponsor of the U.N. ocean conference’s publicly accessible exhibits.

Highly treated wastewater has been pumped up from Lake and Sonoma counties to injection wells over the past decades to recharge that steam reservoir.
Because of depletion of that reservoir and concerns from environmental regulators about dangerous gases emerging from deep underground, some wells have been closed and steam production at some remaining wells has declined.
GreenFire officials said the results signal the system’s scalability to other low-output wells, a major step forward in revitalizing aging geothermal infrastructure.
Sonoma Clean Power has been spearheading a GeoZone program to attract next-generation geothermal projects to the North Bay.","California’s goal of producing more round-the-clock power from The Geysers may be in reach, as a demonstration there of next-generation geothermal energy technology has become operational and is said to be generating promising early results.

The project is part of a multipronged effort to increase electrical output for the North Bay and throughout California from what’s still the world’s largest geothermal energy field despite declining steam production at the plants in the Mayacamas range between Sonoma and Lake counties.

Oklahoma City-based GreenFire Energy last month announced that its first commercial demonstration system, installed in a low-output well at The Geysers, is now fully operational. The well, previously nearing idle status, is producing sustained flow rates of 300–350 gallons per minute with unexpectedly high-output temperatures of 310 degrees Fahrenheit, all within a closed-loop system.

GreenFire’s patented “GreenLoop” system relies on pipe-enclosed fluid that goes down into the well cool, gets heated then comes back up to release the heat into a electricity-generation system. This fluid has a lower boiling point than water, requiring less heat to produce steam.

Such closed-loop systems don’t rely on groundwater to infiltrate the hot rock to be turned into steam and captured at the surface. Highly treated wastewater has been pumped up from Lake and Sonoma counties to injection wells over the past decades to recharge that steam reservoir.

Because of depletion of that reservoir and concerns from environmental regulators about dangerous gases emerging from deep underground, some wells have been closed and steam production at some remaining wells has declined.

Generation at The Geysers peaked at about 2 gigawatts in 1987 and has been between 600 and 700 megawatts in recent years. A megawatt powers about 1,000 typical homes.

“This is a breakthrough — not just for our team, but for the future of geothermal,” said Rob Klenner, president of GreenFire Energy, in the announcement. “We’re delivering on our promises to show how next-gen technology can provide high-performance power with real commercial applications.”

The company’s stated goal is to bring 150 megawatts of geothermal capacity online by 2030, targeting sectors from manufacturing to data centers.

The Geysers project — hosted by Calpine Corporation subsidiary Geysers Power Company at its Bear Canyon Unit 2 plant in Lake County — is designed to test how efficient the energy transfer can be between the hot well and the loop liquid while preserving water mass in the steam-dominated reservoir.

Calpine and GreenFire didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Funded in part by a $2.7 million California Energy Commission grant, the demonstration includes two completed seven-day production tests and a nearly finished steady-state performance test. GreenFire officials said the results signal the system’s scalability to other low-output wells, a major step forward in revitalizing aging geothermal infrastructure.

GreenFire’s success arrives at a pivotal time. Sonoma Clean Power has been spearheading a GeoZone program to attract next-generation geothermal projects to the North Bay. GeoZone is a partnership with local counties and three energy company developers to create a renewable energy development zone focused on geothermal and other clean sources to serve Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake counties.

""We're trying to make California the place that developments can drive forward fastest,"" said Miles Horton, legislative policy and community engagement manager for the power agency.

The agency is backing two key bills aimed at creating a more competitive regulatory environment. Assembly Bill 527 would provide California Environmental Quality Act exemptions for geothermal exploration. AB 531 would allow geothermal projects of any size to use a streamlined permitting process, while the current cutoff is for plants above 50 megawatts.

""We have the demand here in California for clean baseload power,"" Horton said.

The ultimate goal remains expanding geothermal capacity by 600 megawatts in The Geysers, which Horton compared to 2 gigawatts of solar production capacity because it generates whether the sun is shinging or not.

“The House bill introduces provisions that would effectively kill tax credits for clean and advanced manufacturing by making them unusable and sunsetting them early.” Naturally, when you kill the tax credits, you kill projects, you kill jobs, and you kill whole companies.
Just directly influenced manufacturing jobs alone, the bill puts nearly 300,000 jobs at risk.
“Additionally, the brief finds that in several states the manufacturing sector is at the precipice of massive growth under the tax credits,” the BlueGreen Alliance states.
“With the tax credits in place, New Mexico, Nevada, and Georgia could all see manufacturing employment grow more than 10%.","For the past few weeks — or months — we’ve been covering the risks of Congress and Donald Trump repealing the the Clean Manufacturing Tax Credits from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In the past week, now that a Republican House bill repealing them has been passed to the Senate, a number of reports and press statements have come out highlighting how many jobs could be lost in different sectors and how much economic harm the repeals could do. Now we’ve got another big one to share.

The analysis from the BlueGreen Alliance shows that “more than two million jobs across the manufacturing employment footprint are at risk if the budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives becomes law,” the Alliance writes. “The House bill introduces provisions that would effectively kill tax credits for clean and advanced manufacturing by making them unusable and sunsetting them early.” Naturally, when you kill the tax credits, you kill projects, you kill jobs, and you kill whole companies.

Just directly influenced manufacturing jobs alone, the bill puts nearly 300,000 jobs at risk. Then, another one million plus indirect jobs related to the supply chains of these factories are also at risk. Going further (because that’s how the economy work), another ~643,000 induced jobs are also at risk. Therefore, in total, more than 2 million jobs are determined to be at risk.

Regarding the direct job losses, the Alliance notes: “These numbers are drawn directly from company announcements and exclude job creation connected to projects that have already been cancelled.”

Perhaps 2 million isn’t the actual number in reality. Perhaps some mistakes were made in the analysis. But, even if that was the case, without a doubt, numerous jobs will be lost. The economic harm will be immense.

“These numbers make it even more clear, if this bill becomes law, workers are the ones who will pay the price,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “As this administration blusters about its support for American manufacturing, this bill tells an extremely different story, openly selling out workers to pay for a billionaire tax break.”

The BlueGreen Alliance also highlighted that there are seven states that have more than 100,000 jobs at risk from the Republican bill. Those are a mixture of “blue” and “red” states: California, Georgia, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee, Arizona, and South Carolina. “Notably, President Trump won five of those seven states with the greatest number of jobs at stake in the 2024 election,” the BlueGreen Alliance adds. Here are more details on how those numbers break down:

California – 329,131

Georgia – 258,517

Michigan – 226,610

Tennessee – 140,985

Illinois – 138,214

South Carolina – 135,510

Arizona – 100,170

Manufacturing facilities aren’t built overnight. They require long-term planning and development. With Inflation Reduction Act only passed about two and a half years ago, we’re still at the baby stages of what could be created from it. Unfortunately, that also means that, because the big positive effects haven’t sprouted yet, it’s easier for Republicans to stomp on the seeds and prevent factories and jobs from being created rather than trying to shut them down in future years.

“Additionally, the brief finds that in several states the manufacturing sector is at the precipice of massive growth under the tax credits,” the BlueGreen Alliance states. “With the tax credits in place, New Mexico, Nevada, and Georgia could all see manufacturing employment grow more than 10%. Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia could all see at least a 5% boost. Without the credits, that future is uncertain.”

To close, the Alliance puts out one more appeal for common sense, just as more than a dozen Republicans in the House have done (despite also letting the bill get to the Senate as it is). “The job-creating track record of the clean manufacturing tax credits is undeniable and the changes to them included in the House bill threatens all of that progress,” said BlueGreen Alliance Vice President of Manufacturing and Industrial Policy Ted Fertik. “Every bit of data shows clearly that repealing these credits will hurt working Americans. We hope the Senate will see reason and reverse these damaging provisions.”

It just doesn’t make sense that one of our major political parties would be so adamant about hurting the US cleantech industry and economy, but that’s where we are thanks to the party being slaves to the fossil fuel industry.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BlueGreen-Alliance-budget-bill-job-losses.png,N,,2025-06-14 16:06:17.744922

In 2022, solar energy offset over 140 million metric tons of CO₂ globally.
A single home solar system prevents around 3 tons of CO₂ every year.
In Q2 2024, solar power cost was 3–6 cents per kWh—cheaper than coal or gas.
About AM Global Solar AM Global Solar, based in the U.S., helps homes and businesses go solar.","In the U.S., the top reason people choose solar is to save money. A study from Ohio State found that cost savings are the biggest driver for homeowners choosing solar. On average, U.S. households save about $1,500 a year with solar power. Over time, that adds up to tens of thousands of dollars.

For example, if panels cost $18,000, a $1,500 annual saving means a system may pay for itself in 6 to 8 years. After that, those savings go straight to your wallet.

Ways Solar Lowers Costs:

Reduces or eliminates electricity bills

Locks in stable energy prices

Benefits from net metering—selling extra power back to the grid

Tax Credits and Incentives

Federal and state programs make solar more affordable. The U.S. offers a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) under the Inflation Reduction Act. That means if your system costs $20,000, you could get a $6,000 tax credit.

Some states add extra rebates. California even allows solar systems to be exempt from property tax and offers fast permits. Common costs and incentives are shown below:

Cost Item Amount Benefit System cost $3–6 per watt 20-year lifespan Federal ITC 30% Reduces upfront costs Average annual savings $1,500 Up to 50% off energy bills

Solar Helps the Environment

Solar power creates clean energy and helps cut carbon pollution. In 2022, solar energy offset over 140 million metric tons of CO₂ globally. In the U.S., it now provides more than 40% of new electricity capacity.

A single home solar system prevents around 3 tons of CO₂ every year. Think of it as planting 100 trees annually.

Energy Independence and Grid Safety

The U.S. power grid faces aging equipment and extreme weather. Solar panels, along with battery storage, give homeowners more control. They reduce reliance on the grid. They also protect against blackouts and rising energy prices.

Adding battery storage means you have power at night or during storms. That builds energy independence.

Solar Industry Growth

Solar is booming in America. The U.S. had 239 GW of solar capacity by the end of 2024—enough to power millions of homes. In 2024, solar plants added 37 GW and utilities plan 26 GW more in 2025.

Even though federal incentives may change, experts say solar will still grow. Growth may slow, but it’s expected to bounce back as electricity becomes more expensive.

Community Solar: For Everyone

Not everyone can put panels on their roof. Community solar is changing that. It lets renters and low-income people share a local solar project. Many states support this model

Connects 6.5 GW of solar in 2024 (enough for millions of homes)

Credits appear on your bill

Helps renters and those with shaded roofs

This model is growing fast and helps build clean energy access for everyone.

Future Outlook

Experts expect solar to grow even more. The National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) says solar could supply 40% of U.S. electricity by 2035. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) foresees big solar capacity additions in the next two years.

As solar prices drop and technology improves, it gets cheaper. In Q2 2024, solar power cost was 3–6 cents per kWh—cheaper than coal or gas.

He stated the aim to increase U.S. nuclear energy capacity from 100GW to 400GW by 2050 to help the U.S. become a global leader in nuclear energy.
However, as the U.S. relies heavily on nuclear fuel imports from Russia, it could limit the speed of expansion unless it can ramp up its domestic nuclear fuel production capabilities.
Following Trump’s announcement of his ambitious nuclear power aims, the U.S. nuclear fuel company Centrus Energy Corp. said that the domestic supply of enriched uranium must increase to ensure the future of U.S. nuclear energy.
The firm has an enrichment plant in Ohio that it expects could eventually provide a significant portion of the U.S. nuclear fuel demand.","One non-fossil fuel energy source that Trump is backing is nuclear power. The U.S. President recently announced plans to quadruple the U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050. However, several challenges must be overcome to meet this target. Firstly, building a new nuclear plant can take a decade or more, meaning that operators would have to apply for permits for new projects now to get them up and running in the coming decades. In addition, the U.S. continues to rely heavily on Russia for its Uranium, despite having introduced heavy sanctions on the country’s energy sector in response to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. would need to seek an alternative supply of enriched uranium, or significantly increase its domestic production, to fuel its power plants.

In May, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders entitled Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base, Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy and Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. He stated the aim to increase U.S. nuclear energy capacity from 100GW to 400GW by 2050 to help the U.S. become a global leader in nuclear energy. He tasked the Department of Energy (DoE) with prioritising work “with the nuclear energy industry to facilitate 5 GW of power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and have 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030”. Trump also said that license decisions on the construction and operation of new reactors should be delivered in no more than 18 months.

However, as the U.S. relies heavily on nuclear fuel imports from Russia, it could limit the speed of expansion unless it can ramp up its domestic nuclear fuel production capabilities. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), In 2023, U.S. nuclear generators used 32 million pounds of imported uranium concentrate (U3O8) and only 0.05 million pounds of domestically produced U3O8. Imports contributed around 99% of the U3O8 used in the U.S. that year, mainly coming from Canada, Australia, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.

In 2023, around 27 percent of the enriched uranium used in U.S. nuclear power plants came from Russia. However, in May 2024, the U.S. banned the import of uranium products from Russia beginning in August, although companies can apply for waivers through January 1, 2028. In addition to cutting ties with Russia, the recent introduction of sweeping tariffs on imports from various countries around the globe could further hinder the country’s uranium supply chain.

As the U.S. moves away from a dependence on Russian energy, it has looked to other countries to fill the gap. Canada now contributes around 40 percent of the U.S. nuclear fuel supply, and the introduction of 10 percent tariffs on its northern neighbour could hinder this trade link. To mitigate the risk of slowing U.S. nuclear expansion due to a shortage of uranium, the U.S. must rapidly expand its domestic production capacity or face the consequences.

Following Trump’s announcement of his ambitious nuclear power aims, the U.S. nuclear fuel company Centrus Energy Corp. said that the domestic supply of enriched uranium must increase to ensure the future of U.S. nuclear energy. The firm’s CEO Amir Vexler said, “There’s barely enough Western enrichment, if at all, to satisfy existing operating plants… If the nuclear industry is to add all this generation capacity, there will have to be a tremendous amount of enrichment capacity that’s added.” Vexler added, “We don’t have any domestic fuel cycle capacity, almost at all… We don’t mine anything, we don’t convert anything. We don’t enrich anything. We rely on others. And others are all state-owned enterprises, maybe with a few minor exceptions.”

At present, France’s Orano and the British-Dutch-German consortium Urenco dominate Western enrichment capacity. While these suppliers have been historically reliable, the worsening trade war between the U.S. and the rest of the world is fuelling greater uncertainty and disrupting supply chains. Urenco owns the only domestic enrichment facility in the U.S. However, Centrus hopes to soon change this.

Centrus is the only company other than Urenco licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to produce low-enriched uranium in the U.S. The firm has an enrichment plant in Ohio that it expects could eventually provide a significant portion of the U.S. nuclear fuel demand. Commercial operations have not yet been launched at the plant, which focuses primarily on producing a small amount of fuel for advanced reactors, known as high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, which it sells to the DoE for use in nuclear projects.

Scaling up operations to produce the more widely used low-enriched uranium, or LEU, will require some level of government support, according to Centrus. Vexler explained, “We’ve always said that it has to be a public-private partnership.” He added, “We’ve been raising our own funds. We’ve been raising our own financing. We will contribute significantly to this, but we have to have government support.”

President Trump is following in his predecessor’s footsteps with strong nuclear ambitions. However, achieving his nuclear power capacity increase target will require high levels of investment in the sector, as well as a more streamlined approach to licensing and a significant increase in the domestic production of enriched nuclear fuel.

This week, we’re focusing on how Audi is negotiating the twists and turns on the way to an electrified future.

EVs are here to stay at Audi, but a gasoline crossover SUV is still the automaker’s bestselling model, and it’s not ready to risk those sales just yet. That’s why the 2025 Audi Q5 received a top-to-bottom overhaul for this model year, bringing its tech features and styling up to date without altering the what has proven to be a very popular package. By maintaining parallel lineups of electric and internal-combustion cars, Audi hopes to give customers more choices. But that doesn’t completely level the playing field.

The new Q5 may have yesterday’s powertrain, but Audi isn’t holding back on tech. It features the same electrical architecture, operating system, and three-screen dashboard display as the latest Audi EVs, like the Q6 e-tron. So aside from a little engine noise, there’s little difference in what you can see and interact with from the driver’s seat.

It’s not just the infotainment systems. The Q5 and Q6 e-tron are close in size, with similar space for passengers across their two rows of seats. The Q6 e-tron has a bit more cargo space, but not as much as you’d think given the lack of a bulky engine, transmission, and driveshafts. The two SUVs also have similar styling but, having now driven both, we can say that the Q5 is the more pleasant of the two.

More than a difference of powertrain tech

The interiors may look similar, but the materials used in the Q5 felt nicer to the touch. And the gasoline SUV had a much more refined chassis, with crisper handling and plusher ride quality, than its EV counterpart. The base Q5 is also quicker than a base Q6 e-tron in a straight line (quicker versions of the EV are available), although the rough shifts from our test car’s dual-clutch transmission had us missing the smoother acceleration of an EV, even if it took a few more tenths of a second to reach 60 mph.

There’s also more differentiation between the Q5 and its sportier SQ5 counterpart than the Q6 e-tron and the SQ6 e-tron. The latter didn’t do much to justify its price premium over base models, but the SQ5 at least had a somewhat more vivacious character. The e-tron GT proves that Audi knows how to build a sporty EV, and there are plenty of other examples like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. But these SUVs show that it’s harder to build that level of differentiation into a mid-range electric offering like Audi’s “S” models than more extensively-engineered performance EVs.

And while some EVs have closed the price gap with combustion models, the Q6 e-tron’s $65,095 base price is a big step up from the $53,795 starting price of a Q5. Audi has done a great job of maintain parity on tech and features between gasoline and electric models, but that means the Q6 e-tron will likely appeal mainly to brand loyalists who specifically want an EV. It’s hard to imagine many powertrain-agonistic customers choosing it after driving a Q5 — or looking at its window sticker.

Policy uncertainty has automakers hedging their bets

Audi’s approach is typical of the current moment, though. In the United States, at least, automakers are settling into holding pattern on EV adoption as they look to balance unpredictable rates of EV sales and the fallout from Trump Administration policies with the need to capitalize on investments already made in EV production.

The industry is currently holding its breath as the Trump Administration undertakes a trade war with China that could affect the supply of rare earth minerals that are a key part of the EV supply chain. Automotive News reported earlier this week that automakers were “in full panic” over the rare earth situation. A framework was reportedly reached later in the week, but that’s subject to further negotiation and potential future reversals by the mercurial U.S. president.

Trump’s policies are ostensibly aimed at bringing more auto manufacturing back to the U.S., but as another big piece of news from this week shows, that doesn’t necessarily benefit EVs. General Motors announced that it would task its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan to build gasoline SUVs and pickup trucks, rather than the EVs previously planned.

The move, part of a $4 billion investment that will also bring production of the gasoline Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox to the U.S. from Mexico, was criticized by the Sierra Club, which accused GM of all but abandoning a previous “aspiration” to sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035. But at an investor conference Wednesday, GM CFO Paul Jacobson defended the move as a necessary response to both Trump’s tariffs and strong demand for gasoline vehicles.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audi-sq5-grille.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-06-14 16:06:22.588479

2021 Lieutenant Governor (Democratic primary) This wide-open race with eight candidates — a record number for a statewide primary — narrowed in late April when then-Gov.","After Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger released her energy plan for the state this week, Virginia House GOP members wasted no time bashing it. Her plan emphasizes fair cost share, efficiency projects, and supporting a pilot program to handle peak energy consumption times.

“Her plan leans heavily on demand-side management: programmable thermostats, weatherization programs, utility subsidies, and incentives to reduce consumption during peak hours. That might sound reasonable in theory, but here’s the problem: managing scarcity isn’t a solution — it’s a symptom of failure,” an op-ed penned by House GOP leaders and members read.

The demand-side management they referenced is a recently-passed pilot program that requires utility companies to petition the State Corporation Commission to consider how to optimize energy use during peak times, by using virtual power plants, peak-shaving, and other incentives. Dominion is set to go before the Commission on July 15 to present its electric distribution grid plans for the pilot program.

The pilot allows homes and businesses to opt in to have their thermostats, appliances and solar arrays controlled during high-demand times. Spanberger’s plan also emphasizes weatherization of homes to limit energy waste and aims to reduce the need for additional power plants and transmission lines. Republican House lawmakers pushed back against those measures.

“No one wants to sit through a July heatwave hoping their A/C unit is grid-compliant, or that their A/C won’t be the one that someone in Richmond decides that it needs to shut off to save the grid. No one should have to worry that peak-hour surcharges or remote-control thermostats are going to make their daily life harder and more expensive,” the Republican legislators’ letter read.

Ten of the GOP House members who signed on to the letter voted in favor of Senate Bill 1100 in this year’s legislative session, which allowed the pilot program to move forward. Dels. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, Wren Williams, R-Patrick, Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William, Geary Higgins, R-Loudoun, Paul Milde, R-Stafford, Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield, Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack, Chad Green, R-York, and Anne Ferrell Tata, R-Virginia Beach, added their signatures to House GOP Leader Del. Terry Kilgore’s.

Kilgore, recently selected as House Republicans’ caucus leader, sponsored a bill in 2023 that capped Dominion’s profit margin, and this year, will allow the SCC to manage the profit margin rates. The General Assembly has also recently passed legislation aimed at expanding the state’s market for Small Modular Reactors, a nuclear energy source that’s still being developed and hasn’t yet been deployed anywhere in the United States.

Virginia lawmakers pass competing proposals to encourage small modular reactor development

A House GOP spokesperson said the members who voted in favor of SB 1011 are more interested in ramping up energy production in the state to meet increasing energy needs.

Spanberger’s plan doesn’t rule out new energy projects coming to the state to help meet demand, and touts the use of “advanced energy technologies” like “modular nuclear reactors, fusion, geothermal, and hydrogen.” The framework also states her administration will “ensure regulatory agencies in Virginia such as DEQ and VDOT are adequately staffed to deliver timely responses to permit applications.” The GOP letter said they are in favor of speeding up permitting for all energy sources, not just renewable ones.

Spanberger’s energy outline doesn’t go into details on plans to expand natural gas, nuclear, wind, or solar energy sources. It does lay out ideas to ensure the SCC works with stakeholders on efficiency methods to cut back on energy use – something the GOP members took issue with.

“You don’t solve an energy shortage by asking people to get used to less. You solve it by building more power,” the letter said.

Utility rates in the PJM markets have steadily increased in recent years as brownouts in the summer months have become a growing concern. Virginia was rated as the state that received the most electricity from other states in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. GOP House members want to shift away from this heavy import of energy and boost Virginia as a player in the energy production market.

In 2020, the General Assembly passed the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act that put the commonwealth into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Participating states can buy allowances of carbon emissions, and the proceeds are returned to the state for flood and energy projects. Gov. Glenn Youngkin pulled Virginia from RGGI, framing the additional cost to consumers for the program as a hidden tax. The withdrawal was later found to be unlawful by the courts. The state’s inclusion in the program is on hold while appeals play out in the legal system.

Spanberger’s plan suggests negotiating a deal to get the state back in on RGGI and use funding for efficiency projects.

Judge deems Youngkin’s actions to withdraw Virginia from RGGI ‘unlawful’

“Abigail consistently hears from Virginians who are facing high energy bills, and she knows affordable energy is essential for driving economic growth. That’s why her plan to make Virginians’ energy bills more affordable includes increasing local electricity generation and speeding up the timeline to bring new projects online,” a spokesperson for Spanberger said in a statement. “As Governor, Abigail will be focused on making Virginia more affordable — and she looks forward to working with both Democrats and Republicans alike to make it happen.”

Last week, Republican candidate for governor Winsome Earle-Sears said on the campaign trail that she wants to bolster the state’s energy profile through expanding fossil fuels and nuclear energy, according to the Prince William Times, to meet the state’s surging energy needs.

Data centers in Virginia have “substantially driven up energy demand in the state, and demand is forecast to continue growing for the foreseeable future,” a 2024 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission report found. Earle-Sears didn’t mention data centers specifically, but acknowledged that Virginia’s electricity demands have led the commonwealth to import 40% of its electricity from other states. Her administration, she said, would push for an all-of-the-above energy approach, an echo of Youngkin’s energy platform.

Earle-Sears did not respond to the Mercury’s request to elaborate on her energy platform.

As protests erupt again in Los Angeles over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and President Donald Trump’s deployment of U.S. Marines to back up the National Guard, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares isn’t blinking.

“It’s not unprecedented,” Miyares, who is seeking a second term as Virginia’s top law enforcement official, said of Trump’s decision to send troops to the streets. “President George H.W. Bush did it in 1992 during the L.A. riots. Twice the number of Marines were deployed then.”

In a wide-ranging interview at his office in Richmond earlier this week, Miyares, the son of a Cuban refugee and the first Hispanic Virginian elected statewide, insisted that what’s happening in California is the result of leadership failure.

“This is about protecting facilities and backing up law enforcement — not policing,” he said, emphasizing that peaceful protest is a hallmark of democracy, but violence is not. “When you cross the line … that is not protest, that is violence.”

In the interview, Miyares defended the use of force in Los Angeles, spoke at length about his office’s crime-fighting initiatives and touted settlements with corporate polluters and opioid makers. He also fielded questions on civil rights enforcement, voting access, utility regulation and his complex views on criminal justice reform.

Democrats, not surprisingly, remain deeply skeptical of Miyares’ record.

Carolyn Fiddler, spokeswoman for the Democratic Attorneys General Association, dismissed his claims of prioritizing public safety.

“Throughout his time as AG, MAGA Miyares continuously put politics before people,” Fiddler said in an email. “While he touts his ‘tough on crime’ stance, he’s failed to call out Donald Trump and Elon Musk for blatant violations of the law — including those actions with devastating impacts on the commonwealth. Virginians deserve better than Miyares, and we will take back the seat this year.”

And while critics accuse him of being more focused on punishment than reform, Miyares says his approach is guided by listening, law enforcement feedback, and a “victim-first” mindset.

From Virginia Beach to the statewide stage

Born in Greensboro, North Carolina and raised in Virginia Beach, Miyares, 49, earned his law degree from the College of William & Mary and worked as a prosecutor before running for office.

In 2015, he became the first Cuban American elected to Virginia’s General Assembly. Six years later, he unseated Democratic incumbent Mark Herring to become attorney general, winning on a platform centered around public safety.

Now, as he runs for reelection, Miyares is highlighting what he calls some of the biggest public safety and civil litigation wins in Virginia history. But he’s also navigating internal GOP rifts, pressure from both the right and the center, and a polarized electorate that’s increasingly skeptical of tough-on-crime rhetoric.

“I think one of the most important things for a leader to do is just listen,” Miyares said.

Since taking office in 2022, Miyares has zeroed in on violent crime. He calls Operation Ceasefire, a grant-driven program launched in 13 Virginia cities, one of his proudest achievements. The initiative funds a mix of prevention, intervention, and prosecution strategies aimed at repeat violent offenders.

“We saw a 66% drop in the murder rate across the 13 cities,” Miyares said. “Virginia’s statewide murder rate fell by a third. We also saw a decline in overdose deaths — because we’re getting fentanyl dealers off the street.”

The program, he insists, is based on listening tours he conducted with police and community leaders around the state. “Roughly 5% of felons commit over 50% of violent crimes. If you want to lower crime, you go after that small subset.”

Still, sustaining the initiative may prove difficult amid budget fights. “I wish we could expand Operation Ceasefire to more cities,” Miyares acknowledged, hinting that local buy-in has been mixed. “I wish more commonwealth’s attorneys would heed my call to listen to victims. Too many haven’t.”

When asked whether his office has done enough to address police misconduct, Miyares pointed to his 2023 settlement with the Town of Windsor, where officers had unlawfully stopped and threatened a Black Army lieutenant.

“You can be pro-law enforcement and still demand accountability,” he said. “They’re the only ones with a monopoly on violence in our society — they should be held to a higher standard.”

He added that oversight takes time. “We want to be thorough and systematic. And yes, if any other department crosses that boundary, we’ll get involved.”

That approach hasn’t stopped critics from accusing Miyares of being too soft on departments that violate civil rights — an accusation he flatly rejects. “The facts don’t support that claim,” he said.

Still, Miyares makes clear that his office prioritizes public safety above political fashion. “I will not support a criminal-first, victim-last mindset,” he said. “We’ve heard a lot about reform, but rarely do you hear the word ‘victim’ in those debates. That ends with me.”

Taking on corporations

Miyares has also overseen a wave of settlements that he says bring real change to communities.

“We’ve secured over $1.3 billion from opioid manufacturers and distributors,” he said. Some of that money, he said, helped open a new inpatient treatment center in Abingdon — “the first of its kind within a 100-mile radius.”

He emphasized that the money is managed by Virginia’s Opioid Abatement Authority, not his office, to ensure transparency and local tailoring. “What works in Fairfax may not work in Galax. But this is the largest influx of treatment funding in state history.”

On environmental enforcement, Miyares points to an $80 million settlement with Monsanto over PCB pollution and multiple other actions, including prosecuting illegal landfills and forcing remediation of oil spills and raw sewage discharges. “Our environmental law section has been incredibly active,” he said. “We’re thorough, we’re relentless, and we’re the people’s protector.”

That populist posture extends to corporations. Miyares boasts of taking on utility giants and the Washington Commanders alike. “We got a bigger settlement from the Commanders than D.C. and Maryland combined,” he said, referring to the $1.3 million paid over unlawfully withheld ticket deposits.

And in 2023, his office negotiated changes to Dominion Energy’s offshore wind plan. “We got them to share $3 billion of the risk, instead of placing it all on the ratepayers,” he said. “Before us, Virginians were on the hook for 100% of that cost.”

But his critics say his record on housing and regulation is mixed. Miyares counters that protecting property rights doesn’t preclude enforcing civil rights.

“I don’t think those are mutually exclusive,” he said. “We secured the largest housing discrimination verdict in Virginia’s history — $750,000 to two families evicted because one member was Black. And we’re making sure bad actors are held accountable, without choking off affordable housing through overregulation.”

Elections, energy and political calculations

Early into his tenure, Miyares established an Election Integrity Unit, which he said ensures voter rolls are accurate. Launched in September 2022 with no new funding, the unit is tasked with investigating election-law violations and safeguarding voting integrity. It successfully issued a cease‑and‑desist against misleading mailers sent by Look Ahead America — an action upheld by a federal appeals court.

While Miyares touts the unit as crucial to preventing fraud, no actual voter fraud has been identified, leading watchdogs like the NAACP to criticize the unit as more reflective of political signaling than prosecutorial gain.

“I can cite several Virginia elections decided by a handful of votes. It should be easy to vote, hard to cheat,” he said, rejecting the notion that voter ID laws are a means of suppression. “I cannot get a library card without an ID. Voter ID is not controversial.”

In the interview, Miyares wouldn’t commit to refraining from prosecuting voters accidentally registered in error, noting that knowingly voting as a non-citizen could still result in legal action. “They’d have to fear prosecution if they go knowing they’re a non-citizen,” he said.

Miyares, along with Youngkin, has repeatedly challenged Virginia’s ties to California’s environmental standards, particularly on electric vehicles.

“Tying ourselves to California is a fool’s errand,” he said. “Their regulations are being dictated by an unelected air board. The average EV costs $68,000. That’s a tax on working-class Virginians.”

He said Virginia needs to expand its baseload energy capacity, not rely on intermittent sources like wind and solar. “I want electric bills to go down. Tying ourselves to California ensures they go up.”

Despite this skepticism, Miyares defended his record on climate enforcement, including recent court victories over solar and wind energy permits. “We are enforcing the law — just not surrendering to mandates that hurt working people.”

Miyares has also made “second chances” a talking point, holding job fairs for formerly incarcerated Virginians. But he remains skeptical of broader criminal justice reforms, including eliminating mandatory minimums.

“They’re an effective tool,” he said. “They help us go after repeat violent offenders and keep them off the streets.”

He argued that justice reform must be victim-centered.

“Too many of these conversations leave out the victims entirely. They’ve been through trauma, they’ve testified under oath in a courtroom full of strangers, and they deserve to know the system protects them.”

When asked if he supports GOP lieutenant governor nominee John Reid, whose campaign was embroiled in scandal earlier this spring, Miyares replied simply, “I support Republicans.” Despite Youngkin’s attempts to nudge Reid from the race, Miyares said he respects the governor’s judgment — but “John Reid is our nominee.”

Looking to the 2025 election, Miyares said he’s proudest of the state’s drop in fentanyl death — 46%, more than double the national average. “There are Virginians alive today because of our work,” he said.

If reelected, he said, he’d expand Operation Ceasefire and continue pressing commonwealth’s attorneys to prioritize victims.

“I have said before, I will not support a criminal first, victim last mindset. And I find it amazing that whenever we have these great discussions about criminal justice reform, the one word that you never hear is victims,” Miyares said.

“Denying the voice of victims is not something I’ll ever find acceptable.”

With six candidates on the ballot, the June 17 Democratic contest for lieutenant governor is the second most-crowded statewide primary in modern Virginia history.

If history is any guide, a congested primary can generate uncertainty and makes it possible that someone can claim the nomination with considerably less than a majority of votes cast.

Here’s a quick review of five statewide primaries since 1997 where the nominee won less than 40%. The races are listed in chronological order.

1997 Attorney General (Republican primary)

Political newcomer Gil Davis made a splash by representing a former Arkansas state employee who filed a sexual harassment claim against then-President Bill Clinton. A week before the primary, state Sen. Ken Stolle released a TV ad attacking Davis, who was shown, drink in hand, talking to a client about her desire to pose naked in Playboy magazine. As it turned out, Stolle should have saved his fire for his Senate colleague, Mark Earley of Chesapeake. The party’s ascendent anti-abortion base carried Earley to victory in a four-way race. Davis finished last.

Mark Earley 35.8%

Jerry Kilgore 24.6%

Ken Stolle 20.8%

Gilbert Davis 18.8%

In the 1997 general election, Republicans rode gubernatorial candidate Jim Gilmore’s “No Car Tax!” slogan to their first-ever trifecta of statewide offices. In the attorney general race, Earley captured 57.5% of the vote to defeat Democrat Bill Dolan.

With a quiet second place finish in the GOP primary, Jerry Kilgore of Scott County in far Southwest Virginia put himself in line to become the party’s consensus attorney general choice in 2001. Gil Davis never ran for office again, but one of his law associates, Bill Stanley, won a special election to the state Senate in January 2011.

2001 Lieutenant Governor (Democrat primary)

In the second year after the millennium, the candidates with the best name ID were two members of the House of Delegates. Alan Diamonstein, at 69, was part of the party’s old guard that had just lost its majority in the House of Delegates. Jerrauld Jones was a skilled lawmaker who headed the Legislative Black Caucus. Richmond Mayor Tim Kaine, with his yard signs an unusual green and yellow, was only one year younger than Jones, but presented himself as a new generation of Democratic leadership. Kaine, the son-in-law of former Republican Gov. Linwood Holton, rang up big majorities in the Richmond area.

Tim Kaine 39.7%

Alan Diamonstein 31.4%

Jerrauld Jones 28.9%

In the general election, Kaine landed just north of a majority (50.3%) in a three-way race against little-known Republican legislator Jay Katzen (48.1%) and Libertarian Party candidate Gary Reams (1.6%). Many Democrats had expected Charlottesville state Sen. Emily Couric to be their nominee. But Couric — a rising star who was as telegenic as her sister, Katie, the Today Show host — withdrew in July 2020 after a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Emily Couric died three weeks before Election Day.

2001 Attorney General (Democratic primary)

It’s hard to imagine a statewide Democratic primary where the populous suburbs of Northern Virginia do not play the kingmaker. But that is essentially what happened in June 2001, when Democrats went to the polls to select nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general. Without a single candidate from Northern Virginia, turnout was driven by candidates from Richmond and Tidewater. In the lieutenant governor’s race, twice as many votes were cast in Henrico County (7,528) than in Loudoun and Prince William combined (3,012).

Downstate candidates — state Del. Whitt Clement of Danville and state Sen. John Edwards of Roanoke — put up dazzling favorite-son margins in their respective home bases, but the turnout worked to the advantage of Donald McEachin, a state legislator from Henrico who won majorities in core urban cities like Richmond, Hampton and Newport News.

Donald McEachin 33.6%

John Edwards 29.5%

In the general election, McEachin lost his bid to become the first Black attorney general in Virginia history. McEachin’s social justice agenda was ignored by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mark Warner, who ran a centrist campaign with crossover appeal to gun-loving, NASCAR-crazy rural Virginia. McEachin managed only 39.9% of the vote, falling below Mary Sue Terry’s previous record for the all-time worst performance by a Democrat in a statewide general election.

2005 Lieutenant Governor (Democratic primary)

From the standpoint of geography and ideology, the four candidates who sought the lieutenant governor nomination in 2005 seemed handpicked to splinter the state’s Democratic coalition. Leslie Byrne and Chap Petersen were from Northern Virginia, Viola Baskerville was from Richmond and Philip Puckett was from Southwest Virginia.

They ran the gamut from unabashed liberal (Byrne), diligent policy wonk (Baskerville), contrarian (Petersen) and conservative (Puckett). None were slouches; all were legislators who could point to achievements. In the end, party loyalists opted for Byrne, a familiar name who had served in both chambers of the state legislature and one term in the U.S. House, making her the first woman from Virginia to serve in Congress.

Leslie Byrne 32.9%

Viola Baskerville 26.1%

Chap Petersen 21.7%

Philip Puckett 19.4%

In the general election, Republicans nominated state Sen. Bill Bolling of Hanover County and figured they would make quick work of Byrne, arguably the most left-leaning statewide Democrat nominated since populist Henry Howell in the 1970s. Even though Bolling held a 2-to-1 ratio fundraising advantage, Byrne made it a close race. The final tally was Bolling 50.1%, Byrne 49.3%.

2021 Lieutenant Governor (Democratic primary)

This wide-open race with eight candidates — a record number for a statewide primary — narrowed in late April when then-Gov. Ralph Northam endorsed Hala Ayala. She was a little-known state legislator from Prince William County who had been swept into the House of Delegates as part of a massive anti-Trump backlash in 2017. Her story of financial struggle as a woman of color who lacked health care when her first child was born resonated with party faithful still celebrating Medicaid expansion in Virginia. Her multiethnic lineage (a father with Northern African roots who emigrated from El Salvador and a mother who was Irish and Lebanese) offered something for an increasingly diverse Virginia electorate.

Hala Ayala 37.6%

Sam Rasoul 24.3%

Mark Levine 11.2%

Andria McClellan 10.6%

Sean Perryman 8.1%

Xavier Warren 4.1%

The general election was a historic one in which Virginia would elect its first female lieutenant governor – and the first woman of color. The GOP nominated Winsome Sears, a native of Jamaica who emigrated as a child to the United States with her family. Sears won 50.7% of the vote as part of a GOP sweep of the three statewide offices. Also of note: Democratic Del. Mark Levine took the risky path of running in two primaries on the same day – one for lieutenant governor and the other to retain the party’s nomination for his legislative seat in Alexandria. He lost both.

Senate Democrats rejected several appointees to Virginia’s governing boards at various colleges on Monday, including former Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli and former state commerce and trade secretary Caren Merrick.

The Monday vote by the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee removed all eight appointees made by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The move, which Democratic leaders attributed to differences in political values, now puts the decision to find replacements in the governor’s hands once again.

“The work and the oversight that we have and as chairman of this committee is to provide accountability and oversight to our prestigious institutions to ensure that those bodies align with our values and what we see in the political climate today, especially coming out of Washington, trying to make their way into our commonwealth,” said Senate Privileges and Elections Committee Chair Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach. “It is our job to stand up and protect those values, and that is what we are doing today.”

In a statement after the meeting, Rouse referred to Cuccinelli and the other seven appointees as “MAGA extremists” and “Project 2025 supporters,” who are opposed to Democrats’ progressive ideals.

Cuccinelli’s “extreme” position on reproductive rights, his work Project 2025 — a conservative plan for how the country should operate under Republican control — and his “hateful attacks” on LGBTQ Virginians prevented Rouse from lending his support to the governor’s appointment for Cuccinelli to serve on the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors, the Democratic senator said.

“He’s a Trump crony who is simply too extreme to have a role in shaping one of our commonwealth’s flagship universities,” Rouse, who is running for lieutenant governor and facing five Democratic contenders, said of Cuccinelli.

Merrick was slated to serve at George Mason University under the governor’s appointment.

The remaining seven nominees were to serve at Virginia Military Institute and George Mason, but they were all denied by the Democratic-controlled committee in an 8-4 vote. Three Senate Republicans were missing from the meeting.

In response to their colleagues’ action, Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, and Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, defended the governor’s appointees, highlighting that the group is made up of former public servants on the state and federal levels, military service members, and private sector leaders.

“There is nothing about any of these individuals that makes them unqualified to serve the commonwealth of Virginia in any of these positions,” Sturtevant said at Monday’s meeting. “These are all highly qualified appointees.”

DeSteph and Sturtevant also questioned why a joint subcommittee made up of members from both the Senate and House Privileges and Elections Committees had not met to review the statements and economic interests of the appointees, per state code. Rouse directed the question to the subcommittee’s attorney who said he was not aware of if the subcommittee is active.

“We have to follow the law and what the law says,” Sturtevant said, adding that any motion on the appointees moving forward would be “out of order,” “improper” and “not in compliance” with state law.

DeSteph, who was uncertain if the committee was properly formed, added that the state law says that there “shall” be a subcommittee.

“This isn’t a ‘may.’ This isn’t a ‘you can ignore this.’ This is a ‘shall,” DeSteph said. “Normally, when something is in code that strict we kind of do it. Otherwise this is Step A before Step B.”

Staff was unable to determine when the subcommittee last met or how many of the governor’s appointees have been confirmed. Rouse estimated hundreds.

Earlier this year, Democrats also blocked nine of Youngkin’s appointees, including two Virginia Military Institute Board of Visitors nominees.

Leader sends letter to rectors

In a June 9 letter, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, wrote to all the heads of Virginia’s public universities that state code requires all governing body members to be confirmed by the General Assembly, stating that they “will not confirm individuals who do not possess the judgment, character, or willingness to follow the principles” he outlined in the letter.

Some of those principles require board members to understand their fiduciary duties, to commit to the independent governance of such institutions, and to avoid excessive partisan inclinations.

“The General Assembly takes seriously its oversight responsibilities regarding Virginia’s public universities,” Surovell wrote. “Should any Board of Visitors fail to exercise appropriate independent judgment or allow external influences to compromise their fiduciary duties, the General Assembly will not hesitate to examine the situation and take whatever legislative action may be necessary.”

The letter went on to remind university heads that they are accountable to the General Assembly and that the boards must exercise independent judgment and are not obligated to the directives of the governor.

“Virginia is proud to maintain one of the strongest public higher education systems in America,” the letter states. “Our commonwealth is home to some of the nation’s oldest and most prestigious institutions, and they deserve governance that is independent, principled, and focused solely on their academic mission and service to the commonwealth.”

State legislators are now considering other university BOV nominees, a process that is slated to continue through the end of the year.

If Youngkin plans to appoint new members to fill expiring seats, he has until the end of his term in January.

Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has joined a bipartisan group of attorneys general from across the country in urging Congress to pass the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act, a measure designed to shield homebuyers from aggressive and misleading marketing tactics tied to their mortgage credit data.

At the center of the issue is the use of “trigger leads,” a legal but controversial practice in which credit bureaus sell consumer data to third-party lenders and marketing firms the moment someone applies for a mortgage. These companies then flood prospective homebuyers with unsolicited phone calls, text messages, emails, and sometimes fraudulent offers—often before the borrower even hears back from their own lender.

“Too many hardworking Virginia families have been harassed and misled by aggressive telemarketers the moment they begin the homebuying process,” said Miyares. “It’s time to stop turning the American dream of homeownership into a marketing free-for-all.”

While allowed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), these practices have triggered growing concern nationwide. State attorneys general say they have long attempted to protect consumers from the abuse of trigger leads, only to be blocked by federal preemption clauses in the FCRA. Now, with bipartisan support and a renewed push in Congress, officials are calling for lasting change.

The Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act would limit the sale of trigger leads only to companies that already have a relationship with the consumer or that have received explicit consent to access the data. Supporters say the bill strikes a balance—protecting consumer privacy without shutting down healthy competition among lenders.

In 2023, a similar version of the bill passed the U.S. Senate with unanimous support, indicating strong bipartisan backing for the measure. The current version continues to gain traction, with support from both lawmakers and industry leaders who want to end deceptive marketing and restore trust in the mortgage process.

For many home buyers, especially first-time buyers, the barrage of unexpected offers can be overwhelming and confusing. In some cases, misleading solicitations have caused borrowers to mistakenly abandon secure, affordable mortgage offers in favor of more costly options. Others have become targets of scams.

By curbing the misuse of consumer data and restoring clear privacy boundaries, the bill would help protect the personal information of millions of Americans during one of the most important financial decisions of their lives.

Virginia joins a broad coalition of support that includes 49 states and territories, including Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, D.C., all pressing Congress to act swiftly.

“Congress has an opportunity to protect the personal information of millions of Americans by passing this commonsense, bipartisan-backed bill,” said Miyares.

If passed, the Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act would represent a significant step toward modernizing consumer data protections in the housing market. It would ensure that Americans can pursue the dream of homeownership without being bombarded, misled, or taken advantage of along the way.

Driving the news

Tesla received licensing to deploy EV charging stations, solar panels, battery storage systems, and sell electricity directly to consumers.

The big picture

Morocco is already a global leader in renewables, generating 38% of electricity from clean sources in 2024, with a goal of 52% by 2030. Projects like the Noor Ouarzazate Solar Complex showcase the country’s solar ambitions.

Tesla’s presence could:

Accelerate solar-powered EV charging infrastructure

Boost local battery storage solutions

Support the decentralization of Morocco’s national grid

Talent pipeline

Morocco produces 10,000+ engineering graduates annually. Institutions like Mohammed VI Polytechnic University are grooming talent in clean energy and smart grid systems—key for Tesla’s workforce needs.

“Tesla can play a catalytic role in job creation and tech transfer,” said an official familiar with Morocco’s industrial policy.

Between the lines:

Youth unemployment (ages 15–24) stood at 17% in 2024. Tesla’s arrival could align with state efforts to create high-tech jobs.

The government’s National Electric Mobility Strategy targets 10,000 public EV chargers by 2030 and 20% EV share of new vehicle sales.

Zoom out

Tesla’s expansion to Morocco offers a springboard into both European and sub-Saharan markets. With EU trade ties and a strategic geographic location, Morocco could serve as Tesla’s logistics and manufacturing base for North Africa.

Reality check:

Affordability gap: With average urban salaries around $350/month, Tesla cars priced at $40,000+ are out of reach for most Moroccans.

Grid transition lag: As of 2024, 45% of Morocco’s electricity still came from coal and gas, per ONEE.

Incentives and local manufacturing may be key to lowering EV costs and boosting adoption.

What’s next

Trump's Bill Would End EV Subsidies: Could That Bankrupt Lucid Group?","Key Points

Lucid Group has limited capital and is burning through its cash rapidly.

Eliminating EV tax credits could affect Lucid's competitiveness.

10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group ›

Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) is growing its electric vehicle (EV) sales rapidly right now. In 2025, analysts expect its revenues to jump by 73%, and in 2026, they anticipate an even faster growth rate approaching 100%.

There's just one problem: Included in Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is a provision that would eliminate the federal tax credits for electric vehicles. That would effectively raise the prices of EVs by $4,000 to $7,500 -- a huge potential blow to demand. When you look at the numbers, things could quickly get ugly for Lucid. But there's also some reason for hope.

Lucid Group's major flaw

Lucid's sales growth over the next couple of years will primarily be driven by its recently introduced Gravity SUV. Previously, the company only offered its Air sedan, which ranged in price between $70,000 and around $100,000 depending on the configuration. SUVs, however, are much more popular than sedans in the U.S. right now.

Long term, however, it will be critical for Lucid to develop some mass-market vehicles, which are typically priced under $50,000. Tesla's two mass-market models -- the Model 3 and Model Y -- currently account for more than 90% of its unit sales. Such vehicles bring scale to sales growth, but also to operational leverage, which is immensely beneficial to profitability. If the U.S. eliminates federal EV tax incentives, having more affordable vehicles in its lineup will be crucial to Lucid's growth and stability.

While the company has previously teased plans to launch several new mass-market models in 2026, details about those potential EVs have been scarce. Plus, it takes billions of dollars to get a new EV model to market. With less than $2 billion in cash on its books, Lucid will likely need to tap the credit and equity markets again before these vehicles launch. Over the past 12 months, it booked a net loss of $3.8 billion.

This all puts Lucid in a tight spot. It needs to get mass-market vehicles on the road to boost sales, scale, and profitability. But it will need more capital to do that, and if Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress end the federal EV tax credit, that could lead investors to pull back from the space, limiting Lucid's ability to easily raise capital. That would not be a good position for an early stage, capital-intensive business to find itself in.

But could the elimination of EV tax credits actually end up helping Lucid in the long term?

Who has the advantage in a less EV-friendly marketplace?

There's a case to be made that ending the EV tax credit could eventually benefit Lucid. Demand for EVs would likely take a hit over the short term as the real costs to consumers rise, but if Lucid can get its affordable models to market on schedule, that could mitigate some of the impact. Meanwhile, competitors that fail to introduce mass-market EVs could struggle to maintain market share, giving Lucid more room to grow.

I'm skeptical of this optimistic view. Lucid is far behind competitors like Rivian and Tesla in terms of both financing and the ability to launch additional affordable vehicles. The recent departure of its longtime CEO may put even more strain on its ability to raise capital. In terms of publicly traded EV companies, Lucid arguably has the most to lose due to its diminutive size and limited lineup.

Will Trump's bill cause Lucid to go bankrupt? Not immediately. But the company has been relatively quiet about its plans for new mass-market EVs, and it could be years before its production scales meaningfully. That leaves it with a limited lineup of high-priced vehicles -- not an ideal situation when achieving scale will require it to provide affordable options.

Between 2004 and 2024, ethanol production increased by nearly 500 percent.
The country’s primary biofuels policy, the Renewable Fuel Standard, requires that biofuels provide a greenhouse gas reduction over fossil fuels: The law says that ethanol from new plants must deliver a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline.

The American Midwest is home to some of the richest, most productive farmland in the world, enabling its transformation into a vast corn- and soy-producing machine—a conversion spurred largely by decades-long policies that support the production of biofuels.

But a new report takes a big swing at the ethanol orthodoxy of American agriculture, criticizing the industry for causing economic and social imbalances across rural communities and saying that the expansion of biofuels will increase greenhouse gas emissions, despite their purported climate benefits.

The report, from the World Resources Institute, which has been critical of US biofuel policy in the past, draws from 100 academic studies on biofuel impacts. It concludes that ethanol policy has been largely a failure and ought to be reconsidered, especially as the world needs more land to produce food to meet growing demand.

“Multiple studies show that US biofuel policies have reshaped crop production, displacing food crops and driving up emissions from land conversion, tillage, and fertilizer use,” said the report’s lead author, Haley Leslie-Bole. “Corn-based ethanol, in particular, has contributed to nutrient runoff, degraded water quality and harmed wildlife habitat. As climate pressures grow, increasing irrigation and refining for first-gen biofuels could deepen water scarcity in already drought-prone parts of the Midwest.”

The conversion of Midwestern agricultural land has been sweeping. Between 2004 and 2024, ethanol production increased by nearly 500 percent. Corn and soybeans are now grown on 92 and 86 million acres of land respectively—and roughly a third of those crops go to produce ethanol. That means about 30 million acres of land that could be used to grow food crops are instead being used to produce ethanol, despite ethanol only accounting for 6 percent of the country’s transportation fuel.

The biofuels industry—which includes refiners, corn and soy growers and the influential agriculture lobby writ large—has long insisted that corn- and soy-based biofuels provide an energy-efficient alternative to fossil-based fuels. Congress and the US Department of Agriculture have agreed.

The country’s primary biofuels policy, the Renewable Fuel Standard, requires that biofuels provide a greenhouse gas reduction over fossil fuels: The law says that ethanol from new plants must deliver a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline.

In addition to greenhouse gas reductions, the industry and its allies in Congress have also continued to say that ethanol is a primary mainstay of the rural economy, benefiting communities across the Midwest.

But a growing body of research—much of which the industry has tried to debunk and deride—suggests that ethanol actually may not provide the benefits that policies require. It may, in fact, produce more greenhouse gases than the fossil fuels it was intended to replace. Recent research says that biofuel refiners also emit significant amounts of carcinogenic and dangerous substances, including hexane and formaldehyde, in greater amounts than petroleum refineries.

The new report points to research saying that increased production of biofuels from corn and soy could actually raise greenhouse gas emissions, largely from carbon emissions linked to clearing land in other countries to compensate for the use of land in the Midwest.

On top of that, corn is an especially fertilizer-hungry crop requiring large amounts of nitrogen-based fertilizer, which releases huge amounts of nitrous oxide when it interacts with the soil. American farming is, by far, the largest source of domestic nitrous oxide emissions already—about 50 percent. If biofuel policies lead to expanded production, emissions of this enormously powerful greenhouse gas will likely increase, too.

The new report concludes that not only will the expansion of ethanol increase greenhouse gas emissions, but it has also failed to provide the social and financial benefits to Midwestern communities that lawmakers and the industry say it has. (The report defines the Midwest as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.)

“The benefits from biofuels remain concentrated in the hands of a few,” Leslie-Bole said. “As subsidies flow, so may the trend of farmland consolidation, increasing inaccessibility of farmland in the Midwest, and locking out emerging or low-resource farmers. This means the benefits of biofuels production are flowing to fewer people, while more are left bearing the costs.”

New policies being considered in state legislatures and Congress, including additional tax credits and support for biofuel-based aviation fuel, could expand production, potentially causing more land conversion and greenhouse gas emissions, widening the gap between the rural communities and rich agribusinesses at a time when food demand is climbing and, critics say, land should be used to grow food instead.

President Donald Trump’s tax cut bill, passed by the House and currently being negotiated in the Senate, would not only extend tax credits for biofuels producers, it specifically excludes calculations of emissions from land conversion when determining what qualifies as a low-emission fuel.

The primary biofuels industry trade groups, including Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association, did not respond to Inside Climate News requests for comment or interviews.

An employee with the Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers, not ethanol, said the report vastly overstates the carbon emissions from crop-based fuels by comparing the farmed land to natural landscapes, which no longer exist.

They also noted that the impact of soy-based fuels in 2024 was more than $42 billion, providing over 100,000 jobs.

“Ten percent of the value of every bushel of soybeans is linked to biomass-based fuel,” they said.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2166100083-2560x1440.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 14:07:35.613483

They've spotlighted that the potential rolling back of federal tax credits, birthed from the Inflation Reduction Act, might put Arizona's recent economic gains at risk. These incentives have been pivotal in the state's success in attracting business investments and creating jobs within the renewable energy sector.

Stressing the importance of bipartisan effort, Kelly emphasized that Arizona's status as a business hub is due to a collaborative approach over the years. According to a press release by his office, Kelly said, ""Because of this we've benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits."" He pointed out that the Republican plan to snip these programs could potentially increase energy prices and lead to thousands of job losses. Senator Gallego also echoed the urgency, stating in the same press release, ""This isn’t just a tax plan—it’s a direct assault on Arizonans who simply want to get ahead and provide for their families.""

The implications of repealing these tax credits are considerable, with projections hinting at an 11.4% hike in annual electricity bills for households by 2029, as mentioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association. Rep. Ansari, in a statement disseminated by her office, branded the Trump administration's strategy as chaos, insisting that further cuts would jeopardize Arizona's economy and represent ""bad policy.""

On the business front, the stance is clear: keeping these tax credits intact is crucial. Danny Seiden, President and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry, highlighted the importance of targeted tax credits in sustaining Arizona's manufacturing momentum. Furthermore, Richard Ra, President of LG Energy Solution Arizona, told Senator Kelly's office, ""We are investing billions of dollars in Queen Creek and look forward to creating high quality jobs in Arizona as we bring our advanced manufacturing expertise and experience to the United States.""

Meanwhile, Governor Hobbs is backing strategies that seem to advance the Arizona Promise by creating opportunities for the working class and fostering economic growth. Her office released figures showing Arizona's economy has attracted 134 projects, representing more than 69,000 jobs and $58 billion in investments, all of which stand to be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits. Added to these voices, Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority, noted the jeopardy faced by projects in their pipeline should these financial programs be phased out or eliminated.

Maren Mahoney, Director of the Arizona Governor’s Office of Resiliency, insisted, ""Without these federal investments in clean energy technology, Arizona families stand to lose out on good-paying jobs in manufacturing and construction, and risk even higher energy bills."" This sentiment is shared by Steven G.

The agency is proposing Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume targets for 2026 and 2027, marking a pivotal step forward for the program, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year.

Under the leadership of President Trump, the EPA’s “Set 2” proposal seeks to uphold the original intent of the RFS program, expanding the use of American-made biofuels, bolstering domestic energy production, and aiding rural economies.

“This new approach supports U.S. farmers while helping to stabilize fuel prices and preserve the role of liquid fuels,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “We must stop relying on foreign competitors at the expense of American consumers and producers.”

Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins emphasized the impact on agricultural producers, stating, “President Trump understands the vital role the RFS plays for corn and soybean growers. Administrator Zeldin’s proposal is the most ambitious to date, providing much-needed market certainty for producers and reducing costs for consumers at the pump. The USDA and EPA are now more aligned than ever in promoting American-grown biofuels.”

Rollins also highlighted recent trade successes, including a deal with the U.K. that secured tariff-free access for over $700 million in ethanol exports. “This is part of our strategy to expand American energy leadership globally,” she said.

If finalized, the proposed rule would set the highest Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) in the program’s history, reinforcing the Trump Administration’s commitment to energy independence and rural development.

Key elements of the proposal include:

Ambitious growth targets for core renewable fuels.

A revised valuation system that favors domestically produced biofuels and feedstocks over foreign imports.

The elimination of electricity (eRIN) as a qualifying renewable fuel under the RFS, aligning with the President’s goal to roll back electric vehicle mandates.

Traditionally, the RFS operated as a single-variable system, adjusting only fuel volumes. The new proposal introduces a second factor—adjusting the value of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) based on the fuel’s origin. Under this system, foreign biofuels and feedstocks would receive only half the RIN value compared to domestic equivalents.

The proposed rule is expected to cut U.S. dependence on foreign oil by about 150,000 barrels per day during 2026 and 2027. In 2024, nearly 45 percent of biomass-based diesel (BBD) feedstocks and fuels were imported. By reducing the RIN value for these imports, the EPA aims to stimulate domestic production and further enhance national energy security.

The Set 2 Rule proposes the biofuel volume requirements and associated percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel (BBD), advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for 2026 and 2027. The volume targets are as follows:

Table 1: Volume Requirements 2023 – 2027 (billion RINs)a

One RIN is equivalent to one ethanol-equivalent gallon of renewable fuel.

This proposal is a central piece of President Trump’s broader strategy to reinforce American energy independence, expand agricultural markets, and push back against unfair international trade practices. Finalizing these requirements would secure investments made by U.S. farmers, processors, and fuel producers—industries critical to the nation’s energy stability and the vitality of rural communities.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ethanol-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 18:07:23.507267

With electricity bills soaring, New Jersey lawmakers are exploring alternative renewable energy sources — including the untapped potential of ocean wave and tidal power — as part of a broader strategy to reduce costs and meet clean energy goals.

On June 12, the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee advanced A-1478, a bill directing the state Board of Public Utilities to study the viability of ocean-based energy. Supporters say New Jersey’s extensive shoreline positions it to be a national leader in marine renewable technology.

Custom-designed buoys, converters and other equipment could be used to harness energy from tides and waves for consumer use.

“Due to our vast shoreline and offshore resources, New Jersey could be a pioneer in exploring and evaluating wave energy from economic as well as environmental perspectives on the Northeast coast,” said Jasmine Mettelus of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

Mettelus said ocean-based energy could complement more established renewables like solar and wind. The state has committed to 100% clean energy by 2035, but progress has been slowed by the rollback of federal environmental policies under former President Donald Trump.

Electricity prices in New Jersey jumped as of June 1, driven by a regional transmission auction that set new rates. According to state regulators, the average household can expect to pay about $20 more per month. PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, cites increased demand from artificial intelligence data centers and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing as contributing factors.

Some Republican lawmakers expressed skepticism about the feasibility of ocean energy.

“In theory, this sounds like it could be good, but some of the parallels to offshore wind are concerning to me,” said Assemblyman Paul Kanitra, a Republican from Point Pleasant Beach. “How much is this going to industrialize the ocean? How is it going to affect our marine and fishing industries?”

Assemblyman Christian Barranco, a Republican from Pompton Lakes, voted against the bill and called for a focus on immediate solutions.

“This is not going to help us in any way with the freight train that we’re facing of electrical costs in New Jersey,” Barranco said. “Everything that takes away from the fact that we need generating assets, turbines spinning right now, is getting in the way of what we need to do to make sure we don’t go broke paying our electric bills.”

The same day, the Senate Environment and Energy Committee advanced S-4530, which would significantly expand New Jersey’s community solar program. The bill proposes opening registration for up to 3,000 megawatts of additional capacity — enough to power more than 500,000 homes.

Community solar projects allow neighborhoods to benefit from shared solar installations, offering access to residents who rent or live in multi-unit buildings without rooftop space.

“Solar is critical because it allows for a just transition and equal access to clean energy, including … New Jerseyans who may rent their homes and not have access to their own roofs,” said Jesse Sutherland of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

Not everyone is on board with the scale of the proposed solar expansion. Maura Caroselli, managing attorney for gas and clean energy at the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel, warned about potential costs to ratepayers.

“While we appreciate the goals of this bill, we are concerned that it is too much, too fast,” Caroselli said. “We need to make sure there is sufficient generation to meet this goal, and that the subsidies to be paid by ratepayers are not over-burdensome.”

Ben Dziobek, founder of the Climate Revolution Action Network, supported the bill, citing the urgent need for energy alternatives.

“We are in an extreme time of energy need, with expanding usage from AI and other industries,” Dziobek said. “Right now we also have lost the majority of our wind industry in New Jersey. We’re going to need to find ways to get that energy from somewhere else.”",https://mercerme.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/electric_costs_increase.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 14:07:22.270134

POLICING IN WASHINGTON, D.C.: The House has passed the Protecting Our Nation’s Capital Emergency Act (H.R. 2096), sponsored by Rep. Andrew R. Garbarino, R-N.Y. The bill would repeal Washington, D.C., laws regarding disciplinary actions against the District’s law enforcement officers, including by restoring a statute of limitations for bringing disciplinary actions and making the discipline issue a subject for collective bargaining between the city and its police union. Garbarino said the D.C. laws have removed basic bargaining rights and procedural protections for local police, and “this legislation restores fairness and support for the men and women who risk their lives to keep our capital secure.” An opponent, Rep. Stephen F. Lynch, D-Mass., said the measures made it easier “to discipline officers for crimes and serious misconduct. Before that law, the department had been forced to rehire a significant number of officers it had fired for crimes and official misconduct.” The vote, on June 10, was 235 yeas to 178 nays, with 1 voting present.

CLASSIFYING FENTANYL: The House has passed the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act (S. 331), sponsored by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., to register fentanyl-related substances as schedule I controlled substances, with no medical value, a high danger of being abused, and accordingly strict legal penalties. A bill supporter, Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., said the permanent schedule I classification “will strengthen law enforcement’s ability to prosecute fentanyl traffickers and act as a deterrent.” An opponent, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., said: “This bill is essentially recycling an incarceration first response to what I consider mainly a public health challenge.” The vote, on June 12, was 321 yeas to 104 nays.

SELLING WEAPONS TO QATAR: The Senate has rejected a motion to discharge from the Foreign Relations Committee a bill (S.J. Res. 53), sponsored by Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., that would have disapproved of and voided the sale of drone weapons to Qatar. Murphy said the drone sale appeared to be tied to Qatar’s gift of a luxury airplane that amounted to a personal present to President Trump, and “if we start to endorse and grease the wheels of this kind of corruption, then there will be no end” to such corruption. A bill opponent, Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, said it sought to turn a security partnership with Qatar into a partisan political issue.

SELLING WEAPONS TO UNITED ARAB EMIRATES: The Senate has rejected a motion to discharge from the Foreign Relations Committee a bill (S.J. Res. 54), sponsored by Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., that would have disapproved of and voided the sale of military helicopters to the United Arab Emirates. Murphy said the sale was tied to President Trump’s “corrupt request” that the Emirates invest $2 billion in his World Liberty Financial stablecoin cryptocurrency enterprise. A bill opponent, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said: “I am not going to cast aspersions on the president of the United States without any clear evidence that any law has been broken, and I do not believe that there has been.” The vote to discharge, on June 11, was 39 yeas to 56 nays, with 1 voting present.

REGULATING CRYPTOCURRENCY STABLECOINS: The Senate has passed a substitute amendment sponsored by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (S. 1582). The bill would establish procedures for federal regulation of stablecoins, which are digital cryptocurrencies intended to have a relatively static value by tying them to another asset, such as gold or the dollar. Thune called it a needed resolution of a situation in which “stablecoin issuers are operating in a legal gray zone. Companies that want to follow the rules can’t be sure what rules to follow.” A bill opponent, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said it “exposes taxpayers, consumers, and the financial system to unacceptable risk and creates venues for criminals, terrorists, and rogue governments to finance their illicit activities.” The vote, on June 12, was 67 yeas to 30 nays.

Report examines how this dominance shapes global electric vehicle (EV) markets, creating strategic challenges for the free world, specifically the United States and India.

While examining the EV dynamics of US, the report analyses Leftist Biden-Harris Autopen Administration’s promotion measures for “other-than-Tesla” EVs, EV tax credit and Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” and other actions against EVs.

This report examines Indian developments around EVs. Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi, infamous for a “secret” MoU with the CCP, has repeatedly and openly promoted EVs. The report takes note of India’s EV producers (Tata, Mahindra, and others) and India’s efforts to counter CCP-occupied China’s mineral dominance.

CCP-Occupied China’s Control Over Critical Minerals

CCP-occupied China dominates EV supply chains:

Lithium: Mines 17% of global lithium, refines ~65-70%. Australia (43%) and Chile (25%) lead mining, but CCP firms like Ganfeng Lithium control refining.

Cobalt: Congo produces ~70% of cobalt, with Chinese Communist Party firms (e.g. CMOC) controlling ~60%. CCP-occupied China refines ~80% of battery-grade cobalt.

EVs require ~200 kg of critical minerals against ~35 kg required for ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles, amplifying vulnerabilities.

REEs: Mines ~60-69% of REEs, processes ~90-92%, including 99.9% of heavy REEs (e.g., dysprosium) in 2024 due to a Vietnamese facility outage.

As part of its unfair trade practices and trade war, CCP-occupied China has imposed export restrictions (e.g. April 2025 ban on seven heavy REEs and magnets).

Impact on Global EV Markets

Despite EVs being heavier by 30 % by weight, impacting fuel efficiency and road infrastructure, thanks to climate propaganda, Global EV sales hit 17 million in 2024 (CCP-occupied China: 11.3 million, Europe: 3.2 million, U.S.: 1.5 million).

CCP-occupied China’s dominance creates risks:

Supply Disruptions: REE magnet bans imposed by CCP-occupied China threaten EV motor production (~520g REEs per vehicle) in other countries, thereby thwarting diversification and competition.

Cost Pressures: Indian firms like Tata face delays due to end-user certificate requirements and other intentional delays by CCP-occupied China firms, risking halts by June 2025.

Geopolitical Leverage: CCP-occupied China’s 65% lithium and 80% cobalt refining share creates bottlenecks. The International Energy Agency forecasts a 500% demand rise by 2050.

Global EV markets are facing uncertainties due to technical, servicing-related and geopolitical factors.

The US and India, the Big Two, are in retaliation mode in response to unfair trade practices and the trade war of CCP-occupied China.

U.S. Retaliation, Political Dynamics and Elon Musk’s Tesla - the American EV producer

To comprehend the domestic, at times CCP-backed, political dynamics around EVs in a big democracy like US; the background of EV policies and politics across last few years may be viewed first.

The U.S. federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, incentivises new electric vehicle purchases or leases to reduce emissions and support domestic manufacturing. Introduced in 2008 under President Barack Hussein Obama, it was expanded via the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) under President Joe Biden.

This tax credit applies to SUVs/trucks under $80,000 and sedans under $55,000, assembled in North America, with battery materials meeting sourcing rules (e.g. excluding CCP-occupied China). Eligible Buyers must earn ≤$150,000 (individuals) or ≤$300,000 (couples). The incentives also cover $4,000 credit for used EVs (≤$25,000) and a 30% credit (up to $7,500) for commercial EVs.

In 2024, ~3.4 million households claimed over $8 billion in these credits, reducing prices for models like the Tesla Model Y ($7,500 cheaper) and Ford F-150 Lightning (from $62,995 to $55,495).

This incentive supposedly boosts EV adoption, supports U.S. EV automakers. Critics say this favours high-income buyers and firms like Tesla ($2.7 billion in carbon credits).

Elon Musk opposed EV subsidies in 2021, claiming Tesla succeeded without them, though Tesla benefited a lot from them. After Biden’s 2021 EV summit excluded Tesla, Musk aligned with nationalists led by Trump in 2024, criticising leftist Democrats.

Elon Musk’s Republican alignment and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) role polarised Democrats. The Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report poll 2025 showed Democrat support for EV mandates fell to 78% from 85% in 2023, citing Musk’s Trump ties and Tesla’s $2.7 billion carbon credits as elitist.

In 2025, Musk favoured the continuation of incentives as Tesla’s sales dipped (1.8 million vehicles, down 1% from 2023). Elon Musk also claims credit repeal would hurt GM and Ford more, but Tesla, too, could lose 100,000 U.S. sales annually. Some environmental activists see Musk as a climate ally but distrust his ties with CCP-occupied China (Shanghai Gigafactory).

Tesla’s Supply Chain: Tesla likely relies on CCP-occupied China’s minerals.

Lithium: Sourced from Australia and the U.S., but CCP’s ~65% refining share implies indirect, if not direct, dependence.

Cobalt: Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery (LFP) LFP batteries (Model 3/Y) avoid cobalt; NMC batteries use CCP-occupied China refined cobalt (~80% of supply).

REEs: Model Y motors use ~520g of REEs. CCP-occupied China’s 90% processing dominance suggests reliance, somehow via CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited), a CCP-occupied China company in Shanghai.

Reportedly, Tesla mitigates this dependence on CCP-occupied China companies by using LFP batteries, REE-free motors (announced 2023, impacting CCP-occupied China companies’ stocks by 5.9-10%), and North American sourcing.

Democrats’ Perspective: Democrats view EVs as vital for climate goals (Biden’s 50% EV sales target by 2030). Democrats frame EV credits as job creators. But their excluding of Musk from policy discussions alienated Tesla.

Trump’s Actions Against EVs

Trump’s anti-EV stance, based on climate scepticism and self-reliance, includes serial actions:

Trump Campaign (2024): Pledged to “cancel the EV mandate” (officially tactfully projected as emission targets by the Biden Administration) and repeal the $7,500 credit, claiming EVs would kill 40% of auto jobs. Promised increased oil production (“drill, baby, drill”).

Transition Planning (November 2024): Trump’s team proposed for repeal of the EV tax credit to compensate for proposed tax cuts, offsetting $921 billion.

Executive Orders (January 2025): Unleashing American Energy, the Presidential orders halted funding worth $7.5 billion in EV charging infrastructure (NEVI/CFI programs). The orders rescinded Biden’s 50% EV sales goal by 2030 and signalled relaxing EPA tailpipe emissions rules.

Legislative Support (Feb-May 2025): Backed Sen. John Barrasso’s S. 541 (Eliminating Lavish Incentives to Electric Vehicles Act), repealing the $7,500 credit, $4,000 used EV credit, and charging incentives, effective 30 days post-passage. Supported Sen. Deb Fischer’s bill for a $1,000 one-time EV purchase fee, citing road damage from EV weight, as previously stated, EVs are far more heavier compared to equivalent petrol vehicles.

Big Beautiful Bill (May 2025): Trump secured near-unanimous Republican support for the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (1,116-page Republican tax and budget proposal) passed by the House, curtailing EV incentives. The bill eliminates the $7,500 new EV tax credit, the $4,000 used EV tax credit, and charging station credits effective December 31, 2025 (originally expiring in 2032).

The bill imposes new fees - a $250 annual EV owner fee and $100 for hybrids to offset gas tax losses, managed by the Federal Highway Administration. The bill extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), offering a $10,000 deduction for interest on U.S.-assembled vehicle loans (≤$100,000 income) but excludes EVs from this. The Senate is reviewing the bill. The bill aims to reduce reliance on CCP-occupied China’s minerals and rare earths.

California Emissions Waiver (May 2025): Supported Senate Republicans blocking California’s 2035 fossil fuel car phase-out, affecting 12 states and 30% of the U.S. market.

Tariffs (April, May, June 2025): Imposed 25% import tariffs on cars, parts, and semiconductors.

Distancing from Musk: In June 2025, Trump criticised Musk, accusing him of flip-flopping on EV credits: “Elon knew the bill’s inner workings… now he has a problem.”

President Trump unplugged California’s EV mandates by signing three Congressional Review Act resolutions into law in second week of June 2025.

These serial actions are likely to cut U.S. EV sales by 40% by 2030 and aim to protect 1.5 million auto jobs and reduce mineral reliance on CCP-occupied China. Trump’s actions protect immediate U.S. interests. Diversifying supply chains is a more strategic long-term objective that which Trump Administration is yet to spell out.

India’s Retaliation, Domestic EV Players and Political Dynamics

India is also a big democracy and deals with adversarial half front within similarly to the US.

India’s 100% import dependence for lithium and cobalt (82% lithium, 60% graphite from CCP-occupied China) and REE magnet bans pose risks for which it has promulgated mitigation plans.

National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM): Launched in 2025 with Rs. 34,300 crore; it targets exploration (e.g. 5.9 million tonnes of lithium in Jammu & Kashmir), recycling, and acquisitions via KABIL (Khanij Bidesh India Ltd, a joint venture company promoted by reputed Indian mining companies) of lithium blocks in Argentina and Australia as well as copper blocks in Zambia.

Allied Partnerships: Joined the U.S.-led Mineral Security Partnership (2023), exploring REEs from Kazakhstan, Vietnam and Australia’s Lynas. A $1 billion Australian deal for lithium and cobalt is underway.

Refining Capacity: Public Sector company IREL’s Vizag plant produces 3,000 kg of samarium-cobalt magnets (aerospace-focused). A 20,000-tonne REE plant in Odisha by 2028 challenges CCP-occupied China’s 200,000-tonne capacity.

Policy: The 2024 EV policy cuts import tariffs to 15% for $500 million local investments, attracting Tesla but challenging domestic firms. Rs. 1,000 crore provision in public spending supports charging infrastructure for 100,000 EVs by 2030.

Innovation: Funds cobalt-free LFP batteries and REE substitutes, with IIT Mumbai developing tetrataenite magnets.

India’s indigenisation efforts align with its broader goal of reducing reliance on CCP-occupied China.

Indian EV Producers

India’s EV sales reached 100,000 units in 2024 (2.5% of 4.3 million car sales), targeting 30% by 2030.

Tata Motors: Leads with Nexon EV and Tigor EV, investing $1 billion. Opposes tariff cuts to protect its 60% market share.

Mahindra & Mahindra: Offers eVerito and XUV400 EV, with $500 million invested.

CCP-occupied China's REE magnet bans and other unfair trade practices threaten indigenous and “Make in India for the World” production (~550g REEs per EV vs. 140g for ICE Vehicle). Domestic firms seek tariff protection against CCP-occupied China's EVs until 2029.

India is dealing with the CCP-occupied China threats by short term measures and long term plans for own production as stated above.

Congress Leader Rahul Gandhi’s EV Advocacy

Rahul Gandhi’s propaganda of EVs is notable. In interactions with Naga students and in an important parliamentary speech as leader of opposition, he raised concerns that were in alignment with CCP-occupied China’s interests.

Naga Students Interaction (February 2025): In a discussion with Naga students, Rahul Gandhi “emphasised EVs as part of a mobility “revolution”, stating, “Future of mobility will change everything”. He “urged” educational reforms to prepare for EV-driven industries, framing it as “economic progress”. This aligns with CCP-occupied China’s EV dominance, given India’s mineral import reliance.

Parliamentary Speech: Responding to the President’s Inaugural Address for the Budget 2025 session, Rahul Gandhi highlighted EVs, advocating for EV manufacturing to “create” jobs. He criticised Modi government’s “slow” progress on EV infrastructure. His focus on EVs without addressing supply chain risks fuels debate. His 2008 MoU with the CCP highlights transparency concerns, amplifying suspicions about his EV advocacy.

Strategic Considerations & Recommendations

Demoting CCP-occupied China linked EVs by US and India would impact CCP-occupied China’s 11.3 million EV sales and monopoly over supply chains.

Apropos, these recommendations are made.

U.S.: Expand MP Materials Corporation operations, fund LFP batteries, develop tetrataenite. Tariffs to protect domestic EVs producers.

India: Accelerate NCMM, secure KABIL assets, scale refining. Support Tata, Mahindra and other producers like Tesla if they focus on developing indigenous technology and supply chain diversification as well as resilience.

Global: Partner with Australia, Canada and Vietnam to diversify.

Conclusion

CCP-occupied China’s ~65-80% control over lithium, cobalt, and REE processing threatens EV markets. Trump’s anti-EV actions serve the immediate interests of the US. India’s robust efforts counter CCP-occupied China’s dominance. Rahul Gandhi’s EV advocacy in Nagaland and Parliament lacks a take on supply chain nuance. Diversifying supply chains and innovation can counter CCP-occupied China while also advancing alternative energy and more importantly self-reliance.",https://myind.net/sites/default/files/field/image/77ef6bf3_untitled.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 16:07:09.117941

Are electric minicars the future?: Smaller electric vehicles could be poised to fill the space between bikes and cars as people look for more space and energy efficient alternatives to driving a car or truck. 80% of trips in the United States are under ten miles so a 25 mph limited neighborhood electric vehicle could make sense for some of them. Could lower prices and new technology usher in a minicar future? (Michael J. Coren | Washington Post)

Emissions reductions from active transportation: Much of the literature and research about emissions reduction in transportation is from mode shift, not addressing the potential for changes in frequency and length of trips. New research suggests that mode shift alone only accounts for 1/5th of the potential for emissions reductions. Only changing modes reduced emissions 37% while allowing for changes in destinations and frequency reduced them 51%. (Guo, Bigazzi, Chen | Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment)

Gas stations getting bigger: With many gas stations set to build more charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, they are also getting bigger to accommodate people waiting for people to fill up their batteries. These mega stations, many over 7,000 square feet, had mostly been waystations on interstate highways. But now they are also moving into suburban and urban spaces, conflicting with local land uses and policies. (Kevin Williams | New York Times)

Give communities good design: Basic public sector design including logos and public websites is often maligned as boring and ineffective.

Trump’s parade this year has inspired “No Kings” protests across the country.
Lindsay Koshgarian, program director at the Institute for Policy Studies, said that the parade’s emissions were “egregious” and the event itself was a “wake-up call” about Trump’s priorities.","Donald Trump’s military parade this weekend will bring thousands of troops out to march, while dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers roll down the streets and fighter jets hum overhead.

The event has prompted concern about rising autocracy in the US. It will also produce more than 2m kilograms of planet-heating pollution – equivalent to the amount created by producing of 67m plastic bags or by the energy used to power about 300 homes in one year, according to a review by the progressive thinktank Institute for Policy Studies and the Guardian.

The military parade is meant to celebrate the US army’s 250th anniversary on 14 June – which will also coincide with the president’s 79th birthday. It will feature 150 military vehicles including 60-ton tanks and armored fighting vehicles, and more than 50 helicopters and aircraft such as a Mustang fighter aircraft and a B-25 Mitchell bomber, which were both used widely during the second world war. These vehicles burn dozens or even hundreds of gallons of fuel per hour.

Institute for Policy studies quantified the emissions that will result from the use of those vehicles, using data from the International Energy Agency and publicly available information. The researchers calculated emissions from not only the parade route itself, but also the transport of the vehicles to the event and the upstream impact of producing fuel for the parade.

The large quantity of emissions this activity is estimated to produce is equivalent to those from flying 4,700 people from North Carolina – where the parade helicopters are based – to the nation’s capital in first class.

The calculation is probably an understatement as it does not include pollution from transporting thousands of people, horses and equipment to the parade, or other energy used for the event.

Hanna Homestead, research analyst at the Institute for Policy Studies, noted the same kinds of vehicles deployed for the parade have also been used to transport napalm and other supplies to Vietnam, and are now being used by Israel in its siege on Gaza.

“So we’re spending money to glorify a gas-guzzling equipment used for war, genocide and planetary destruction,” she said, “at the same time as critical services for populations at home and around the world are being slashed.”

Reached for comment, a White House spokesperson, Anna Kelley, said the parade “will honor all of the military men and women who have bravely served our country, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom”.

The president reportedly sought to throw a similar tribute during his first term, inspired by Bastille Day celebrations in France, but was thwarted by the then secretary of defense, James Mattis. Trump’s parade this year has inspired “No Kings” protests across the country.

Lindsay Koshgarian, program director at the Institute for Policy Studies, said that the parade’s emissions were “egregious” and the event itself was a “wake-up call” about Trump’s priorities.

“This parade comes alongside proposals for a $1tn Pentagon budget, along with massive cuts to healthcare, food programs, and an ideological attack on climate programs both in the Pentagon and across government,” she said. “The more we spend on sending these fuel-guzzling tanks and helicopters around the world, the less we have to protect our people, communities and the planet.”

The Institute for Policy Studies’ National Priorities Project, which focuses on budget analysis and which Koshgarian directs, found that the $45m it will cost to hold the military parade would be enough to fund programs Trump has put on the chopping block, such as the two offices enforcing endangered species protection or the development of an HIV vaccine in South Africa.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec89c41a75199f1855a14ff7b934534e0e31ce6/535_0_5329_4264/master/5329.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e848f8fc30bee37eeae5cfc97b35fe7c,N,,2025-06-14 14:08:12.635991

As retirees living on a fixed income in Carson City, we’ve had growing concern watching energy costs continue to rise across Nevada. But nearly two decades ago, we made a decision that has provided us with both financial stability and peace of mind: we installed solar panels on our home.

The very tax credits that made our solar journey possible — and that have helped thousands of families across the state — are now on the chopping block.

Installing solar has allowed us to save thousands. The federal tax credits make solar more accessible to Nevadans—allowing them to save 30% on the cost of the project. Families have only just gotten started using them, and now, Congress wants to pull the plug. If Congress rolls them back, the next generation of Nevada homeowners could be locked out of the solar savings.

We first installed solar in 2006 when NV Energy offered a 50% rebate, and our 36 panels covered nearly all our energy use — shielding us from rising rates. Over time, they lost efficiency, but the savings fully paid for a new roof and the upgraded system we’re now planning. Now, thanks to today’s 30% federal tax credit, we’re installing just 17 high-efficiency panels that will meet 100% of our needs for the next 25 years — something we couldn’t afford without that incentive. If that tax credit disappears, as the House has proposed, our ability to afford this upgrade—and the clean energy future it represents—would have vanished with it.

Across Nevada’s second congressional district, represented by Congressman Mark Amodei, federal renewable energy incentives have generated $11 billion in investment. Already, more than 41,000 Nevada families have benefited from over $151 million in tax credits to lower costs for renewable energy and energy efficiency home upgrades during 2023 alone. Despite these proven benefits to constituents, lawmakers have moved to eliminate the very credits that enable homeowners to invest in solar energy.

These aren’t partisan issues—they’re economic ones. Solar energy puts money back in the pockets of families like ours while strengthening local businesses and creating high-quality jobs with strong wages. Nevada now ranks first in the nation for solar jobs per capita, with over 8,500 people employed in the industry statewide.

As we watch NV Energy repeatedly request rate increases—attempting to pass more costs onto consumers in ways that frankly seem obscene to us—we’re grateful for the energy independence our solar provides. When utility prices go up, our fixed income doesn’t have to stretch further, and our solar panels keep producing.

The solar tax credits make a huge difference between who will or will not be able to install solar on their roof, as we’ve seen firsthand. These credits are named by where they are located in the tax code – this specific credit is 25D. Without these incentives, many Nevada families simply couldn’t afford the upfront investment, despite the long-term savings that come with going solar.

That’s why we’re concerned about efforts to roll back these successful federal renewable energy provisions. We are counting on Senator Cortez Masto and Senator Rosen to support the solar tax credits and oppose any attempts to weaken investments that are already delivering for Nevadans across the political spectrum. We also urge Representative Amodei to support any Senate fix when it comes back to the House.

The “Big Beautiful Bill” from the House has already cast uncertainty over homeowners, contractors, and local clean energy businesses. However, the Senate now has the opportunity to rework the bill in ways that center everyday Americans’ economic well-being by preserving 25D.

Our message to fellow Nevadans is straightforward: solar saves money. Our message to our representatives in Washington is equally clear: support the tax incentives that make solar accessible to more families like ours.

When we installed our first panels nearly 20 years ago, solar was still considered experimental by many. Today, our state produces enough solar energy to power more than 1.3 million Nevada homes. Solar provides over 30% of our state’s electricity. This progress is worth protecting.

For retirees like us—and for working families feeling the pinch of rising costs—solar tax credits are delivering real benefits to real Nevadans every day. This is the success we should continue to build on.

It’s the first major milestone for renewable fuel policy under Trump this year, helping shed light on how the president will approach an issue that proved especially controversial during his first term in office, when he struggled to balance demands from then oft-warring oil refiners and ethanol producers.

The proposed quotas boosted ethanol and soybean interests. Ethanol producer Green Plains Inc. jumped 20%, the most on a closing basis in five years, while Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. gained 4.7% and Bunge Global SA climbed 5.7%.

The proposal also lifted soybean oil futures in Chicago, which climbed as much as 6.2%. Renewable identification numbers, or RINs, tracking compliance with biomass-based diesel targets, gained 20% to $1.16, the biggest increase since last July. Credits tracking conventional ethanol climbed 18%.

The administration is so far dodging one of the thorniest issues — whether to grant some small refineries’ bids to be exempted from past years’ quotas and how to account for any waived volumes. The EPA said it was still determining how to address the matter but expected to make that clear before 2026 and 2027 quotas are finalized.

For biomass-based diesel typically made from soybeans and used cooking oil, the EPA is proposing a 2026 credit-based target it says would amount to 5.61 billion gallons, representing a 67% jump from the 3.35 billion gallons required this year. That’s broadly in line with what had been sought by a coalition of some large oil and biofuel interests, including the American Petroleum Institute and Clean Fuels Alliance America.

Those groups had also pushed for a higher overall biofuel-blending quota of 25 billion gallons in 2026. The proposed target falls under that level the next two years, with the EPA proposing an overall 2027 quota of 24.46 billion gallons.

The EPA plan was lauded by ethanol and biodiesel producers as well as lawmakers from soybean- and corn-heavy states, with Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican from Iowa, calling it a sign the “administration is committed to championing rural America.”

Integrated oil companies have increasingly linked arms with biofuel interests to champion the mandate, as more of them convert refineries to produce renewable diesel and generate the RINS used to show quotas have been fulfilled.

Yet the proposed quotas were decried by refiners that lack enough blending capacity to independently generate sufficient RINs and are uniquely exposed to higher credit costs. They had lobbied the agency for far more modest targets, warning aggressive quotas could outpace production, hiking the cost of compliance credits and putting domestic refining capacity in peril. The Fueling American Jobs Coalition that represents independent refiners and union workers called it “a gut punch.”

“These unrealistic mandates do not just threaten the future of independent refining; they endanger our existence today,” the group said by email. “EPA’s proposal would threaten many of America’s last remaining refineries, deepening our nation’s reliance on foreign fuel imports and sending consumer energy costs soaring. This stands in stark contrast to President Trump’s energy agenda.”

Discounted Credits

The EPA is proposing to halve the number of RINs awarded to biofuels that are imported or made in the US using foreign feedstocks, so each gallon generates half the credits awarded to domestic rivals. Roughly 45% of biomass-based diesel and its ingredients came from other countries last year.

The administration cast the proposed shift as promoting “national energy independence” and aiding American farmers, already on the front lines of Trump’s effort to rebalance trade flows with widespread tariffs. But it will come at the expense of biofuel producers with international footprints, potentially lowering the value of their foreign-made feedstocks.

The EPA also is proposing to lower the number of credits awarded to renewable diesel, jet fuel and co-products from 1.7 per gallon to 1.6, a shift meant to account for fossil-fuel based hydrogen found in most of the supplies. That compares with 1.5 for biodiesel, a similar yet chemically different product. The planned shift responds to criticism from biodiesel advocates who said some fuels have been unfairly discounted.

Companies would also be compelled to keep additional records on their purchases or transfers in a bid to thwart the use of fraudulent cooking oil and foreign supplies wrongly labeled as domestic.

The EPA is moving to set biomass-based diesel quotas as RINs, not on a per-gallon basis, and it is seeking to close an opening for electricity to count as a renewable fuel under the program. That would prevent generating credits from charging electric vehicles with power made from sources such as woody biomass.

“It’s just been very pleasurable, and I can see the commitment and the same concerns that U.S. Steel had about our communities.
It’s a big sigh of relief.” Trump hosted a rally May 30 at U.S. Steel Irvin Works.
It was called a victory lap by some attendees for supporters of the company’s $14 billion partnership with Nippon.
At the rally, Takahiro Mori, vice chairman of Nippon Steel, told the crowd that his company has “deep respect for U.S. Steel and the role it played in building America.” He also thanked Trump for his blessing.","A pair of Mon Valley-area mayors are celebrating a major moment for Western Pennsylvania industry as the Trump administration announced on Friday another hurdle to Nippon Steel’s planned acquisition of U.S. Steel has been cleared.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order that says the deal can go through so long as the Japanese company complies with a “national security agreement.”

The order, posted on whitehouse.gov, did not provide terms of the agreement.

However, the companies said in a joint statement that the agreement establishes about $11 billion in new investments that will be made by 2028.

Investments include a greenfield project.

The agreement also reportedly includes an American CEO, an American-majority board and a “golden share.” which requires U.S. government approval of a number of the board members that allows the U.S. to ensure that production levels aren’t cut.

“We thank President Trump and his Administration for their bold leadership and strong support for our historic partnership,” the joint statement read.

“This partnership will bring a massive investment that will support our communities and families for generations to come. We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.”

The companies have completed a U.S. Justice Department review and received all necessary regulatory approvals, according to the joint statement.

Clairton Mayor Rich Lattanzi, a retired U.S. Steel employee who spent decades at the Irvin Works, took a moment from being out with family Friday evening to share his thoughts.

“This has been a long, drawn-out process and I and some other mayors contributed to the ongoing process of meetings, support letters and media influence,” Lattanzi said. “Nippon, from day one, presented the best deal possible that provided a detailed plan to invest, honor good-paying jobs and provide environmental improvements.”

Lattanzi said he looks forward to seeing what impact the combined efforts of Nippon and U.S. Steel will have on the area.

“For towns like mine, Clairton and the Mon Valley, this will provide the tax base necessary to ensure that our town can survive and grow,” Lattanzi said. “More important, as a third generation steelworker this will provide good jobs and benefits for my kids, grandkids and their kids. This is a blessing and, actually, a bit of history.

“We were at a turning point for steelmaking,” Lattanzi said. “Trump came through and stuck his neck out, and this will be a time in history that cultivates the strength of steelmaking and helping America build its future. I am so proud to be a part of US Steel/Nippon and the mayor of the town with the largest coke plant in America.”

West Mifflin Mayor Chris Kelly said Friday he hosted countless meetings of local, state and federal officials as well as union leaders, U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel upper management in his garage.

“It’s been an unbelievable roller coaster,” Kelly said. “We thought we had the deal locked up several times, then something would throw a roadblock in it.

“As mayors we had very little power, but we supported it through state and federal individuals and hosting a lot of events. … It is the single largest investment in commonwealth history.”

Kelly highlighted the professionalism and courteousness of Nippon leaders during those visits.

“They are absolutely wonderful people to host,” he said. “It’s just been very pleasurable, and I can see the commitment and the same concerns that U.S. Steel had about our communities. … You can imagine the size of the document when you’re talking about almost $15 billion. It is estimated that this transaction is going to save and create almost 100,000 jobs.”

Kelly said he was on the phone with union leaders earlier in the day.

“They’re ecstatic,” Kelly said. “They are busy notifying all their membership that this has been finalized. It’s a big sigh of relief.”

Trump hosted a rally May 30 at U.S. Steel Irvin Works. It was called a victory lap by some attendees for supporters of the company’s $14 billion partnership with Nippon.

He announced several pieces of the overall arrangement between the two manufacturing titans at the event.

Among the details: $2.2 billion to “increase steel production in the Mon Valley,” $200 million for a research and development center in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University and $7 billion for facilities in Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota and Indiana.

How can I make public comments?","The public now has until June 18 at 5 p.m. to send the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency their comments on the draft renewal permit for plastics-to-oil company Alterra Energy. This extension follows a May 28 public hearing at the Akron-Summit County Public Library, where residents expressed their concerns and requested more time to provide their perspectives.

At the hearing, representatives from the Akron Regional Air Quality Management District (ARAQMD) and OEPA shared details about Alterra’s operations and the draft permit, which will allow work to continue while providing limits on the company’s emissions.

Here are some things to know.

What does Alterra do?

Alterra transforms post-consumer plastics into synthetic oil, which can be used to make new plastics or other products. At the East Akron site, located at 1200 E. Waterloo Road, the plastics are fed into an extruder and melted, then heated in a kiln with no oxygen. The material is then sent through a condenser, where it is cooled and the oil is produced.

The oil is stored in tanks, and any non-conductive material (which does not easily conduct electricity) is directed to a vapor combustor unit, where the material is burned using a flare. The facility is required to destroy a minimum of 98% by weight of the volatile organic compounds, the gases that are emitted through this process. Any remaining emissions from the vapor combustor unit are released into the atmosphere.

Why does Alterra need a permit?

Alterra’s first permit was issued in 2012 and was valid for 10 years; the company began operations in 2015. The initial permit was modified a few times, so the permit renewal was delayed, an EPA spokesperson told Signal Akron.

This renewed permit, if approved, will allow Alterra to continue its operations. It would also reduce the maximum amount of plastic the company can feed into its kiln each hour from 6,250 pounds to 5,000 pounds — this change was made because Alterra could not meet the maximum, the EPA spokesperson said.

Some of the concerns at the public hearing were the lack of independent monitoring of Alterra’s production, the plant’s proximity to residential areas and the health impacts of the pollutants released into the air.

The permit is intended to limit the amount of pollutants Alterra can emit and set standards for control measures, operational restrictions, monitoring and recordkeeping, reporting and testing.

What are the requirements for the permit?

Some of the key permit requirements include:

Emission limitations on carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, fugitive volatile organic compounds and particulates.

A leak detection and repair program to identify and address potential emissions.

Restrictions ensuring only end-of-life plastics (plastics that can no longer be used/ plastic waste) from materials recovery facilities, recycling facilities and industrial facilities are processed.

Requirements for monitoring and reporting the amount of plastic processed, the amount of feed materials produced and marketed and the purchaser of the feedstock.

Quarterly reports of the amount of plastic processed and the amount of oil produced and annual evaluations of permit compliance.

An emissions test must be conducted by May 22, 2026, for pollutants including volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants and particulate emissions.

Under the permit, the facility is allowed to emit up to 34.7 tons of volatile organic compounds, 35.2 tons of nitrogen oxides, 13.4 tons of carbon monoxide, 10 tons of sulfur dioxide and 10 tons of particulate matter.

What happens when there is a violation?

If any violation occurs, the ARAQMD will issue a notice of violation and allow Alterra to respond and take corrective action. The notice of violation is also the first step toward escalated enforcement, such as fines or permit suspension, depending on the violation.

The notice of violation letters are public and can be found through the OEPA’s online records system by searching the facility ID (1677011258) or permit number (P0133062).

How does the permit process work?

When the OEPA receives a permit application, it issues a public notice and reviews the application for completeness. Once the permit terms and conditions have been prepared, the OEPA reviews and issues the draft notice and gives public notice.

For cases of what are called significant public interest, like Alterra’s permit, the OEPA holds a public hearing.

After reviewing the public comments made in person and online, the ARAQMD will make a recommendation to the EPA to issue or deny the permit. The OEPA director will take final action on the permit.

How can I make public comments?

Comments may be submitted online or by mail to Laura Miracle, ARAQMD, Summit County Public Health, 1867 W. Market St., Akron, OH 44313.

While the 100-crore project for the second BIM campus has seen a slight delay, officials remain optimistic about completing it by Nov this year. Governor R N Ravi laid the foundation for the project in 2024. With environmental sustainability at the core, officials said steps are being taken to ensure green standards on the new campus. Director of BIM Asit K Barma said water conservation forms a crucial part of the 19-acre green campus. ""The institute will have vayu jal machines in the hostels. The machines, developed by IIT-M PhD scholars, harness atmospheric moisture to produce potable water. By 2030, we expect 50% of our drinking water needs to be met by these atmospheric water generators (AWG),"" he said. The institute, an autonomous business school established and affiliated to Bharathidasan University, will have a small artificial pond for rainwater harvesting and the beautification purpose. Landscaping is also done in such a way that trees would need less water. Besides, only electric vehicles, bicycles, and electric buggies will be allowed for intra-campus travel. ""We want to promote bicycle usage, but EVs will not be restricted. EV charging stations will be installed at the entrance and four other locations, where users can pay through e-wallets to charge their vehicles,"" he said. The new campus is coming up along the Trichy-Pudukkottai highway, which is emerging as a knowledge hub. ""However, taxi services are scarce in the area. So, we plan to have two taxis on the campus,"" Barma said. The institute also plans to set up solar power plants starting with 140kW unit on the administration block and two hostels for about 300 students. As part of its expansion plans, the institution aims to increase its intake from the current 120 to more than 200 students. Besides the five specialized courses that are being offered at the campus in Thuvakudi inside the Bhel complex, officials are considering launching new courses in areas such as executive education, faculty development, management development, and healthcare management. According to sources, if everything goes by plan, the transition of first-year students to the new campus will begin in Jan next year and full-fledged operations of the campus are expected by June. The campus at Thuvakudi may function as a heritage campus offering only major programmes. ""Retaining the existing campus also allows us to preserve the rich legacy of our association with Bhel,"" a source said.

“Our coastal economy, environment, and way of life are at risk,” according to Southern Shores council members.
“Our economy thrives with the tourism and recreation sector employing 85% of its marine economy, contributing 56% to the overall marine GDP of $4 billion,” Southern Shores councilors stated.","From SamWalkerOBXNews.com

Dare County, Kill Devil Hills, Nags Head and Southern Shores leaders have reaffirmed their opposition to the Trump administration’s plans to open leasing of offshore sites for oil and natural gas drilling as a comment period on the proposal comes to a close on Monday.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management published in the Federal Register on April 30 a request for comments on the preparation of the 11th National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program.

The publication initiated a 45-day public comment period and served as the initial step in the multi-year planning process, according to the Interior Department.

Among the 42 executive orders Trump signed on his first day in office in 2025 was an attempt to repeal Former President Joe Biden’s Jan. 6 order to protect most U.S. offshore waters from leasing for oil and gas.

The order applied to federal waters in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Alaska, and the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, though it allowed oil and gas production to continue in the western and central Gulf.

There has been considerable bipartisan pushback from local, state and federal elected officials against attempts by the previous administrations to allow offshore drilling along the North Carolina coast.

In 2019, nearly all of the state’s coastal counties, with the exception of Brunswick, passed resolutions opposing East Coast offshore oil and gas leases and leaders from Outer Banks towns and Dare County also actively lobbied in Raleigh and Washington.

The Dare County Board of Commissioners unanimously adopted a resolution Monday opposing the inclusion of North Carolina’s coast in the federal government’s proposed 2024–2029 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program.

“But the threat…the risk to our community from an economic perspective and environmental health perspective, has not changed,” said Dare County Department of Health and Human Services Director Sheila Davies at the Board of Commissioners meeting on Monday.

Davies said she attended a meeting in recent weeks with other coastal and environmental group leaders that included Kill Devil Hills Mayor Ivy Ingram and Nags Head Mayor Ben Cahoon to discuss the renewed offshore drilling efforts.

“This is critical. Any oil spill off our coast would certainly play havoc with our economic engine, and that’s tourism and our beaches,” said Board Chairman Bob Woodard. “And once again, I’m highly in opposition to offshore drilling.”

“Since 1989, the Town of Kill Devil Hills Board of Commissioners has stated its strong opposition to offshore drilling, seismic testing, and leasing,” according to a call-to-action email sent Wednesday.

“Our coastal economy, environment, and way of life are at risk,” the town stated. “Our economy thrives with the tourism and recreation sector employing 85% of its marine economy, contributing 56% to the overall marine GDP of $4 billion.”

“An oil spill would devastate this vital sector, jeopardizing jobs and revenue while harming the pristine marine ecosystem that attracts visitors,” KDH officials stated.

The Nags Head Board of Commissioners approved a resolution on Wednesday also voicing their opposition.

“The Outer Banks region would assume disproportionate environmental and economic risks associated with OCS development while receiving minimal long-term benefit,” the Nags Head resolution states. “Energy companies would profit from resource extraction, while coastal communities bear the consequences of potential spills, degraded tourism, fisheries loss, and the costs of emergency preparedness and response.”

“There is no equitable mechanism currently in place that ensures local communities share in financial returns or have adequate resources to manage increased risks,” Nags Head’s resolution added.

“For the most part, these things do fly under the radar,” said Mayor Ben Cahoon, who also encouraged the public to submit comments. “Thanks to Oceana and similar organizations who watchdog this, we were given a heads up.”

In an email newsletter sent Friday afternoon, the Southern Shores Town Council echoed their colleagues on the north beach.

“Our coastal economy, environment, and way of life are at risk,” according to Southern Shores council members.

“Our economy thrives with the tourism and recreation sector employing 85% of its marine economy, contributing 56% to the overall marine GDP of $4 billion,” Southern Shores councilors stated. “An oil spill would devastate this vital sector, jeopardizing jobs and revenue while harming the pristine marine ecosystem that attracts visitors.”

“Even the perception of environmental risk associated with offshore drilling can negatively impact tourism, investment, and business development in coastal areas,” said Southern Shores Mayor Elizabeth Morey in her written comments submitted to BOEM.

“The protection of our coastal environment and economy is a priority for Southern Shores, and the long-term well-being of our community outweighs any short-term benefits that expanded offshore drilling might offer to the oil and gas industry,” Morey said.",https://islandfreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dont-Drill.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 13:05:39.366414

EPA establishes the standards through a notice-and-comment rulemaking process with opportunity for public comment and stakeholder engagement.

Through 2022, the standards must be finalized by November 30th of the year preceding the compliance year.

After 2022, EPA must determine the applicable volumes at least 14 months prior to the year in which the volume will be required.

That skews blue, but only by a hair, suggesting that EV infrastructure is one subject where Texans can find common ground regardless of political leaning.
Renewable Energy Is A Key Part Of The Texas Economy According to the Texas Comptroller's office, solar power generated 14,830 jobs for Texas in 2022 alone.
In 2023, Texas produced 108,000 GWh from wind power, and 32,000 GWh from solar, according to the EIA.
Florida came in second, at around a quarter million registrations, and Texas came in third by a nose, at just over 230,000 registrations.","When you think about electric vehicles, the first American state that comes to mind is probably California. Indeed, folks on the Golden Coast buy up more EVs than people in any other state in the country, and California has some of the most, well, let's say forward-thinking emissions laws in the world. But Tesla is actually headquartered out of Austin, Texas, and a new study, coming to us courtesy of Prepaid Electricity (check the link in our sources to read the whole thing) suggests that the Lone Star State could be ready to take the lead in the shift towards a fully-electric American highway.

Here's the headline grabber: Only around a quarter of Americans are ""very likely"" to consider purchasing an EV, according to a J.D. Power study. By and large, Americans are still resisting the shift to electric. But, when we limit the respondents to Texans, according to the Prepaid Electricity poll, nearly half of those in the market for a new car are looking to buy an electric vehicle. Here's what else the study turned up.

The following is based primarily on a study provided by Prepaid Electricity. Additional research has been conducted via government and statistical databases. Any opinions offered thereupon are those of the author unless otherwise attributed.

Texans Are Ahead Of The Curve On Electric

So, here's the thing about electric vehicles; automakers may have pushed a little too hard, too fast, over the last few years, toward a fully battery-powered future. Meaningful change takes time, it's gradual. Old ways are phased out and new ways are phased in. So, sure, you have brands like Ford and Volkswagen retracting their most enthusiastic promises and deciding to let the revolution happen at its own pace. But, that doesn't mean electric cars aren't the future, it only means that it won't happen overnight.

Public support is a big part of that change. If we want infrastructure support for more EV charging stations, if automakers want to sell these things in the first place, you need drivers, and voters, on your side. And the battle for hearts and minds seems all but won in Texas, based on the fact that:

Three in four Texans support expanding infrastructure across the state.

Gen Z and Millennial Texans are especially supportive of infrastructure expansion, at four in five, but Baby Boomers are surprisingly enthusiastic, as well, with two in three voicing support for EV infrastructure.

Of Texans planning to buy a new car in the next year, 44% of Baby Boomers, and 43% of Gen X, are planning to buy an electric vehicle. The number jumps to an even 50% for younger drivers.

EV infrastructure expansion is fairly non-partisan in Texas, earning approval from 84% of Democrats and 72% of Republicans. That skews blue, but only by a hair, suggesting that EV infrastructure is one subject where Texans can find common ground regardless of political leaning.

The Dallas-Fort Worth metro area showed the most support for EV expansion, at 79%. This is followed by the Austin and Houston areas, at 78% and 74%, respectively.

There's Still Plenty Of Resistance And Suspicion

Texans are the poster boys and girsl for American principles of rugged individualism, so you're naturally going to see some distrust and resistance, even among those who are, in theory, fully on board with electric cars.

Two in five Texans feel that the federal government is pushing EV adoption a little too aggressively, and the consensus is that big corporations, plus wealthy and middle-class families, will reap the greatest benefits of clean energy policies, with only 6% of respondents believing low-income households will claim the lion's share of savings. 53% of Texans feel that the state's power grid will need to be upgraded if it's to support expanded EV infrastructure, which sounds like a reasonable concern.

Ultimately, 64% of Texans feel that gas-powered vehicles are a part of Texas culture, and that includes 59% of Gen Z respondents. Honestly, that's a hard point to disagree with, no matter your personal feelings on the matter. Texas produces 43% of the nation's crude oil and 27% of our natural gas, according to the US Energy Information Administration. It's the land of full-size pickups, like the Silverado and the F-150. This isn't necessarily an anti-EV thing, it's just an acknowledgment of gasoline's unshakable place in Texas culture.

Texas Is One Of The Greenest States In The US

If you know a bit about Texas, there's nothing too surprising about this study (other than the fact that 5% of EV owners are against expanded infrastructure, for some reason). Texas littering fines start at a cool five hundred bucks, and can rack up five figures in penalties, plus several months of jail time, for repeat offenses. The state has nearly 73,000 miles of beautiful highway, and they intend to keep it beautiful.

Renewable Energy Is A Key Part Of The Texas Economy

According to the Texas Comptroller's office, solar power generated 14,830 jobs for Texas in 2022 alone. In 2023, Texas produced 108,000 GWh from wind power, and 32,000 GWh from solar, according to the EIA.

The state is home to initiatives like the Clean Energy Fund of Texas, pumping much-needed funding into green energy projects, and, according to the Comptroller, the state boasts more than 15,300 wind turbines (more than any other state) across 100,000 acres of wind farms.

This is all to say that it's unsurprising to find that Texas is on board with the shift toward electric vehicles, and for reasons of principle, as much as practicality. California gets all the credit, but Texas is right there on the frontline with them, pushing for more environmentally-friendly, sustainable energy sources.

Texas Is Already Claiming Its Share Of The EV Market

According to the EIA, California still holds the lead for most electric vehicle registrations by state, as of the end of 2023, with more than one million in total. Florida came in second, at around a quarter million registrations, and Texas came in third by a nose, at just over 230,000 registrations.

If 230,000 units doesn't sound like a whole lot (remember, that's the grand total, not annual registrations), bear in mind that fourth place goes to Washington state with barely more than 150,000 registrations. From there, the gap just gets wider, with New York and New Jersey both accounting for just over 130,000 registrations, and all remaining states not even cracking six figures.

There's no denying that the future is electric, but we won't get there until the public is on board. Any automaker looking to sell more EVs might be wise to look at Texas and see what makes the product so attractive in the Land of the Midnight Sun.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/vlcsnap-2025-04-15-16h18m00s992.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 12:10:03.511624

Indonesia's automotive industry has developed rapidly over the past 50 years and has been undergoing a shift toward cleaner energy vehicles. With the swift adoption of EVs, the country has emerged as a promising destination for nickel investment.

Kukuh Kumara, secretary general of the Association of Indonesia Automotive Industries (GAIKINDO), told Xinhua in an interview that the transition toward EVs has drawn significant attention from the Indonesian public, supported by the government's strong push for the nickel downstream industry. However, building a complete downstream ecosystem requires many more components.

""From the mining process to ready-to-use batteries, there is a huge process involved. There are three main components in EVs: batteries, electromotors, and semiconductor chips for battery management. Moreover, EV batteries are very specific. Even EVs from the same brand can use different types of batteries, each containing numerous components,"" Kumara said.

As Southeast Asia's largest economy, Indonesia is currently attracting numerous international EV automakers and nickel miners.

From 2024 to March 2025, seven EV manufacturers, including BYD, Citron, Geely, and VinFast, have invested in the country, with a total investment value of 15 trillion rupiahs (921.9 million U.S. dollars), according to the Ministry of Investment and Downstream Industry. Together, these companies have brought a combined production capacity of up to 280,000 units per year.

Currently, Indonesia is home to nine electric car manufacturers, seven electric bus production facilities, and 63 two- and three-wheeled electric vehicle factories. According to data from the Ministry of Industry, the annual production capacities are 70,600 units for electric cars, 3,100 units for electric buses, and 2.28 million units for two- and three-wheeled electric motorcycles.

In terms of raw materials, Indonesia remains the world's largest holder of nickel reserves, accounting for 40 percent to 45 percent of global supply.

As of 2023, Indonesia had nickel resources in the form of ore amounting to 18.5 billion tons, with total reserves reaching 5.3 billion tons, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. By January 2024, 54 nickel smelters were in active operation across the country.

While many companies have already invested in mining and EV manufacturing, Kumara emphasized the need to focus more on battery component industries.

""We need to expand the industry, especially in the three main components, including the electromotor, which we are still importing. Also, semiconductors for battery management systems are not yet produced locally,"" he said.

""We want to encourage the supporting industries to grow alongside the EV industry. That's why we should begin identifying which components can be manufactured locally,"" Kumara added.

He noted that by building more industries related to the EV supply chain, Indonesia could strengthen its downstream capabilities, create job opportunities, and facilitate knowledge transfer. For this reason, ""It's interesting because China is known for its strong EV component industry. We encourage our local companies to learn from Chinese firms."" Kumara said.

This investment is part of the broader Plan for Change, an initiative designed to position Britain as a global leader in clean energy.

At the heart of this funding package is the creation of the nation’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network. For the first time, hydrogen producers will be directly linked to major end-users such as power stations and industrial plants. This is a milestone moment that signals a shift toward a more self-reliant and decarbonised energy future.

Thousands of skilled jobs are expected to emerge in key industrial areas like Merseyside, Teesside, and the Humber. These are communities that have long been defined by heavy industry. Now, they are being reimagined as hubs for clean energy innovation.

The economic impact will not be limited to the borders of these regions. The broader supply chain will also benefit, creating opportunities in manufacturing, logistics, engineering, and maintenance. In short, this investment is designed to ripple across the entire economy while reducing our reliance on international fossil fuel markets.

The announcement builds on a series of job-creating initiatives confirmed in the recent Spending Review. At Sizewell C in Suffolk, 10,000 new jobs are expected as part of a major nuclear power project. Meanwhile, a new fusion reactor is set to be constructed on the site of a former coal station in Nottinghamshire, bringing high-tech energy production to the region.

The small modular reactor programme is also gaining traction. This initiative is projected to create up to 3,000 additional jobs and is receiving dedicated funding support. Scotland’s Acorn project and the Viking initiative in the Humber are further examples of clean energy development being rolled out nationwide.

Many of these projects are designed to support industrial sectors that are likely to be among the first to adopt hydrogen solutions. Think iron and steel manufacturing, glass production, chemical processing, and ceramics. These are the sectors that form the backbone of the UK’s industrial legacy, and they are being positioned for a cleaner, more resilient future.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “We are investing over half a billion pounds in our industrial heartlands to deliver jobs and energy security for Britain.

“By building hydrogen networks, we are securing homegrown energy that will power British industry for generations to come.”

Hydrogen plays a special role in Britain’s evolving energy system. It is not just a fuel. It is a flexible energy carrier that can help decarbonise the toughest sectors, from refineries to long-haul freight transport. It can also be used for long-duration energy storage, helping to stabilise the grid during periods of high demand.

Government support is already accelerating production. The continued rollout of Hydrogen Allocation Rounds builds on the early success of the first funding wave, which committed over £2 billion to 11 pilot projects.

“Hydrogen networks are essential for a secure and resilient hydrogen sector, whilst ensuring sufficient energy storage capacity will be critical to energy security and affordability during the energy transition,” explained Brett Ryan, Head of Policy and Analysis at Hydrogen UK.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, added: “By investing in transport and storage infrastructure, the government is rightly joining the dots, connecting already supported hydrogen production with end users across power and industry.”

These efforts have helped attract £400 million in private sector investment so far, with activity concentrated in locations such as Milford Haven and High Marnham.

This public-private collaboration is essential to scaling the sector. With it comes a surge in employment opportunities, not just for senior engineers and executives but also for apprentices, graduates, and skilled tradespeople. Roles will open up for welders, pipefitters, construction workers, and operations technicians, offering long-term career paths in a future-facing industry.

The goal is clear. Britain is investing in clean energy not just to meet its net-zero targets but also to revitalise its economy, build strategic resilience, and create meaningful employment. This is not just about switching to a different fuel. It is about transforming communities, modernising infrastructure, and ensuring that the next generation of workers has a place in the global energy transition.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_ea68647437274045824844bcf0eb01fa~mv2.webp/v1/fill/w_1000,h_563,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/becc64_ea68647437274045824844bcf0eb01fa~mv2.webp",N,,2025-06-14 14:07:26.886974

We know this because coal’s decline happened in both public and private coal companies.
Coal companies themselves have noted the decline in prior Securities and Exchange Commission annual reports.
Asset managers have a legal duty to evaluate long-term risks and returns for their clients.","A core misunderstanding fuels a recent lawsuit that has made headlines. The Republican attorneys general of Texas and 10 other states have accused some of the nation’s largest asset managers of “colluding” to harm coal companies, claiming falsely that the decline of coal is the result of some coordinated political vendetta rather than simple, demonstrable market economics.

With the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission joining the conversation, it is important to delve into the details and consider market trends over the past few decades.

Coal’s decline in the U.S. did not start with asset managers or so-called “environmental, social and governance” or ESG investment policies. It started decades ago, with the shale gas revolution, when fracking technology unleashed an abundant, cheap and cleaner-burning alternative. U.S. Energy Information Administration data show that U.S. coal production was 1.13 trillion short tons in 2001, but by 2020 that number had declined to 535 billion short tons — its lowest level since 1965.

Natural gas outcompeted coal because it made economic sense. It has lower operating costs, fewer regulatory burdens and, perhaps most importantly, reduced environmental impact. Add in the drop in the cost of renewables, and coal’s decline was predictable. Asset managers saw the writing on the wall and adjusted their investments, as their fiduciary duty to their clients demands.

This is about economics, not ideology — business decisions, not politics.

Power utilities, manufacturers and even global markets have made decisions based on price, efficiency and reliability. We know this because coal’s decline happened in both public and private coal companies. Coal companies themselves have noted the decline in prior Securities and Exchange Commission annual reports. Capital flows based on competitive advantage, not political talking points.

What these attorneys general attempt to frame as “coal collusion” is, in fact, a textbook example of fiduciary responsibility and following industry direction.

Asset managers have a legal duty to evaluate long-term risks and returns for their clients. When coal projects increasingly face uncertain demand, regulatory headwinds and operational volatility, it is prudent investing to limit exposure. The lawsuit itself notes that coal production increased (incrementally) in 2021, the first year of the supposed “conspiracy.” This further shows the inconsistency of the argument, raising questions about whether the lawsuit is really about coal or about weaponizing an economic trend — a dangerous precedent to set.

We must be honest about what’s happening to coal, and to energy more broadly. Rather than distort reality for short-term political gain, let’s focus on developing solutions that respect our economic system, support innovation and ensure energy security.

The real conversation we should be having is about ensuring energy abundance through all means. Let’s talk about how to accelerate nuclear energy, streamline permitting for cleaner domestic production, invest in resilient grid infrastructure, and maintain American leadership in next-generation energy technologies. Allowing for a truly “all of the above” energy strategy enables investments in diverse, dependable and secure energy sources.

Climate, energy and market decisions are complex and intertwined. They deserve meticulous debate. It’s time to refocus the conversation on pragmatism and opportunity — not partisan politicking.

We should all care about America’s energy future, and to best do so, we have to stop pretending market evolution is sabotage. The decline of coal in the U.S. is simply capitalism doing exactly what conservatives have always trusted it to do: adapt and allocate capital where it best serves growth, stability and prosperity.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/05/coal_money_istock_0531.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-14 12:10:13.898044

“The Engine Technology Forum welcomes EPA’s announcement today of the establishment of a robust and growth oriented renewable fuels policy. The policy will boost our American energy portfolio, where fuels from below the ground and those from above the ground are valuable and contribute to our energy security and sustainability.

“Today’s proposed rule was boosted by the coming together of the renewable fuels and petroleum sectors around shared goals and vision for meeting our increasing demands for energy. ETF joined fuels industry leaders in supporting the call for a minimum of 5.25 billion gallon biomass-based diesel volume, and EPA delivered more.

“Advanced engines and renewable fuels together are a sustainable solution for power and mobility. Internal combustion engines are key to both producing our renewable and traditional fuels and realizing the benefits from them to power key sectors of our economy. Biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, and ethanol already play a vital role in our nation’s transportation system and key industries. Thanks to this proposal, that role will be expanded in the future.

“Today’s welcome action by Administrator Zeldin ends a period of stagnation and uncertainty for fuels needed to help power our agriculture and transportation sectors in the future. We look forward to working with our members and EPA on the many important details of the proposal on the road to a final rule.”

The Shire of Narrogin, about 180 kilometres south-east of Perth, has been considered prime territory for wind, solar and battery because of its open farmland and proximity to the state's grid.

Projects proposed for the Narrogin Renewable Energy Zone include a $2.4 billion, 168-turbine wind farm of 1209 megawatts, a $400M solar farm and a $400M battery project.

Narrogin Shire President Leigh Ballard said the council had welcomed the projects for their economic benefits but wanted a community fund created so residents could benefit.

The shire recently requested the battery project include a community fund or public art funding, which was rejected.

Mr Ballard said the growth of the projects was putting stress on the community and its infrastructure.

""It's an issue we, as a shire, are trying process, comprehend and plan for,"" he said.

""Each individual project has a small impact, but when you put all these projects together it's a huge impact for the region.""

He said pressure points included housing, roads, general resources, procedures and baseline community functions.

Community fund draft

The WA government released draft guidelines on Thursday which said it would ensure ""all Western Australians benefit from the energy transition"".

It said community arrangements on projects differed and a lack of consistency created uncertainty for communities and proponents.

The proposed guidelines include $500 to $,1000 per megawatt per year for wind projects and $150 to $800 for solar projects.

Under the proposal, a 200-megawatt wind farm project would contribute between $100,00 to $300,000 each year, the government said.

It said the final benefit could differ depending on the size of community and whether multiple communities were affected.

""In sparsely populated areas, a lower … amount may be appropriate compared to areas of higher population,"" it said.

The draft proposed community funds could be administered through local governments or a community trust fund.

Need for legislation

Mr Ballard said the situation required clear-cut legislation from the Cook government.

""Our community is getting told what's happening, they're not getting brought along with the process or involved with it,"" he said.

""We look at it as a bit of social license from these projects, coming into the community and changing our landscape.""

WA Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said the government had listened to industry and communities to develop the concept.

""The draft guideline provides support for the community and renewable energy developers to achieve sensible arrangements that balance benefit for the local community with the affordability of energy,"" she said in a statement.

Planning Minister John Carey said WA was in a ""critical moment in the state's history"" with large renewable projects proposed and under construction.

""It's a significant opportunity in terms of economy, for jobs, and meeting the renewable energy transitions but we understand there are concerns in local communities and what the community benefit will be,"" he said.

Seeking balance

Energy analyst Ray Wills said baseline payments per hour or megawatt per project were a sensible starting point.

He said the direct benefits of farmers and other landholders hosting projects needed to be balanced against the indirect impact on the wider community.

""Because otherwise all of the expenditure that company will look to do will be captured by one person, rather than being more broadly available,"" Mr Wills said.

""On the other hand, not having any of those payments made to the community is going to see a restriction of projects going forward.""

He said any community funding requirement needed to be carefully calibrated so investment was not deterred.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2b03ebe996f5f611ee0e177661318097?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2250&cropW=4000&xPos=0&yPos=375&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-06-14 16:06:48.521614

Solar tax credits can take thousands of dollars off the cost, making solar energy more viable for the average American.
What's being done to save solar incentives?","Solar energy experts are worried for the state of solar — here's why.

What's happening?

Solar panels are a great way to save money on energy bills while reducing your household's carbon footprint, but valuable incentives allowing homeowners to affordably access panels are at risk.

The loss of these incentives could be disastrous for customers and the industry, as detailed in a YouTube short by EnergySage.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expanded the Residential Clean Energy Credit, allowing eligible homeowners to claim a tax credit on solar panel installation.

Over 750,000 Americans were able to install home solar in 2023 thanks to the IRA credits, according to The New York Times.

However, the House of Representatives has passed the reconciliation bill, which includes expediting the end of the 30% residential solar tax credit.

The tax credit originally had a phase-out date of 2034, but if the Senate passes the bill, the solar tax credit will end in 2025 — nearly a decade early.

The effects of this bill could be catastrophic for homeowners and local businesses. Kyle Elpel, the owner of Serv Solar in California, warned that ""a dramatic drop-off will literally kill the industry in about a dozen states,"" per an EnergySage YouTube short.

Why are solar tax credits important?

Going solar is one of the best ways to save money on home energy while helping the environment, but one of the biggest barriers to accessing the benefits of solar is the upfront installation cost.

Prices vary, but the average system is around $33,000 before incentives. EnergySage has quick, easy-to-use, free tools to help you find estimates and compare quotes, and access the incentives available to you.

Solar tax credits can take thousands of dollars off the cost, making solar energy more viable for the average American. Without available incentives, many homeowners would be unable to install solar, and with fewer customers, many solar companies could go out of business.

""We are now 100% running our house off solar with a battery backup, and I don't think we would have been able to do that without tax credits,"" solar customer Sam Potasznik told EnergySage.

What's being done to save solar incentives?

EnergySage urged Americans to contact their local representatives and ask them to save Section 25D, also known as the Residential Clean Energy Credit.

The fate of the incentives is uncertain; it could be valuable to act quickly now and potentially save yourself thousands.

If the Senate passes the bill, homeowners only have until the end of the year to make the switch to solar. If you're interested in solar panels but aren't sure where to start, EnergySage offers tools and resources that make installation easier than ever. With installation quotes, savings estimates, and verified contractors, EnergySage will help you get the lowest price on the best system, potentially providing up to $10,000 off the total cost.

The cost of installation varies by state, as do the incentives. EnergySage's mapping tool can show you each state's average installation cost and specific incentive offerings.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-tax-creditimage-recfrrhtRTgXRf572.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 12:09:59.201923

The administration also planned an analysis of how to meet the region’s energy needs without sacrificing salmon.
When Trump took office and slashed thousands of jobs from the Department of Energy, the commitment for new energy sources died too.
But some Columbia River hatcheries are nearly a century old.","Less than two years ago, the administration of President Joe Biden announced what tribal leaders hailed as an unprecedented commitment to the Native tribes whose ways of life had been devastated by federal dam-building along the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest.

The deal, which took two years to negotiate, halted decades of lawsuits over the harm federal dams had caused to the salmon that had sustained those tribes culturally and economically for thousands of years. To enable the removal of four hydroelectric dams considered especially harmful to salmon, the government promised to invest billions of dollars in alternative energy sources to be created by the tribes.

It was a remarkable step following repeated failures by the government to uphold the tribal fishing rights it swore in treaties to preserve.

The agreement is now just another of those broken promises.

President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Thursday pulling the federal government out of the deal. Trump’s decision halted a government-wide initiative to restore abundant salmon runs in the Columbia and Snake rivers and signaled an end to the government’s willingness to consider removing dams that blocked their free flow.

Thursday’s move drew immediate condemnation from tribes and from environmental groups that have fought to protect salmon.

“The Administration’s decision to terminate these commitments echoes the federal government’s historic pattern of broken promises to tribes,” Yakama Nation Tribal Council Chair Gerald Lewis said in a statement. “This termination will severely disrupt vital fisheries restoration efforts, eliminate certainty for hydro operations, and likely result in increased energy costs and regional instability.”

The government’s commitment to tribes, however, had been unraveling since almost when the deal was inked.

Key provisions were already languishing under Biden. After Trump won the presidency, his administration spiked most of the studies called for in the agreement, held up millions of dollars in funding and cut most of the staff working to implement salmon recovery. Biden’s promise to seriously consider the removal of dams gained little traction before it was replaced by what Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, called “passionate support” for keeping them in place.

The chair of the White House task force to implement the agreement quit in April because of what he saw as Trump’s efforts to eliminate nearly everything he was working on.

“Federal agencies who were on the hook to do the work were being destroyed through untargeted, inefficient and costly purges of federal employees,” Nik Blosser, the former Columbia River Task Force chair, told ProPublica and OPB. “When I left, most things were on hold or paused — even signed contracts were on hold, which is a disgrace.”

Trump’s White House announcement called the Biden administration’s commitments “onerous” and said the president “continues to deliver on his promise to end the previous administration’s misplaced priorities and protect the livelihoods of the American people.”

“President Trump is committed to unleashing American energy dominance, reversing all executive actions that impose undue burdens on energy production and use,” the announcement read.

But the decision could also have some unintended consequences, experts say.

Trump signed an executive order in April to “restore American seafood competitiveness” but in revoking the Columbia River agreement has canceled millions of dollars to support the programs that seed the ocean with fish to catch. He signed a separate executive order on his first day in office to “unleash American energy dominance” but has now reversed a commitment, made under the Biden salmon deal, to build new sources of domestic energy. This week’s action has sent federal agencies back to court, where judges have repeatedly shackled power production at hydroelectric dams because of its impact on the endangered fish.

“It’s tempting to comment at length on the absurdity of the President’s order, including the fact that what he says he wants — stability for power generation — is in fact put more at risk by this action,” Blosser wrote in a post on LinkedIn. “Instead, I’ll look for inspiration to the mighty salmon, who don’t stop swimming upstream when they get to a waterfall.”

Back to court

Before they began negotiating the Columbia River Basin agreement in 2021, federal agencies had been losing in court over the hydropower system for more than 20 years. Judge after judge ordered the federal government to use less water for making electricity and instead let more of the river spill through the dams’ floodgates so that fish could more safely ride the current past them.

The accord with states and tribes guaranteed up to a decade without those lawsuits. Trump canceled that.

The Bonneville Power Administration, which sells the hydroelectricity from federal dams, had more at stake than the rest of the agencies in the deal. When the government signed it, Bonneville Administrator John Hairston said it provided “operational certainty and reliability while avoiding costly, unpredictable litigation in support of our mission to provide a reliable, affordable power supply to the Pacific Northwest.”

In its most recent annual report, Bonneville credited the agreement for giving it the flexibility to increase hydropower production during times of high electricity demand, which helped stem the losses in an otherwise difficult financial year.

A major component of the agreement was the acknowledgment of the region’s dependence on hydropower and the need to build new sources of energy before removing the dams. It offered no guarantee of dam removal.

The Biden White House had pledged to help tribes develop enough renewable energy sources to replace the output of four dams on the Snake River, which salmon advocates have long wanted to remove. The administration also planned an analysis of how to meet the region’s energy needs without sacrificing salmon.

The Biden administration never followed through. Even tribally backed energy projects that were already in progress ran into bureaucratic quagmires. When Trump took office and slashed thousands of jobs from the Department of Energy, the commitment for new energy sources died too.

Proponents of Columbia River dams, including the publicly owned utilities that buy federal hydroelectricity, criticized the Biden administration for leaving them out of the negotiations that led to the agreement.

“I want to thank the President (Trump) for his decisive action to protect our dams,” Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Central Washington, said in a statement on Thursday. He said the Biden administration and “extreme environmental activists” would have threatened the reliability of the power grid and raised energy prices with dam removal.

Even critics of the Biden deal, however, acknowledge they do not want the issue to return to court, where judges’ orders have driven up electricity rates. When Bonneville can’t generate as much hydropower to sell, but still has to pay for hatcheries and habitat fixes for salmon, it has to charge utilities more for its electricity.

“I’m hoping that we avoid dam operations by injunction, because that doesn’t help anybody in the region,” said Scott Simms, executive director of the Public Power Council, a nonprofit representing utilities that purchase federal hydropower.

Earthjustice attorney Amanda Goodin, who represents the environmental advocates who signed the agreement, said the Trump administration’s actions would force a return to courts.

“The agreement formed the basis for the stay of litigation,” Goodin said, “so without the agreement there is no longer any basis for a stay.”

More fish will die

The White House said that Trump’s revoking of the Columbia River deal shows that he “continues to prioritize our Nation’s energy infrastructure and use of natural resources to lower the cost of living for all Americans over speculative climate change concerns.”

Shannon Wheeler, chair of the Nez Perce Tribe, said the damage on the Columbia River is anything but speculative.

“This action tries to hide from the truth,” Wheeler said in a statement. “The Nez Perce Tribe holds a duty to speak the truth for the salmon, and the truth is that extinction of salmon populations is happening now.”

Wild salmon populations on the Columbia and its largest tributary, the Snake River, have been so sparse for decades that commercial, recreational and tribal subsistence fishing are only possible because of fish hatcheries, which raise millions of baby salmon in pens and release them into the wild when they’re old enough to swim to the ocean.

In some years, an estimated half of all the Chinook salmon commercial fishermen catch in Southeast Alaska are from Columbia River hatcheries, making them critical for “restoring American seafood competitiveness” as Trump aimed to do.

But some Columbia River hatcheries are nearly a century old. Others have been so badly underfunded that equipment failures have killed thousands of baby fish.

As ProPublica and OPB previously reported, the number of hatchery salmon surviving to adulthood is now so low that hatcheries have struggled to collect enough fish for breeding, putting future fishing seasons in jeopardy.

The Biden administration promised roughly $500 million to improve hatcheries across the Northwest. His administration never delivered it, and Trump halted all the funds before eventually canceling them with this week’s order.

Mary Lou Soscia, former Columbia River coordinator at the Environmental Protection Agency, said the administration’s dismantling of salmon recovery programs amounts to “cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

“We’re losing decades of accomplishments,” said Soscia, who spent more than 30 years at the agency.

“When the fish managers aren’t there to make real time river decisions, more fish will die,” she said. “Or the watershed restoration work will take a lot longer to happen because you won’t have funding, and more fish will die.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e95a571/2147483647/strip/true/crop/767x403+0+78/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2Fbb%2Fb7ded6764f3b91d4ad2af098271f%2Fsalmon-viewing-area-bonneville-dam-opb.jpeg,N,,2025-06-14 16:06:53.154891

As governments introduced financial incentives for EV uptake alongside emissions fees and eventual bans on ICE vehicles, automakers expected the sale of EVs to soar. However, due to a range of factors, EV sales are lower than they were expected in many parts of the world, with no sign of increasing significantly any time soon. This has encouraged many automakers to reassess their strategies, with some turning their attention back to hybrid vehicles that offer the best of both worlds.

EV sales are gradually increasing, but not at anywhere near the rate previously anticipated for most automakers. Some of the main reasons cited for the slowdown in the growth in EV sales include the high cost of EVs, difficulties in charging – from the high cost of installing a home charger to the lack of public charging infrastructure, and the low range of many existing EV models. Fears over the inability to charge an EV on a journey, the time wasted at a charging station, and the low range of EVs, as perceived by consumers, have led many to view EVs as a supplement rather than a replacement for ICE vehicles.

In 2023 and 2024, the growth in sales of hybrid vehicles increased while EV sales growth slowed, suggesting that many consumers are looking to make the switch but are more open to a compromise than to taking the leap to fully electric. In the U.S. market, several automakers have increased their hybrid vehicle production capacity over the last year in response to the growing market demand. The global sale of EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles increased by 29 percent year-on-year in April, with growth in both China and Europe. However, North America recorded the first decline since last September, amid growing economic uncertainty.

One type of vehicle that is gaining increasing attention is the extended-range electric vehicle (EREV). This is a type of plug-in hybrid that is positioned between conventional hybrids and wholly electric vehicles, relying on battery-powered motors for propulsion and containing a small gas engine that can be used as a generator to charge batteries. The batteries are bigger than those of a traditional hybrid vehicle, while the gas engines are smaller.

EREVs appeared to go out of fashion, or perhaps were never in fashion, with low sales figures for the Chevy Volt and Fisker Karma in the U.S. when they entered the market in 2011. GM did manage to sell around 157,000 of its Volt over nine years, making it the best-selling EREV in the U.S., but it is still comparatively low compared to other types of vehicles. Since BMW’s i3 was discontinued in 2022, there have been no new EREVs in the U.S. market, but that is soon expected to change.

There are several EREVs in the pipeline, including a version of the Ram 1500 pickup truck and the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, as well as Volkswagen models under the Scout brand name. Hyundai and Nissan are also reportedly planning to develop their EREV models in response to increased market demand. Some of these models could offer over 560 miles of range, making them much more appealing to consumers concerned about charging restrictions. Because they use smaller batteries than conventional EVs, they are also generally cheaper to produce, bringing the sales price down.

Eric Anderson, the associate director of Americas light vehicle powertrain forecasting for S&P Global Mobility, explained that hybrids, including EREVs, are a “relatively affordable way for consumers to move up the electrification ladder without a significant monthly payment increase.”

And it’s not only in the U.S. that automakers are turning their attention to hybrid vehicles, as Chinese automakers are seeing a rising demand for hybrids at the international level. In 2024, Charles Lester, a data manager at Rho Motion, said China-based EV makers were continuing to increase domestic sales of battery EVs while responding to growing demand for plug-in hybrids offshore. Lester stated, “The plug-in hybrids have almost doubled year to date in the rest of the world, but the main reason for that is the Chinese exports.”

However, hybrid vehicles even appear to be becoming more popular among Chinese consumers. The Chinese automaker BYD announced in January that it had sold around 4.3 million passenger cars in 2024, almost 2.5 million of which were hybrid vehicles. Joe McCabe, the president and CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, said, “We still see growth in the Chinese market in terms of battery electric, but we see it sort of capping.” McCabe expects that by 2031, there will still be demand for ICE vehicles, including hybrid vehicles.

As consumers worldwide battle growing economic uncertainty, particularly in the wake of the U.S. sanctions on a wide range of foreign goods, many are reluctant to invest in a wholly electric vehicle. Meanwhile, EV makers have failed to provide consumers with the confidence needed to invest in EVs, such as ensuring a lower price tag, adequate access to charging infrastructure, and a long range. This has driven many consumers to invest their money in a hybrid vehicle, seeing it as the best of both worlds and showing their openness to gradually shifting away from fossil fuels to electric.

US President Donald Trump vaulted into his second term in office on a mission to boost US coal, oil, and gas production. As promised, all three resources were tapped for priority status under the “National Energy Emergency” declaration issued by the White House on January 20. Geothermal energy was included as well, and the US geothermal industry is ready to answer the call. New Mexico alone, for example, is sitting on 163 gigawatts worth of geothermal energy according to a new assessment.

Geothermal Energy Gets A Big Thumbs-Up

The National Energy Emergency declaration of January 20 launched with this observation: “We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.”

Two of the most readily accessible and affordable energy resources in the US — wind and sunshine — failed to make the Energy Emergency cut, but these ones squeezed through (emphasis added):

The term “energy” or “energy resources” means crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals, as defined by 30 U.S.C. 1606 (a)(3).

Reading through the list, you’ll see that geothermal is not the only renewable resource to be embraced under the national emergency tent. Biofuels and hydropower (“the kinetic movement of flowing water) are also included.

However, the emergency declaration did not automatically protect every item on the list. Congress also had to pick up the ball, which it has not. At least, not yet. Last month the Republican-controlled House of Representatives sent the BBB — the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” aka the federal budget bill — to the Senate without the tax provisions needed to support the nation’s hydropower and geothermal industries.

A New Era For Geothermal Energy

That’s not the end of either industry. The members of the Republican-controlled Senate are entitled to tweak the BBB to make it make sense before sending it back to the House. Perhaps they will, perhaps they won’t. If you know where your Senators stand on the matter, drop a note in the comment thread.

Meanwhile, the US geothermal industry is finally shaking off a decades-long coating of dust to spread its wings and fly. If geothermal tax credits go away under the final BBB, the timing is not ideal for a geothermal renaissance in the US, but the data center construction boom could provide the industry with a supportive environment for rapid expansion. The US Department of Defense is also pursuing the prize of 24/7 clean power at or near its facilities.

The fact is that the US is sitting on a mother lode of geothermal energy, but until now it has barely been tapped for power generation. That’s because only a few, scattered locations west of the Rocky Mountains provide the right combination of naturally occurring water, heat, and rock to produce electricity. A commercially viable business model is another ingredient that has been missing from the picture.

Well, that was then. All throughout the first Trump administration and into the Biden years, the US Department of Energy was pushing forward with R&D programs supporting new, enhanced geothermal systems, which borrow drilling methods from the oil and gas industry to fabricate the necessary underground conditions for geothermal heat and/or power generation, enabling the industry to spread into many more parts of the US (see more EGS background here).

New Mexico Is Sitting On 163 Gigawatts Of Geothermal Energy

As for how much geothermal energy is suddenly available, the US Geological Survey has begun deploying new mapping tools to assess the power generation potential, beginning with the Great Basin region covering much of Nevada. Earlier this year USGS issued a preliminary determination of 135 gigawatts, which is the equivalent of about 10% of the nation’s overall generating capacity. In contrast, the nation’s current supply of geothermal generating capacity barely registers, at less than 1%.

The Williston Basin in North Dakota is next on the US Geological survey to-do list, but the state of New Mexico, for one, is not waiting around to see what happens next.

The New Mexico Bureau of Geology & Mineral Resources has partnered with the The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the non-profit organization Project InnerSpace to assess their own state’s geothermal energy resources. They came up with a total of 163 gigawatts. To put that into perspective, that’s more than 15 times the existing power generation capacity in New Mexico as in 2023.

The findings are described in a report titled, “The Future of Geothermal in New Mexico,” released to the public on June 12 by Project InnerSpace.

Giving credit where credit is due, Project InnerSpace credits the oil and gas industry with lending its technology to the effort.

“A new report made public today finds that New Mexico’s particular combination of abundant subsurface heat, well-developed technical expertise from the oil & gas and traditional geothermal industries, and support from political leaders make it exceptionally well suited to exponentially grow its geothermal development,” Project InnerSpace explained in a press statement.

According to the findings, geothermal power, heating, and/or cooling potential exists everywhere in New Mexico, not just in a few places. “Almost all of the western half of the state has enough subsurface heat potential for power generation,” Project InnerSpace notes.

For the record, New Mexico currently has just one geothermal power plant on its roster.

Data Centers And The DoD

The new report also outlines policy recommendations to get the geothermal energy wheels in motion, while underscoring the potential for transferring oil and gas employment into the geothermal industry. That’s a key consideration because New Mexico currently bills itself as the second-largest producer of oil and gas in the US.

“The report also noted that New Mexico could be a top state for the development of geothermal-powered data centers,” Project InnerSpace concludes.

As if on cue, on June 12 Meta (the parent company of Facebook) let word slip that a new 150-megawatt geothermal energy project is in the works in partnership with the startup XGS Energy., aimed at supporting its data center operations in New Mexico.

XGS has come up with its own variation on advanced geothermal technology, with a focus on eliminating water from the equation. “XGS Energy’s proprietary geothermal technology, which enables geothermal power production with zero operating water use, will be deployed to the PNM electric grid and support Meta’s data center operations in New Mexico, demonstrating that energy demand can be met with clean, water-independent baseload power,” XGS explains.

XGS also emphasizes that the Meta project alone will increase geothermal electricity capacity in the state by a factor of 10. That will happen by 2030, once the two-phase construction timeline is completed and the project is fully built out.

Keep an eye out for more news from XGS.

The seventh and eighth films in the franchise revolve around a rogue artificial intelligence (AI) entity taking over cyberspace, with different nations racing against the clock to capture this entity and dominate the rest of the globe. The plot today may be different, but the emerging battle for AI-supremacy seems similar.

Recently, President Trump issued four executive orders aimed at unleashing nuclear energy to establish America’s “energy dominance” and maintain national security amid a potential global AI arms race. These orders could lead to the repeal or reform of burdensome regulations that have constrained the American nuclear industry in past decades. Did I expect national security to be a key driver of nuclear energy reform? Not exactly, but this is not an unprecedented scenario.

From the battlefield to the home front

At the height of World War II, nations began working to apply atomic physics to wartime technology. This led to America achieving the world’s first self-sustaining nuclear reaction under the stands of Stagg Field in Chicago. While nuclear technology’s first use was in the atom bomb, its debut as an energy source came soon after with the launch of the USS Nautilus in 1954.

Since then, the technology has had a prominent role in both military and civilian affairs. Nuclear reactors are used to power submarines and aircraft carriers, and 19% of the United States’ electricity generation comes from nuclear power plants. National security had a role in its origin story — and now, it may be a factor in the nuclear industry’s resurgence as well.

An opportunity for Missouri

To win an AI arms race, speed and time are of the essence. Missouri could position itself as a strategic partner by finding ways to more quickly connect new nuclear power to energy-intensive AI data centers.

One policy that could shorten the time of construction of nuclear power plants and also protect Missouri consumers from price hikes is consumer regulated electricity (CRE).

In theory, CRE would allow private investors to create new, independent electric power systems (encompassing both generation and transmission) using their own capital. These private grids would be scaled to meet new demand growth from large consumers. In order for a CRE entity to operate appropriately, it would need to be free from restrictions placed by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC). That means CRE systems would need to be unconnected to the regular grid and serve only new industrial and large commercial customers — like AI data centers.

While CRE could accelerate the deployment of new nuclear power, it could be used with natural gas plants, newly built or reactivated coal plants, solar farms, and other generation sources. The key is enabling private developers to respond directly to the energy demands of large customers.

CRE could not only attract investment but also relieve strain on the primary grid and ratepayers. Rather than relying on ratepayers to fund new power plants to accommodate rising electricity demand (driven by large consumers), CRE could provide a targeted solution. New Hampshire passed a CRE measure this year, and Missouri may benefit from evaluating how its statutes could be amended to allow for such innovation.

By connecting it directly with national security, the Trump administration has made the development of nuclear-energy infrastructure an urgent priority. The mission for Missouri — if our policymakers choose to accept it — is to position the state to take part in the revitalization of nuclear power and reap the accompanying economic benefits. Adopting CRE is one important way in which Missouri could help meet the nation’s needs while benefiting in the process.

On April 7, Georgia Power flipped Vogtle Unit 4 to commercial operation, adding 1,114 megawatts of carbon‑free power to the Southeast grid.

The project blew past every budget prediction —roughly $35 billion for two new units— but the payoff is real and humming. The reactor’s debut closes a long drought in U.S. nuclear construction and opens a new chapter built on safer designs, deeper climate goals, and fresh investor interest.

What makes Vogtle 4 different from your parents’ gen reactor

Vogtle 4 uses the Westinghouse AP1000, a Generation III+ pressurized‑water design loaded with passive‑safety features. Massive gravity‑fed water tanks sit above the reactor vessel; if power dies, valves pop open and natural convection keeps the core cool for three days without a pump or operator. Fewer pipes and valves (about half as many as older Gen II plants) leave less chance of leaks.

The thick containment shell can shrug off an airliner strike or a hefty Georgia tremor. And the entire system comes with a 60‑year license that regulators can extend to 80, giving one reactor a career that spans three generations of engineers.

All that engineering didn’t come cheap. The expansion started in 2013 with a $7 billion estimate for both units. Then came first‑of‑kind component hiccups, post‑Fukushima rule changes, contractor swaps, and pandemic supply snarls. The final bill makes Vogtle the priciest power‑plant build in U.S. history. Supporters respond that every weld, inspection, and lesson learned is now baked into Westinghouse’s playbook. Poland, Ukraine, and at least one Midwest utility are already lining up their own AP1000 projects.

The numbers that matter

An operating nuclear plant lives or dies on capacity factor: how steadily it sends power to the grid. Existing U.S. reactors average 92 percent. If Vogtle 4 pulls the same, it will output about one gigawatt around the clock… enough to light 500,000 typical homes. Paired with Vogtle’s three other units, the site now produces almost five gigawatts, making it the largest generating station in America.

Georgia regulators calculate the two new reactors will displace six million tons of carbon dioxide every year compared with a modern gas plant, the equivalent of pulling 1.3 million cars off the road.

Money flows too. Unit 4 keeps 800 permanent, high‑skill jobs on site and supports thousands more in maintenance, security, and supply. Local counties anticipate $3 billion in tax receipts over the reactor’s life: funding schools, fire departments, and roadwork in towns that used to rely on timber and farming.

The next wave: smaller, faster, and flexible

Vogtle proves America can still erect gigawatt‑scale reactors, but it may also be the last of its kind. Engineers have shifted to nimble designs that tuck into retiring coal sites.

In Wyoming, Bill Gates‑backed TerraPower broke ground on a 345‑MW Natrium reactor cooled by liquid sodium and paired with molten‑salt thermal storage. That storage lets the plant ramp to 500 MW at sunset, exactly when solar output dips. In Tennessee, the Tennessee Valley Authority plans a BWRX‑300boiling‑water SMR at its Clinch River site. Factory‑built modules could roll off assembly lines like wind‑turbine hubs, cutting on‑site work to a fraction of Vogtle’s.

Lessons from Georgia already lubricate these projects. Supply chains are lined up earlier, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reviews module designs instead of bespoke blueprints, and federal loan guarantees trim borrowing costs that once sank earlier nuclear proposals.

Renewable synergy, not rivalry

Clean energy no longer feels like a zero‑sum game. Georgia’s solar capacity has surged over the past decade; Vogtle’s steady output lets grid operators back off fossil peakers when clouds roll in. Analysts compare the mix to a hybrid car: solar for the zip around town, nuclear as the efficient highway engine. With battery costs inching lower but still pricey, firm nuclear watts keep wholesale prices stable and cut the need for oversized storage.

The vehicle was a 2025 Toyota Sienna Platinum in Wind Chill Pearl.

Production of the Toyota Sienna at the Princeton plant began in 2003, and the plant currently hosts 7,650 employees. The current model is an all-hybrid version.

The vehicle was recently honored in the 2025 J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study as the leading model in the minivan segment.

“It’s a significant achievement to reach this milestone and something our team members should be proud of,” said Jason Puckett, president of Toyota Indiana. “The all-hybrid Sienna demonstrates our commitment to electrification and remains a top-selling vehicle in Toyota’s lineup.”

Sienna is one of many electrified powertrain options at Toyota. In May, sales of the Sienna increased by more than 95% compared to the previous year. Electrified vehicles comprised nearly half of Toyota’s total monthly sales during the same period.

Since its establishment in 1996, Toyota Indiana has received approximately $8 billion in total investment. The plant has contributed over $54 million to local organizations.

How Much Is California To Blame? - Politico,Debra Kahn,,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/06/14/mary-nichols-trump-california-clean-car-air-rules-00344370,"It’s those same automakers who lobbied Trump to “rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” as Trump put it Thursday.

California had 12 other states signed on to follow its lead as of last year, but it now has 10, after Republican-led Virginia dropped out and Vermont delayed enforcement by 19 months.
(California and the other 10 states immediately sued Thursday to preserve the emissions standards.)","It’s those same automakers who lobbied Trump to “rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” as Trump put it Thursday.

It didn’t have to get to this point. California officials had been in talks with automakers prior to the November election about how to keep them on board, but the state overplayed its hand, Nichols said.

“Many people were acting on the assumption that it was going to be the Democrats continuing in power,” she said. “So the state felt like they had all the cards in their hand, and then after the election, it was pretty hard to reset the conversation.”

To hear Nichols tell it, California may have gone too far this time in nudging the industry to ever-higher sales of zero-emission vehicles. The rules would have required automakers to hit increasing percentages — 35 percent by model year 2026 and 68 percent by model year 2030 — before reaching 100 percent of new-car sales in 2035.

Maybe that would have worked if it were just about California. But a dozen other states are signed on to California’s targets, and they have been slower and less generous with incentives and EV charging infrastructure. Where California has more than a quarter of its new car sales coming from EVs, New Jersey is at 15 percent, and New York is under 12 percent, according to the industry’s latest figures.

“They were definitely having issues with the California program because they didn’t think they could meet the sales numbers in the mandate, especially [Gov. Gavin] Newsom’s target of nothing but ZEVs with a deadline attached to it,” Nichols said. “That was scary, and even the interim targets were going to be hard to meet.”

The pendulum has swung against California before: The George W. Bush administration was the first to attempt to deny California’s permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to require automakers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles, and Trump went further in his first term by attempting to revoke the state’s already-issued authority.

But Republicans had never resorted to doing it through Congress, via an untested maneuver that congressional watchdogs have warned is likely illegal but that still drew 35 Democratic votes in the House and one in the Senate (Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), in the tradition of Detroit’s John Dingell).

It’s a far cry from the bipartisan consensus that reigned when President Richard Nixon famously signed the Clean Air Act, which set federal air pollution levels for the first time but gave California permission to continue going further, owing to its decade-plus of vehicle emissions rules aimed at the smoggy Los Angeles basin.

The automakers have been steadily lobbying against the rules since then, with a brief ceasefire from 2009-16, when ten automakers and the United Auto Workers signed a nonaggression pact in President Barack Obama’s Rose Garden with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the EPA.

That it happened at the same time that the federal government was taking an equity stake in General Motors was no coincidence, said Nichols, who helped broker the pact. “They saved them from bankruptcy,” she said.

California has less recourse this time around. Where Newsom signed deals in 2019 with Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, BMW and Volvo to abide by the state’s rules even in the event of federal cancellation, he now only has Stellantis, which signed a separate agreement last year that goes through model year 2030.

And several of the state’s allies are peeling off. California had 12 other states signed on to follow its lead as of last year, but it now has 10, after Republican-led Virginia dropped out and Vermont delayed enforcement by 19 months. And Democrats are getting cold feet, too: Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order in April delaying enforcement, and Democratic lawmakers in New York introduced a bill this year to delay their participation by two years. (California and the other 10 states immediately sued Thursday to preserve the emissions standards.)

“If it was only California, I think [automakers] wouldn’t have been as eager to jump in on the federal level and work with the Republicans, but it’s the fact it’s the other states that had the California standards that were killing them, especially New York,” Nichols said.",https://static.politico.com/4b/f9/2ee48f70483ba82b7ae0341bc125/trump-03834.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:08:17.884654

The sector is poised to generate a record level of electricity in 2025, while global investment in nuclear power has increased rapidly over the past four years, with a compound annual growth rate of 14%. That's up from 1% prior to 2020.

The surge is less about meeting climate goals with low-carbon energy sources than about the massive power demands of AI and data centers as the global economy undergoes seismic shifts.

The Nuclear Energy Market's Critical Mass

The nuclear renaissance isn't happening in a vacuum. Data centers consumed about 4.4% of total U.S. electricity in 2023, a figure that's expected to grow to about 12% by 2028. That expected increase is driven by the growth in AI, which requires enormous amounts of reliable, 24/7 power.

Major tech companies are responding by signing nuclear power purchase agreements. Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (META) recent deal with Constellation Energy for an Illinois nuclear plant follows similar moves by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). (For price and fundamentals on any shares listed on this page, click on their market page.)

These aren't feel-good sustainability gestures, but strategic moves in the AI race. ""Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, in a press release.

Core Holdings in Nuclear Energy

Nuclear Stocks

Cameco: The world's second-largest uranium producer offers the most direct exposure to gains from nuclear fuel supplies. In May 2025, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rated Cameco as a ""buy"" with a price target of $65, suggesting an 11% upside. Beyond uranium mining, the company owns a 49% stake in Westinghouse, giving investors exposure to reactor construction as well.

Constellation Energy: The largest owner of nuclear plants in the U.S. that are not rate-regulated. Unlike rate-regulated utilities, where state regulators control profits, Constellation can benefit more responsively from rising electricity prices and growing demand.

GE Vernova (GEV): As a spinoff from General Electric's energy business, Vernova offers exposure to multiple energy technologies.

Nuclear ETFs for Diversified Exposure

Nuclear ETFs provide more diversification than single stocks:

Global X Uranium ETF (URA): With 51 holdings and $3.6 billion in assets under management, it provides ample exposure to uranium producers, nuclear component manufacturers, and service providers. Cameco is the fund's largest position, accounting for about a quarter of its holdings.

Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): Focuses specifically on uranium mining companies, with 38 holdings and $1.7 billion in net assets. This fund targets companies dedicating at least 50% of their assets to uranium mining.

The Small Modular Reactor Revolution

Perhaps the biggest gains are to be found in small modular reactors (SMRs). Over 80 SMR designs are in development, with key competitors including NuScale, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (RYCEY), and Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear energy company that controls over 40% of the global uranium market and 17% of international reactor fuel. These smaller, factory-built reactors promise faster deployment and lower costs than traditional large nuclear plants.

NuScale Power: The only company with SMRs certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), giving it a significant first-mover advantage. The company says it expects NRC certification for its higher-output 77-megawatt reactors soon, which would make them cost-competitive with coal-fired plants.

Oklo: Backed by OpenAI's Sam Altman, the company said it plans to bring its first reactor online by 2027.

The Half-Life of Nuclear Investments

Nuclear investing isn't without significant risks:

Construction and development risk: Nuclear power plants have the highest construction risk among all energy infrastructure, with average cost overruns of 102.5%. This risk extends to SMR developers, most of whom still need to show they can build and operate their technologies economically.

Highly concentrated supply chain: Uranium production is highly concentrated in four countries, with Kazakhstan accounting for 43%, and enrichment capacities are concentrated in only four suppliers.

Political support: Nuclear projects are subject to extensive regulatory oversight and can be vulnerable to shifting political winds.

The JPO agencies continue to communicate with each other and continue to engage together in spill drills and other activities, the GAO report said.","The multiagency group that coordinates oversight of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System needs an update to better operate in changing conditions, said a federal report released on Thursday.

The Joint Pipeline Office, a consortium of federal and state agencies with various regulatory duties, has scaled back its operations over the past several years, leading to possible gaps in oversight of the system that has delivered North Slope crude oil since 1977, said the report, issued by the Government Accountability Office, an independent nonpartisan agency that conducts audits and investigations for Congress.

To meet current conditions, the joint office should clarify its desired outcomes and resume what was once communication with the public about regulation, enforcement and other issues, the GAO report said.

“Redefining and documenting the intended outcomes of JPO’s oversight activities, including those aiming to inform the public of its oversight efforts, would enable JPO agencies to work toward shared goals and ensure accountability,” the report said. It is important to document the expectations, the report said. “Clarifying roles and responsibilities would enhance coordination among JPO agencies and help JPO identify any potential gaps in oversight.”

The GAO report was requested by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.

The JPO, led by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, was established in 1990 in response to the prior year’s Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster. The purpose was to better regulate the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, which comprises the 800-mile pipeline that carries crude oil from an intake station at Prudhoe Bay and the Valdez Marine Terminal, where the oil is loaded onto tankers.

Other agencies participating in the JPO are the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development.

Much has changed since the JPO’s startup, the GAO report points out.

North Slope oil production has dwindled. Pipeline throughput that averaged nearly 1.8 million barrels per day in 1990, close to the peak of 2 million barrels a day hit in 1988, is at an average daily flow of 482,495 barrels for the year to date, according to Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium that operates the system.

Lower oil volume affects Alyeska operations because the oil flowing through the line cools faster, moves slower and drops more solids, leading to more corrosion risks, the report noted.

Permafrost thaw, which undermines infrastructure through much of Alaska, has also affected the system’s integrity and prompted Alyeska to do some special maintenance and protective projects in slumping areas.

Alyeska in the early 2000s launched what it called a “strategic reconfiguration,” later renamed as “electrification and automation,” that increased automation, consolidated facilities — notably for pump stations along the 800-mile line and at the Valdez marine terminal — and relocated workers.

The agencies that are part of the JPO have also changed over time, with shifts in responsibilities and structure.

The JPO agencies continue to communicate with each other and continue to engage together in spill drills and other activities, the GAO report said. But since 2004, there has no longer been a common physical office, and JPO staffing has been reduced. The JPO no longer issues regular activity reports to the public; Its last Comprehensive Monitoring Program report was issued in 2007 and its last annual report in 2005, the GAO report said.

There are now concerns about oversight gaps, particularly at the Valdez terminal. The report cited one example of a troubling incident, the 2022 discovery of vapor leaks at 12 of the thermal’s 14 oil storage tanks. That event led to a report commissioned by the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council that criticized the safety culture at the terminal.

The GAO has issued other reports in the past about TAPS regulation and the JPO. A 1995 report lauded the joint office for improving oversight of the pipeline and terminal.

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.","Small business owners and community leaders from rural regions in Western states including Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah pressed lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week to preserve clean energy tax credits on the chopping block in the Republicans’ “one big beautiful” mega-bill, now in the Senate.

The suite of investment, production and residential tax credits enacted and expanded under the Democrats’ own big budget reconciliation bill in 2022, titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change.

The credits have spurred hundreds of billions in investment dollars in advanced manufacturing and production since 2022, and contributed to job creation, largely in states that elected President Donald Trump to a second term.

Small business operators and community leaders from rural and mountainous areas of the United States that have benefited from the boom in alternative energy sources say the campaign to end the tax credits will also cause job losses and cut options for consumers.

Solar projects in Alaska

Chase Christie, director of development for Alaska Solar LLC, said his company installs four to five large-scale solar projects per year in remote Alaskan villages and also fits and services smaller residential solar installations.

“They take a lot of planning, a lot of logistics,” Christie told States Newsroom in an interview Wednesday.

“For going into a remote village where there’s tundra, we might need to go there in the dead of winter so we can work on frozen ground,” he added. “Other places we won’t go until summer. So we have these large gaps in between these larger projects, and a company like ours absolutely relies on the residential installations to keep our workforce going.”

Christie, who met Tuesday with staffers for Alaska’s Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said in January he let a handful of workers go and paused most new hiring.

“Our workforce is roughly half of what it usually is just because we’re not sure which direction things are going to go,” he said.

Christie was among a dozen small energy business owners, municipal government officials and nonprofit employees focused on energy options for low-income households who States Newsroom spoke to Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement: “Senator Sullivan supports energy projects that lower costs for Alaska. The Senator and his team have been meeting with a number of Alaskans about energy tax credits. As we wait for text from the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator is working with his colleagues to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between promoting stable and predictable tax policy, advancing projects that benefit Alaska, and addressing the need to reduce the federal deficit.”

Murkowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elimination of tax credits

Senators are hashing out language for the massive Republican agenda bill that will extend and expand the 2017 tax law, costing roughly $3.8 trillion, and cut spending in other areas to offset the price tag.

A contingent of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam,” won on accelerating the expiration of the energy tax credits and tightening restrictions on eligibility as a way to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts that Trump campaigned on.

The language in a section of the House bill, passed 215-214 on May 22, titled “Working Families Over Elites,” terminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, worth up to $3,200 for homeowners who make energy upgrades to their property.

Among the slate of other affected IRA tax credits, the House bill also speeds up the expiration of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a credit dating back decades that was updated in 2022.

The credit is available to taxpayers who invest in “energy property,” including solar installations to provide electricity and heat, fuel cells, small wind turbines, geothermal pumps, and other electricity-producing technologies.

House Republicans wrote provisions to eliminate the credit for facilities placed into service after 2028 and end eligibility for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

The credit is worth up to 30 percent of the cost of the project, plus two bonus credits up to 10 percent each if the project includes mostly domestically produced material and if it’s located in an “energy community,” meaning a place where a coal plant has closed or where unemployment reaches a certain threshold.

The bill also repeals a taxpayer’s ability to transfer the tax credits as a way to finance a project, and introduces restrictions on foreign-made components that industry professionals say essentially makes the credit unworkable.

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, as of June 4, the elimination of the clean energy investment and production tax credits will save roughly $249 billion over the next decade.

Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a right-of-center think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Thursday in a new analysis that “The final House bill makes impressive cuts to the IRA green energy tax credits, but it does so in part by introducing more complexity.”

The group is advocating for senators to reduce the tax credit rates and make clearer complicated language, like the provision around “foreign entities of concern.”

Keeping on the heat during a Montana winter

But Logan Smith, weatherization program manager for the Human Resource Development Council in central Montana, argues the credits have been a lifeline for lower-income rural residents.

“If I can get solar panels on each of the clients’ homes, that means that their power is going to stay on in the middle of winter,” Smith said. “Because every winter we plan for losing power for about a week, that’s just something we grew up with. … But if we have solar panels, the power stays on, the heat stays on.”

Ralph Waters, owner of SBS Solar in Missoula, Montana, became emotional when talking about how an early termination of the tax credits could slow his business and result in having to lay off half his workforce.

He criticized the politicization of the tax incentives.

“Montana is deeply red, but it’s also a very practical place. And so green energy renewables becomes a taboo phrase somehow,” Waters said. “The practical energy needs are undeniable, and so if we can get past our disagreements about the phraseology and realize that it’s electrons, watts, and amps. And it’s cheaper.”

Fuel cells vs. batteries

One of the most frequently asked questions in the sustainable transport debate is whether hydrogen fuel cells can outperform traditional lithium-ion batteries. Battery-powered EVs have made significant strides in range, affordability, and infrastructure but still face challenges in long-distance travel and commercial applications due to longer charging times and weight constraints.

FCVs offer faster refuelling, comparable to conventional gasoline vehicles, and a longer range, making them highly suitable for buses, trucks, trains, and even maritime vessels. Fuel cell systems are also less sensitive to temperature variations, providing better performance in extreme weather conditions.

The fuel cell market is leveraging these advantages to position FCVs as a practical alternative for applications where battery technology may fall short. Industry leaders argue that rather than competing, hydrogen fuel cells and batteries can coexist, each serving different niches within the broader clean mobility ecosystem.

The role of policy

Policy frameworks and government incentives play a critical role in accelerating the adoption of fuel cell vehicles. Countries like Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the United States have introduced national hydrogen strategies aimed at promoting hydrogen infrastructure, R&D, and deployment of FCVs. For instance, South Korea plans to put 6.2 million hydrogen vehicles on the road by 2040 and build 1,200 refuelling stations. The European Union is also investing heavily in the Hydrogen Roadmap Europe, aiming to establish hydrogen as a central component of its decarbonization strategy.

While consumer adoption of fuel cell cars has been gradual, commercial fleets are showing strong interest in the technology. Hydrogen-powered buses, delivery vans, and long-haul trucks are being deployed in several cities worldwide. Companies like Toyota, Hyundai, and Nikola are investing heavily in developing fuel cell trucks, with Toyota’s Mirai and Hyundai’s NEXO among the few FCVs available to the public today.

A future built on innovation and collaboration

The future of the fuel cell vehicle ecosystem depends largely on cross-industry collaboration, government backing, and technological breakthroughs. Advances in hydrogen storage, fuel cell efficiency, and infrastructure development are already underway, and companies are exploring innovative solutions like mobile hydrogen stations and hybrid fuel cell-battery systems to enhance performance and convenience. As costs decline and awareness increases, FCVs are likely to become a more mainstream solution in the global transportation matrix.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/06/14/fuel-cell-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 15:05:18.092103

The measure from the Environmental Protection Agency would compel refiners to blend biofuels into diesel or gasoline. Those refiners would have to mix about 24.02 million gallons in 2026, a new record. It's a step to discourage foreign imports from reaching the sector.

“We are creating a new system that benefits American farmers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a release. “We can no longer afford to continue with the same system where Americans pay for foreign competitors.”

Soybean oil prices jumped after the announcement. It leapt 6.3% during Friday's market trading.

Still, other aspects remained unclear, such as whether small refineries would be exempt from the quotas, given the sheer blending capacity that's necessary to meet the Trump-backed standard. The measure falls under the Renewable Fuel Standard program, which was set up by Congress two decades ago to help boost rural communities.

President Donald Trump's megabill that's currently in the Senate includes a four-year extension of a biofuel tax credit, known as 45Z. But it undoes most other green energy tax credits that were unilaterally approved by Democrats in 2022 under their Inflation Reduction Act.

Since IRA’s passage, “Arizona’s economy has attracted 134 existing, potential, and announced projects that would be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits,” said the Democratic governor in a news release. “These projects together represent more than 69,000 existing and potential new jobs, and $58 billion in capital investment to grow the state’s advanced manufacturing, energy, technology, and infrastructure industries.”

Hobbs added that the “federal government should be working with us in furthering Arizona’s economic success” instead of undermining the growth in Arizona.

U.S. Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, both Democrats from Arizona, agree with Hobbs.

“We’ve benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits,” said Kelly. “We see it in the big solar and battery storage projects bringing low-cost, reliable power to the grid and in the dozens of companies who have invested to bring manufacturing here, creating thousands of good-paying jobs.”

Gallego said President Donald Trump and House Republicans promised to make life affordable. But instead, Gallego said, the GOP is cutting jobs and hurting people.

“Targeted tax credits supporting domestic production and clean energy innovation have helped accelerate private-sector growth across the state,” said Danny Seiden, president and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry. “Preserving them is critical to sustaining Arizona’s manufacturing momentum and keeping us at the forefront of next-generation industries.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/a1/9a113f91-667a-4e4d-ba75-07238f8384e8/684ad9eb4aefb.image.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:08:56.039266

As Net Zero Investor reported, experts believe it's now a ""buyer's market"" in renewable energy stocks.

Tancrede Fulop, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told the publication that stock prices for renewable energy developers are lower than expected, meaning it's an excellent time to invest, as the green energy market is anticipated to grow significantly in the coming years.

While renewable stocks have taken a significant hit due to high interest rates and inflation, experts say the market has reached the end of a downward trend and will soon start to reverse.

Fulop explained that prices for power purchase agreements and construction costs for onshore wind are steady, while solar project costs continue to drop. These factors have contributed to a favorable renewable energy market; however, a drop in interest rates would likely facilitate more development, thereby providing additional opportunities for investors.

Due to uncertainties in the geopolitical outlook over the next several years, Chris Berkouwer, equity portfolio manager at Robeco, told Net Zero Investor that investors should stick with companies that have a proven track record of financial and operational success, rather than taking excessive risks.

Although the clean energy market has experienced fluctuations recently, investing in sustainability-focused companies is a wise decision for the future, as the green energy economy continues to grow rapidly.

According to Statista, the renewable energy market is expected to reach over $2 trillion by 2030, with the International Energy Agency predicting that global renewable electricity generation will ""be enough to meet the combined power demand of China and the United States"" by then.

The expansion of renewable energy is also spurring massive growth in clean energy jobs. A Department of Energy report found that green careers are growing at a rate more than twice that of overall employment in the U.S.

As more clean energy comes online, it will not only benefit the economy but also the planet by replacing the dirty fuels that are contributing to rising global temperatures and more extreme weather.

Because of the positive developments in green stocks, Berkouwer told Net Zero Investor that ""expectations have been reset"" and the ""hunting ground for climate transition investors looks attractive once again.""

""Stock prices haven't done well over last few years, but in the real economy clean is booming,"" Aniket Shah, head of sustainability and transition strategy at Jefferies, told Bloomberg.

Despite the declining share of coal in China's power generation since 2007, the expansion of renewables has not kept pace with electricity demand, meaning renewables supplement rather than replace coal-fired generation.
From 2020 to 2024, electricity demand in China grew faster than GDP — averaging 7% against GDP growth of around 5%.
Between 2021 and 2024, coal still comprised 55%–61% of total electricity generation.
Direct local supply of green electricity—such as building renewables near industrial zones or large-scale rooftop solar—is also expanding rapidly.","China accounted for more than half of global growth in electricity demand in 2023, mainly due to its industrial sector, which represents approximately 60% of national electricity consumption. A significant share of this growth is being driven by the production of the ""new three"" industries—solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs)—which together contributed about one-third of the industrial demand increase. In coming years, additional demand is anticipated from increased air-conditioner adoption, EV charging, rapid growth in data centers, and the expansion of 5G infrastructure [para. 1][para. 2].

Despite the declining share of coal in China's power generation since 2007, the expansion of renewables has not kept pace with electricity demand, meaning renewables supplement rather than replace coal-fired generation. In response, China has introduced policies requiring energy-intensive sectors to source a portion of their power from renewables, as a way to encourage compliance and engagement with greener power use [para. 3][para. 4].

From 2020 to 2024, electricity demand in China grew faster than GDP — averaging 7% against GDP growth of around 5%. Notably, manufacturing of EVs, PV modules, and batteries saw output rise ninefold, fourfold, and twelvefold respectively over this period, while general industrial output increased by only 24%. By comparison, traditional heavy industry segments (like steel and cement) grew much less or even contracted. Industrial demand was also spurred by burgeoning infrastructure such as AI data centers, with electricity use in internet-related services jumping 31% in 2024, and EV charging/switching services rising 51%. Projections suggest that by 2030, data centers alone could account for nearly 6% of China's electricity usage [para. 5][para. 6][para. 7][para. 8][para. 9].

However, coal-fired power remains dominant, supported by concerns over economic efficiency and grid security. Between 2021 and 2024, coal still comprised 55%–61% of total electricity generation. In 2024, coal accounted for 54.8% of generation, and renewables about 35%. Notwithstanding record renewables expansion—356 GW of wind and solar installed (equivalent to the entire US wind and solar capacity)—coal capacity also grew, with 94.5 GW of new projects started and total approvals reaching 66.7 GW in 2024, the most since 2015. While renewables’ share in the mix is up 15 percentage points since 2014, coal has fallen 16. The IEA projects coal’s share will decrease to 50% by 2027, with fossil fuels increasingly acting as backup as variable renewables are integrated [para. 10][para. 11][para. 12][para. 13][para. 14][para. 15][para. 16][para. 17][para. 18][para. 19][para. 20][para. 21][para. 22][para. 23].

To encourage renewable adoption, China uses Green Electricity Certificates (GECs), which companies can purchase to claim use of green energy. From March 2024, companies in heavy industries are required to use renewable electricity for a set percentage of total consumption, matching national averages by 2030. Currently, provincial targets are around 35% (20% excluding hydropower), and there is an oversupply of GECs due to a lack of firm sectoral mandates [para. 24][para. 25][para. 26][para. 27][para. 28][para. 29].

Direct local supply of green electricity—such as building renewables near industrial zones or large-scale rooftop solar—is also expanding rapidly. Incentives include zero-cost installation and discounts; for example, distributed (mainly rooftop) PV capacity reached 370 GW (42% of national installed PV capacity) by the end of 2024, up 121 times from 2013. Some industrial users, such as parts suppliers for German automakers, are contractually obligated to use 100% renewables for production and supplement local supply with purchased certificates. Such practices highlight China’s move toward locally sourced and direct supply of renewable power as both policy and economics drive further green transformation [para. 30][para. 31][para. 32][para. 33][para. 34][para. 35][para. 36][para. 37][para. 38][para. 39][para. 40][para. 41][para. 42].

Studies along these lines, using remote control of air conditioners to support the grid, have for many years explored theoretical possibilities like this.
The benefits include increasing the reliability of the power grid, which makes it easier for the grid to accept more renewable energy.
Our goal is to turn air conditioners from a challenge for the power grid into an asset, supporting a shift away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy.
The way power plants know what real-time power adjustments are needed is by closely monitoring the grid frequency.","As summer arrives, people are turning on air conditioners in most of the U.S. But if you’re like me, you always feel a little guilty about that. Past generations managed without air conditioning – do I really need it? And how bad is it to use all this electricity for cooling in a warming world?

If I leave my air conditioner off, I get too hot. But if everyone turns on their air conditioner at the same time, electricity demand spikes, which can force power grid operators to activate some of the most expensive, and dirtiest, power plants. Sometimes those spikes can ask too much of the grid and lead to brownouts or blackouts.

Research I recently published with a team of scholars makes me feel a little better, though. We have found that it is possible to coordinate the operation of large numbers of home air-conditioning units, balancing supply and demand on the power grid – and without making people endure high temperatures inside their homes.

Studies along these lines, using remote control of air conditioners to support the grid, have for many years explored theoretical possibilities like this. However, few approaches have been demonstrated in practice and never for such a high-value application and at this scale. The system we developed not only demonstrated the ability to balance the grid on timescales of seconds, but also proved it was possible to do so without affecting residents’ comfort.

The benefits include increasing the reliability of the power grid, which makes it easier for the grid to accept more renewable energy. Our goal is to turn air conditioners from a challenge for the power grid into an asset, supporting a shift away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy.

Adjustable equipment

My research focuses on batteries, solar panels and electric equipment – such as electric vehicles, water heaters, air conditioners and heat pumps – that can adjust itself to consume different amounts of energy at different times.

Originally, the U.S. electric grid was built to transport electricity from large power plants to customers’ homes and businesses. And originally, power plants were large, centralized operations that burned coal or natural gas, or harvested energy from nuclear reactions. These plants were typically always available and could adjust how much power they generated in response to customer demand, so the grid would be balanced between power coming in from producers and being used by consumers.

But the grid has changed. There are more renewable energy sources, from which power isn’t always available – like solar panels at night or wind turbines on calm days. And there are the devices and equipment I study. These newer options, called “distributed energy resources,” generate or store energy near where consumers need it – or adjust how much energy they’re using in real time.

One aspect of the grid hasn’t changed, though: There’s not much storage built into the system. So every time you turn on a light, for a moment there’s not enough electricity to supply everything that wants it right then: The grid needs a power producer to generate a little more power. And when you turn off a light, there’s a little too much: A power producer needs to ramp down.

The way power plants know what real-time power adjustments are needed is by closely monitoring the grid frequency. The goal is to provide electricity at a constant frequency – 60 hertz – at all times. If more power is needed than is being produced, the frequency drops and a power plant boosts output. If there’s too much power being produced, the frequency rises and a power plant slows production a little. These actions, a process called “frequency regulation,” happen in a matter of seconds to keep the grid balanced.

This output flexibility, primarily from power plants, is key to keeping the lights on for everyone.

Finding new options

I’m interested in how distributed energy resources can improve flexibility in the grid. They can release more energy, or consume less, to respond to the changing supply or demand, and help balance the grid, ensuring the frequency remains near 60 hertz.

Some people fear that doing so might be invasive, giving someone outside your home the ability to control your battery or air conditioner. Therefore, we wanted to see if we could help balance the grid with frequency regulation using home air-conditioning units rather than power plants – without affecting how residents use their appliances or how comfortable they are in their homes.

From 2019 to 2023, my group at the University of Michigan tried this approach, in collaboration with researchers at Pecan Street Inc., Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy.

We recruited 100 homeowners in Austin, Texas, to do a real-world test of our system. All the homes had whole-house forced-air cooling systems, which we connected to custom control boards and sensors the owners allowed us to install in their homes. This equipment let us send instructions to the air-conditioning units based on the frequency of the grid.

Before I explain how the system worked, I first need to explain how thermostats work. When people set thermostats, they pick a temperature, and the thermostat switches the air-conditioning compressor on and off to maintain the air temperature within a small range around that set point. If the temperature is set at 68 degrees, the thermostat turns the AC on when the temperature is, say, 70, and turns it off when it’s cooled down to, say, 66.

Every few seconds, our system slightly changed the timing of air-conditioning compressor switching for some of the 100 air conditioners, causing the units’ aggregate power consumption to change. In this way, our small group of home air conditioners reacted to grid changes the way a power plant would – using more or less energy to balance the grid and keep the frequency near 60 hertz.

Moreover, our system was designed to keep home temperatures within the same small temperature range around the set point.

Testing the approach

We ran our system in four tests, each lasting one hour. We found two encouraging results.

First, the air conditioners were able to provide frequency regulation at least as accurately as a traditional power plant. Therefore, we showed that air conditioners could play a significant role in increasing grid flexibility. But perhaps more importantly – at least in terms of encouraging people to participate in these types of systems – we found that we were able to do so without affecting people’s comfort in their homes.

We found that home temperatures did not deviate more than 1.6 Fahrenheit from their set point. Homeowners were allowed to override the controls if they got uncomfortable, but most didn’t. For most tests, we received zero override requests. In the worst case, we received override requests from two of the 100 homes in our test.

In practice, this sort of technology could be added to commercially available internet-connected thermostats. In exchange for credits on their energy bills, users could choose to join a service run by the thermostat company, their utility provider or some other third party.

Then people could turn on the air conditioning in the summer heat without that pang of guilt, knowing they were helping to make the grid more reliable and more capable of accommodating renewable energy sources – without sacrificing their own comfort in the process.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/06/air-conditioner-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:07:39.254316

The removal of the requirement for the traditional UPS infrastructure can significantly change how data center energy issues are addressed. According to Pasi Taimela, Chief Innovation Officer of FlexGen:

Partnership Benefits

By the end of 2024, over 6400 MW of new data center capacity was under construction, just in the US, and with the growth of AI and HPC workloads, global demand could double by 2028, potentially reaching 325–580 TWh annually.

Yet these facilities face increasing stress on grid capacity, long interconnection queues, and rising ESG expectations. And regardless of the stress level, reliability is non-negotiable. Even seconds of downtime cost $100k–500k/hour.

Tier 0 power security hinges on instantaneous, high‑quality backup—typically via UPS and diesel generators, which are increasingly seen as outdated, noisy, polluting, and too slow for evolving demands.

As local communities begin to legislate controls over data center development, the traditional backup power system, primarily diesel generation, is squarely in their sights as something that requires external controls.

One of the goals of this product partnership is to help define new architecture templates, procurement guidelines, and deployment strategies for BESS as UPS replacements, setting benchmarks for future deployments and potential long-term positive impact on data center targets for net-zero growth.

Why this BESS?

This partnership marks the first utility-scale BESS deployment explicitly designed to replace UPS for data centers. By placing the BESS outside the facility at medium voltage, it changes the perspective, circumventing the complexity and cost of indoor power system rewiring.

The system integrates Rosendin’s patented BESSUPS and FlexGen’s Soft-Grid Interconnect & Island-Grid Frequency Stabilization technologies. The goal is to enable deployment without costly electrical redesign inside the data facility.

The system delivers a utility-scale, medium-voltage system providing high-density, high-quality power sufficient for mission-critical data center loads. Overall, the solution is managed by FlexGen’s HybridOS energy management software, enabling real-time monitoring, intelligent dispatch, and precise transitions between operating modes.

BESS Is the Best (for AI)

This system, deployed outside the data center, on the medium-voltage side, can eliminate complex indoor UPS systems. This not only reduces capex, but also simplifies design, reduces fire and acoustic risks, and improves modularity.

It is also designed to accommodate the energy demands of fast-shifting workloads, such as AI training and HPC, that can quickly scale to tax the limits of existing power infrastructure already installed in existing data centers.

This BESS system is designed to support bi-directional dispatch, enabling data centers to act as virtual power plants by feeding power back during peak demand or grid instability. Selling power back to the grid, supporting utility services, and providing fast frequency response, even while continuing to act as a UPS, transforms the data center into a grid asset, not just a load.

With more locations requiring data center deployments to work with the existing utility grid, this capability is one that can help assure project approval and data center deployment.

Sustainability Cred

To further enhance sustainability and the drive toward net-zero, the BESS reduces dependency on backup diesel power generation and makes for a cleaner grid profile.

The BESS system itself delivers CEBMA-level power quality at scale, meeting Continuous, Evolvable, Black‑Start, Micrologic Aligned (CEBMA) standards, delivering clean, uninterrupted, high-performance power crucial for mission-critical data center, without onsite generators.

According to a FlexGen press release, real world, grid-connected validation is in process with the partners conducting live field tests to demonstrate:

· Existing grid-forming PCS technologies supporting waveforms and response.

PCS firmware upgrades enabling full UPS replacement.

Seamless switching between grid-connected and island mode.

This forward-thinking model supports India’s energy security, clean transportation goals, and the expansion of fuel access in remote regions.
Vijay Nirani, Managing Director of TruAlt Bioenergy, commented, “Achieving OMC status is a pivotal moment for TruAlt.
This creates value at the grassroots level while supporting the clean energy transition through solutions like ethanol and Bio-CNG.
This development coincides with a period of transformation in India’s fuel economy.","In a major step for India’s energy transition, TruAlt Bioenergy Limited, the nation’s leading ethanol producer and a top integrated biofuels company, has received official authorization as an Oil Marketing Company (OMC). This approval enables TruAlt to directly distribute clean fuels like ethanol and Bio-CNG, as well as market traditional fuels such as petrol and diesel throughout India, marking its significant entry into the fuel retail industry.

TruAlt becomes one of the first private biofuel firms in India to be granted this status, joining a select group licensed to market and retail petroleum products across the country. This achievement reinforces the company’s manufacturing capabilities and its leadership in advancing India’s clean energy future. It also allows TruAlt to provide a smooth retail experience, combining both biofuels and conventional fuels under one roof.

The timing of TruAlt’s foray into retailing is both strategic and transformative. With its strong foundations in ethanol and Bio-CNG production, the company aims to offer a distinctive retail model that combines traditional and renewable fuels, including petrol, diesel, E93, Bio-CNG, along with EV charging points and battery swapping services. This forward-thinking model supports India’s energy security, clean transportation goals, and the expansion of fuel access in remote regions.

As part of its OMC authorisation, TruAlt is committed to improving fuel access in underserved areas, planning to establish at least 5% of its outlets in remote regions as part of its contribution to the government’s last-mile connectivity initiative. In the initial phase, the company plans to roll out over 100 fuel stations in key areas of Karnataka and Maharashtra, creating a strong network that serves both conventional and next-generation blended fuels, such as ethanol and Bio-CNG. This expansion is set to generate over 2,000 jobs across urban and rural areas, driving local economies and supporting the broader energy transition.

Vijay Nirani, Managing Director of TruAlt Bioenergy, commented, “Achieving OMC status is a pivotal moment for TruAlt. This milestone allows us to directly address the evolving fuel demands in India while accelerating the adoption of cleaner energy. Our retail network will not only offer traditional fuels but will place a strong emphasis on biofuels and extending our reach to rural areas.”

“By setting up stations along high-demand routes and in remote regions, we aim to foster rural development, create jobs, and contribute to a sustainable and inclusive energy infrastructure. Our model is rooted in empowering farmers, with a focus on sourcing agri-residue and biomass directly from rural communities. This creates value at the grassroots level while supporting the clean energy transition through solutions like ethanol and Bio-CNG. This farm-to-fuel cycle promotes both environmental and economic sustainability,” he added.

As a vertically integrated player, TruAlt Bioenergy holds a 7% market share in molasses-based ethanol and 3.7% in overall ethanol supply, making it a key player in India’s Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP). The company is also ramping up production of compressed biogas (CBG) and is poised to become one of the largest Bio-CNG producers in the country, reinforcing its leadership in the clean fuels sector.

This development coincides with a period of transformation in India’s fuel economy. The country saw a record 239.5 million metric tonnes of petroleum product consumption in FY 2024–25, driven by significant growth in petrol, aviation fuel, and LPG. The country’s petrol consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% over the last decade, signaling a shift in consumer preferences and presenting an opportunity for the next generation of fuel retail.

“India’s growing demand for mobility, with over 2.5 crore cars sold annually, is reshaping the market. Our focus is to build a network that caters to the current demand while transitioning to a more sustainable, intelligent, and purpose-driven fuel system,” Mr Nirani concluded.

India’s biofuel programme has been rapidly gaining momentum, with ethanol blending in petrol reaching 18.4% in the 2024–25 ethanol supply year and hitting 19.7% in February 2025, moving closer to the country’s 20% target. This progress opens up new opportunities for companies with integrated biofuel operations, especially as flex-fuel vehicles and E20-ready infrastructure become more widespread.

As part of its strategy to expand in the biofuels value chain and tap into global markets, TruAlt Bioenergy is making strides in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production. The company plans to establish a facility with an annual capacity of 10 crore litres, positioning itself as one of the world’s largest producers of SAF from ethanol and helping India lead the global sustainable aviation movement.

TruAlt Bioenergy Limited is a leading biofuel producer in India, playing a crucial role in the country’s shift toward clean and sustainable energy. The company operates five distilleries that produce ethanol from sugarcane juice and molasses, with a combined capacity of 2,000 KLPD, making it the largest ethanol producer in India.",https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/TRuALT-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:07:01.476708

Meanwhile, competitors that fail to introduce mass-market EVs could struggle to maintain market share, giving Lucid more room to grow.
But the company has been relatively quiet about its plans for new mass-market EVs, and it could be years before its production scales meaningfully.","Lucid Group (LCID -2.78%) is growing its electric vehicle (EV) sales rapidly right now. In 2025, analysts expect its revenues to jump by 73%, and in 2026, they anticipate an even faster growth rate approaching 100%.

There's just one problem: Included in Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is a provision that would eliminate the federal tax credits for electric vehicles. That would effectively raise the prices of EVs by $4,000 to $7,500 -- a huge potential blow to demand. When you look at the numbers, things could quickly get ugly for Lucid. But there's also some reason for hope.

Lucid Group's major flaw

Lucid's sales growth over the next couple of years will primarily be driven by its recently introduced Gravity SUV. Previously, the company only offered its Air sedan, which ranged in price between $70,000 and around $100,000 depending on the configuration. SUVs, however, are much more popular than sedans in the U.S. right now.

Long term, however, it will be critical for Lucid to develop some mass-market vehicles, which are typically priced under $50,000. Tesla's two mass-market models -- the Model 3 and Model Y -- currently account for more than 90% of its unit sales. Such vehicles bring scale to sales growth, but also to operational leverage, which is immensely beneficial to profitability. If the U.S. eliminates federal EV tax incentives, having more affordable vehicles in its lineup will be crucial to Lucid's growth and stability.

While the company has previously teased plans to launch several new mass-market models in 2026, details about those potential EVs have been scarce. Plus, it takes billions of dollars to get a new EV model to market. With less than $2 billion in cash on its books, Lucid will likely need to tap the credit and equity markets again before these vehicles launch. Over the past 12 months, it booked a net loss of $3.8 billion.

This all puts Lucid in a tight spot. It needs to get mass-market vehicles on the road to boost sales, scale, and profitability. But it will need more capital to do that, and if Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress end the federal EV tax credit, that could lead investors to pull back from the space, limiting Lucid's ability to easily raise capital. That would not be a good position for an early stage, capital-intensive business to find itself in.

But could the elimination of EV tax credits actually end up helping Lucid in the long term?

Who has the advantage in a less EV-friendly marketplace?

There's a case to be made that ending the EV tax credit could eventually benefit Lucid. Demand for EVs would likely take a hit over the short term as the real costs to consumers rise, but if Lucid can get its affordable models to market on schedule, that could mitigate some of the impact. Meanwhile, competitors that fail to introduce mass-market EVs could struggle to maintain market share, giving Lucid more room to grow.

I'm skeptical of this optimistic view. Lucid is far behind competitors like Rivian and Tesla in terms of both financing and the ability to launch additional affordable vehicles. The recent departure of its longtime CEO may put even more strain on its ability to raise capital. In terms of publicly traded EV companies, Lucid arguably has the most to lose due to its diminutive size and limited lineup.

Will Trump's bill cause Lucid to go bankrupt? Not immediately. But the company has been relatively quiet about its plans for new mass-market EVs, and it could be years before its production scales meaningfully. That leaves it with a limited lineup of high-priced vehicles -- not an ideal situation when achieving scale will require it to provide affordable options.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/821167/gettyimages-1330888912-1201x655-4b46871-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:06:36.952385

The patent describes a layered electrode structure that improves ionic conductivity and energy density—two critical barriers to commercialising this next-generation battery technology.

The core of the design integrates a current collector with multiple electrode material layers composed of active materials, conductive agents, binders, and a solid electrolyte made of polymers and metal salts. The electrolyte penetrates the electrode layer along its thickness, shortening ion transport paths and enhancing performance. Xiaomi also notes that this approach is compatible with existing lithium battery manufacturing lines, potentially easing future mass production.

Xiaomi claims its prototype supports a Cell-to-Body (CTB) design with a 77.8% volume efficiency. The battery pack, measuring only 120 mm in height, including the vehicle floor, offers better space utilisation and improved weight distribution. Claimed figures include a CLTC-rated range exceeding 1,200 km and a fast-charging capability of 800 km in 10 minutes.

This development aligns with a broader industry push toward solid-state batteries. Global players, including CATL, BYD, Toyota, SAIC, and BMW, are advancing similar technologies. BMW has begun road testing a prototype i7, while CATL and SAIC target small-scale production by 2027. Toyota also aims to launch its first solid-state battery models between 2027 and 2028.

Solid-state batteries replace the liquid electrolyte in conventional lithium-ion cells with solid materials, promising improvements in energy density, safety, and thermal stability. However, significant hurdles persist, such as limited ionic conductivity, interfacial contact issues, and lithium dendrite formation. Three types of solid electrolytes—sulfide, oxide, and polymer—are being explored, each with conductivity, stability, and manufacturability trade-offs.

Xiaomi’s patent indicates progress in addressing ion transport challenges within thick electrodes, a key bottleneck in fast-charging applications. Analysts suggest this could give Xiaomi a path toward integrating in-house solid-state batteries into future EVs, such as a successor to the SU7, reducing reliance on third-party suppliers like CATL and BYD.

While widespread adoption is unlikely before 2030, Xiaomi’s entry signals growing momentum.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' next-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing machine achieves 100% recovery of imbalance-related capacity in a Nissan Leaf and recovers 37.7% of Rated Capacity in a severely imbalanced Class 3 commercial EV battery pack.

Trial results confirm the real-world effectiveness of innovations covered in the Company's provisional patent applications filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), validating both hardware and software components of its next-generation rebalancing platform.

Ongoing validation efforts span additional EV battery platforms, supporting full utility patent filings and positioning Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a first mover in the EV battery reconditioning and lifespan extension market.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W) (""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news release dated April 11, 2025-wherein the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies"") submitted provisional patent applications (the ""Patent Applications"") with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (""USPTO"") for its next-generation battery rebalancing hardware and software platform-Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has now successfully validated the core innovations described in the filings through multiple real-world preliminary trials (the ""Preliminary Trials"").

In a Preliminary Trial disclosed in the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies tested its second-generation, patent-pending rebalancing machine (""Prototype 2.0"") on a 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack (the ""Nissan Battery Pack""), representative of the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle model in the United States. The Nissan Battery Pack exhibited minor voltage imbalances typical of real-world use. Prototype 2.0 successfully rebalanced all 96 cells to 4.20 volts - the commonly recognized full charge state in the industry1 - achieving 100% recovery of imbalance-related capacity and restoring 1.95 ampere-hours, representing a 3.9% increase in usable capacity. The trial demonstrated the precision of Prototype 2.0 in restoring performance even on a relatively well-balanced battery pack, and supported its scalability across high-volume electric vehicle (EV) battery platforms.

In a subsequent Preliminary Trial, as disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025, Prototype 2.0 was tested on a significantly imbalanced 144-cell battery pack from a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""). The Preliminary Trial was conducted on a battery pack exhibiting significant real-world imbalance and resulted in the recovery of 66.3 ampere-hours, representing a 37.7% recovery of the Rated Capacity, and 100% recovery of imbalance-induced capacity loss. The Electric Truck Preliminary Trial demonstrated the robustness of the technology under more demanding conditions and expanded Prototype 2.0's proven applicability to commercial vehicle platforms.

""The trials are confirming exactly what we filed with the USPTO,"" said Massimo Bellini Bressi, CEO of Battery X Metals. ""To see both passenger and commercial electric vehicle battery platforms respond with full imbalance-related capacity recovery proves our technological innovations work-and it works where it matters most: in real-world environments with real-world degradation caused by battery cell imbalance.""

Together, these initiatives underscore Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' commitment to demonstrating the adaptability, precision, and commercial readiness of its rebalancing platform across a wide range of EV battery platforms. By validating performance on both passenger and commercial electric vehicles - with varying chemistries, architectures, and states of degradation - Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is building the foundation for broad-based adoption. These efforts reinforce its mission to deliver a scalable, software- and hardware-enabled solution capable of correcting imbalance-related degradation that affects millions of lithium-ion battery packs worldwide.

Importantly, the Preliminary Trial results not only validate the technical functionality of Prototype 2.0, but also demonstrate its ability to recover substantial usable capacity otherwise lost to cell-level imbalance. This has clear implications for extending driving range, improving battery health, and reducing lifecycle costs for electric vehicle owners. The significance is amplified in the case of the Electric Truck, where nearly 40% of the pack's Rated Capacity was recovered, reinforcing Prototype 2.0's relevance in fleet and commercial contexts where battery degradation can severely impact performance, uptime, and asset value. The results support a broader opportunity to position Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a first mover in battery lifespan extension and reconditioning, targeting the rapidly growing segment of electric vehicles anticipated to fall outside of their manufacturer's warranty, which is estimated to be nearly 40 million vehicles worldwide by 20312,3.

Looking ahead, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to continue its validation phase, which includes additional testing on a range of electric vehicle battery platforms and high-volume vehicle models. These efforts are designed to support the Company's progression from provisional to full utility patent applications, while also verifying system compatibility across multiple lithium-ion chemistries and configurations. This ongoing validation will play a critical role in expanding market readiness and demonstrating the commercial potential of Prototype 2.0 across both private and fleet-based EV markets.

This milestone strengthens Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' strategic position as a first mover in the emerging EV battery rebalancing market, with a focus on extending battery life, reducing waste, and improving performance for electric vehicle owners and fleet operators.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 20234. With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units5, a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years.

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage6,7. This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements8. As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the NRC, focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced - one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC - resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

What is Battery Rebalancing?

Patent Applications

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' first patent application, method and system for battery pack adjustment, introduces a novel solution to address the common issue of imbalanced battery cells within a battery pack - an issue that leads to reduced capacity, safety concerns, and shortened lifespan. In most battery packs, cells charge and discharge at different rates due to variations in manufacturing, internal resistance, and temperature, which causes some cells to reach full charge or depletion before others. As a result, traditional battery management systems (BMS) cut off charging or discharging based on the weakest cell, wasting the remaining potential of other cells. This invention solves that problem through a smart system that continuously monitors and adjusts the state of charge (SOC) of each group of cells (referred to as ""strings""). The system includes a display controller (which manages operations), a charger and discharger (handling overall energy flow), and an equalizer (which precisely adjusts each string). By allocating charge and discharge intelligently across the cells, the system ensures they all reach full capacity and deplete evenly, thereby maximizing usable energy, detecting early signs of degradation, enhancing safety, and extending the overall life of the battery pack.

The second patent application, for two-wire charging and remote voltage detection, presents a streamlined method to charge a battery and measure its voltage using only two wires-significantly reducing system complexity and hardware costs. In conventional battery systems, separate wires or sensors are typically required to monitor voltage during charging, which adds material costs and design challenges, especially in large-scale applications like electric vehicles or grid storage. This invention enables both functions over the same wire pair by briefly pausing the charge current, opening a switch, and using that moment to measure the battery's voltage through the same lines. A pulse isolation drive circuit is used to manage this operation safely and reliably, even when voltage levels are floating or unstable. The result is a simplified yet highly accurate system that maintains the integrity of voltage readings while eliminating the need for redundant hardware. This two-wire approach offers a more efficient and cost-effective solution for modern battery systems that demand reliability, safety, and scalability.

News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' next-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing machine achieves 100% recovery of imbalance-related capacity in a Nissan Leaf and recovers 37.7% of Rated Capacity in a severely imbalanced Class 3 commercial EV battery pack.

Trial results confirm the real-world effectiveness of innovations covered in the Company's provisional patent applications filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), validating both hardware and software components of its next-generation rebalancing platform.

Ongoing validation efforts span additional EV battery platforms, supporting full utility patent filings and positioning Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a first mover in the EV battery reconditioning and lifespan extension market.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W) (""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news release dated April 11, 2025-wherein the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies"") submitted provisional patent applications (the ""Patent Applications"") with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (""USPTO"") for its next-generation battery rebalancing hardware and software platform-Battery X Rebalancing Technologies has now successfully validated the core innovations described in the filings through multiple real-world preliminary trials (the ""Preliminary Trials"").

In a Preliminary Trial disclosed in the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies tested its second-generation, patent-pending rebalancing machine (""Prototype 2.0"") on a 96-cell Nissan Leaf battery pack (the ""Nissan Battery Pack""), representative of the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle model in the United States. The Nissan Battery Pack exhibited minor voltage imbalances typical of real-world use. Prototype 2.0 successfully rebalanced all 96 cells to 4.20 volts - the commonly recognized full charge state in the industry1 - achieving 100% recovery of imbalance-related capacity and restoring 1.95 ampere-hours, representing a 3.9% increase in usable capacity. The trial demonstrated the precision of Prototype 2.0 in restoring performance even on a relatively well-balanced battery pack, and supported its scalability across high-volume electric vehicle (EV) battery platforms.

In a subsequent Preliminary Trial, as disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 6, 2025, Prototype 2.0 was tested on a significantly imbalanced 144-cell battery pack from a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""). The Preliminary Trial was conducted on a battery pack exhibiting significant real-world imbalance and resulted in the recovery of 66.3 ampere-hours, representing a 37.7% recovery of the Rated Capacity, and 100% recovery of imbalance-induced capacity loss. The Electric Truck Preliminary Trial demonstrated the robustness of the technology under more demanding conditions and expanded Prototype 2.0's proven applicability to commercial vehicle platforms.

""The trials are confirming exactly what we filed with the USPTO,"" said Massimo Bellini Bressi, CEO of Battery X Metals. ""To see both passenger and commercial electric vehicle battery platforms respond with full imbalance-related capacity recovery proves our technological innovations work-and it works where it matters most: in real-world environments with real-world degradation caused by battery cell imbalance.""

Prototype 2.0

Together, these initiatives underscore Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' commitment to demonstrating the adaptability, precision, and commercial readiness of its rebalancing platform across a wide range of EV battery platforms. By validating performance on both passenger and commercial electric vehicles - with varying chemistries, architectures, and states of degradation - Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is building the foundation for broad-based adoption. These efforts reinforce its mission to deliver a scalable, software- and hardware-enabled solution capable of correcting imbalance-related degradation that affects millions of lithium-ion battery packs worldwide.

Importantly, the Preliminary Trial results not only validate the technical functionality of Prototype 2.0, but also demonstrate its ability to recover substantial usable capacity otherwise lost to cell-level imbalance. This has clear implications for extending driving range, improving battery health, and reducing lifecycle costs for electric vehicle owners. The significance is amplified in the case of the Electric Truck, where nearly 40% of the pack's Rated Capacity was recovered, reinforcing Prototype 2.0's relevance in fleet and commercial contexts where battery degradation can severely impact performance, uptime, and asset value. The results support a broader opportunity to position Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a first mover in battery lifespan extension and reconditioning, targeting the rapidly growing segment of electric vehicles anticipated to fall outside of their manufacturer's warranty, which is estimated to be nearly 40 million vehicles worldwide by 20312,3.

Looking ahead, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies plans to continue its validation phase, which includes additional testing on a range of electric vehicle battery platforms and high-volume vehicle models. These efforts are designed to support the Company's progression from provisional to full utility patent applications, while also verifying system compatibility across multiple lithium-ion chemistries and configurations. This ongoing validation will play a critical role in expanding market readiness and demonstrating the commercial potential of Prototype 2.0 across both private and fleet-based EV markets.

This milestone strengthens Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' strategic position as a first mover in the emerging EV battery rebalancing market, with a focus on extending battery life, reducing waste, and improving performance for electric vehicle owners and fleet operators.

Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the US and to support American jobs.","It's no secret that every automaker is currently scrambling to adjust its production output and sales forecast in response to the new US tariffs on vehicle and parts imports. Some companies have already decided to raise prices, some have shifted production allocation away from other North American markets to keep cars within the US, and some are still negotiating to work out their own trade deal, like the Japanese bloc of carmakers. Today, General Motors has reacted, in part, by announcing a fresh investment of nearly $4 billion into US manufacturing for next-gen vehicles over the next two years, including the hotly anticipated and hopefully affordable 2027 Chevy Bolt EV comeback.

Bolting Back

The Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV went out of production by December 2023 at the GM Fairfax plant in Kansas, which is now retooling for the expected return of the Bolt model for the 2027 model year. Chevrolet says that next-gen Bolt production could start as early as the end of this year. The Fairfax plant is said to build ""next-generation affordable EVs,"" but it's not clear if that means more models than the Bolt, or if GM is planning to do a Bolt EV hatch and EUV crossover duo again.

We'll see soon enough, it sounds like. The GM Fairfax assembly plant will also begin building the gas-powered Equinox SUV starting in 2027, which will also be built in Mexico, likely localized to each market and not for cross-border sales.

Other Production Shifts

GM has already announced that it would scale back full-size truck production in Canada and scale it up at its Fort Wayne, Indiana plant instead. GM’s Spring Hill, which currently builds the Cadillac XT5 and Cadillac Lyriq and Cadillac Vistiq EVs, will get a next-gen gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer SUV in 2027. Gas-powered Blazer production is then expected to cease at GM's Ramos Arizpe, Mexico facility, which will continue to build gas-powered Equinox SUVs for non-US markets.

The GM Orion Assembly plant in Michigan has been offline for retooling since 2023, has swapped initial plans to build new EV trucks, and instead will churn out full-size gas SUVs and trucks by early 2027. EV models will continue to be assembled in the Factory Zero plant in Michigan; those models include the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Hummer EV, and the Cadillac Escalade IQ electric SUV.

Experts say the spike is being fueled by rising costs linked to tariffs, especially on imported components and finished goods often used in appliance manufacturing.
What’s behind the spike in appliance prices?
The backstory: Major appliances—such as refrigerators, washing machines, and ovens—often include components made overseas, even if they’re assembled in the U.S.
The latest inflation data shows appliance prices were up even more than most other consumer goods.","After two years of falling prices, appliances are suddenly getting more expensive—and trade policy may be the reason.

According to the latest Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the cost of major household appliances jumped 4.3% in May compared to April. That’s the sharpest month-over-month increase in over a year, and a major reversal after a period of steady deflation in 2023 and 2024.

Experts say the spike is being fueled by rising costs linked to tariffs, especially on imported components and finished goods often used in appliance manufacturing.

What’s behind the spike in appliance prices?

The backstory:

Major appliances—such as refrigerators, washing machines, and ovens—often include components made overseas, even if they’re assembled in the U.S. When tariffs are placed on imported goods, those costs are passed along to manufacturers, and increasingly, to shoppers.

""Refrigerators, dishwashers and washing machines are particularly vulnerable because they often include a high percentage of foreign components—even when final assembly happens in the U.S.,"" David Warrick, executive vice president at supply chain platform Overhaul, told CNET.

The latest inflation data shows appliance prices were up even more than most other consumer goods. In April, only newspapers and magazines saw a bigger monthly jump.

How are companies and consumers responding?

What they're saying:

Some manufacturers are already preparing to raise prices further. In April, appliance giant LG told Reuters it was considering price increases on certain U.S. products.

That announcement has some consumers rushing to buy before prices climb again. ""We’re going to maybe see another 10% price increase come June,"" said Joseph Legato, CEO of Bill & Rod’s Appliance in Livonia, Michigan, in an interview with WXYZ Detroit. ""What we are recommending is make sure people take advantage of the promotional times that are coming up.""

Could prices rise even more this summer?

What's next:

The U.S. Department of Energy announced in February that it would delay some energy-efficiency requirements for washers and dryers in an attempt to lower costs, but analysts say tariffs will likely continue putting upward pressure on prices—especially as trade policies evolve.

EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026 – a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.
It said it projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons.
Previously, the EPA projected the average gallon of biomass-based diesel generated 1.6 RINs.
The volume mandate for 2025 for biomass-based diesel was 3.35 billion gallons, a figure the industry had complained was too low.","New York — President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday proposed to increase the amount of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation’s fuel mix over the next two years, driven by a surge in biomass-based diesel mandates.

After months of lobbying on the issue, the biofuels industry welcomed the move, which also included measures to discourage biofuel imports.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuels into the U.S. fuel supply or purchase credits, called RINs, from those that do.

The proposal is driven in part by an increase in biomass-based diesel requirements. EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026 – a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.

It said it projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons. The EPA expressed the biomass-based diesel requirement in billion RINs in accordance with the agency’s proposal to reduce the number of RINs that could be generated from imported biofuels.

After accounting for the reduction for imported biofuels, the EPA said it projected the number of RINs generated for biomass-based diesel would be 1.27 per gallon in 2026 and 1.28 RINs per gallon in 2027. Previously, the EPA projected the average gallon of biomass-based diesel generated 1.6 RINs.

The volume mandate for 2025 for biomass-based diesel was 3.35 billion gallons, a figure the industry had complained was too low.

Renewable fuel (D6) credits for 2025 traded as high as $1.06 each on Friday, up from 88 cents the previous session, traders said.

Biomass-based (D4) credits traded as much as $1.17 each, versus between $1.05 and $1.01 the previous session, traders said.

The oil and biofuel industries, both powerful lobbies in Washington, have highly anticipated the release of the proposal, which, if finalized, determines the fate of billions of dollars in fuel and tradable credit transactions.

As one of the first decisions made by the current Trump administration regarding federal biofuel policy, the proposal signaled the administration’s support for the biofuels industry, which has at times been at odds with oil companies.

A coalition of oil and biofuel groups banded together in a historically unusual move this year to request biomass diesel blending for 2026 at 5.25 billion gallons, compared with 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The coalition, led by the American Petroleum Institute, argued that the EPA’s previous mandates failed to support the growth of the advanced biofuel industry and undercut the market.

Biofuel advocates cheered the proposal.

“USDA and EPA have never been more aligned on the need for more American-grown biofuels,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins.

“The volumes proposed today provide crucial growth opportunities for U.S. ethanol producers and farmers,” said Renewable Fuels Association President Geoff Cooper.

Though GM continues to assert its belief in an “all-EV future,” the new investment signals a recalibration in response to changing political, economic, and consumer dynamics.
Still, analysts suggest the 2035 pledge was more symbolic than practical.
In another telling sign, GM recently cancelled plans to produce electric motors in Buffalo, New York, redirecting nearly $900 million into V-8 engine production instead.
“Given the current market and regulatory climate,” Abuelsamid concluded, “GM’s pivot is not surprising – it was always a long shot.”","General Motors (GM) has taken a major step back from its once-bold pledge to sell only electric vehicles (EVs) by 2035, opting instead for a more balanced production strategy. The Detroit automaker revealed this week that it will invest $4 billion in expanding production of petrol-powered vehicles, a move industry analysts see as effectively shelving the original EV-only ambition.

Though GM continues to assert its belief in an “all-EV future,” the new investment signals a recalibration in response to changing political, economic, and consumer dynamics. “They’re not abandoning EVs, but this investment shows they no longer see 2035 as a realistic target,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an auto analyst at Detroit-based research firm Telemetry told Politico.

GM’s revised strategy reflects broader challenges in the EV sector. Since the company unveiled its goal in 2021, momentum has slowed. The initial optimism under the Biden administration, which introduced EV incentives and green infrastructure plans, has given way to a more conservative stance under President Trump. Federal support for EVs has been reduced, new tariffs have been introduced, and public enthusiasm has cooled, prompting automakers to hedge their bets.

Despite the strategic pivot, GM reported 37,000 EVs sold in Q1 2025, securing its position as the second-largest EV seller in the U.S. behind Tesla. Still, analysts suggest the 2035 pledge was more symbolic than practical. “It was always aspirational,” said independent analyst Alan Baum. “They’ve outperformed many competitors, but policy gaps and market reluctance are limiting growth.”

GM’s current restructuring includes relocating production of petrol vehicles from Mexico to U.S. plants to dodge new tariffs. The company’s Orion plant in Michigan will now handle full-size SUV and pickup production, while the Equinox will shift to Fairfax, Kansas, and the Blazer to Spring Hill, Tennessee.

Meanwhile, EV manufacturing will continue at Factory Zero in Detroit, though it is operating below capacity. That plant will produce electric Silverados, Sierras, Escalades, and the Hummer EV. The upcoming Chevrolet Bolt reboot will be built in Fairfax.

In another telling sign, GM recently cancelled plans to produce electric motors in Buffalo, New York, redirecting nearly $900 million into V-8 engine production instead. These investments suggest GM expects internal combustion engines to remain part of its lineup well beyond 2035.

In an op-ed in the USA Today News Network this week, former Board of Public Utilities Commissioner Mary-Anna Holden said the energy policies of the Murphy administration, which primarily removed natural gas and nuclear as sources before the advance of solar and wind effectively drove up costs because New Jersey was at a stark energy imbalance of supply and demand.

“The truth is that this state’s energy policy has gone off the rails,” Holden wrote. “I’ve seen good intentions turn into costly failures when they lack fact-based planning.

“Instead of chasing artificial deadlines and politically popular incentives, our leaders should be focused on real-world physics and economics.

“This means revisiting the Energy Master Plan, rethinking electrification mandates and supporting a balanced generation mix that includes reliable, low-emission sources like natural gas and nuclear while continuing to develop meaningful renewables at a pace our infrastructure can handle.”

New Jersey, under the governor’s Energy Master Plan, set a target to achieve 100% clean energy by 2035 mostly through offshore wind, solar expansion and other energy efficiency programs.

When the plan was introduced five years ago, NJBIA Deputy Chief Government Affairs Officer Ray Cantor predicted the current supply and demand challenges and energy cost spikes currently taking place.

Said Cantor: “From the day the EMP was announced, we have continuously warned that creating policies that set artificial deadlines for actions and discouraging new generation from sources that include natural gas and nuclear will result in much higher energy prices for our residents and businesses. And here we are.

As a major greenfield facility focused on refractories and steel casting fluxes, the CAPES project is setting new benchmarks for sustainable industrial development in East and South India.

Designed as a next-generation manufacturing hub, the CAPES plant integrates eco-conscious practices from the ground up—going well beyond regulatory compliance to drive long-term environmental stewardship.

Powering Up with Clean Energy

The CAPES plant is taking definitive steps toward energy sustainability, beginning with a plan to source 20% of its energy from solar power within five years. This shift not only reduces carbon emissions but also reflects Calderys’ alignment with India’s broader push for renewable energy integration in manufacturing.

Zero Discharge, Maximum Water Efficiency

One of CAPES’ standout features is its zero effluent discharge design. Through advanced on-site effluent and sewage treatment systems, all wastewater is treated and reused for landscaping and auxiliary functions. To further support aquifer sustainability, Calderys will install 95 groundwater recharge pits. This initiative ensures long-term water conservation and promotes responsible usage within the industrial ecosystem.

Green Belt Development: 800 Trees and Counting

In line with its commitment to biodiversity and carbon offsetting, Calderys has launched an ambitious green belt development initiative on-site. The company has already planted 800 of the planned 2,000 trees, with the goal of developing 33% green cover within the facility. This will significantly enhance the microclimate and contribute to a more resilient industrial environment.

Cleaner Air Through Advanced Filtration

Calderys is also tackling air quality head-on. The plant features a state-of-the-art dust and emission control system, designed to make the air up to five times cleaner than traditional refractory manufacturing sites. High-efficiency filtration technologies sharply reduce particulate emissions, protecting both workers and the surrounding community.

Embracing Circular Economy Principles

At CAPES, sustainability is circular. The plant actively incorporates scrap and recycled materials into its production cycles, effectively minimizing waste and maximizing resource efficiency. This approach reduces environmental impact and contributes to a closed-loop manufacturing model that supports Calderys’ global sustainability goals.

Leadership Perspective: Building for the Future

Ish Mohan Garg, Senior Vice President, Asia Pacific, stated, “At Calderys, sustainability is not a standalone initiative—it’s embedded into every aspect of our operations. The CAPES plant in Odisha reflects our vision of future-ready manufacturing, where innovation and responsibility go hand-in-hand. Our environmental measures are a commitment not just to the planet, but also to the communities and generations we serve, and they support India’s national decarbonization goals.”

A Model for Sustainable Industrial Growth

Through its efforts at the CAPES facility, Calderys is developing more than just a modern manufacturing site. It is pioneering a new standard for environmentally responsible growth. As per the press release, the company’s approach aligns with India’s national sustainability goals. It also supports the global push for a cleaner, smarter, and more accountable industry.",https://chemindigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Calderys-Sets-Sustainability-Milestone-in-Odisha-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 12:09:37.457859

Capito has been a frequent critic of the energy tax credits within the IRA.
Capito said the IRA’s energy tax credits need to be received and reconsidered in some cases.","CHARLESTON – A former state senator who previously led West Virginia’s economic development initiatives is urging President Donald Trump and Congress to keep in place energy tax credits, while U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito believes that some of those credits need to be reviewed or repealed.

Mitch Carmichael, a former member of the House of Delegates and state Senate, is the leader of Built for America, a new advocacy organization, urging the Trump administration to not roll back energy tax credits.

Carmichael served as state Senate president and lieutenant governor from 2017 to the end of 2020, then served under former governor and current U.S. Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., as the first secretary of the new Department of Economic Development until the fall of 2024.

During his tenure as a cabinet secretary, Carmichael oversaw the recruitment of several major manufacturers to the state, including the Form Energy grid battery project in Weirton, and the Berkshire Hathaway/Timet titanium melt facility near Ravenswood that will be powered by a solar energy microgrid. Carmichael also serves as a senior advisor for strategic initiative for LG Nova.

These projects, along with many others across the nation, are benefiting from energy tax credits within bills signed by former President Joe Biden, including the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). But Carmichael said these tax credits are vital to Trump’s goal to return manufacturing back to the United States.

“I’m proud to lead Built for America as Executive Director because the fight to defend the energy tax credits driving America’s manufacturing comeback is one we can’t afford to lose,” Carmichael said. “Built for America is a new organization working to defend the tax credits that are powering America’s manufacturing comeback, creating jobs, and helping America beat China.”

Following his inauguration for a second non-consecutive term in January, Trump ordered all federal agencies to pause disbursement of funds appropriated through the 2022 IRA or the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in a 215-214-1 vote, sending it to the U.S. Senate.

The bill is a budget and spending reconciliation package which continues the 2017 tax cuts that went into effect during Trump’s first term and are set to expire at the end of 2025. The bill also includes nearly $1.5 trillion in spending cuts through various methods, including work requirements for Medicaid benefits and the elimination of several tax credits made possible by the IRA.

Specifically, the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would eliminate tax breaks and incentives for wind, solar, hydrogen projects, as well as phase out tax credits for consumers purchasing new electric vehicles among other rollbacks. If enacted as the House intended, the rollbacks could end more than $522 billion in investments made possible through the IRA.

However, Carmichael argued that these tax credits are tied to performance, not politics, with the tax credits rewarding businesses that complete major energy projects and put Americans back to work.

“They reward U.S. companies that build here, hire here, and deliver results by putting America first,” Carmichael said. “Unlike mandates…these credits are performance-based and results-driven. They support an all-of-the-above energy approach, empowering innovation in nuclear, geothermal, carbon capture, and other emerging technologies.”

Carmichael also said repealing the tax breaks would benefit companies competing with the U.S. for energy, such as China. Built for America is launching a $2 million ad campaign aimed at swaying Congress and the White House to reconsider some of the proposed cuts.

“No one has done more to jumpstart American manufacturing than President Trump, and these credits are aligned with his America First mission,” Carmichael said. “They’re helping us beat China, rebuild the middle class, and power a new era of American industrial strength. That’s a fight worth having.

“Repealing these credits would ship jobs and supply chains back to China and hand America’s energy future to our adversaries,” Carmichael continued. “That’s why I’m proud to stand with Built for America and lead this fight.”

Capito, R-W.Va., is the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Capito has been a frequent critic of the energy tax credits within the IRA. Speaking to reporters Thursday during a weekly phone call from Capitol Hill. Capito said the IRA’s energy tax credits need to be received and reconsidered in some cases.

“Everything was tilted towards clean energy, and it was just incredibly lopsided and incredibly generous, so those need to be scaled back no doubt, and some of them absolutely probably need to be stopped immediately,” Capito said. “Others, I think, need a better transition.”

As an example, Capito cited the 45V hydrogen tax credit created by the IRA, which offers incentives for the production of clean hydrogen, with potential payouts up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced. Capito advocated for regional hydrogen hubs in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, including what is now the ARCH2 Appalachian hydrogen hub project.

“The House put in their bill that in order for you to take advantage of 45V…you have to be under construction by the end of this year,” Capito said. “Well, you and I both know, and I think those at the ARCH2 Appalachian hydrogen hub know, that’s impossible. That knocks us out of the game, and I don’t want to see us knocked out of being a leader on a new and promising type of energy production…So, I’ve asked if we can make provisions there.”

Once other Senate committees release their reconciliation language, the Senate could begin voting on its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill reconciliation package by the end of next week. Capito said Congress needs to get the energy incentives right.

“We need to unleash American energy,” Capito said. “The (previous) administration has spent three and a half years trying to cap our American innovation in the energy space and we’re going to open it back up again – one of (Trump’s) main tenants for his presidency…I’m very excited to be able to be a part of that.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.weirtondailytimes.com/images/2016/08/19083913/fbLIKE.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:08:20.879938

MEAN and Kimball Wind then entered into a power purchase agreement, where MEAN would purchase the Kimball Wind Farm's electricity output for twenty years and the Kimball Wind Farm would deliver electricity by June 2018.
Facing an impending deadline to begin delivering electricity, Kimball Wind agreed under protest to be responsible for the remaining costs.
Kimball Wind seeks an order for a reimbursement, either as a cash payment from WAPA or a three-party rate-crediting agreement between WAPA, MEAN, and Kimball Wind.
The order Kimball Wind seeks thus would direct WAPA to grant MEAN rate credits and MEAN to reimburse Kimball Wind.","Kimball Wind, LLC, operates a wind facility in Nebraska that generates electricity transmitted on a network owned and operated by the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Before Kimball Wind's facility began its operations, WAPA determined that a substation expansion was necessary to ensure the network could safely and reliably transmit the facility's electricity output. WAPA offered to cover part of the expansion costs but required that Kimball Wind commit to pay the rest. Kimball Wind agreed under protest, believing that WAPA wrongfully made it responsible for most of the expansion costs.

Kimball Wind petitioned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the Commission) for an order, pursuant to section 211A of the Federal Power Act (FPA), directing WAPA to reimburse Kimball Wind's contribution to the substation expansion. The Commission determined that section 211A does not provide for the relief sought by Kimball Wind. We agree. Kimball Wind did not seek an order for transmission services—the sole form of relief provided by section 211A. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.

To maintain open access to transmission lines, sections 205 and 206 of the FPA authorize the Commission to regulate the transmission services provided by certain utilities, 16 U.S.C. § 824e(a), to ensure that they are provided at just, reasonable and non-discriminatory rates, id. § 824d(a)–(b). But not all transmission utilities fall within the Commission's authority under sections 205 and 206. Entities of the federal government that own and operate transmission lines, for example, are outside the scope of those sections. See id. § 824(f).

To address this gap, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 added section 211A to the FPA. Section 211A gives the Commission jurisdiction over “unregulated transmitting utilities,” which include agencies, authorities, or instrumentalities of the United States that “own[ ] or operate[ ] facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.” Id. §§ 824(f), 824j-1(a)–(b). WAPA is an unregulated transmitting utility, as it is an entity within the U.S. Department of Energy that owns and operates a transmission network over fifteen states.

The Commission's statutory authority over unregulated transmitting utilities, however, is limited. Because unregulated transmitting utilities may provide transmission services to themselves and other customers, section 211A is “designed to foster an open and competitive energy market by promoting access to transmission services on equal terms.” Nw. Requirements Utils. v. FERC, 798 F.3d 796, 808 (9th Cir. 2015). Accordingly, under section 211A, the Commission may only order an unregulated transmitting utility to “provide transmission services,” “(1) at rates that are comparable to those that the unregulated transmitting utility charges itself; and (2) on terms ․ that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself and that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential.” 16 U.S.C. § 824j-1(b).

Section 211A grants the Commission discretionary authority. S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth. v. FERC, 762 F.3d 41, 95–96 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (explaining that “section 211A plainly permits, but does not mandate, the Commission to require [an unregulated transmitting utility] to provide transmission service on given terms”). The Commission has seen fit to issue an order pursuant to section 211A only once, then providing prospective relief and stressing that it “expect[ed] that the need to use this statutory authority would be rare.” Iberdrola Renewables, Inc., 137 FERC ¶ 61,185, ¶ 32 (2011).

B.

The dispute in this case stems from a long-running project to develop wind-based electricity generation in Nebraska. In 2016, the Municipal Energy Agency of Nebraska (MEAN) requested proposals to upgrade an existing wind generation facility. MEAN selected Kimball Wind's proposal to develop an upgraded facility (“the Kimball Wind Farm”). MEAN and Kimball Wind then entered into a power purchase agreement, where MEAN would purchase the Kimball Wind Farm's electricity output for twenty years and the Kimball Wind Farm would deliver electricity by June 2018. To begin delivering its electricity output, the Kimball Wind Farm had to connect to WAPA's transmission network.

WAPA transmits electricity for MEAN pursuant to a transmission services agreement. As required by that agreement, MEAN requested that WAPA transmit the Kimball Wind Farm's electricity output, which would be delivered through the Kimball Substation, and then along a long-distance transmission line, the Archer-Sidney Line.

In considering MEAN's request, WAPA carried out preliminary studies to assess whether any changes to the network's infrastructure were necessary to safely and reliably transmit the Kimball Wind Farm's electricity output. WAPA's studies concluded that adding the Kimball Wind Farm's output to WAPA's transmission network would “cause an overall degradation in protective coverage for the Archer-Sidney ․ line,” and recommended expanding the Kimball Substation “with a four breaker ring bus.” J.A. 72. WAPA estimated that the overall cost for the substation expansion would be about $6.5 million.

The question then became who would pay for the substation expansion. WAPA offered to contribute $2.2 million, and proposed that MEAN pay the rest. MEAN declined and notified WAPA that it would not be a party to any agreement regarding the substation expansion. Facing an impending deadline to begin delivering electricity, Kimball Wind agreed under protest to be responsible for the remaining costs. Kimball Wind ultimately paid around $5.9 million. Kimball Wind then turned to the Commission for relief.

C.

Kimball Wind petitioned the Commission for an order, pursuant to section 211A, directing WAPA to reimburse Kimball Wind's contribution to the substation expansion. In May 2023, the Commission issued an order denying the petition. As a threshold matter, the Commission found that Kimball Wind could file a petition because section 211A does not limit who can seek an order. The Commission determined, however, that the relief Kimball Wind requested was not appropriate under section 211A, because: (1) Kimball Wind did not seek an order for transmission services; (2) Kimball Wind was not WAPA's transmission service customer; and (3) even if section 211A authorized a reimbursement, Kimball Wind did not provide any evidence it received non-comparable transmission service from WAPA or explain how the requested relief would remedy such non-comparable service.

Kimball Wind then filed a request for rehearing, arguing that the order was internally inconsistent by finding that Kimball Wind could file a petition but could not obtain relief under section 211A, and that the order departed from Commission precedent without explanation and was unsupported by substantial evidence. The Commission denied Kimball Wind's request for rehearing. Kimball Wind filed this consolidated petition for review of the Commission's orders. WAPA, the American Public Power Association, and Large Public Power Council intervened.

II.

A.

We have jurisdiction to review the Commission's final orders. 16 U.S.C. § 825l(b). We review the Commission's orders under the Administrative Procedure Act's arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law standard. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); LSP Transmission Holdings II, LLC v. FERC, 45 F.4th 979, 991 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (applying the APA's arbitrary-and-capricious standard to review actions under the FPA). “[W]hen addressing a question of statutory interpretation, we begin with the text,” and apply “the traditional tools of statutory construction.” Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. FERC, 113 F.4th 943, 948 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (quotations omitted).

B.

The key question before us is whether section 211A authorizes the Commission to issue an order directing WAPA to reimburse Kimball Wind for its contribution to the substation expansion. We agree with the Commission that Kimball Wind does not seek an order for transmission services—the only type of order the Commission may issue under section 211A. Because the Commission's orders can be sustained on that determination alone, we do not address its other reasons for declining Kimball Wind's petition. See Williams Gas Processing-Gulf Coast Co., L.P. v. FERC, 475 F.3d 319, 330 (D.C. Cir. 2006).

Pursuant to section 211A, the Commission may only order “an unregulated transmitting utility to provide transmission services” on comparable terms and rates. 16 U.S.C. § 824j-1(b). Kimball Wind seeks an order for a reimbursement, either as a cash payment from WAPA or a three-party rate-crediting agreement between WAPA, MEAN, and Kimball Wind. Kimball Wind contends that an order instructing WAPA to reimburse it for its contribution to the substation expansion is an order to “provide transmission services.” We are not persuaded.

First, Kimball Wind's request for a direct cash refund from WAPA would not result in an order for transmission services. Kimball Wind acknowledges that the only relief it seeks is “the refund of [its] construction costs.” Oral Arg. Tr. 12:18–20. It does not seek a transmission services agreement with WAPA, and it is not currently a party to such an agreement. An order directing WAPA to reimburse Kimball Wind with a cash refund would neither require that WAPA provide transmission services to Kimball Wind nor modify the terms on which WAPA provides transmission services to any other party. Cf. Iberdrola Renewables, 137 FERC ¶ 61,185, ¶ 30 (ordering an unregulated transmission utility to prospectively modify the terms and conditions on which it provides transmission services).

Second, Kimball Wind's request for a three-party rate-crediting agreement would not result in an order for transmission services. Under Kimball Wind's proposed three-party rate-crediting agreement, WAPA would adjust the rate it charges MEAN for transmitting electricity, and MEAN would then use this rebate to reimburse Kimball Wind. The order Kimball Wind seeks thus would direct WAPA to grant MEAN rate credits and MEAN to reimburse Kimball Wind. Such an order would not direct WAPA or MEAN to provide transmission services to Kimball Wind.

On Kimball Wind's petition, neither an order for a cash refund nor an order for a three-party rate-credit agreement would “require an unregulated transmitting utility to provide transmission services.” 16 U.S.C. § 824j-1(b). The Commission, therefore, correctly concluded that Kimball Wind seeks relief that section 211A cannot provide.

C.

Kimball Wind also contends that the Commission's orders are arbitrary and capricious, because they are internally inconsistent or because they are an unreasonable and unjustified departure from Commission precedent and policy disfavoring direct assignment of network upgrade costs. We do not reach these questions in light of our preceding conclusion that the Commission lacks statutory authority under section 211A to order that WAPA reimburse Kimball Wind. And Kimball Wind identifies no other independent statutory basis for the reimbursement it seeks.

III.

For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for review.

So ordered.

FOOTNOTES

. The Kimball Wind Farm is connected to a substation owned by the City of Kimball, which in turn is connected to the Kimball Substation by a transmission line owned by the City of Kimball.

. Neither the Tucker Act nor the Contracts Dispute Act limit our jurisdiction over Kimball Wind's petition, because “at its essence” this case does not turn on a contractual dispute, Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982), and turns instead on the scope of the Commission's authority under section 211A, see Crowley Gov't Servs, Inc. v. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 2022).

. Although section 211A does not provide for the relief Kimball Wind seeks, Kimball Wind has still shown that its claimed injury—the Commission's denial of a reimbursement order—is redressable for purposes of Article III standing. “[D]uring the standing inquiry,” the Court “accepts [petitioner's statutory] interpretation ․ as correct.” BP Energy Co. v. FERC, 828 F.3d 959, 963 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quotations and citations omitted). Assuming that Kimball Wind will prevail in its argument that section 211A authorizes the Commission to grant the reimbursement it seeks, a favorable ruling from this Court would redress its injury.

We continue to appreciate the work of Senators Grassley and Ernst in supporting these tax credits over the years.","Clean energy advocates warn Iowa stands to lose jobs and renewable energy project expansions, and businesses and households will see an increase in utility bills if Congress passes President Donald Trump’s budget reconciliation bill as is.

Iowa U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who represents southeast Iowa, made similar warnings to House Republican leaders urging them to maintain the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy tax credits.

The Republican incumbent — who is expected to run for re-election to a fourth term in 2026 — however, has come under fire from Democrats and the same clean energy advocates for voting to pass the tax and spending policy bill despite her push to preserve the tax credits that would be rolled back under the legislation.

Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation.

“Renewable energy is a vital, and growing industry in Iowa. It provides good jobs and cheap electricity for the entire state,” Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a statement Friday calling out Miller-Meeks and the rest of Iowa’s U.S. House members who voted for the bill. “Iowa's Republican representatives just helped deal Iowa's renewable energy sector a major blow, all to pass tax cuts for the millionaires and billionaires who are calling the shots.”

The reconciliation bill passed by the House and being considered by the Senate — referred to as Trump's “one big beautiful bill” — proposes significant changes to clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) signed into law by Democratic former President Joe Biden.

The bill accelerates the phaseout and, in some cases, effectively eliminates key clean energy tax credits, including those for wind, solar and battery storage projects.

Miller-Meeks repeatedly advocated for maintaining the IRA’s energy tax credits. In August 2024, Miller-Meeks was one of 18 House Republicans who signed on to a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson pushing him to preserve the IRA’s energy tax credits, touting the jobs they had created and the investments made across America by multiple companies because of them.

Like others who signed, Miller-Meeks voted against the IRA in August 2022. While acknowledging the bill contained some key provisions — such as the clean energy tax credits — she said the bill overall was “deeply flawed.” She considered the legislation to be a $740 billion spending bill “filled with partisan priorities,” and argued it was not the time to pass such legislation given the country's economic situation and inflation rates at the time.

The August 2024 letter warned: “Today, many U.S. companies are already using sector-wide energy tax credits — many of which have enjoyed bipartisan support historically — to make major investments in new U.S. energy infrastructure.

“We hear from industry and our constituents who fear the energy tax regime will once again be turned on its head due to Republican repeal efforts,” the letter continues. “Prematurely repealing energy tax credits, particularly those which were used to justify investments that already broke ground, would undermine private investments and stop development that is already ongoing. A full repeal would create a worst-case scenario where we would have spent billions of taxpayer dollars and received next to nothing in return.”

Miller-Meeks and Republican co-signers also pointed out, “Energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment, and created good jobs in many parts of the country — including many districts represented by members of our conference.”

They asked the House speaker to “consider us partners in reforming our tax policies in a way that puts America first while ensuring certainty for industry and the energy sector.”

In March 2025, Rep. Miller-Meeks signed on to a letter to Ways And Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, warning that multiple projects would be “jeopardized” if the tax credits were repealed.

In May 2025, Rep. Miller-Meeks signed on to another letter to Rep. Smith saying she strongly supported the energy tax credits and asking him to preserve them, warning that repealing the credits would lead to a 10 percent increase in consumer electricity costs.

In January, at a House Ways And Means Committee Hearing, Miller-Meeks testified that the IRA’s energy tax credits were “delivering” economic benefits to communities nationwide, and that their repeal “would be a setback to clean energy, and importantly economic growth, and put Brazil first, not America first.”

Miller-Meeks is chair of the Conservative Climate Caucus and a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

A spokesperson for her office said — like any piece of major legislation — while unable to secure everything she wanted in the reconciliation bill, she was able to preserve some key energy tax credits while scoring other significant conservative policy wins for Iowans. That includes extending the 2017 federal tax cuts; restoring American energy production by increasing oil and gas leasing and drilling on federal lands and expediting the approval process for oil and gas exploration and extraction; and increasing funding for border security and immigration enforcement.

""I voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act because it prevents the largest tax hike on families and small businesses in American history, secures the border and unleashes American energy dominance,“ Miller-Meeks said in a statement to The Gazette. ”I’m proud that we were able to keep key energy tax credits that will expand domestic power generation, create good-paying jobs, and lower utility costs. This bill is a win for Iowa.”

She noted the bill also:

Tax incentives spurred clean energy projects

New clean energy and manufacturing projects have seen substantial growth in Iowa and across the country since new federal tax incentives were put in place in 2022, according to Climate Power, a strategic communications firm highlighting how clean energy investments benefit local communities.

This repeal comes at a time when energy costs and utility bills are already going up, and will increase more if energy sources like wind and solar are not available to meet much higher demand, according to the firm.

A study by Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) determined that repealing the federal investment (§48E) and the production tax credits (§45Y) would raise electricity and natural gas prices, lead to job losses and economic slowdown, and lower household incomes across 19 states between 2026 and 2032.

In Iowa, CEBA estimates the reconciliation bill will lead to 5,000 fewer jobs, a $370 average loss in annual household income and a $590 million decrease in goods and services produced in the state.

According to Climate Power, if tax credits and key pollution regulations are repealed as outlined in the House reconciliation bill, Iowa households would see an average increase in annual electricity bills of $67 in both 2030 and 2035, and annual energy bill increases of $132 in both 2030 and 2035.

Five new clean energy projects have been announced and private companies have announced plans to create 1,102 new clean energy jobs in the state since the passage of the IRA.

Iowa relies on clean energy

Sixty-two percent of Iowa’s total energy generation came from clean energy in 2023, with wind power generation accounting for 59 percent. Iowa’s solar power production increased by 92 percent from March 2024 to March 2025.

The state is home to 13.91 gigawatts of operating clean energy capacity, enough to power more than 10 million homes, according to Climate Power. Another 0.29 gigawatts of clean energy capacity is planned in the state, including a solar project in Muscatine County and the Silver Creek Wind Farm in southwest Iowa, both of which are scheduled to come online in the fall.

Iowa is already home to 99 data centers, one of the largest concentrations in the Midwest. In 2023, data centers accounted for 11.43 percent of the total electricity consumed in the state, ranking fourth nationwide.

Policy analysts have cited data centers’ energy usage as a reason for utility rate hikes on customers.

Earlier this year, NextEra Energy proposed restarting its Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant near Palo. A company spokesperson declined to comment on the impact the Republican-sponsored bill would have on the Iowa project.

Alliant Energy said the utility continues to monitor and will be watching closely as the Senate continues their work on the bill.

MidAmerican Energy spokesperson Geoff Greenwood said MidAmerican, too, is closely monitoring progress of the bill through Congress, adding “production tax credits have been key to reducing the cost of new generation projects for our customers.”

“We have made significant investments in renewable energy over the past 20 years, and in 2024, MidAmerican delivered the equivalent of 100 percent carbon-free energy to serve our Iowa customers’ electricity usage,” Greenwood said. “Renewable energy makes up 91.7 percent of that energy delivered over the course of the year. We continue to appreciate the work of Senators Grassley and Ernst in supporting these tax credits over the years.

“Our customers’ demand for electricity is only growing, so MidAmerican will continue to propose new generation projects to support that growth,” Greenwood said. “MidAmerican’s Solar Reliability Project, which is pending before the Iowa Utilities Commission, is one such project and an essential part of our all-of-the-above generation approach to serve that demand.”

This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claimed on Wednesday that its plan to eviscerate power plant pollution standards will save the US about $1 billion a year. In reality, though, this represents a starkly uneven trade-off, experts say.

The savings for “Americans” will go entirely to power plant operators who won’t have to cut their pollution, while at the same time, climate and health benefits for all Americans that are 20 times larger in dollar terms will be deleted.

“The massive cost to the public compared to the minuscule benefits is breathtaking,” said Charles Harper, power sector campaigner at green group Evergreen Action. “The costs will be borne by the American people who will breathe dirtier air and those around the world suffering from climate change. The benefits will go to a very small group of donors. Perhaps they should change the name of the agency if they are no longer about protecting the health of Americans.”

The EPA is proposing to entirely ditch all restrictions on planet-heating emissions coming from US power plants, the second largest source of carbon pollution in the country, while also weakening a separate regulation designed to limit the amount of harmful toxins, such as mercury, seeping from these power plants into Americans’ air, water and soils.

These restrictions were imposed by Joe Biden to “advance the climate change cult” and the “green new scam,” according to Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, at an unveiling of the rollbacks on Wednesday that did not mention any benefit to the environment or public health.

“Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil, and gas out of existence,” said Zeldin, who touted the need for “beautiful clean coal” and for the US to develop artificial intelligence, neither a core EPA responsibility.

In justifying its decision, the EPA has claimed that power plant emissions “do not contribute significantly” to the climate crisis—despite US electricity generation being one of the largest single sources of such pollution in the world—and that the rollbacks will save the country $19 billion over two decades, or about $1.2 billion a year.

However, this “saving” is entirely for the benefit of power plant operators who won’t have to install technology to reduce hazardous pollution, rather than the broader public. The EPA has said overall electricity costs will go down, too, but did not provide a figure on any estimated savings from this.

By contrast, the existing climate rule for power plants, put in place by Biden last year, was previously estimated by the EPA to save the US $370 billion by the 2040s, at about $20 billion a year, via climate and public health benefits. The rule is also expected to slash more than 1 billion tons in carbon emissions and save thousands of lives from reduced air pollution.

Experts said that the vast 20 to one discrepancy in benefits, and who they flow to, represents a damaging favor given to the fossil fuel interests that have strongly backed Trump, at the expense of the American public.

“The only people who benefit from these rollbacks are the biggest emitters of toxic pollution who don’t want to install cleaner technologies,” said Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, a group composed of former EPA staff. “American families will pay the cost of these rollbacks in higher healthcare bills from emergency room visits, missed work days, and missed school days. This proposal is scientifically indefensible and represents a complete abdication of EPA’s responsibilities under the Clean Air Act.”

Under Trump, the EPA has set about dismantling an array of clean air and water protections and adopted the president’s agenda of boosting fossil fuel production. The agency argues that casting off such regulations will bolster the economy and save money for households.

“Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of base load power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the artificial intelligence capital of the world,” said an EPA spokesperson. “Regulatory costs are inherently regressive—placing a heavier burden on those who can least afford it. These costs are ultimately borne by consumers in the form of higher utility bills and rolling blackouts.”

But, critics warn that the EPA’s traditional purpose to protect public health and the environment is being rapidly eroded.

“EPA’s proposal to stop regulating emissions of greenhouse gases and mercury from US power plants reflects Trump’s breathtaking willingness to sacrifice public health and progress against climate change in the service of the nation’s worst polluters,” said John Holdren, who served as Barack Obama’s science adviser. “In this and so many other ways, Trump and his enablers are doing their best to drive this country off a cliff.

“American jobs, economic competitiveness, health, environment, national security, and standing in the world are all in peril from Trump’s ignorance and reckless disregard for the public good,” said Holdren, who now co-directs the science, technology, and public policy program at Harvard University’s Belfer Center.

The EPA announcement makes good on Trump’s campaign trail promise to “unleash American energy” and open “dozens and dozens” of power plants.

It came as part of Trump’s assault on pollution regulations. Taken together, his administration’s planned environmental rollbacks—including of power plant and tailpipe emission standards and clean energy incentives from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—will result in 22,800 additional pollution-related deaths and a $1.1 trillion reduction in US GDP by 2035, a University of Maryland study published on Thursday found.

Julie McNamara, an associate director at the science, climate, and health-focused advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists, said Zeldin’s Wednesday proposal was “shameful”.

“There’s no meaningful path to meet US climate goals without addressing carbon emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants—and there’s no meaningful path to meet global climate goals without the United States,” she said.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20210209_zaa_s197_290.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-06-14 11:07:59.054101

These projects, including Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind and New York’s Empire Wind, are creating thousands of jobs and will power millions of homes.

Opponents of these projects cite concerns about ocean views and potential harm to marine life, but these claims are often unsubstantiated.

Is it possible the predictions of the death of offshore wind power – one of our single best tools in the fight against climate change – were wrong?

While fossil fuel lobbyists and wealthy waterfront landowners in beachfront communities cheered on the impending death of clean energy, the turbines continued going up, large-scale projects got built and began turning wind into electricity, and the wind projects continued their progress toward construction.

Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is more than halfway complete. In many ways, between the jobs, the power and the investment, it may simply be too big to fail. With 176 turbines, the $6 billion project will power 660,000 homes with clean energy when finished in 2026. It has already created 2,000 jobs.

A stop work order from the Trump administration against New York’s Empire Wind was rescinded recently. Empire has created 1,500 jobs and will power a half-million New York homes when completed in 2028. To the extent reports that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to fresh consideration of one or more fracked gas pipelines in exchange for allowing Empire to proceed are accurate, such ill-advised and outdated proposals face major obstacles, including stiff public opposition.

Revolution Wind, 15 miles off the coast of Rhode Island, began work two years ago and is on target to be finished and powering 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island by next year. Revolution has faced an onslaught of legal attacks from wealthy waterfront owners concerned about their ocean views. But, at least for now, the project has been safe from President Trump’s anti-wind attacks. And again, size and economic clout may have helped keep the project viable. Revolution has spent more than $100 million shoreside redeveloping waterfront in both Connecticut and Rhode Island and, by creating 1,500 jobs, has strong political and union support.

Finally, there is Vineyard Wind.

After a devastating turbine break stopped construction in July, Vineyard Wind has quietly – very quietly – managed to get back to work. Their project will power 400,000 homes in Massachusetts, revitalize the port of New Bedford, and generate 2,000 jobs. The project is also generating electricity – though how much is impossible to establish since the developer, possibly in response to the high-profile attacks on wind by the Trump administration, has opted to answer few questions about the work.

Each of these projects has, so far, survived in the face of relentless attacks from the Trump administration, fossil fuel proponents, and greenwashed fronts. Baseless charges that wind power kills whales; lawsuits targeting transmission cables, substations and transmission cables; phony ""grassroots"" organizations bankrolled by waterfront homeowners and/or oil and gas companies; attacks by the Trump bureaucracy – all so far have failed.

Silence may be a winning strategy: One of the directors of the Dominion project said recently that continued construction came from “keeping our head down.” Dominion has also managed to keep working by touting offshore wind not as clean, green or planet saving – which, of course, it is – but simply as homegrown American power. Like federal biologists and health experts, offshore wind developers have learned not to bring the benefits of clean air and cuts to pollution into their conversations.

They can’t say it. But we can: When these four projects go on-line in the next three years, they will power two million homes while taking millions of tons of carbon pollution out of the air we breathe – the equivalent of taking 2,300,000 cars off the road. That means less asthma, better heart health, and a planet moving further from a future marked by increasing heat and drought, flooding and erosion, real damage to marine life, and more houses being swallowed by a rising ocean.

Every day, the U.S. sends 780,000 barrels of refined products back to Canada and more than 1 million barrels to Mexico.
A vast, interconnected pipeline network spans the continent, bolstering U.S. energy security with stable, predictable supplies from Canada and Mexico.
The upcoming G-7 summit is more than a diplomatic gathering — it’s a moment to reaffirm North America’s leadership in the global energy arena.","With the upcoming G-7 summit set to take place Sunday through Tuesday in Alberta — Canada’s energy heartland — President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Carney are uniquely positioned to champion a bold vision: reasserting and securing North American energy dominance.

Doing so wouldn’t represent just a win for the United States and Canada. It would create a strategic advantage for their European and Asian allies as well.

The G-7 should embrace energy abundance by cooperating and committing to a rapid expansion of energy infrastructure. Members should commit to streamlined permitting, including a one-stop shop for permitting and environmental review, to unleash the capital investment necessary to make energy abundance a reality.

North America’s energy success story is built on deep continental integration and a relentless entrepreneurial drive. Together, these forces have made the region one of the most prosperous and energy-secure in the world.

From the earliest days of oil’s rise as a dominant energy source, the United States has led the way — not only in exploration and discovery but also in building the world’s most advanced and expansive refining infrastructure.

Today, global refining capacity stands at over 103 million barrels per day. Remarkably, nearly one-fifth of that — 18 million barrels — is processed in the United States alone.

These refineries are economic engines, directly employing nearly 65,000 Americans in high-paying jobs. With median earnings around $95,000 and many workers earning six-figure salaries, the industry supports a thriving middle class. An additional 1.4 million Americans work in supply chains and corporate operations that keep these refineries running.

To maintain this momentum, the U.S. relies heavily on its own oil production — averaging 13.2 million barrels per day last year, primarily light crude. But here’s the catch: American refineries are optimized for heavy crude, which is more cost-effective and essential for maximizing output and profitability.

Enter Canada and Mexico. Canada supplies 2.8 million barrels of heavy crude daily to U.S. Midwest refineries, while Mexico contributes another 780,000 barrels to Gulf Coast facilities. This steady flow of heavy crude is vital — it keeps energy costs low and allows the U.S. to export its higher-value light crude, advancing Trump’s vision of energy dominance.

Consider this: The $99 billion in crude oil imported from Alberta alone is transformed by U.S. refineries into $361 billion worth of energy products — much of which is exported. Every day, the U.S. sends 780,000 barrels of refined products back to Canada and more than 1 million barrels to Mexico. This seamless energy integration benefits all three nations.

The same synergy powers the natural gas sector. A vast, interconnected pipeline network spans the continent, bolstering U.S. energy security with stable, predictable supplies from Canada and Mexico. This not only supplements domestic production but also fuels booming exports.

Thanks to competitively priced Canadian gas, Americans in the Midwest, Mountain West and Pacific Northwest enjoy lower energy costs. Excess gas flows to the Gulf Coast and Maryland, where it’s liquefied and shipped to Europe and Asia.

This system enables the U.S. to export 11.5 billion cubic feet of liquefied natural gas daily — generating revenue, creating jobs and providing allies with a secure, pressure-free alternative to Russian and Chinese energy.

The G-7 summit will spotlight this powerful continental alliance. Nations such as Japan, France, Germany, Italy and the UK are urgently seeking reliable energy sources — not just to meet rising demand, but to reduce dependence on volatile suppliers such as Russia and Iran.

North America is ready to answer that call. With its unmatched resources and infrastructure, and reformed permitting regulations, the continent can become the trusted energy partner the world needs.

The United States, with its robust pipeline networks reaching both coasts, is well-positioned to meet Europe’s energy demands — advancing Trump’s agenda while boosting exports and revenues.

Meanwhile, Canada’s expanding infrastructure to its western ports opens the door to supplying key Asian allies such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.

The upcoming G-7 summit is more than a diplomatic gathering — it’s a moment to reaffirm North America’s leadership in the global energy arena. Let’s not waste it.

Since the first turbine was installed in Blyth in 2000, the UK has become a global offshore wind leader with around 15GW of installed capacity. The UK’s ambitious target of achieving Clean Power by 2030 (CP2030) and 43-50GW of offshore wind signals to investors that the UK is open for business when it comes to clean energy. The target doesn’t just stand as a galvanising call to action, but as a huge economic opportunity to deliver investment and jobs to parts of the country that need it most.

However, this needs to be delivered against a difficult global backdrop. It has been a tough few years for the offshore wind sector. Global macroeconomic headwinds in the form of inflation, high interest rates and supply chain pressures have led to failed auctions in multiple markets, including Contracts for Difference (CfD) Allocation Round 5 (AR5) in the UK, and projects have been delayed or cancelled as a result. In response, developers and investors have been raising hurdle rates, concentrating on fewer core markets, and seeking to prioritise ‘value over volume’.

Despite the UK Government reacting quickly in AR6 to adjust auction parameters to economic realities, wider factors outside of their control (such as tariffs) continue to pose a risk. We’re not out of the woods yet.

Along with others, Equinor has been impacted by these challenges and has adjusted its short-term renewable ambitions in response. Notwithstanding this, Equinor is maintaining its long-term commitment to net zero by 2050 and reconfirming its view on the important role offshore wind will play in the energy transition.

The UK has been one of the most attractive markets globally to develop offshore wind and remains a core market for Equinor. Today our UK wind farms power 750,000 homes and by 2030, as part of our own journey towards net zero, we aim to power 7 million British homes, taking us from megawatts to gigawatts.

The UK is where we built the world's first floating wind farm, Hywind Scotland, and where we are now building the world's largest offshore wind farm, Dogger Bank, with our partners SSE and Vårgrønn. When fully operational, over 400 people will operate and maintain the wind farm – part of a wider 2,000+ jobs created or sustained through the project.

Alongside our partners, we are also planning to extend our operational Sheringham Shoal and Dudgeon projects off the Norfolk coast and develop a fourth phase of Dogger Bank. During the construction phase, these extension projects are anticipated to support more than 1,800 full time jobs per year across the UK and within East Anglia, generating more than £370 million in direct gross value added (GVA) to the economy.

However, having ambition alone is not sufficient and without further urgent action this economic opportunity presented by CP2030 is at risk.

AR7 later this year is the last best chance to secure ‘shovel-ready’ projects that can deliver for 2030. However, with network charging, connections reform, auction rules and wider market design all in flux there is an unprecedented amount of uncertainty going into this year’s auction. Several key decisions from Government over the next 100 days may well determine whether the CP2030 target remains achievable, or, more importantly, whether the potential economic benefits for the UK can be realised.

That is why Equinor is pleased to be an event partner at this year’s Global Offshore Wind (GOW) Conference (17– 18 June), as we believe the focus on the theme of ‘Mission: Possible’ couldn’t come at a more critical time. It offers an opportunity for industry, supply chain and policy makers to come together and align on the action needed.

From Equinor’s perspective the action needed now can be summarised in three steps: reset, scale and deliver.

Reset

Making the right call on key decisions over the next 100 days will be key to resetting investor confidence sufficiently ahead of AR7 for the auction to be successful.

A prompt decision needs to be made on Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA) and this needs to provide as much clarity and certainty as possible (e.g. on legacy arrangements) to investors well ahead of AR7. Whatever your view of the proposals to move to zonal pricing, it’s clear that, were the uncertainty to be prolonged or the can to be kicked down the road, this would lead to additional risk premia being priced into CfD bids that could otherwise be avoided by a clear decision either way.

Whether to extend the CfD contract term beyond 15 years as another big open question. With projects now having economic lifetimes of around 35 years, the current CfD contract covers less than 50% of the asset life. Our analysis has shown that extending the CfD to at least 20 years can reduce merchant tail risk and the cost of capital, bringing down CfD break-even prices by up to 10%.

The decision on CfD eligibility also looms large. Recent events show that delivery risk persists even once a project has secured its CfD. It’s our view that this risk is even higher the less mature a project is, which could undermine supply chain investments, and if the non-delivery framework is not strengthened this could encourage speculative bidding. Ultimately, if unconsented projects are to be eligible for the CfD then they should be bound to the same rules as consented projects to maintain a level playing field in the auction.

Scale

AR7 will undoubtedly need to deliver a record level of new offshore wind volume to keep the 2030 targets within reach. However, when it comes to securing pre-2030 inward investment into supply chain capacity, post-2030 pipeline visibility and certainty will be equally key.

As we argued at last year’s GOW, it takes more than one offshore wind project to make a factory, and it will take more than one successful auction to provide the supply chain with the line of sight to future orders to overcome fears of overcapacity in the long-term and have the confidence to invest in the short term. This is particularly important for floating offshore wind, where investment in enabling port infrastructure will be key to enabling local assembly.

We believe the Government should introduce an annual minimum capacity ambition based on long-term volume targets derived from the Strategic Spatial Energy Plan. This, in combination with a forward-looking schedule of seabed lease and CfD auctions, tailored to both fixed and floating wind, would, in our view, go a long way to enabling the supply chain and ports to scale up. A similar call was made at April’s WindEurope conference in Copenhagen, where industry called for 100GW of auctions over 10 years across the EU.

Deliver

In order to ensure awarded offshore wind capacity can be delivered and existing capacity retained, there needs to be a relentless focus within Government on ensuring policies are conducive to this.

Grid supply chains, particularly for HVDC, are under huge strain with transmission companies and developers, who are all competing for the same scarce supply chain capacity and manufacturing slots around the world. Government should consider establishing an equivalent of the Electricity Transmission Advanced Procurement Mechanism, a scheme put in place by Ofgem for Onshore Transmission Owners, to help developers manage large pre-commitments in the grid supply chain.

Many of the UK’s first offshore wind farms which make up the 15GW of current installed capacity will, by the early 2030s, be approaching the end of their original operational life. Action on policies to support lifetime extension and/or repowering is therefore needed to prevent the loss of renewable capacity.

Other live topics within the industry, such as wake effects, would also benefit from being viewed through the lens of whether they help this existing capacity to be retained.

The industry’s understanding of far-field wake effects has grown significantly in the last few years, and while there are differing views on how to respond, in our view it has become clear that buffers used in previous leasing rounds are not sufficient to mitigate the significant commercial impacts from wake effects. Whether existing projects are compensated or not for generation loses due to unforeseen wake effects from new lease areas will have a material effect on end-of-life decisions. Identifying, mitigating and potentially compensating impacts on other seabed users is already a key part of the planning framework and our view is that this issue should be no different. Key upcoming decisions in the planning process this year will likely set a precedent on this issue for years to come.",https://www.renewableuk.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-14 08:01:22.271962

This move will allow GM to assemble over two million vehicles annually in the US. The announcement comes shortly after the company committed $888 million to enhance its Tonawanda Propulsion plant in Buffalo, New York, for the development of GM’s next-generation V-8 engine.

General Motors is set to enhance its US production capabilities by expanding key manufacturing plants in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee. These plants will play a pivotal role in increasing the output of some of GM’s most popular vehicles. This move is aimed at meeting the growing demand for both gasoline-powered and electric vehicles in the US market. Each facility will focus on different vehicle types, ensuring that GM can continue to deliver a diverse lineup to its customers.

In Orion Township, Michigan, the Orion Assembly plant will begin producing gasoline-powered full-size SUVs and light-duty pickup trucks by early 2027. This facility’s new production line is designed to support the increasing demand for these vehicles. Meanwhile, GM’s Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan, will become the exclusive site for assembling the all-electric models, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ, and GMC Hummer EV. This strategic division of labor ensures that GM can efficiently manage the production of both traditional and electric vehicles in the region.

Kansas City, Kansas, will also see an uptick in production with the Fairfax Assembly plant slated to begin manufacturing the gasoline Chevrolet Equinox in mid-2027. The Equinox has already experienced a 30% increase in sales year-over-year in early 2025, reflecting the vehicle’s growing popularity. In addition to the Equinox, Fairfax is set to start producing the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt EV later this year. GM has further plans to invest in this facility for the production of its next-generation, affordable electric vehicles, reinforcing its commitment to EV innovation.

Spring Hill, Tennessee, will be another focal point for GM’s production expansion. Starting in 2027, Spring Hill Manufacturing will add the production of the gasoline-powered Chevrolet Blazer to its existing lines. The facility will continue to produce the Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq EVs, as well as the Cadillac XT5, which has been a key model for the brand. This expansion aims to meet the increasing demand for both gasoline and electric vehicles while supporting GM’s overall strategy for a more sustainable future.

These investments in US manufacturing plants underscore GM’s commitment to expanding its vehicle offerings while supporting American jobs. With an emphasis on both gasoline and electric vehicles, GM is positioning itself to lead the industry in innovation and production capacity. As the automotive landscape evolves, these plants will play a crucial role in GM’s strategy to meet the diverse needs of customers across the country.

“We believe the future of transportation will be shaped by American innovation and manufacturing,” said Mary Barra, GM’s Chair and CEO. “This investment highlights our continued dedication to US manufacturing and American jobs. Our goal is to give customers a wide variety of vehicles they can choose from and love.” GM operates 50 manufacturing plants across 19 US states, including 11 vehicle assembly facilities. The company supports nearly one million American jobs, including employees, suppliers, and dealers.

“Today’s announcement is more than just about numbers — it’s about hardworking Americans building vehicles they’re proud of, and that customers are proud to own,” said GM President Mark Reuss. “The scale of our manufacturing operations and their positive impact on communities across the country is something you can see firsthand.”

GM continues to see strong sales across both gasoline and electric vehicles in the US. The company is poised to secure its sixth consecutive year as the top seller of full-size pickups and its 51st year leading in full-size SUV sales. By the second half of 2024, GM became the second-largest seller of electric vehicles in the US, thanks to a portfolio of 13 EV models across Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC. Chevrolet is now the fastest-growing EV brand in the US and ranks second among all electric vehicle brands in terms of sales.

GM’s capital spending for 2025 remains in the range of $10 billion to $11 billion, with projections of $10 billion to $12 billion annually through 2027.

These reforms therefore stand to avoid potential political pushback on data center and other large load projects and help establish a more sustainable growth environment for large load customers and generators.","Texas has responded to rapid electrical load growth with legislative reforms.

On June 1, 2025, Texas Senate Bill 6 (SB 6), passed both chambers of the Legislature with bipartisan support and was sent to Governor Abbott for signature. Absent a veto by Gov. Abbott, the bill will become effective on September 1, 2025. SB 6 introduces significant changes to how large electricity users interact with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid and marks a notable shift in regulatory policy to address concerns over grid reliability and cost allocations.

ERCOT’s low energy costs have long attracted data centers and other large-scale electricity users. As the rapid growth of data centers, crypto mining and other large energy consumers continues to drive up demand, state officials have recognized the need for a more robust regulatory framework to maintain and enhance grid performance. Recent studies suggest that energy demand in Texas may double by 2031. SB 6 reflects recognition of the increasing demand and marks a policy shift by requiring large-scale electricity users to contribute more to grid investment and operation, while balancing reliability against anticipated demand growth.

Specifically, SB 6 targets new and expanding large load customers by imposing financial and operational requirements targeted at “level[ing] the playing field” between these major consumers and typical retail users. Among other things, the bill requires upfront financial commitments, demonstrable site control and disclosure of any backup generation capacity before such customers can connect to the grid. Additionally, it establishes new interconnection rules for co-located loads connecting to existing generation facilities, including a mandate that such interconnections incorporate an ERCOT-controlled “kill switch” to ensure grid operators can isolate these loads in emergencies.

SB 6 Provisions

Cost Sharing and Interconnection Standards for Large Load Customers

SB 6 introduces new financial and operational requirements for large load customers, defined as facilities with an energy demand of 75 megawatts (MW) or more (e.g., data centers, crypto mines and cloud storage facilities). It is one of the first attempts by a state to directly engage in large load management The bill specifically requires that these large load customers participate in paying for interconnection and grid costs and other ancillary services tied to their facility even when the facility plans to significantly rely on behind-the-meter use.

To establish a new connection to the ERCOT grid, large load customers must also comply with a new set of interconnection standards. They must disclose if they are shopping for electric services elsewhere in the state, to prevent duplicative infrastructure development. Additionally, new large load customers must demonstrate a financial commitment, establish control of the site for the proposed load location and pay the interconnecting utility a flat study fee of at least $100,000 for an initial transmission screening.

Further, large load customers must disclose to ERCOT whether they possess on-site backup generators capable of generating at least 50% of the facility’s requirements. In emergencies, ERCOT may require these large load customers to either deploy their on-site generators or curtail load.

Net Metering Rules and Oversight

SB 6 imposes additional regulatory oversight on new behind-the-meter interconnections and co-location agreements between large load customers and existing generation resources. Under the new rules, prior to implementing a co-location or interconnection agreement with a large load customer, power generation companies must first notify ERCOT of the proposed arrangement. ERCOT is then required to conduct a study of the system impacts of the proposed arrangement and submit its findings to the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) for approval. If the PUC does not respond timely, the interconnection agreement is automatically approved by default.

To preserve grid reliability during emergencies, the bill allows the PUC to impose specific conditions on the proposed interconnections and co-location agreements. These conditions may include requiring the behind-the-meter large load customers to curtail use during grid stress events and requiring the generation resource to make grid capacity available to the ERCOT region.

Load Curtailment and Demand Management Protocols

Most notably, SB 6 requires utilities to develop and implement protocols, including the installation of any necessary equipment or technology, to curtail large electrical loads during firm load shed events and emergencies. The utility and the customer should work together to accomplish a coordinated response. This new rule will apply only to new interconnections (excluding critical industrial and natural gas facilities) established after December 31, 2025.

Additionally, SB 6 directs ERCOT to develop a reliability service to competitively procure demand reductions from large load customers. Participating large load customers must curtail their usage during declared emergencies, with at least a 24-hour notice, and remain curtailed for the duration of the emergency or until the load can be safely recalled. ERCOT must prohibit participation by any large load customer that responds to the wholesale price of electricity or that participates in a different reliability service.

Impact on Data Centers and Other Large Load Customers

SB 6 represents one of the earliest state-level efforts to balance the need for effective regulation of large load customers with continued support for industry growth. The deadly blackouts in Texas during 2021’s Winter Storm Uri have made lawmakers more cautious with large loads, and other states could take cues from how industry responds to the Texas legislation. SB 6 imposes constraints for data centers and other high demand customers, particularly those hoping to rely on behind-the-meter generation. Large consumer facility developers may face delays in interconnection and energization timelines. The risk of downtime due to curtailments is significant for data centers, which depend critically on nearly continuous service. These added costs, barriers to connection and interruption risks will likely slow the rapid pace of data center development we’ve seen in Texas in recent years.

Nonetheless, these provisions may serve a longer-term purpose of ensuring grid reliability and efficiency. By heightening oversight and regulating development, ERCOT may be able to spread grid costs across a wider base of users. The costs imposed on the large energy-consuming facilities will enter the stream of commerce and be passed along to customers and investors. The bill’s requirements to notify regulators if projects are being developed elsewhere in the state will also help ensure there is fewer double counting of projects in ERCOT and allow regulators to focus their attention on the projects most likely to be built.

The announcement came last week as the state’s Republican governor, Mike Dunleavy, headed up the Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage.
He was joined by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
The federal officials spent days touring Alaska, including visiting the North Slope, where much of Alaska’s drilling and mining is focused.
In 2020, the Trump administration approved the Willow Project, a controversial ConocoPhillips oil drilling project that was later greenlit by the Biden administration.","The Department of the Interior announced a proposal last week to cancel its protections of 13 million acres of Alaskan land inside a previously created reserve.

More than 40 Indigenous communities rely on the acreage in question for clean water and critical subsistence resources like caribou, fish and other wildlife. Indigenous people have occupied the lands inside the reserve for millennia. Protected public lands have grown increasingly important at a time when changing climate conditions have destabilized life in the Arctic.

The announcement came last week as the state’s Republican governor, Mike Dunleavy, headed up the Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage. He was joined by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. The federal officials spent days touring Alaska, including visiting the North Slope, where much of Alaska’s drilling and mining is focused.

While some communities appreciated the cabinet members’ visit to the Arctic and the economic opportunities that increased resource extraction may bring, others worry about the negative effects it could have on their lives and livelihoods.

“ They want to come in and create pipelines and drill and mine and extract and log. We are the ones who will be most greatly impacted,” said Rochelle Adams, director of the Yukon River Protectors, an Indigenous nonprofit organization. “ We’re gonna have the health impacts, and we’re gonna have the medical costs and responsibilities, and we’re going to have bury our loved ones.”

The proposal would rescind the 2024 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rule that increased protections of designated “special areas” of Alaskan lands to limit oil and gas development and protect subsistence resources. The rules affect what is called the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A), which includes 23 million acres of BLM land, of which 13 million acres are special areas due to their wildlife, recreational and subsistence value.

The proposal is open to public comment until August 4, 2025, and is published in the Federal Register.

During the conference, Dunleavy, already 6 feet, 7 inches tall, was seated on stage in a chair with markedly higher legs than the other speakers, and he physically towered over the conversations throughout the day. From this perch, he joined other Republican speakers emphasizing party slogans, including “Make Alaska great again” and “unleashing energy dominance,” and referred to President Donald Trump’s executive order on Alaska energy from January, in which he promised to “immediately reverse” the Biden administration’s restrictions.

“We were sanctioning Alaska more than we were sanctioning Iran,” said Burgum. In a large ballroom with hundreds of attendees, Trump’s cabinet members condemned Biden’s conservation efforts and promised rural Alaskans more energy, jobs and infrastructure.

There are 229 federally recognized tribes in Alaska, and Alaska Natives are divided on the issue of continued development of the fossil fuels that have been a foundation of the state’s economy.

“ How are we ever going to have more development and infrastructure when we can’t even accommodate what we have in these communities already?” said Deilah Johnson, tribal resources director for the Village of Solomon, who was a speaker on rural Alaskan energy.

She said she supports renewable energy and efficiency measures over fossil fuels. She explained that building out infrastructure in Alaska holds unique challenges, such as short building seasons; expensive materials, labor and shipping; and difficult environmental conditions. These factors already hold back existing communities from growth and safe housing for its current residents.

Another speaker, Mayor Josiah Patkotak of North Slope Borough, said that getting communities plugged into the natural gas pipeline instead of drums of diesel would be life-changing. He praised the cabinet members’ overnight stay in his community and said the previous administration had flown in, “had the town hall meeting [and] flew out.”

Dunleavy said public opinion is on the side of the administration, both in Alaska and nationally. His introductory morning talk was followed by a presentation from Matt Larkin of Dittman Research, an Alaska-based polling company. Larkin shared results that said 77 percent of Alaskans supported the construction of a natural gas pipeline, and 61 percent of respondents nationwide supported the governor and cabinet secretaries’ mission to expand Alaska’s role in oil and gas.

Dunleavy and Burgum claimed that relying on imported resources to generate U.S. energy was dangerous, since “ you may end up trying to get minerals or energy from places that are dictatorships or that don’t have laws for good child labor.”

They spoke to a ballroom that was divided among supporters and opponents of the administration’s energy goals. For example, when Zeldin promised that developing the North Slope was the archway to “a golden age of American prosperity and freedom,” some tables of attendees clapped loudly, while others sat silent.

The federal officials had messages specifically for the environmentalists in the room.

“ If you care about the environment, then you should want every drop of oil, every cubic foot of gas, every electron made in the United States because we do it cleaner, smarter and safer than anybody else in the world,” said Burgum.

Environmentalists disagreed. “Oil and gas pollute the environment and cause climate change, period,” said Matt Jackson, who was born and raised in Alaska and was attending the conference as the senior manager for the state at The Wilderness Society, an environmental nonprofit. “The U.S. should be positioning itself as a global leader in the clean, renewable energy that will power the future. While Sec. Burgum is stuck in the past, arguing about whose pollution is the least bad, other countries are overtaking us on the energy technologies that will matter most in the 21st century- renewables.”

At a press briefing after the ballroom speeches, the officials emphasized a different aspect of their proposed development: selling natural gas to Asian markets. Wright, who came to the administration from the oil and gas industry, thanked foreign journalists for attending. “ Our goal with this trip was to have Asian countries that are large consumers of American energy exports to come see the infrastructure,” he said, “ and the main thing we’re looking to get is people that want to buy Alaskan natural gas.”

While Trump cabinet members were inside the convention center, about 50 people rallied outside with signs that read “We can’t eat money” and “Hands off our public lands.” Several people gave speeches, including Adams of Yukon River Protectors.

“You are not welcome here!” she said as she pointed to the convention center. “And this goes for the people who want to extract all across our state … We don’t want Alaska opened up as a warehouse. We want to protect our lands.”

The dissent wasn’t limited to the sidewalk. Inside the conference, attendees who had arrived to talk about sustainable energy expressed disappointment.

“Listening to Secretary Burgum and Secretary Wright talk about the announcement and the law, it’s clear they have a very one-sided understanding of the history of Alaska and the history of the NPR-A,” said Jackson.

The Interior announcement last week cited the original Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 that created the reserve, and stated that the Biden administration’s 2024 rule conflicts with the original intent of the act. The Biden rule expanded protections of special areas in the western Arctic and also opened up avenues to expand current protected areas and create new ones. It limited future oil and gas leasing and industrial development in certain areas that are “collectively known for their globally significant intact habitat for wildlife, including grizzly and polar bears, caribou and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds.”

The original act was as a response to oil shortages and the 1973 Arab oil embargo, but it included provisions for conservation. The original document assured maximum protection to areas with high “surface values,” such as “significant subsistence, recreational, fish and wildlife, or historical or scenic value.” In the following years, it has been amended multiple times, moves that were often met with legal and public opinion opposition. For example, in 2006, the George W. Bush administration tried to open areas to oil and gas, but the lease sale got bogged down by various challenges. The Obama administration granted additional drilling in the reserve and expanded the special areas from approximately 8 million acres to the current 13. In 2020, the Trump administration approved the Willow Project, a controversial ConocoPhillips oil drilling project that was later greenlit by the Biden administration.

“ The ongoing theme is that we’re just selling Alaska,” said Johnson, of the Village of Solomon, “and I think that there’s a lot of inconsideration for the people because this is somebody’s home, in every part of Alaska, and I don’t feel like that’s being considered in any shape or form, and that is scary to me. It’s actually very terrifying.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ASEC_KF_pressconf1-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 06:01:33.544314

In 2025, analysts expect its revenues to jump by 73%, and in 2026, they anticipate an even faster growth rate approaching 100%.

There's just one problem: Included in Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is a provision that would eliminate the federal tax credits for electric vehicles. That would effectively raise the prices of EVs by $4,000 to $7,500 -- a huge potential blow to demand. When you look at the numbers, things could quickly get ugly for Lucid. But there's also some reason for hope.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

Lucid Group's major flaw

Lucid's sales growth over the next couple of years will primarily be driven by its recently introduced Gravity SUV. Previously, the company only offered its Air sedan, which ranged in price between $70,000 and around $100,000 depending on the configuration. SUVs, however, are much more popular than sedans in the U.S. right now.

Long term, however, it will be critical for Lucid to develop some mass-market vehicles, which are typically priced under $50,000. Tesla's two mass-market models -- the Model 3 and Model Y -- currently account for more than 90% of its unit sales. Such vehicles bring scale to sales growth, but also to operational leverage, which is immensely beneficial to profitability. If the U.S. eliminates federal EV tax incentives, having more affordable vehicles in its lineup will be crucial to Lucid's growth and stability.

While the company has previously teased plans to launch several new mass-market models in 2026, details about those potential EVs have been scarce. Plus, it takes billions of dollars to get a new EV model to market. With less than $2 billion in cash on its books, Lucid will likely need to tap the credit and equity markets again before these vehicles launch. Over the past 12 months, it booked a net loss of $3.8 billion.

This all puts Lucid in a tight spot. It needs to get mass-market vehicles on the road to boost sales, scale, and profitability. But it will need more capital to do that, and if Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress end the federal EV tax credit, that could lead investors to pull back from the space, limiting Lucid's ability to easily raise capital. That would not be a good position for an early stage, capital-intensive business to find itself in.

But could the elimination of EV tax credits actually end up helping Lucid in the long term?

Who has the advantage in a less EV-friendly marketplace?

There's a case to be made that ending the EV tax credit could eventually benefit Lucid. Demand for EVs would likely take a hit over the short term as the real costs to consumers rise, but if Lucid can get its affordable models to market on schedule, that could mitigate some of the impact. Meanwhile, competitors that fail to introduce mass-market EVs could struggle to maintain market share, giving Lucid more room to grow.

I'm skeptical of this optimistic view. Lucid is far behind competitors like Rivian and Tesla in terms of both financing and the ability to launch additional affordable vehicles. The recent departure of its longtime CEO may put even more strain on its ability to raise capital. In terms of publicly traded EV companies, Lucid arguably has the most to lose due to its diminutive size and limited lineup.

Will Trump's bill cause Lucid to go bankrupt? Not immediately. But the company has been relatively quiet about its plans for new mass-market EVs, and it could be years before its production scales meaningfully. That leaves it with a limited lineup of high-priced vehicles -- not an ideal situation when achieving scale will require it to provide affordable options.

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said the draft rule, which proposes a total 24.02 billion gallon blending level in 2026, is a “very strong starting point for further discussions.” Shaw said the association will need time to evaluate the proposal, specifically as it relates to changes in credits for imported fuels and feedstocks.

‘Femi Awolesi, born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, has embraced big questions and bold answers. Whether standing before a packed room of engineers and policy experts in Raleigh, North Carolina, or examining the lived experiences of communities in the shadow of Louisiana’s industrial corridor, his message has been clear: sustainability must be inclusive, and justice must be at its core.

Earlier this week, June 10, 2025, Awolesi took the stage at the 118th Annual Conference and Exhibition of the Air & Waste Management Association (A&WMA), one of the most respected global gatherings of environmental professionals. His technical session, rooted in original research conducted in southern Louisiana, explored public perceptions of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects—one of the cutting-edge technologies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

But rather than dwelling only on technological advancements, Awolesi challenged the room to examine the social foundations of innovation. “Trust building is important to foster an inclusive energy transition,” he declared. “Trust takes time and effort to build, particularly in a society with a long history of distrust like Louisiana.” These were not just words of theory; they were drawn from months of informal and formal conversations, including stakeholder interviews, focus groups with fence-line communities, and immersive fieldwork in regions historically burdened by environmental injustice.

“Everyone should be a member, not just a number,” he further suggested, emphasizing the need for participatory governance in energy planning. His talk resonated across sectors—receiving positive feedback from attendees after his delivery.

This engagement comes on the heels of another major milestone in Awolesi’s academic journey. On May 28, 2025, he successfully defended his doctoral dissertation in a rigorous two-hour session before a five-member faculty panel at Louisiana State University (LSU). The dissertation, titled “Rethinking Green Building Development Through Policy and Operational Metrics: Insights from Baton Rouge and Beyond,” explores why some cities lag behind in sustainable construction and offers a practical tool—the Operational Sustainability Index (OPSi)—for measuring real-world building performance after certification. The research is already gaining attention in academic circles and policy discussions.

A Scholar’s Rise from Lagos

Awolesi’s intellectual journey began in the bustling suburban area of Lagos, where he attended Hon-Bethel Nursery and Primary School—a private school—and later, Ojodu Junior Grammar School and Babs Fafunwa Millennium Senior Secondary School—both public institutions. It was during these formative years that he cultivated a deep passion for science, communication, and people. He went on to graduate as a top-ranking student in the Faculty of Science at Olabisi Onabanjo University, earning his degree in Industrial Chemistry.

But it was not just academic curiosity that propelled him forward—it was also poverty and purpose: the fear of remaining poor, both mentally and economically; the conviction that science and technology must serve the society from which they arise; and the belief that he could effect real change in his everyday environment.

That belief carried him into graduate research and professional experiences across both Nigeria and the United States. After serving as a research assistant at Landmark University during his National Youth Service Corps (a mandatory post-tertiary program for Nigerian graduates), and later taking on environmental management roles with PAMM Environmental Services in Lagos, he earned a scholarship to pursue advanced studies in the U.S.

Awolesi spent a year at Mississippi State University, conducting research in the Department of Chemistry on Biochar and its applications in soil remediation and wastewater treatment. He later advanced to Louisiana State University (LSU), where he enrolled in a rare and ambitious triple-track graduate program: a PhD in Environmental Sciences, an MS in Construction Management, and a Graduate Certificate in Environmental and Energy Policy. All three credentials are scheduled to be conferred in August 2025—a remarkable achievement accomplished by very few graduate students.

Yet, Awolesi’s academic accomplishments are only part of his story. He has authored or co-authored over 15 peer-reviewed articles, several of which have appeared in leading international journals such as Energy and Built Environment. His published research offers insights that are adaptable to both policy and practice—locally and globally—spanning environments from school campuses to broader urban communities.

A Voice for Environmental Justice

Throughout his research, Awolesi has placed community impact at the forefront. His doctoral work incorporates stakeholder engagement and investigates how public policies can be restructured to make green building development widespread, especially in underserved cities like Baton Rouge. He strongly advocates for an inclusive energy transition and has developed a conceptual framework to clarify this approach, emphasizing the pillars of justice, education, and active participation.

“Energy literacy is about moving from being a consumer as community citizens, but rather being a prosumer by being involved in the dialogues that matter with regard to energy innovation,” he stated in effect during his A&WMA presentation.

Beyond the classroom and research lab, Awolesi has volunteered with the Louisiana State University Industrial Assessment Center, a program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. In this role, he has conducted sustainability audits for industrial facilities across Louisiana, helping companies identify pathways to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency.

“Urban sustainability cannot be attained without factor measurement, evaluation, and control,” he noted in a LinkedIn post following an energy and sustainability assessment conducted at Louisiana Fish Fry Products in Baton Rouge.

Recognition and Global Reach

Awolesi’s efforts have not gone unnoticed. He has received several prestigious awards for sustainability research, including the IFMA Fellows Scholarship and the A&WMA Sustainability Research Related to Waste Management Scholarship—two of the most competitive honors available to emerging scholars and professionals in the field. He was also recently inducted into Phi Kappa Phi, one of America’s oldest and most selective academic honor societies.

During the Honors and Awards Ceremony at the conclusion of A&WMA’s four-day conference in Raleigh, Awolesi was named runner-up for the Young Professional Best Paper Award in the Industry, Power, Government, and Indigenous (IPGI) Sectors Group. The award recognizes outstanding technical contributions from young professionals, defined as those 35 years old or younger, based on the submission and peer review of a full-length paper or extended abstract.

Beyond accolades, Awolesi continues to pay it forward. As part of LSU’s academic outreach, he has co-designed and facilitated workshops for high school students in environmental justice communities—teaching them how to monitor air pollution, analyze environmental data, and communicate findings to local officials.

“There’s no progress without people,” he affirms. “The most brilliant idea means nothing if it can’t be communicated, understood, and trusted by the communities it is meant to serve.”

From the lecture theatres of Olabisi Onabanjo University to international stages and scholarly journals, ‘Femi Awolesi is building more than a career—he is building a legacy of equity-driven innovation. “And it all began in Lagos,” he reflects, “where I learned that we don’t just inherit history—we shape it.”",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Screenshot_20250614-085636.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 12:11:45.687700

Still, OP is saving a lot of money per month on their bill. According to NerdWallet, the average monthly electricity bill in the U.S. is $136.84. Each year, homeowners can save about $1,500 on their electricity bills, as an EcoFlow blog post pointed out.

""Generally, I've been pretty happy with my solar,"" OP said.

Solar energy doesn't produce air pollution or release planet-warming gases like other forms of power. It is also one of the best ways to save money on your home's electricity bill, as OP demonstrated with their monthly bill.

While the cost of installing solar panels could be high, it doesn't take long to break even. According to EnergySage, solar begins paying for itself after about 7.1 years.

Tax credits and rebates, like the Inflation Reduction Act, can also knock down the initial costs of installing solar. With the Residential Clean Energy Credit, homeowners can save up to 30% on a new solar installation.

However, the savings may not be around for much longer, as Congress might eliminate these credits, stopping homeowners from saving $10,000 on average.

It's best to take advantage of the savings available now before they are gone. EnergySage also offers free tools to find the lowest solar installation estimates in your area to help you maximize your savings.

The company's mapping tool allows you to see the average cost of solar panel systems in your state and all the local incentives as well, helping to give you the best price on your solar installation.

In the Reddit post, commenters shared their own perspectives on solar panels.

""You lucky dog,"" one commenter wrote.

Others shared their thoughts on choosing the right solar company.

""Go with a company that specializes and focuses on solar,"" one wrote.

Help Grow Congressional Support for Museums

Earlier this year, the Congressional Museum Caucus was created by co-chairs Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY) and Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH). AAM advocated for the creation of the caucus, which is made up of members of the House of Representatives. The goal of the caucus is to help raise awareness within Congress of issues impacting museums.

Action: Ask your House member to show their support for museums by joining the bipartisan Congressional Museum Caucus. We strongly recommend editing the draft letter below, sharing why museums are important to you and to your community.

If you attended Museums Advocacy Day, please reach out to the staff person that you met with to follow up on the request for the House member to join the caucus.

Tax Policy Legislation

Last month, the House passed a sweeping tax package. The Senate is currently working on its own version, and details have yet to be released. Eventually, the House and Senate will need to come to an agreement to resolve the differences between the two versions.

The House bill would reinstate a modest non-itemizer deduction for tax years 2025-2028 at $150 for single taxpayers and $300 for married taxpayers. While this is a step in the right direction, this provision is not as strong as those in the Charitable Act (S. 317/H.R. 801), one of AAM’s top legislative priorities. The deduction would allow the more than 90% of taxpayers who do not itemize to deduct charitable gifts.

The House bill also contains troubling provisions for nonprofit charitable organizations, including museums. We oppose several of the House bill’s provisions, including expanding the excise tax on investment income of university endowments, which could impact resources for college and university museums and galleries, and increasing the foundation excise tax thus reducing availability of grant funds.

AAM is working with our coalition partners in the Charitable Giving Coalition, Independent Sector, National Council of Nonprofits, and the Community Impact Coalition to protect and advance the interests of museums, preserve and expand the charitable deduction, and defeat anti-charity provisions.

FY26 Appropriations

The President released his full Budget for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26), which included the elimination of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). Please note, the president’s budget is just a proposal. Congress sets the spending limits for the agencies.

Congress has begun the Appropriations process to fund the federal government for FY26.

Thank you to everyone who contacted their members of Congress to encourage them to support IMLS funding in FY26. View the final letters and signers for the Senate and House. Note, some members of Congress who serve on the Appropriations Committee, the committee that writes the funding bills, often do not sign onto these letters as they would essentially be sending the letters to themselves.

The House Appropriations Committee released its schedule for consideration of their versions of the FY26 Appropriations Bills. Of note:

Subcommittee consideration of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bill (Interior) will be on June 23, with full committee consideration on June 26. The Interior bill includes agencies such as the NEA, NEH, and the National Park Service (NPS).

Subcommittee consideration for the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies bill (LHHS) will be on July 21, with full committee consideration on July 24. The LHHS bill includes IMLS.

AAM’s President and CEO Marilyn Jackson provided written testimony to the House Appropriations Committee:

Support of funding for the IMLS Office of Museums Services

Support of funding NEH, NEA, Smithsonian Institution, and Historic Preservation Programs

The Senate Appropriations Committee has not yet released its schedule for consideration of the Appropriations bills.

Rescissions Package

The President sent a Rescissions Package to Congress. A Rescissions Package proposes cuts from current spending (in this case, FY25) that Congress would need to vote on to approve. Congress has 45 days to consider the package, or the funding remains where Congress originally intended. The House passed the package this week. The Senate has not yet considered the package. The IMLS, NEH, and NEA funding cuts were not included in the President’s Rescissions Package but could be included in potential future packages. AAM will continue to monitor these developments closely. If those funding cuts are sent to Congress and they approve them, it would take away a key argument in the lawsuits that the President cannot eliminate the agency and not use the funding appropriated to the agency without Congressional approval.

The relatively young brand, part of Geely, is the latest automaker from China to launch sales in the Europe amid a still-lukewarm amount of interest in the commercial van segment.

Last-mile electric delivery van startups are almost all gone with established automakers remaining, but landing large orders is still proving difficult.

While Chinese car brands appear unlikely to land in the US anytime soon, the same is not true across the Atlantic, with a growing variety of passenger and commercial models now available to buyers in Europe in every price category.

Farizon is far from a being a household name across the pond, but at the moment the brand isn't even the only van from China that's now available in the UK. That's a big change from just a few years ago.

Eager to capture a slice of the elusive but constantly just-over-the-next-hill commercial and last-mile delivery market before it fills up with local competitors, Farizon's SuperVan, or SV, is aimed at a vast variety of familiar customers that, to date, have mostly been using vans powered by rather tiny diesel engines.

With the electrification of the commercial van segment gaining some modest traction after plenty of false starts, Farizon is opening a flagship dealership in London's Park Royal industrial area.

The vans themselves offer a choice of three batteries, in 67-kWh, 83-kWh, and 106-kWh flavors, in a total of eight variants, ranging from 177 to 247 miles in the combined WLTP cycle, and a maximum urban range of 342 miles.

With payloads of up to 3,064 lbs and a maximum 4,409-lb towing capacity, the vans promise commercial users plenty of versatility, with the largest variant featuring 459 cubic feet of interior space.

The two smaller battery packs are lithium iron phosphate (LFP) units, meant to keep costs down, while the largest 106-kWh pack is an NMC battery.

Farizon's vans have begun arriving in the UK in recent months.

The vans start at $54,000 for the L1 H1 model with Jameel Motors UK, a leading commercial vehicle dealer, set to offer the vans along with providing aftersales support.

Meanwhile, logistics giant DHL is slated to help coordinate the brand's launch.

""Setting up an entirely new operation is a significant undertaking. By giving Farizon a ready-made network and access to the highest level of automotive logistics expertise, we're enabling seamless market entry,"" said Paul Stone, MD Manufacturing Logistics, DHL Supply Chain.

Farizon is the latest in a string of successful launches of Chinese-produced brands in Europe, but it's also targeting a vehicle category that has been resistant to big changes.

If Farizon's launch in the UK reflects one other particular trend, it's the one where it's the more established automakers that have actually made it into mass production when it comes to commercial EVs, rather than cottage industry startups that had attracted a lot of attention starting a decade ago.

Most of those startups are now gone, having succumbed to typical startup cashflow issues, while the larger automakers are slowly trying to get buyers large and small interested in their wares.

Concerns over charging infrastructure certainly play a role in the rate of commercial EV adoption, especially for small businesses. But there are other barriers as well in this sphere, including the high costs of some of the available models.

Finding large fleet buyers has always been one of the first steps in the launch of a new commercial model. But this hasn't been as easy in the age of electrification, with few automakers taking the risk.

Farizon itself was launched only in 2016 and it has the backing of Geely Holding Group, which also owns Volvo, Polestar, Lotus, Zeekr, and several other brands.

So it's not a small player—just a relatively new one.

One of the problems with this segment is that there have been only a handful of large fleet buyers to court among the early adopters, including the big retail and logistics companies. Established van makers have quickly maxed out the early wave of orders from these big fleet buyers with some serious effort, but after that, automakers have to convert plumbing businesses and mom-and-pop shops to electric van religion to keep sales going.

At the moment, there is no danger of Farizon appearing stateside to challenge existing EV van makers with the most momentum, including Rivian.

But it is worth noting that the demand for electric vans isn't quite what it was projected to be, with GM's BrightDrop having already taken a few steps back when it comes to production.

Kia, on the other hand, is quite bullish about its PBV lineup, though it also has a much more global audience.

Whether this status quo will change drastically by 2030 remains to be seen, but even getting to 20% of the commercial van market now seems like an overly optimistic estimate for the end of the decade.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/farizon-sv-684c4adb8c5d0.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.706xh;0,0.271xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-06-14 15:05:50.514332

The dispute between California and the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.
""Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process.
Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act.","President Donald Trump on yesterday signed three measures that block California’s mandates to phase out gas-powered cars and clean up diesel trucks. And California immediately struck back with a lawsuit and a vow to continue setting standards.

The move by Trump and Congress deals a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles and could upend its decades-long authority to clean up its air pollution, which is the worst in the nation.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate,” Trump said at the White House. “And they’re never coming back.” He said the state's zero-emission car phaseout ""has been a disaster for this country.""

Last month, Congress used the Congressional Review Act to revoke three waivers that the Biden administration granted to California to set standards phasing out gas-powered cars and diesel trucks. Trump’s signing makes that official. The dispute between California and the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.

Many legal experts, along with the Government Accountability Office and Senate Parliamentarian, said Congress has no authority to revoke the waivers.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit against Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, arguing that it’s an unlawful use of the review act.

""Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process. We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement Thursday.

Ten other states that are enforcing California's emissions rules joined the lawsuit — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

Newsom on Thursday also issued an executive order that reaffirms the state's commitment to phasing out gas and diesel-powered vehicles. He directed the Air Resources Board to craft another mandate for cars and trucks — to either bolster its existing mandates or replace them in case they lose in court.

Newsom also directed the air board to create a public list of automakers and truck manufacturers that are following California's emissions rules, and companies that take early action to convert fleets to zero-emission trucks ""regardless of the status of those regulations under federal law."" And he ordered state agencies within 60 days to determine what more can be done to help consumers with the transition to electric vehicles, including eliminating obstacles to building more charging stations.

Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act. Before now, the federal government has never blocked any of California’s dozens of rules.

Under California’s mandate enacted in 2022, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. It builds on decades of tightening emissions standards for cars sold in the state.

Congress also blocked California’s 2020 Advanced Clean Trucks rule, an unprecedented measure that requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035. A third vote revoked the waiver for a 2020 state regulation reducing nitrogen oxides — a key ingredient of smog — emitted by trucks and buses..

Trump said his actions mean those rules ""are fully and expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act and cannot be implemented.""

""Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation,"" he wrote. (California's mandate applies only to vehicles sold in the state; the other states agreed to enact the same rules.)",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c9fc52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F26%2F84%2F41c3b08a422ca6dc035ac5b30e0a%2Fcalifornia-sues-trump-blocking-clean-air-rules-cars.JPEG,N,,2025-06-14 05:01:29.961675

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners. JetZero has said it’s already raised about $300 million toward investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027. United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production. Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina’s robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903. “North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.” The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project discussed earlier Thursday by a state committee that awards economic incentives. State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.35 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met. A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers’ paychecks. The incentives also include up to $785 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and up to $450 million from the General Assembly in part to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures. A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states. JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus. “We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O’Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It’s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.” While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles. The 5-year-old company says the plane’s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero. JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared. “It’s going to deliver a better passenger experience than you’ve ever had before on any other plane,” O’Leary said. Stein said the state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets. The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County. North Carolina’s previous largest economic development project, measured by employment, was revealed in 2022, when Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Chatham County, promising 7,500 jobs.

Australia allows emissions reporting for biomethane, H2

Sydney, 13 June (Argus) — The Australian government will enable companies to report scope 1 emissions from the consumption of biomethane and hydrogen, which will need to be backed by eligible renewable gas certificates, it announced today. Companies will be able to prove that the gas they receive from the natural gas network and consume in a reporting year contains an amount of renewable gas, as represented by renewable gas certificates retired or completed by them or on their behalf, adjusted for losses, the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) said on 13 June. The new product guarantee of origin (PGO) certificates registered under the guarantee of origin (GO) scheme, as well as the renewable gas guarantee of origin (RGGO) certificates issued under the GreenPower Renewable Gas Certification (RGC), will both be allowed. Any gas sourced from the natural gas network that is not covered by the new certificate-backed loss-adjusted amount must be reported as natural gas, the DCCEEW said. The changes are part of updates to the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme, which is used to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy production and consumption. These are the latest changes following the implementation of the recommendations made at the end of 2023 by Australia's Climate Change Authority (CCA), which reviews the NGER scheme every five years. The market-based reporting allowing companies to report the scope 1 emissions benefits from their renewable gas purchases will start from 1 July 2025, and be applicable from the July 2025-June 2026 financial year onwards. They will affect NGER scheme reports to be submitted by corporations by 31 October 2026. The updates also include amendments to support the reclassification of hydrogen as a fuel type. Hydrogen was previously classified in the NGER scheme as an energy commodity. The DCCEEW will monitor the uptake of biomethane as a feedstock for ammonia and hydrogen production and may revisit some technical rules in future annual NGER scheme updates, it said. Potential impact on oil and gas facilities Other changes announced on 13 June include updates to the emission factors used in two methods for gas flared in oil and natural gas operations. Some submissions to a public consultation raised concerns about the potential overestimation of methane emissions resulting from the assumption that flare gas is 100pc methane, and implications of the proposed emission factors on facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism, the DCCEEW said. The Clean Energy Regulator has the discretion to vary the facility's baseline to accommodate the regulatory change if the revised factors have a material impact on emissions reported by a facility covered by the safeguard mechanism, it said. Facilities under the oil and gas extraction sector received a combined 3.07mn safeguard mechanism credits (SMCs) in the July 2023-June 2024 financial year as their covered scope 1 emissions were below their baselines.

UK ETS emissions fell by 11pc on the year in 2024

Seville, 12 June (Argus) — Emissions in sectors covered by the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS) declined by 11.5pc year on year in 2024, data published by the UK ETS authority show, slowing their decline slightly from the previous year. Stationary installations covered by the UK ETS emitted 76.7mn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), down by 12.9pc from 2023, the data show. But this was offset somewhat by a 2pc increase in aviation emissions to 8.99mn t CO2e. Overall UK ETS emissions now have declined for two consecutive years, having fallen by 12.5pc in 2023. Emissions under the scheme rose by 2.5pc in 2022, as a strong rebound in aviation activity following earlier Covid-19 restrictions outweighed declining stationary emissions. Stationary emissions have decreased in every year since the scheme launched in 2021. The majority of the decline in stationary emissions under the UK ETS last year took place in the power sector, where emissions dropped by 18.2pc to 30.6mn t CO2e. The country's last coal-fired plant, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, closed in September last year. And the share of gas-fired output in the generation mix dipped as wind, solar and biomass production and electricity imports edged higher. Industrial emissions also declined, by 8.9pc to 46.1mn t CO2e. The iron and steel sector posted the largest relative drop of 30pc to 6.54mn t CO2e. Emissions from crude extraction fell by 6.4pc to 6.0mn t CO2e, while emissions from gas extraction, manufacture and distribution activities decreased by 8.9pc to 5.3mn t CO2e. The chemicals sector emitted 2.28mn t CO2e, down by 5.2pc on the year. A total of 43 installations were marked as having surrendered fewer carbon allowances than their cumulative emissions since the launch of the UK ETS, as of 1 May. A further two installations failed to report their emissions by the deadline. ""Appropriate enforcement action"" will be taken against operators that fail to surrender the required allowances, the UK ETS authority said. Overall greenhouse gas emissions across the UK economy dropped by a smaller 4pc last year, data published by the government in March show. This decline also was driven principally by lower gas and coal use in the power and industry sectors, with smaller declines in transport and agriculture, not covered by the UK ETS, and an increase in buildings emissions, also out of the scheme's scope. Emissions under the EU ETS in 2024 dipped by a projected 4.5pc from a year earlier, based on preliminary data published by the European Commission in April. The UK and EU last month announced that they will ""work towards"" linking the two systems together.

EPA seeks end to power plant CO2, mercury rules

Washington, 11 June (Argus) — The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday proposed the repeal of CO2 and mercury emissions standards for power plants, its latest steps in an effort to undo many of the regulations enacted by President Donald Trump's predecessors The agency said the repeals will help bring about an end to the ""war on much of our domestic energy supply"" waged by previous administrations, while saving consumers money ""We have chosen to both protect the environment and grow the economy,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said. ""There was this false binary choice made before we got here."" Together, the repeals would save more than $1bn/yr for American families, Zeldin said. The standards, finalized last year by EPA during the administration of former president Joe Biden, cover CO2 emissions from existing and new coal-fired power plants and new natural gas-fired units, as well as mercury emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants. At the time, EPA said the CO2 rules will lead to a 90pc reduction in emissions from coal-fired power plants, while it tightened the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for coal- and oil-fired units by 67pc and included new emissions-monitoring requirements. In addition, the MATS for lignite-fired units were tightened by 70pc to put them in line with the standards for other coal plants. The CO2 rule includes standards for new coal and gas units and guidance for existing coal-fired power plants, the latter of which vary by unit type, size and other factors such as whether a power plant provides baseload or backup power. It does not include standards for existing gas-fired generators, which EPA had proposed in 2023 but last year decided to scrap in favor of a ""new, comprehensive approach"". While the CO2 regulation would be fully repealed, Zeldin said the agency is proposing to only undo last year's ""gratuitous"" changes to MATS, such as the new lignite standards. ""If finalized no power plant will be allowed to emit more than they do now or as much as they did one or two years ago,"" he said. In addition to repealing the two Biden regulations, EPA is proposing to undo the Clean Power Plan, developed by the agency during the administration of former president Barack Obama. It would do this in part by reversing a previous agency determination that it could regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants, and by also finding that those emissions ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution."" The Clean Power Plan has never been enforced, and the US Supreme Court in 2022 ruled the agency lacked the authority to regulate CO2 emissions from power plants in the way envisioned by that approach. Unlike during Trump's first term, when EPA first sought to repeal the Clean Power Plan, the agency this time around is not proposing any replacement. The previous replacement rule was struck down by the US District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021. The lack of a new rule could make EPA more vulnerable to legal challenges, which are all but certain to be filed by environmental groups and some states. ""This administration is transparently trading American lives for campaign dollars and the support of fossil fuel companies, and Americans ought to be disgusted and outraged that their government has launched an assault on our health and our future,"" Sierra Club climate policy director Patrick Drupp said. Zeldin said he was not concerned about any potential litigation. ""I would say with great enthusiasm and excitement for the future, I know we are absolutely going down the right path,"" he said. Coal and electric sector groups cheered EPA's proposal. ""Today's announcement nullifies two of EPA's most consequential air rules, removing deliberately unattainable standards and leveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them,"" National Mining Association president Rich Nolan said. EPA in March included the CO2 and mercury rules among 31 Obama and Biden-era regulations and actions it planned to review and potentially repeal. Since then, the White House has identified more than 60 fossil fuel-fired power plants that will have two extra years to comply with the more-stringent MATS, giving them a reprieve while EPA works to formally repeal the regulations. The March announcement also included a reconsideration of the 2009 endangerment finding for GHG emissions, which underpins all of the major climate regulations EPA issued in recent years. ""I don't have anything to announce today as it relates to any proposed rulemaking that may be to come on that topic,"" Zeldin said. EPA will open a 45-day public comment period on each proposed repeal once they are published in the Federal Register .

EIA raises US 2026 renewables outlook

Houston, 11 June (Argus) — The US renewable energy fleet remains on track to provide an increasing portion of the country's total electricity over the next two years, even with some changes in the US Energy Information Administration's (EIA) latest projections. Renewable energy is on track to supply almost 1.1bn MWh in 2025 and 1.2bn MWh in 2026, enough to account for roughly 25pc and 27pc of all US generation in those years, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook report. The 2025 estimate is less than 1pc lower than the agency's forecast in May, while the 2026 outlook is about 2pc higher. Renewables in 2024 generated almost 948mn MWh, about 23pc of all US generation. EIA attributes the higher share from renewables to projects coming on line through the end of 2026. The agency expects developers to add about 32,500MW of utility-scale solar to the grid this year, which would surpass the record high of 30,000MW in 2024. EIA anticipates about 7,700MW of new capacity from the wind sector this year. Wind capacity in 2024 expanded by about 5,100MW, its lowest showing since 2014. The month-over-month change in the larger renewables outlook corresponds with higher expectations for wind and solar generation next year. Wind farms are now on track to provide about 506mn MWh in 2026, while utility-scale solar farms will generate around 350mn MWh, each about 2pc higher from May's outlook. If the solar projection bears out, it would surpass hydropower in 2025 as the second most prevalent form of renewable generation in the US. In the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) territory, EIA expects non-hydropower renewable generators are on pace to supply nearly 179mn MWh in 2025, down by less than 1pc from last month's outlook. But the 216mn MWh now anticipated from the sector in 2026 marks an almost 10pc increase from May's predictions for the Texas grid. EIA's lowered its predictions for non-hydropower renewables in the New York Independent System Operator's footprint by less than 1pc for 2025 and by 4pc for 2026, to 11.5mn MWh and just under 13mn MWh, respectively. Revisions to other regional forecasts were minimal. EIA increased its expectations for non-hydropower renewables in the areas managed by the PJM Interconnection, ISO-New England and Midcontinent Independent System Operator by less than 1pc for both 2025 and 2026. Renewable energy resources for EIA's purposes include conventional hydropower, wind, solar projects larger than 1MW, geothermal and certain forms of biomass.

The proposal increases biomass-based diesel mandates and aims to limit the Renewable Fuel Standard to liquid fuels.

Iowa politicians and agricultural leaders praised the proposal, citing potential benefits for the state's biofuel and agricultural industries.

President Donald Trump's administration is proposing to increase the amounts of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation's fuel mix over the next two years, driven by a surge in biomass-based diesel mandates.

After months of lobbying on the issue, the biofuels industry welcomed the Friday, June 13 announcement, which proposes to raise the Renewable Volume Obligation levels, a provision that sets specific targets for how much for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels each refiner or importer must blend into gasoline and diesel fuel.

The proposal also includes measures to discourage biofuel imports and calls for limiting the Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets an overall target for the portion of renewable fuel in the nation's fuel supply, to liquid fuels, omitting electricity, which the Biden administration had sought to add.

It's expected to be a significant boost for Iowa, the nation's No. 1 producer of ethanol, biodiesel and the corn that is the main feedstock for ethanol. Ethanol production absorbs half of Iowa's annual corn crop, and the state is the No. 2 producer after Illinois of soybeans, the main source of biodiesel.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican and member of the Agriculture Committee, praised the proposal.

“Under the Biden administration, five biodiesel plants in Iowa closed or idled in part because RVOs were set too low,"" he said in a statement. ""Today, President Trump and (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) Administrator (Lee) Zeldin turned the ship around, delivering a victory for American energy security and following through on their promise to support American agriculture."" Biofuels lower gas prices, strengthen national security and drive economic growth in rural communities. Today’s announcement is welcome news for Iowa farmers and biofuel producers.”

Grassley's fellow Republican senator from Iowa, Joni Ernst, another member of the Agriculture Committee, also released a statement.

“After Biden blatantly ignored the needs of farmers and biofuel producers, I applaud the Trump administration for getting the RFS back on track with today’s announcement,” Ernst said. “By eliminating the electric vehicle mandate and restoring the RFS’ original focus on liquid transportation fuels, prioritizing domestically grown crops over foreign imports, setting record-high volumes to revitalize the biofuel industry, and adopting safeguards to prevent small refinery waivers from gutting the program—it is clear the Trump administration is committed to championing rural America.

Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig also weighed in.

“Iowa leads the nation in ethanol and biodiesel production and our existing infrastructure has the capacity to produce even more home-grown biofuels. Today’s announcement sends a welcome and optimistic growth signal to this important industry,"" Naig, a Republican, said in a statement. ""I strongly support the Administration’s effort to prioritize and incentivize American sourced biofuels and ingredients over foreign fuels and feedstocks, including used cooking oil from China. I am also pleased to see the elimination of the misguided attempt to force Biden’s electric vehicle mandate... into the RFS.""

Here are specifics of the proposal

The EPA in the proposal calls for setting total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuels into the U.S. fuel supply or purchase credits, called RINs, from those that do.

The proposal is driven in part by an increase in biomass-based diesel requirements. The EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026 — a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.

It projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons. The EPA expressed the biomass-based diesel requirement in billions of RINs in accordance with the agency's proposal to reduce the number of RINs that could be generated from imported biofuels.

After accounting for the reduction in imported biofuels, the EPA said it projected the number of RINs generated for biomass-based diesel would be 1.27 per gallon in 2026 and 1.28 RINs per gallon in 2027. Previously, the EPA projected the average gallon of biomass-based diesel generated 1.6 RINs.

The volume mandate for 2025 for biomass-based diesel was 3.35 billion gallons, a figure the industry had complained was too low.

Renewable fuel (D6) credits for 2025 traded as high as $1.06 each on Friday, up from 88 cents the previous session, traders said.

Biomass-based (D4) credits traded as much as $1.17 each, versus between $1.05 and $1.01 the previous session, traders said.

Lobbying for policy draws together biofuels, oil industries

The oil and biofuel industries, both powerful lobbies in Washington, have highly anticipated the release of the proposal, which, if finalized, determines the fate of billions of dollars in fuel and tradable credit transactions.

As one of the first decisions made by the current Trump administration regarding federal biofuel policy, the proposal signaled the administration's support for the biofuels industry, which has at times been at odds with oil companies.

A coalition of oil and biofuel groups banded together in a historically unusual move this year to request biomass diesel blending for 2026 at 5.25 billion gallons, compared with 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The coalition, led by the American Petroleum Institute, argued that the EPA's previous mandates failed to support the growth of the advanced biofuel industry and undercut the market.

Biofuel advocates cheered the proposal.

""USDA and EPA have never been more aligned on the need for more American-grown biofuels,"" said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins.

""The volumes proposed today provide crucial growth opportunities for U.S. ethanol producers and farmers,"" said Renewable Fuels Association President Geoff Cooper.

The Chinese Are Helping Toyota

The news of a future EREV Highlander and Sienna comes from Toyota's current Chinese partnerships, and so far, the EREV development is only confirmed for models coming to that market. Announced at the 2025 GAC Toyota Technology Day, the focus was on models for the Chinese market, but the details were particularly interesting, as slides shown at the event showcased models with familiar looks to the ones here in the US.

The way in which these models will be engineered also piqued attention, as there could be potential crossover into the American market.

The fourth-gen Highlander and fourth-gen Sienna both currently ride on variations of the Japanese automaker's TNGA-K platform, which is expected to get a light update to adopt an EREV powertrain setup. No details of the new Chinese market platform have been announced yet, but this is a different tactic than the one we typically see, where a Chinese platform is used with the badge from a brand like Toyota or Honda applied for prestige. In theory, if the existing TNGA-K platform can be tweaked to accommodate an EREV powertrain, USDM Highlander and Sienna models could adopt the same at some stage.

It's also possible there's a new platform for the US market that hasn't yet been announced. So far, for the US, Toyota has confirmed a three-row electric SUV is in development and will be built in the US. CarBuzz sources previously indicated the strong likelihood that this model would bear the Highlander name, and recent comments from the automaker indicated it was done with the clunky bZ nomenclature and wanted to focus on the names people know and love.

""Over time, what you will see us doing is transitioning away from the bZ naming convention and starting to use more traditional names from our lineup,.""

- Cooper Ericksen, Senior Vice President, product BEV mobility planning strategy, Toyota Motor North America

A new Highlander is reportedly planned for the US market by 2026, with an updated Toyota Grand Highlander model (not sold in China) coming in 2027. Now, the new Sienna is rumored for 2027 as well, though the fifth-gen has so far only been confirmed for China. Considering the sales growth of minivans in the US, we predict some version of the next-gen Sienna will eventually come stateside.

More Toyota Hybrids Coming

Toyota is also reportedly working on a sixth-generation hybrid system. The Toyota fifth-gen series hybrid system underpins models like the Camry, Prius, Corolla, 4Runner, and Tundra. The next-gen system will likely improve efficiency, lighten the motors, enhance power output, and continue as a series-parallel hybrid setup instead of a plug-in one.

Toyota declined to comment on future products for the US market. As for other companies developing EREV tech, they include Ram, Hyundai and Genesis, the Volkswagen Group, BMW, and more. But given tightening emissions legislation combined with a general anti-EV sentiment, we wouldn't be surprised to see more adopt the technology in the near future.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2021-toyota-sienna-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 03:01:08.926579

Circuit Court of Appeals, in a divided decision, said the U.S. Bureau of Land Management largely abided by federal laws when it granted approval to ConocoPhillips to develop the huge Willow project.
Friday’s ruling is the latest in a yearslong series of legal challenges that have created roadblocks to Willow development.
The 2023 project approval is the product of that supplemental study.
“ConocoPhillips welcomes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision, which allows construction on the Willow project to continue.","A federal appeals court on Friday upheld the Biden administration’s approval of a major oil development on Alaska’s North Slope, even though it identified one flaw with the action.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a divided decision, said the U.S. Bureau of Land Management largely abided by federal laws when it granted approval to ConocoPhillips to develop the huge Willow project.

Despite one problem that the ruling characterized as “minor,” the approval shall stand, said the majority opinion, written by Judge Ryan D. Nelson.

The ruling allows ConocoPhillips to keep developing Willow, which holds about 600 million barrels of reserves and is slated to produce up to 180,000 barrels per day and be the westernmost operating oil field on the North Slope. And it rejects arguments from environmental and Native plaintiffs who said the BLM approval violated requirements for considering the cumulative and climate impacts of the huge development, impacts to endangered species and other issues.

The identified flaw stems from the BLM’s decision to approve a Willow development plan with three drill pads rather than the five ConocoPhillips had proposed. The scaled-back plan approved in 2023 also required ConocoPhillips to give up leases on about 68,000 acres, almost all of that in the ecologically sensitive Teshekpuk Lake area.

During the environmental study process that led to the approval decision, the BLM had expressed the position that it needed to consider full field development rather than piecemeal development, the ruling said. “And then when it came time to issue the final approval, it never explained whether its adopted alternative satisfied the full field development standard,” the ruling said.

But that was a “at heart, a procedural, not a substantive violation,” the ruling said. The development approval is to remain in place, the decision said. Overturning the approval is “unwarranted because the procedural error was minor and the on-the-ground consequences (of vacating it) would be severe,” the decision said.

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Gabriel Sanchez said the flaw was serious enough to justify overturning the permit. “BLM’s errors were more fundamental than simply failing to explain how it applied the full field development standard among the alternatives it reviewed,” he said. The agency wrongly excluded consideration of smaller alternatives when it was deciding whether to allow “the largest domestic oil drilling project on federal public lands,” he said.

Willow has been the subject of heated national debate. The discovery, on federal leases that date as far back as 1999, has inspired other exploration in the area, as well as hopes for state officials for a development renaissance on the North Slope. Oil production in the region is now less than a quarter of the 2 million-barrel-a-day peak hit in 1988.

Environmental activists, however, have described the project as a “climate bomb” that will pour substantial new amounts of planet-heating carbon gases into the atmosphere.

Friday’s ruling is the latest in a yearslong series of legal challenges that have created roadblocks to Willow development. In 2021, U.S. District Court Sharon Gleason overturned a prior approval of Willow. She ordered the BLM to complete a formal supplemental environmental impact statement to better analyze climate impacts and impacts to threatened polar bears. The 2023 project approval is the product of that supplemental study.

ConocoPhillips, which is already well into Willow construction and plans to spend at least $7 billion on development, described Friday’s ruling as good news.

“ConocoPhillips welcomes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision, which allows construction on the Willow project to continue. We recently completed another significant winter construction season, and the project remains on track for first oil in 2029,” company spokesperson Rebecca Boys said by email.

“We look forward to continuing the responsible development of Willow, which will enhance American energy security while expanding local employment opportunities and providing extensive benefits to Alaska Native communities and the State of Alaska.”

Over the past winter season, crews delivered modular structures and worked on road, pad, bridge, work camp and pipeline construction, Boys said.

That work was allowed to proceed because the 9th Circuit Court in December denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a restraining order blocking it.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case had mixed responses to Friday’s decision.

Some were highly critical.

“This decision is bad news for the planet and anyone who cares about the impacts of industrialization on communities now and in the future,” Bridget Psarianos, an attorney with the environmental law firm Trustees for Alaska, said in a statement.

“The bureau is required under the law to protect the western Arctic’s sensitive ecosystem and the subsistence users who rely on them. But the agency did not minimize the harm from this project on the Arctic’s people, animals, habitat, and the planet in a real way, in violation of the law. There is too much at stake to gloss over the harm this project will do,” said Psarianos, who is representing some of the plaintiffs.

It will probably be fairly simple for the BLM to address the court-identified flaw, Psarianos said in a follow-up email. The agency could submit a report or a memorandum explaining its reasoning, leaving the approval unaffected, she said.

Other plaintiff representatives portrayed the ruling as a vindication, albeit a partial one.

“Today’s ruling is a significant step forward for Alaska’s North Slope,” Hallie Templeton, legal director for plaintiff Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. “We hope that this will push BLM to heed the significant risks that Willow poses and deny it for good. While this should be the final straw for the doomed Willow Project, we will continue fighting to prevent this carbon bomb project from destroying one of our last remaining wild places.”

Eric Engle is board president of Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action.","Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., had an op-ed published in the June 5 edition of the Parkersburg News and Sentinel titled “Pulling the plug on the EV mandate” that was absolutely farcical.

The first comically absurd aspect of the piece was when Sen. Capito referred to “Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority over federal agencies and unelected bureaucratic overreach.” When since Jan. 20 of this year have Republicans shown the slightest care or interest in “Congress’s constitutional and statutory oversight authority?”

Capito herself has applauded the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and the Trump 2.0 regime’s Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget as they have systematically worked to dismantle the federal civil service. Through executive orders and proclamations written by the Heritage Foundation and the infiltration of virtually all the data the federal government compiles on all Americans by tech bro toddlers, as well as nefarious efforts to put that ill-gotten data into the hands of Peter Thiel’s Palantir, we have seen nothing but careless acquiescence and/or active support for these democracy-destroying blatant violations of the rule of law by Capito and her party colleagues throughout Congress.

For a Trump sycophant like Capito to feign concern for Congress’s ability to act as a coequal branch of government with strong oversight capabilities, irony must indeed be dead. As chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Capito holds great congressional sway. Instead of using it to defend federal employees in her state and their civil service protections and collective bargaining rights — just one example of a positive way her power could be wielded — Capito wants to expend political capital on eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency’s approval of a waiver for California so all states adopting California clean air standards can also adopt the state’s “Advance Clean Cars II” standard.

As Capito points out, the adoption and implementation of this ACCII standard would mandate that 30% of the nation’s new car market (including all areas of the country who have adopted California’s clean air standards) consist of zero tailpipe emission cars in the next decade. This is fundamentally no different than mandating that new car models had to have seatbelts or states enforcing laws that your brake lights work or states enforcing inspection laws. Tailpipe exhaust is a major air pollution problem and therefore public health issue, as well as the largest contributing factor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

This isn’t about “consumer choice,” as Capito claims. California and the EPA have not been attempting to force consumers to purchase one make or model of a car over another when purchasing a new vehicle. They weren’t the ones who turned the White House lawn into a Tesla lot (Teslas are zero tailpipe emission EVs, by the way). This is about protecting the environment and public health. You know, EPA’s stated mission since it was created.

It’s also about saving consumers money. Research by the Union of Concerned Scientists has shown that the costs of owning an EV are now lower across the country than the costs of owning an internal combustion engine vehicle. EVs are cheaper to charge than gasoline-powered vehicles are to fuel, with the median cost savings on fuel costs being between $700-$800 a year, according to UCS. Maintenance costs for EVs are far lower than for gas-powered vehicles and EV charging ranges are now comparable to or exceed the driving ranges of gas-powered vehicles.

EVs have more torque off the line and just as much, if not more, towing capacity as any gas-or-diesel-powered vehicle. They are built with the same safety specs and cargo and passenger capacities as any gas-powered vehicle. Inflation Reduction Act and other federal and state investments have made the initial purchase of both new and used EVs far more affordable and helped American auto manufacturers meet so much of the demand for new EVs with unionized workforces.

Don’t fall for Capito’s fossil fuels industry-backed propaganda. All that she and her colleagues accomplished by using the Congressional Review Act to strike down this waiver by alleging (falsely) that it was an actual EPA rule is higher new car prices (alongside Trump’s tariff costs), more air pollution over the next decade (and the negative health impacts of that pollution), a worsened global climate crisis and lost American manufacturing jobs (many union jobs) created under the previous administration.

Real Clear Wire

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the proposed repeal of the Biden-era’s Clean Power Plan 2.0, which ruled that coal-fired and many new natural gas power plants must capture and store over 90% of their carbon emissions by the 2030s—or shut down by 2040. It’s a costly mandate, resting on shaky legal and technical foundations. Americans would be fortunate to have it repealed.

President Biden issued his Clean Power Plan 2.0 after the Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency that President Obama’s Clean Power Plan 1.0 exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) statutory authority. The Court’s 2022 decision concluded that the EPA had overstepped by attempting to reshape the nation’s energy grid without clear congressional approval.

In a world where energy security and affordability are paramount, one might assume that when the Supreme Court strikes down a sweeping environmental regulation, the EPA would reconsider its approach. But in Washington, ideology often trumps reason, and undeterred, the Biden administration returned in 2024 with a sequel that EPA now proposes to end.

The Clean Power Plan 1.0 attempted to force states to overhaul their energy systems entirely, compelling them to adopt renewable energy and shutter fossil fuel plants, regardless of local needs or economic consequences.

Its successor, the Clean Power Plan 2.0, imposed an estimated $15 billion in regulatory costs over 20 years, and greater costs through increases in prices of electricity and slower economic growth. EPA argues “that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.”

Just as Chief Justice John Roberts warned in 2022 that the EPA had claimed “an unheralded power representing a transformative expansion of its regulatory authority,” the EPA was trying to do through regulation with the Clean Power Plan 2.0 what Congress had repeatedly declined to do through legislation.

Fifteen years ago similar legislative proposals—the Waxman-Markey and Kerry-Lieberman bills—failed in the U.S. Congress even when Democrats held strong majorities. That should have signaled to regulators that such sweeping changes lacked democratic legitimacy.

Yet ideology brooks no dissent, and the Biden administration’s Clean Power Plan 2.0 pressed ahead, relying on technologies that are neither commercially viable nor widely demonstrated. Carbon capture and storage, the linchpin of the Biden plan, remains prohibitively expensive and technically uncertain. Hydrogen, another favored solution, is not cost-effective. The EPA’s cost-benefit analysis glossed over these realities, assuming generous tax subsidies and benefits from reduced CO2 emissions would bridge the gap.

The consequences of this regulatory ambition are stark. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned in 2024 that the Biden plan’s disincentives for baseload power would destabilize the electricity grid, increasing the risk of blackouts. Spain’s recent 12-hour blackout offers a cautionary tale: rapid transitions to solar without reliable baseload power can lead to lack of backup power, causing the grid to crash.

Moreover, the Biden plan was regressive. It would raise electricity prices, disproportionately affecting low-income households, farmers, and small businesses. It would also undermine a reliable electricity grid and economic growth. By constraining energy supply and inflating costs, it would drive economic activity and jobs offshore, where goods would be manufactured with coal-fired energy in China.

The dirty secret, which Mr. Zeldin forced into the open, is that the Biden plan would not have helped the climate. The greenhouse gases emitted by the power sector do not significantly affect human health, and moving energy intensive manufacturing overseas where it is made with coal-fired power using older technology would have raised emissions, not lowered them.

There is also a deeper constitutional issue at play. The EPA is misusing its authority under the Clean Air Act to pressure states into adopting policies that lie outside its jurisdiction. The plan’s emissions targets are so stringent that no state has voted them into law.

The Clean Power Plan 2.0 amounts to a form of federal commandeering. States are faced with a loss of a significant portion of their electricity generation capacity, and their manufacturing base, by restructuring their energy systems to align with the EPA’s vision. This is not cooperative federalism; it is coercion.

And it is unnecessary. America’s carbon emissions have declined by about a billion metric tons over the past 15 years without such mandates. This progress has been driven by technological innovation, not federal diktats. Cleaner air and efficient power generation are worthy goals, but they must be pursued within the bounds of the law and with respect for democratic processes.

The lesson from West Virginia v. EPA is clear: transformative policy changes require legislative backing. Agencies cannot conjure sweeping powers from ambiguous statutes. The rule of law demands clarity, accountability, and restraint.

As America grapples to ensure grid reliability, there is a cautionary tale here. The path to a reliable energy future lies not in top-down mandates, but in innovation, cooperation, and respect for the institutions that safeguard our freedoms. Administrator Zeldin should be congratulated.

Over the 140-day session that ended June 2, legislators passed several key bills, including measures to increase public school funding, school voucher programs and regulating school library books.

House Bill 2, already signed by Gov. Greg Abbott, includes a substantial boost to public school funding. Public education reform was a top priority during this year's session. Senate Bill 2, also signed, will launch a voucher program that allows families to fund private school tuition.

“One thing is clear: putting these dollars directly into classrooms and focusing on student achievement is the strongest path to strengthen the future of our state,” Sen. Brandon Creighton said in a post on Facebook. “With nearly $15,500 invested for the average student funding across 5,400,000 Texas public school students, classrooms will have what they need for our students and our future workforce.”

SB 13 will require school boards to dictate what books are permitted in school libraries and set up a formal process for parents to challenge any titles. Abbott has not yet signed.

“The more that you restrict, the harder it becomes to provide for all the children in the school,” Denton resident and teacher Dana White said. “I think it is very restrictive and not conducive to a productive learning environment.”

According to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, SB 10 has sparked controversy and will require public schools to display the Ten Commandments in their classrooms. SB 11 would allow school districts to provide students and staff with daily time for prayer and reading of the Bible or other religious texts in public schools. Thus far, neither bill has been signed by Abbott.

SB 10 is similar to a bill passed in Louisiana last year, which was deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge. The ruling said the law violated the separation between church and state.

“Well, the Ten Commandments in school is about as close to church and state as possible,” Denton resident Patrick Hemmer, 39, said. “Unless we’re going to deem all public schools as Christian, then we should keep religion and school separate.”

On the social and health front, SB 3 was passed but has yet to be signed by Abbott, and includes a ban on THC. The bill would ban consumable hemp products that contain any synthetic cannabinoid, such as delta-8, and create higher fines and possible jail time for offenders.

Abbott has remained silent on whether he will choose to veto or sign the bill into law, leaving the future of hemp products and local businesses uncertain.

“Why try to legalize something, and make a point to do it and then flip flop backwards,” university alum Izaiha Arnold, 22, said. “There’s a smoke shop on every block, I mean you may not agree with weed, but they’re taking away taxes at this point, they’re taking away jobs.”

Also on Abbott’s desk is SB 2, which would raise the homestead exemption for school district property taxes. The bill aims to reduce the tax burden on homeowners, with the state compensating school districts for any lost revenue.

Many bills are currently awaiting final approval. Abbott has until June 22 to sign or veto bills. Those not acted on will automatically become law, with most taking effect on Sept. 1, 2025 or at the beginning of next year.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/ntdaily.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/1f/c1f608de-f198-4a2d-b101-f46fde1f5f77/684c5774c4f47.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-14 06:01:30.365064

Here is the abstract from that study: “Ocean acidification has been identified in the Planetary Boundary Framework as a planetary process approaching a boundary that could lead to unacceptable environmental change.
“Because of ocean currents, temperature variations, and other factors, the level of ocean acidification varies throughout the world.","Last Updated on:

This week, the EPA announced its intention not to protect the environment by rolling back the rules put in place by those hated socialists Barack Obama and Joe Biden that limit emissions from thermal generating plants. What this failed administration is saying is simply this — corporations are more important than people. During his inauguration speech in January, the putative president shouted, “We will drill, baby, drill.”

Rest assured, gentle reader, this is not about rolling back pollution rules from power plants. It is about eliminating them. Here is the summary from the EPA’s proposal, which makes its intentions crystal clear:

“In this action, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants. The EPA is proposing that the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires it to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution, as a predicate to regulating GHG emissions from those plants. The EPA is further proposing to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.

“The EPA is also proposing, as an alternative, to repeal a narrower set of requirements that includes the emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating units, the carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS)-based standards for coal-fired steam generating units undertaking a large modification, and the CCS-based standards for new base load stationary combustion turbines.”

The crux of the EPA’s argument is that carbon dioxide emissions from thermal generating stations have decreased from about 5.5 percent of global emissions in 2005 to about 3 percent today. Therefore, reducing those emissions further, as directed by the Biden administration, would have little effect on public health. But CleanTechnica readers, who are all well above average, will note the new proposal form EPA is not about rolling back the standard set by the prior administration. It is about eliminating all restrictions on power plant emissions. If you don’t believe that, go back and read the first sentence of its proposal again.

Support For The EPA Roll Back

Lee Zeldin, the stooge heading the EPA today, crowed, “Rest assured President Trump is the biggest supporter of clean, beautiful coal, EPA is helping pave the way for American energy dominance because energy development underpins economic development, which in turn strengthens national security.”

According to NPR, Rich Nolan, head of the National Mining Association, added his own endorsement. “We applaud the Trump administration’s work to counter the Biden administration’s direct assault on coal power.” West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey called the proposal “a major victory for West Virginia, our energy producers, and every American who depends on reliable, affordable electricity.” Morrisey’s comment is a swipe at renewables and pays homage to the shibboleth of “baseload power,” a construct that Michael Barnard exposed as antiquated in a recent CleanTechnica article.

Wyoming is the top coal-producing state in America, so naturally its governor, Mark Gordon, embraced the EPA proposal. “Today, I welcome the proposed repeal by the EPA of the so-called Clean Power Plan Version 2 that [EPA] Administrator Lee Zeldin and I have discussed over the past several months, and I encourage him to proceed with it with all due urgency. The lopsided and misguided policies of the Biden administration have already wreaked enough havoc on our nation’s power supply and delayed our progress providing the beautiful clean coal President Donald Trump recognizes as essential to having a reliable, affordable and dispatchable energy supply for our nation.”

Not Everyone Is Thrilled

Not everyone is delighted by the new EPA policy initiative. “These regressive proposals are bad for public health and bad for climate, all to prop up some of the highest polluting power plants in the nation,” Shaun Goho, legal director at Clean Air Task Force, wrote in a statement. “The EPA is hoisting the white flag of surrender on the power plant pollution that’s poisoning the air we breathe and harming our climate,” wrote Manish Bapna, CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“As Trump and his EPA continue to shovel dirty old coal down our throats, they’re now adding more toxic heavy metals like mercury, lead and arsenic to the mix,” said Ryan Maher, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “If these reckless rollbacks are allowed to stand they’ll only fan the flames of extreme heat and wildfires, and they’ll trigger more child deaths, more cancers, more lung diseases, and more heart attacks.”

The EPA And Ocean Acidification

Ryan Maher is not wrong. Fossil fuels are now the official religion of the United States, and many Americans are bowing and praying in support of the movement. The problem, of course, is that in order to do so, they have to reject science. America is on its way back to the good old days when witches were burned at the stake and non-believers were stripped naked, dunked in hot tar, covered in feathers, and ridden out of town on a rail. Travelers of every description are now required to surrender their electronic devices to jackbooted authorities who scrutinize their social media accounts and contacts for any hint that they might harbor thoughts that are not in line with prescribed dogma.

But while America is drinking deeply of the fossil fuel Kool-Aid, things are happening in the environment because of the rising levels of pollution in the atmosphere. Some believe that there is no such thing as too much carbon dioxide. How could that be? Plants need carbon dioxide to grow. That’s true, but as my old Irish grandmother liked to say, there can be too much of a good thing. Water is also essential to life, but too much water can be deadly, as the passengers on the Titanic discovered to their sorrow on April 15, 1912.

When there is too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, more of it gets dissolved in the waters of the ocean, which creates carbonic acid. In a study published June 9, 2025, in the journal Global Change Biology, scientists published the results of research conducted on behalf of the European Space Agency, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Global Ocean Monitoring and Observing and Ocean Acidification Programs, NOAA, and the Slovene Research Agency. Here is the abstract from that study:

“Ocean acidification has been identified in the Planetary Boundary Framework as a planetary process approaching a boundary that could lead to unacceptable environmental change. Using revised estimates of pre-industrial aragonite saturation state, state-of-the-art data-model products, including uncertainties and assessing impact on ecological indicators, we improve upon the ocean acidification planetary boundary assessment and demonstrate that by 2020, the average global ocean conditions had already crossed into the uncertainty range of the ocean acidification boundary.

“This analysis was further extended to the subsurface ocean, revealing that up to 60% of the global subsurface ocean (down to 200 m) had crossed that boundary, compared to over 40% of the global surface ocean. These changes result in significant declines in suitable habitats for important calcifying species, including 43% reduction in habitat for tropical and subtropical coral reefs, up to 61% for polar pteropods, and 13% for coastal bivalves. By including these additional considerations, we suggest a revised boundary of 10% reduction from pre-industrial conditions more adequately prevents risk to marine ecosystems and their services; a benchmark which was surpassed by year 2000 across the entire surface ocean.”

Breaching Planetary Boundaries

According to Paul Hormick at Green Dispatch, the idea of planetary boundaries was first proposed in 2009 by a group of climate scientists led by former Stockholm Resilience Center director Johan Rockström. They represent boundaries on global processes affected by human activity. If these limits are crossed, permanent, unacceptable environmental change becomes reality for planet Earth.

Hormick writes: “Ocean acidification is particularly problematic for creatures such as oysters, clams, and sea urchins. The increased acidity makes it difficult for them to form their shells. Corals also have a harder time forming their structures. Creatures such as sea stars have difficulty forming their protective outer layers in acidic oceans.

“Because of ocean currents, temperature variations, and other factors, the level of ocean acidification varies throughout the world. Acidity in tropical regions can be twice that of polar regions. Recent research has also found that acidification is spreading to deeper waters. The authors of this most recent paper extended their inquiry to the subsurface ocean and found that up to 60 percent of the global subsurface waters — down to 600 feet — had crossed the planetary boundary, compared to around 40 percent of the surface oceans.”

We alter the acidity of the ocean at our peril. Billions of people rely on the seas for their sustenance. There is a so-called food chain that starts with phytoplankton. We may believe we would never eat such tiny organisms, but in fact they are the source of all the food that marine animals consume. If you eat tuna, clams, scallops, or mahi mahi, you are benefiting from the abundance of phytoplankton in the ocean. The krill that are the primary source of food for whales depend on phytoplankton as well.

The point is simply this: There is too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the proposal by the EPA will add more. The Earth doesn’t care a horse’s patoot about energy dominance. Those who worship in the temple of fossil fuels are making the Earth unfit for human habitation — that’s the long and short of it. That’s something to consider when your government promotes more pollution rather than less.

A Holy War On Science

We are done asking people to spare a thought about their children and grandchildren. That argument clearly carries no weight in the minds of MAGAlomanics. There is only one way to hold polluters in check, and that is by making them pay for the harm they do. Everything else is just empty words and failed hopes. Putting a price on carbon and methane pollution is the only way forward.

We can also throw bums like Lee Zeldin out of government and replace them with people who are not apostles for the fossil fuel companies. These are people who would happily gouge their eyes and pour boiling hot oil in the ears to keep from learning anything about how human activity is altering Nature. If they get their way, lots of people will die prematurely and future generations may never be born. What is astonishing is how comfortable they, and so many others, are with that.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/9729_Hunter-Power-Plant-Castle-Dale-Emery-County-Utah._10February2025.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:08:08.458111

Shelley Moore Capito believes that some of those credits need to be reviewed or repealed. Mitch Carmichael, a former member of the House of Delegates and state Senate, is the leader of Built for America, a new advocacy organization, urging the Trump administration to not roll back energy tax credits. Carmichael served as state senate president and lieutenant governor from 2017 to the end of 2020, then served under former governor and current U.S. Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., as the first secretary of the new Department of Economic Development until the fall of 2024. During his tenure as a cabinet secretary, Carmichael oversaw the recruitment of several major manufacturers to the state, including the Form Energy grid battery project in Weirton, and the Berkshire Hathaway/Timet titanium melt facility near Ravenswood that will be powered by a solar energy microgrid. Carmichael also serves as a senior advisor for strategic initiative for LG Nova. These projects, along with many others across the nation, are benefiting from energy tax credits within bills signed by former President Joe Biden, including the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). But Carmichael said these tax credits are vital to Trump’s goal to return manufacturing back to the United States. “I’m proud to lead Built for America as Executive Director because the fight to defend the energy tax credits driving America’s manufacturing comeback is one we can’t afford to lose,” Carmichael said. “Built for America is a new organization working to defend the tax credits that are powering America’s manufacturing comeback, creating jobs, and helping America beat China.” Following his inauguration for a second non-consecutive term in January, Trump ordered all federal agencies to pause disbursement of funds appropriated through the 2022 IRA or the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in a 215-214-1 vote, sending it to the U.S. Senate. The bill is a budget and spending reconciliation package which continues the 2017 tax cuts that went into effect during Trump’s first term and are set to expire at the end of 2025. The bill also includes nearly $1.5 trillion in spending cuts through various methods, including work requirements for Medicaid benefits and the elimination of several tax credits made possible by the IRA. Specifically, the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would eliminate tax breaks and incentives for wind, solar, hydrogen projects, as well as phase out tax credits for consumers purchasing new electric vehicles among other rollbacks. If enacted as the House intended, the rollbacks could end more than $522 billion in investments made possible through the IRA. However, Carmichael argued that these tax credits are tied to performance, not politics, with the tax credits rewarding businesses that complete major energy projects and put Americans back to work. “They reward U.S. companies that build here, hire here, and deliver results by putting America first,” Carmichael said. “Unlike mandates…these credits are performance-based and results-driven. They support an all-of-the-above energy approach, empowering innovation in nuclear, geothermal, carbon capture, and other emerging technologies.” Carmichael also said repealing the tax breaks would benefit companies competing with the U.S. for energy, such as China. Built for America is launching a $2 million ad campaign aimed at swaying Congress and the White House to reconsider some of the proposed cuts. “No one has done more to jumpstart American manufacturing than President Trump, and these credits are aligned with his America First mission,” Carmichael said. “They’re helping us beat China, rebuild the middle class, and power a new era of American industrial strength. That’s a fight worth having. “Repealing these credits would ship jobs and supply chains back to China and hand America’s energy future to our adversaries,” Carmichael continued. “That’s why I’m proud to stand with Built for America and lead this fight.” Capito, R-W.Va., is the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Capito has been a frequent critic of the energy tax credits within the IRA. Speaking to reporters Thursday during a weekly phone call from Capitol Hill. Capito said the IRA’s energy tax credits need to be received and reconsidered in some cases. “Everything was tilted towards clean energy, and it was just incredibly lopsided and incredibly generous, so those need to be scaled back no doubt, and some of them absolutely probably need to be stopped immediately,” Capito said. “Others, I think, need a better transition.” As an example, Capito cited the 45V hydrogen tax credit created by the IRA, which offers incentives for the production of clean hydrogen, with potential payouts up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced. Capito advocated for regional hydrogen hubs in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, including what is now the ARCH2 Appalachian hydrogen hub project. “The House put in their bill that in order for you to take advantage of 45V…you have to be under construction by the end of this year,” Capito said. “Well, you and I both know, and I think those at the ARCH2 Appalachian hydrogen hub know, that’s impossible. That knocks us out of the game, and I don’t want to see us knocked out of being a leader on a new and promising type of energy production…So, I’ve asked if we can make provisions there.” Once other Senate committees release their reconciliation language, the Senate could begin voting on its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill reconciliation package by the end of next week. Capito said Congress needs to get the energy incentives right. “We need to unleash American energy,” Capito said. “The (previous) administration has spent three and a half years trying to cap our American innovation in the energy space and we’re going to open it back up again – one of (Trump’s) main tenants for his presidency…I’m very excited to be able to be a part of that.” Steven Allen Adams can be reached at sadams@newsandsentinel.com.

What Class VI Primacy Means for Texas Class VI wells are designed for the injection of CO₂ into deep geologic formations for permanent sequestration.
According to its application, the RRC’s decades of experience managing UIC programs leave it well positioned to assume oversight of Class VI wells.
If finalized, Texas’s Class VI primacy could take effect as early as this calendar year.
Prepare for RRC’s Approach to Community Engagement and Transparency Texas’s proposed Class VI program places emphasis on public outreach and transparency.","On June 9, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed granting the State of Texas primary enforcement authority—commonly referred to as “primacy”—over the permitting and regulation of Class VI underground injection control (UIC) wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). This would authorize the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) to regulate the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO₂) through Class VI wells—an essential component of carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure.

If finalized, Texas would become the fifth state to secure such authority, joining North Dakota (2018), Wyoming (2020), Louisiana (2023) and West Virginia (2025). (EPA also proposed granting primacy to Arizona in May over all classes of UIC wells, including Class VI.)

EPA-RRC Memorandum of Agreement: A Milestone in Primacy Delegation

On April 29, 2025, EPA Region 6 Regional Administrator Scott Mason and RRC Chairman and Commissioners executed a Memorandum of Agreement Addendum 2 (MOA), a key milestone in the primacy process that signaled the proposed approval was likely imminent. This agreement outlined the operational framework for the delegation of regulatory authority to the RRC, including compliance monitoring and enforcement procedures, community engagement, and information sharing, and EPA’s oversight role and mechanisms in the RRC’s administration of the program. Notably, the MOA included an acknowledgement that all Class VI permits, applications, and other information for Texas-based projects are to be transferred to RRC upon the final primacy determination. Environmental justice measures were not included in the final MOA.

The MOA affirmed that Texas has the technical, legal and administrative capacity to implement the Class VI program in a manner that protects underground sources of drinking water while supporting economic development and innovation in carbon management.

What Class VI Primacy Means for Texas

Class VI wells are designed for the injection of CO₂ into deep geologic formations for permanent sequestration. These wells are regulated under stringent criteria under the SDWA to ensure the protection of underground sources of drinking water (USDWs). With primacy, the RRC would be responsible for implementing these safeguards through site characterization requirements, well construction standards, testing and monitoring protocols, and financial assurance mechanisms.

According to its application, the RRC’s decades of experience managing UIC programs leave it well positioned to assume oversight of Class VI wells. The RRC already oversees Class I through V wells, including Class II wells used for oil and gas-related injections. The EPA’s press release underscored the state’s preparedness, stating that “Texas is best positioned to protect its underground sources of drinking water while advancing economic growth and energy dominance.” Region 6 Administrator Scott Mason echoed this view, affirming that Texas “has effectively and reliably administered programs for underground injection wells while protecting drinking water sources for decades,” and expressing confidence that “their success will continue with Class VI wells.”

If the EPA’s proposal is finalized, the RRC will be authorized to issue and enforce permits directly, eliminating the need for federal EPA review and approval. This shift is expected to significantly reduce administrative delays, clear permitting backlogs, and facilitate more rapid investment in and deployment of CCS infrastructure across the state.

Texas has long been a national leader in both fossil energy and emerging clean technologies. With primacy, the state can leverage its geological assets, experienced regulatory institutions and energy workforce to scale CCS projects efficiently and responsibly. Ideally, the result is a nimbler permitting process that supports both emissions reductions and economic growth.

A Step Forward for Cooperative Federalism and State Empowerment

EPA’s proposed approval reflects its ongoing commitment to cooperative federalism and the new Administration’s broader objective of restoring American energy dominance. By granting states primary enforcement authority over geologic carbon sequestration wells, EPA aims to empower qualified state agencies to implement federal environmental programs more efficiently and with greater local adaptability.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the proposal accordingly, stating that “EPA is taking a key step to support cooperative federalism” by which EPA will delegate decision-making authority “to states that have local expertise and understand their water resources, geology, communities, and opportunities for economic growth.”

The announcement drew support from Texas lawmakers. Senator John Cornyn praised the move as a next logical step for a state leading in both energy production and carbon management, noting that state-level control over the permitting process could streamline CCS development and “put Texas in the driver’s seat” for advancing decarbonization efforts. Representatives Dan Crenshaw and August Pfluger echoed these sentiments, pointing to the potential for job creation, emissions reductions, and local control.

Next Steps

EPA is soliciting public comments on the proposed approval. Following the close of this 45-day public comment period, EPA will review and respond to public comments, making any necessary revisions or updates to the proposed rule for final consideration by Zeldin. EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on July 24 at 5 p.m. CST. If finalized, Texas’s Class VI primacy could take effect as early as this calendar year.

Strategic Considerations for Companies Advancing CCS Projects in Texas

With EPA’s proposed approval of Texas’s Class VI primacy and the groundwork laid by the recent EPA-RRC Memorandum of Agreement, stakeholders should begin preparing now for the regulatory and operational shift that primacy will bring. Key considerations include:

Participate in and Monitor the Public Comment Process

The outcome of the public comment period may shape the scope and timeline for finalizing Texas’s primacy. Companies should evaluate the proposed approval and RRC’s regulatory framework, submit comments where appropriate, and engage with regulators to ensure the final rulemaking reflects operational realities. The tone and volume of public feedback may also offer early insights into potential legal or procedural delays.

Recalibrate Project Timelines and Regulatory Strategies

Entities with pending or planned Class VI applications in Texas—particularly those currently before EPA Region 6—should anticipate a possible handoff to the RRC later this year. Developers should revisit permitting timelines, coordinate with counsel to address both state and federal requirements during the transition, and consider whether early strategic engagement with RRC staff can help de-risk the permitting process. Simultaneously, stakeholders should also consider the risk of litigation challenging Texas’s primacy. Similar lawsuits have been brought in other states, such as Louisiana, where environmental groups cited liability waivers and the state’s expertise and resources to manage permitting. Although the Fifth Circuit dismissed that case for lack of standing, the court did not address the merits, potentially leaving the door open to future challenges under different factual circumstances. Any such litigation could introduce uncertainty or delays in the transition timeline.

Prepare for RRC’s Approach to Community Engagement and Transparency

Texas’s proposed Class VI program places emphasis on public outreach and transparency. Developers should plan early for stakeholder engagement, particularly in communities near proposed CCS sites. Early and meaningful engagement strategies, clear documentation, and responsiveness to local concerns will be essential to maintaining momentum under a new regulatory structure.

Assess Long-Term Permitting and Liability Management

Companies should evaluate how Texas’s assumption of enforcement authority will affect long-term monitoring, post-injection site care, and financial assurance requirements. While the core technical criteria are federally defined, state-level implementation could introduce distinct expectations or pathways for compliance. It is also an opportunity to shape how Texas builds out its own enforcement and closure protocols.

Align Internal Compliance and Risk Protocols

With the primacy transition ostensibly on the horizon, internal teams should align now on how to respond to the new permitting framework. This includes tracking rule changes, updating internal compliance procedures, and modeling how Texas-specific processes will influence risk profiles and reporting obligations.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15622_1442.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 02:01:44.415130

“We are in a period when we need to be deploying more energy resources,” Vaughan said at a Pennsylvania House Energy Committee hearing on Wednesday.
“Too often, red tape makes it slower, more uncertain and more expensive to build the next generation of energy projects in Pennsylvania,” he said.
Pennsylvania is one of only 12 states that don’t coordinate their energy development statewide, he added.
”What has worked in other states with a similar crisis is a state siting board.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

State lawmakers heard conflicting views this week over whether the state should set up a board that oversees the siting and operation of new electric-generating plants amid national fears that growing demand for electricity will exceed supply.

The Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board, or RESET, would set statewide standards for the selection and use of sites for energy generation and storage. According to a bill, HB 502, that’s backed by the administration of Gov. Josh Shapiro and is now being considered by the state legislature, the board would do so in a way consistent with human health, safety, environmental protection and the efficient use of resources.

If approved, the board would replace what its supporters say is a patchwork of local regulations set by townships, whose power over land use can create delays, add to costs and sometimes results in new power projects being rejected. Local officials often lack the expertise to decide on power-generating projects that may cost $1 billion or more, proponents say.

Opponents fear the panel will usher in more fossil-fuel power plants even as the consequences from climate change mount, both in Pennsylvania and worldwide.

The seven-member board would consist of three secretaries of state agencies, the chair of the state’s Public Utility Commission, representatives of business and the building trades and the chair of the state’s environmental justice advisory board.

Although the bill does not propose that local officials are represented on the board, it requires developers to inform them about reasons for proposing a local site, alternative locations that were considered, environmental impacts and potential benefits to the community. Developers would also have to provide a township with copies of technical reports showing the need for a new power plant or energy-storage facility.

While local input is required by the bill, towns should not prevent energy projects at a time when new capacity is urgently needed in Pennsylvania and across the United States, argued Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, a trade group that advocates for clean energy infrastructure in 10 of the 13 states that fall in the territory of regional grid operator PJM Interconnection.

“We are in a period when we need to be deploying more energy resources,” Vaughan said at a Pennsylvania House Energy Committee hearing on Wednesday. “We can’t afford to have good projects get stymied by, not bad faith by localities, but by a myopic view of what a good energy project is. Localities are not bad guys but they are not fundamentally set up to make judgements about energy projects that can be significant at the state or even the regional level.”

Power-hungry data centers are a driving force behind quickly rising energy demand around the country. The urgent need for more power supply means fossil fuels must also be considered, Vaughan said, despite his group’s advocacy for renewables. “I agree that includes all of the above,” he said.

There are about 9 gigawatts of renewables—mostly solar but also wind and battery storage—awaiting PJM approval in Pennsylvania now, but only about 20 percent of that is likely to finally provide power to the grid, according to the historical average, Vaughan said. Lately, the rate has fallen to around 5 percent, partly because some projects are denied by local governments.

“You can be ready to go, but if your locality says no, your project doesn’t materialize,” he said.

Critics say the plan is an unwarranted centralization of power at the state level, erodes local democracy and sidelines the expertise of local officials.

The plan that would give the board power to issue or deny certificates of reliable energy supply without clearly defined environmental standards “enables political favoritism, reduces transparency, and concentrates immense influence in the hands of a few,” according to a statement issued by the environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch and signed by 24 other environmental and civic groups.

The group accused Shapiro, a Democrat, of abandoning campaign promises to be an environmental champion, and said he has instead backed fossil-fuel development. “This is not climate leadership. It’s a corporate giveaway,” the group said, referring to the bill. “At a time when local governments are developing bold climate solutions, this bill cuts them off at the knees.”

Adam Walters, an energy advisor to Pennsylvania’s Department of Community and Economic Development, testified on behalf of the Shapiro administration in support of the bill. The proposal is part of Shapiro’s “Lightning Plan,” a multi-pronged energy effort the governor said is designed to lower costs, create jobs, streamline permitting and boost in-state energy production.

Since the mid-19th century, Pennsylvania has been a national energy leader, producing large quantities of oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear power, Walters said. But it is now in danger of losing its lead because of bureaucratic delays and high costs, some of which originate locally, he said.

“Too often, red tape makes it slower, more uncertain and more expensive to build the next generation of energy projects in Pennsylvania,” he said. Pennsylvania is one of only 12 states that don’t coordinate their energy development statewide, he added.

But Brian Rengert, director of government relations with the Pennsylvania State Association of Township Supervisors, blamed federal and state permitting delays, supply-chain challenges and construction holdups rather than local deliberations for a slow pace of power development.

The bill would deprive the energy-development process of the expertise of local officials, he said at a committee hearing on Monday. Rengert dismissed the bill’s requirement for developers to consult with local officials as only “checking a box.” He said that required public hearings don’t have to take place in the host municipality, a measure that would limit public attendance.

“HB 502 removes an important check and balance from the development process by local elected officials, who understand the uniqueness of their communities,” he said. “It overrides the careful planning by local governments and strips communities of protections.”

The Texas-based power company Vistra supports the bill because it would streamline permitting and help to create certainty for investors in power projects, said Kathy Dietz, director of development and strategy of the company, which has three gas-fueled and one nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, serving some 200,000 customers.

“Regulatory complexity can add years to the amount of time required to develop a new power plant. In contrast, a stable state regulatory policy can significantly accelerate and de-risk the timeline for a project by providing predictability, clarity and coordination across the development lifecycle,” she said.

Committee vice chair Mandy Steele, a Democrat who is the bill’s lead sponsor, predicted that Pennsylvania’s residents and businesses won’t be able to afford their electric bills unless supply rises to meet demand.

“PJM is telling us that demand is rising and that we have to do something, or we are going to be in a full-grown crisis in Pennsylvania,” Steele said. ”What has worked in other states with a similar crisis is a state siting board. We’ve got to get this done fast.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Josh-Shapiro-Lightning-Plan-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 08:01:31.181282

The draft rules propose biomass-based diesel standards equivalent to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons in 2027.
That’s a significant jump from the EPA’s 2025 targets, which set an annual volume requirement of 3.35 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel.
“For Iowa, these volumes likely mean something even more immediate — getting our idled biodiesel plants back up and running.
There are no income eligibility requirements for this program and it closes 180 days from the date of the Governor’s proclamation.","State officials and Iowa’s biofuels industry praised proposed Renewable Fuel Standard volumes for 2026 and 2027 released Friday by the Trump administration, calling the record-setting targets for biomass-based diesel a major win for domestic biodiesel producers.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Friday released its Renewable Fuel Standards draft rule, which proposes a total 24.02 billion gallon level in 2026.

The RFS mandates that U.S. refiners blend a certain amount of renewable fuels into transportation fuels, or buy credits to comply.

The draft rules propose biomass-based diesel standards equivalent to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons in 2027. That’s a significant jump from the EPA’s 2025 targets, which set an annual volume requirement of 3.35 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel.

Grant Kimberley, executive director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, said in a statement the volumes “signal real opportunity for domestic producers, especially here in Iowa, and we appreciate the EPA’s recognition of what this industry is capable of delivering.”

“We thank the Trump administration for recognizing that American-made biofuels should be a national priority, and for setting the stage for today’s historic growth in biomass-based diesel,” Kimberley added. “For Iowa, these volumes likely mean something even more immediate — getting our idled biodiesel plants back up and running. That’s good news for jobs, for soybean farmers and for communities that rely on biofuels as a driver of economic growth.”

Iowa Republican U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst celebrated the EPA announcement.

“I'm very encouraged by the EPA's proposed rule, which underscores the important role that biofuels play in our strategy for American energy dominance,” Hinson said in a statement. “Energy security is national security, and today’s announcement is a win for our biofuels producers and Ag community in Iowa.”

Hinson earlier this year led a bipartisan letter to President Donald Trump urging his administration to propose robust blending targets, after several biodiesel plants in the Midwest idled production after former President Joe Biden’s administration failed to issue final guidance on new tax incentives for the next generation of renewable fuels and set biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels volumes below what the industry said was needed to meet actual production capacity.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig similarly applauded the move, including proposed regulation changes to steer producers away from foreign-made feedstocks.

“President Trump is once again demonstrating his commitment to showcasing how Iowa-made biofuels can be central to his effort to make America energy dominant,” Naig said in a statement. “Biofuels are a win for drivers and American farmers — they save drivers money at the pump, directly support corn and soybean prices, expand markets for farmers, and support rural jobs and communities.”

Naig also called on the administration to clarify that future EPA decisions on small refinery exemptions be done “in a manner that upholds current and future blending targets.”

EPA will host a public hearing on the rules July 8.

Iowa nonprofits warn of harms caused by Trump tax bill

The Iowa Nonprofit Alliance and 96 other nonprofit organizations from across the state sent a joint letter Thursday to Republican Iowa U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst calling for critical changes to the House-passed budget reconciliation bill.

The letter warns that specific provisions in the bill would harm Iowa communities, particularly in rural Iowa, by cutting access to food, health care and education, and by weakening charitable giving incentives that support local services.

“If these cuts go through, more Iowans will go without food and health care,” Alex Rice, executive director of the Iowa Nonprofit Alliance, said in a statement. “This isn’t just about dollars — it’s about real human consequences.”

The nonprofit groups warn the proposed $1 trillion in reduced spending outlined in the bill would increase food insecurity and jeopardize health coverage for some 730,000 Iowans, and threaten the viability of rural health care providers and grocery stores.

Cuts to Pell Grant funding would block pathways to better jobs, especially in a state already grappling with workforce shortages, the letter warns.

And proposed changes to charitable deductions and new tax burdens on nonprofits would significantly reduce donations and limit critical services at a time of rising community need, the alliance warns.

“Nonprofits are not just service providers — we are employers, community hubs, and often the last line of support for people in crisis,” Rice said. “We ask our senators to stand with Iowa’s communities and the organizations working every day to support them.”

Reynolds issues disaster proclamation for Palo Alto, Osceola counties

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for Palo Alto and Osceola counties Friday after the areas experienced severe weather conditions, including wind damage, Tuesday.

The proclamation will allow state resources to be utilized to help areas impacted by severe whether and activates the Iowa Individual Assistance Grant Program, which provides grants up to $7,000 for households with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Grants are available for home or car repairs, replacement of personal property or food, and temporary housing expenses. The program application is open for 45 days from the date of the proclamation.

The proclamation also activates the Disaster Case Advocacy Program, which provides support for those who experience disaster-related hardship, injury or adverse conditions. There are no income eligibility requirements for this program and it closes 180 days from the date of the Governor’s proclamation.

APIA, CA, UNITED STATES, June 13, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Samoa became one of the first Pacific Island nations to adopt a legally binding Marine Spatial Plan — a milestone step to fully protect 30% and ensure sustainable management of 100% of its vast 120,000-square-kilometer ocean territory.

The adoption of the plan under the Lands, Survey and Environment Act 1989 was endorsed by Samoa’s Cabinet, setting a global blueprint for how large ocean states can sustainably manage their ocean and their resources.

Hon. Toeolesulsulu Cedric Pose Salesa Schuster, Samoa’s Minister for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the legal adoption of the plan, stating, “Samoa is a large ocean state, and our way of life is under increased threat from climate change, overfishing, habitat degradation, and much more. This Marine Spatial Plan marks a historic step towards ensuring that our ocean remains prosperous and healthy to support all future generations of Samoans-just as it did for us and our ancestors.”

The Marine Spatial Plan includes the establishment of nine new fully protected Marine Protected Areas, covering 36,000 square kilometers of ocean. It integrates traditional management systems by incorporating existing nearshore community-managed areas such as Fish Reserves and District MPAs, ensuring these culturally important practices are preserved and strengthened.

Traditional knowledge and the best available science together with input from stakeholders and communities from across 185 communities guided and shaped the Plan. Its implementation will be led by the MNRE in close collaborations with other Ministries and national and local stakeholders.

Leilani Duffy-Iosefa, Country Director of Conservation International Samoa, emphasized the importance of Samoa’s legal commitment and the broader implications for global marine governance, “This example shows what true delivery and accountability look like and Conservation International is excited to continue the partnership to support Samoa’s goals to protect 30% and sustainably manage 100% of its ocean.""

Dr. Kathryn Mengerink, Executive Director of the Waitt Institute, acknowledged Samoa’s leadership and the significance of this achievement in the global context, “Today, Samoa has established itself as a leader in sustainable ocean management. We are proud to support Samoa’s visionary leadership and decisive action towards securing a healthy ocean, thriving communities, and a prosperous future for its people and the planet.”

The legal establishment of this Marine Spatial Plan comes ahead of the United Nations Ocean Conference taking place this June in France. The conference, aptly themed “Accelerating action and mobilizing all actors to conserve and sustainably use the ocean,” will provide a platform for Samoa to inspire countries across the globe to advance their ocean protection targets as the deadline for the 30x30 conservation goals rapidly approaches.

The district is leveraging clean energy investment credits specifically for energy storage and plans to reinvest those savings into solar panels to further drive down energy use.
Meanwhile, the surrounding community benefits from taxpayer savings and the creation of high-quality jobs, many of them in Maine’s growing clean energy sector.
“Maine has seen a boom in clean energy jobs,” he says.
“I’ve seen what a large impact a relatively small amount of money can have in a local district,” Howell says.","In school districts across Maine, a quiet transformation is taking place, one that’s improving classroom environments, lowering taxpayer costs and preparing students for the jobs of tomorrow. At the center of this shift are clean energy investments supported by federal tax incentives, which superintendents say are not just good policy, but that they’re also reshaping what’s possible for public education in the state.

For Christopher Howell, Superintendent of Schools for RSU-14, serving Windham and Raymond, energy policy wasn’t exactly a familiar topic. “These tax credits were not in my realm of thought before this project,” he admits. But that changed when his district began construction on a new middle school, the most energy-efficient school ever built in Maine.

By consolidating three outdated schools into one, RSU-14 is creating a state-of-the-art facility that runs on air-source heat pumps and energy storage technology. These systems electrify heating and cooling while reducing long-term operational costs. The district is leveraging clean energy investment credits specifically for energy storage and plans to reinvest those savings into solar panels to further drive down energy use.

“The result is a win for everyone,” Howell says. “We’re lowering the tax burden on our residents, freeing up funds that can be redirected back into the classroom and giving our students a better environment to learn in, with cleaner air and more stable temperatures.”

That ripple effect is no accident. With improved air quality and better temperature control, students and teachers can focus more on learning and less on discomfort. Meanwhile, the surrounding community benefits from taxpayer savings and the creation of high-quality jobs, many of them in Maine’s growing clean energy sector.

But Howell warns that progress could stall if federal incentives are rolled back. “Maine has seen a boom in clean energy jobs,” he says. “If those investments go away, so do the specialized workers.”

Keeping cool for Maine’s classrooms and students

Jeremy Ray, Superintendent of Schools for the Saco, Biddeford and Dayton School Departments, echoes that concern, and brings a personal perspective. “My daughter was in a classroom that reached 96 degrees,” Ray says. “That’s unacceptable, and it’s why we’re acting now.”

His district is replacing four aging elementary schools with two modern, energy-efficient facilities. Thanks to investment tax credits and direct pay provisions, the district will receive approximately $1 million to fund critical energy efficiency upgrades, including expanded solar capacity and high-efficiency lighting.

The projected savings? About $300,000 annually in heating and electricity, which is enough to reduce the local mill rate by 13.5 cents. “That’s money we can put toward retaining staff and avoiding cuts to programming,” Ray explains. “It directly supports student success.”

It also supports the broader community. Ray’s district runs a vocational center that trains students in HVAC, electrical and plumbing, skills that are increasingly in demand due to Maine’s clean energy boom. “We’re preparing students for careers in renewable energy right here in our state,” he says. “If we lose these programs, we lose not only the jobs, but the chance for our kids to build a future here.”

The stakes are local—and high

What both Howell and Ray make clear is that clean energy in schools isn’t abstract. It’s deeply personal. It’s about the air students breathe, the comfort they feel and the opportunities they’ll have when they graduate. It’s also about lowering costs and giving rural Maine communities a level playing field.

“I’ve seen what a large impact a relatively small amount of money can have in a local district,” Howell says. “And I’ve become a champion for these programs because of it.”

“The Engine Technology Forum welcomes EPA’s announcement today of the establishment of a robust and growth oriented renewable fuels policy. The policy will boost our American energy portfolio, where fuels from below the ground and those from above the ground are valuable and contribute to our energy security and sustainability.

“Today’s proposed rule was boosted by the coming together of the renewable fuels and petroleum sectors around shared goals and vision for meeting our increasing demands for energy. ETF joined fuels industry leaders in supporting the call for a minimum of 5.25 billion gallon biomass-based diesel volume, and EPA delivered more.

“Advanced engines and renewable fuels together are a sustainable solution for power and mobility. Internal combustion engines are key to both producing our renewable and traditional fuels and realizing the benefits from them to power key sectors of our economy. Biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, and ethanol already play a vital role in our nation’s transportation system and key industries. Thanks to this proposal, that role will be expanded in the future.

“Today’s welcome action by Administrator Zeldin ends a period of stagnation and uncertainty for fuels needed to help power our agriculture and transportation sectors in the future. We look forward to working with our members and EPA on the many important details of the proposal on the road to a final rule.”

On Thursday, legislative committees in the Assembly and Senate approved measures related to state energy policies and the overall affordability of energy in New Jersey.

These included a bipartisan measure that cleared the Senate Environment and Energy Committee to establish a nuclear power advisory commission in New Jersey.

“As demand grows, the state must undertake a serious, science-based evaluation of how nuclear energy can help meet our clean energy goals,” said Sen. Joseph Pennacchio (R-Morris).

Bid to reject electricity auction results

In a different Senate committee, lawmakers approved a resolution urging federal regulators to formally reject the results of a regional electricity pricing auction that has resulted in skyrocketing utility bills for consumers in New Jersey taking effect this month.

“New Jersey families and businesses are now facing higher electric bills because of a capacity auction process that appears rigged against the public interest,” said Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson).

Last week, Gov. Phil Murphy and Democratic legislative leaders announced a plan to use more than $400 million to help offset the electricity bill increases, which are estimated to run as high as 20% for some consumers.

Their action comes as many lawmakers are gearing up for a November election where all 80 seats in the Assembly are on the ballot.

‘Not only is community solar cheaper and faster, it also creates good, local jobs, and helps increase energy transmission, right here in Jersey.’ — Jasmine Metellus, New Jersey League of Conservation Voters

However, compounding concerns about the state’s rising energy bills — and any political implications — is federal legislation that calls for ending federal tax credits for renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, as well as hydrogen production and nuclear energy among other policy changes.

By some estimates, these federal changes alone could push electricity costs up by nearly 10% by 2030.

Community solar program

At the state level, a bill sponsored by Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) calls for revising New Jersey’s community solar energy program, including by updating development targets and eliminating capacity caps.

“The growth that is projected here is exactly the growth that we need,” said Doug O’Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, while testifying in favor of the legislation moments before it was cleared by members of the Senate Environment and Energy Committee.

The same bill was also up for consideration in the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee, where it drew praise from Jasmine Metellus from the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

“Not only is community solar cheaper and faster, it also creates good, local jobs, and helps increase energy transmission, right here in Jersey,” Metellus said.

Concerns about data centers

Meanwhile, the same committee took up a measure that calls for establishing regulations and rates that would be levied on “large load” data centers, defined as consuming 100 megawatts or more of electricity.

As the industrial footprint of data centers expands nationally, including to support artificial intelligence businesses, many states are grappling with how to regulate their huge energy demands in ways that also protect residential consumers.

“If we, in New Jersey, are not proactive in creating a plan, and these guardrails, for addressing the problems that data centers can pose to maintaining an affordable and reliable grid, everyday taxpayers and small businesses will pay the price,” said Assemblyman Dave Bailey (D-Salem).

According to Assemblyman Don Guardian (R-Atlantic), the U.S. Department of Energy has predicted wave and other water-generated energy will produce 15% of the country’s electricity by 2030.

The measure received some opposition before the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee ultimately approved it.

Data centers are “the future of economic growth, here in our state, and across the country,” New Jersey Business & Industry Association economic policy research analyst Jack Ramirez told committee members.

He pointed to economic development related to data centers in places like Pennsylvania and Virginia that share the regional energy grid with New Jersey.

Ramirez also warned that higher utility rates for data centers currently up for consideration in New Jersey could “turn away these centers from our state to states with more competitive and better (business) environments.”

Salvation in the ocean?

The same committee also cleared bipartisan legislation calling for additional study by the state Board of Public Utilities of the potential of ocean wave and tidal energy.

According to Assemblyman Don Guardian (R-Atlantic), the U.S. Department of Energy has predicted wave and other water-generated energy will produce 15% of the country’s electricity by 2030. The bill, sponsored by Guardian, calls for making New Jersey a “nationwide leader in ocean energy.”

“It’s really an exciting proposition and absolutely worth exploring,” Guardian said.

Among other energy-related legislation advancing on Thursday were those seeking to:

Require electric public utilities to file an annual report with the BPU on recorded votes at meetings of PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator serving more than 65 million consumers, across 13 states, including New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.

Require a public utility to annually review its actual revenues collected during the year and its total revenue requirement to determine if it collected excess profits during that year. After any year in which a public utility collected excess profits, the utility would be required to redistribute its excess profits to customers, in a proportional manner and in intervals prescribed by BPU, through a refund mechanism subject to board approval.

The president’s signing of joint resolutions under the Congressional Review Act reverses the Biden administration’s approval of California’s Advanced Clean Trucks rule.
That earlier rule called for requiring 75% of Class 8 trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.
""Under the Congressional Review Act, the EPA cannot approve any future waivers that are 'substantially the same' as those disapproved in the joint resolutions,"" Trump said in a statement.
“Our 150,000 small-business members have been saying it all along—electric trucks just aren’t a realistic option right now.","President Donald Trump moved to sever California's EPA waivers by signing a series of joint resolutions Thursday, rolling back the Golden State's strict truck and automotive emissions policies.

The president’s signing of joint resolutions under the Congressional Review Act reverses the Biden administration’s approval of California’s Advanced Clean Trucks rule. That earlier rule called for requiring 75% of Class 8 trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.

Another resolution also prevents the state’s low-nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions rule for heavy-duty trucks from being implemented, per a statement by the president. The NOx rule intended to regulate emissions from manufacturers by cutting heavy-duty NOx emissions by 90% and overhaul engine testing procedures.

Trump’s actions also reverses the Environmental Protection Agency’s approval of a waiver to California and several states that banned sales of gas powered passenger vehicles by 2035, which was viewed as a welcome move by the automotive industry.

John Bozzella, president and CEO Alliance for Automotive Innovation, said the president deserves credit for repealing EV mandates before they “did real damage to the auto industry in America.”

“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” Bozzella said in a statement. “Customers don’t want the government telling them what kind of car to buy. What they want is a range of choices like efficient gas-powered, battery electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles.”

The Trump administration has described his predecessor's environmental policies as overreach and unjustified mandates. Trump said the congressional moves he signed further restrict California from implementing a similar policy in the future.

""Under the Congressional Review Act, the EPA cannot approve any future waivers that are 'substantially the same' as those disapproved in the joint resolutions,"" Trump said in a statement.

""Accordingly, the joint resolutions prohibit the EPA from approving future waivers for California that would impose California’s policy goals across the entire country and violate fundamental constitutional principles of federalism, ending the electric vehicle mandate for good,"" the statement said.

In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared the federal measures illegal and moved to sue the federal government, seeking to pursue the state's zero-emission vehicle policy. Newsom signed an executive order on Thursday for the state to continue regulation requiring that 100% of sales of new vehicles be zero emission by 2035 for cars, pickup trucks and drayage trucks and by 2045 for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.

Trucking leaders applauded Trump for the measures. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association said the news was a big win for both men and women behind the wheel.

“Our 150,000 small-business members have been saying it all along—electric trucks just aren’t a realistic option right now. They’re too expensive, the charging infrastructure isn’t there,” OOIDA President Todd Spencer said in an emailed press release to Trucking Dive.

Industry advocates, including the American Trucking Associations and the Washington Trucking Associations, also warned that electric truck technology and charging infrastructure were not caught up to accommodate California's ambitious EV policies.

“We’ve done our part to reduce carbon emissions while keeping America's economy moving,” ATA President and CEO Chris Spear said in a press release. “But what we need is federal leadership to set realistic and achievable national emissions standards. And today brings us one step closer toward that goal,” he added.

Werner Enterprises truck driver Gina Jones shared a similar sentiment, speaking as part of the signing ceremony at the White House.

“We cannot allow one state’s regulations to disrupt our entire nation’s supply chain,” Jones said. “Allowing California to do so would have [negatively] impacted the hundreds of thousands of truck drivers who deliver critical goods across the country each and every day.”

However, electric vehicle advocates view the action as a set back for broader EV adoption as well as improving air quality.

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, in a statement said despite Trump’s actions, the nation’s electric vehicle and battery supply chains will continue to grow and spur job creation across the country.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/A-8vDSiBrvZ_9gmm37YuwUDxp5nvH_LqblzQDuYJfpM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE5ODIxODE4XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-14 00:00:50.846136

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) also anticipates declines in U.S. production and lower oil prices as global oil supply grows.
The IEA noted increasing EV use as a major contributing factor among others for declining oil demand.
While falling demand is encouraging for those concerned about the environment, a radical increase in the global oil supply brings its own issues.
“Oil supply must drop down if the world is going to avoid catastrophic climate change.” Oil Growth Now Unrelated to Economy However, Williams-Derry also notes that oil has decoupled from economic growth.","Experts are urging caution after the secretary general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) told delegates to the Global Energy Show Canada that there is no oil peak on the horizon, and that energy demand will increase by 24 percent by 2050.

“The fact is that oil demand keeps rising, hitting new records year on year, is a clear example of what I’m saying,” Haitham al-Ghais said during his keynote address Tuesday, opening the convention in Calgary. “In fact, our projections are that oil demands will go and surpass 120 million barrels a day by 2050.”

Al-Ghais further criticized the International Energy Agency (IEA) for what he termed “flip-flopping” on their projections for future oil demand.

Experts do not share al-Ghais’ optimistic outlook, however.

“Oil producers — OPEC included — clearly have a financial incentive to make bullish claims about growing demand,” said Clark Williams-Derry, energy finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

“OPEC’s forecasting record is mixed at best. For key trends in oil demand, such as EV adoption, OPEC’s forecasts have been consistently terrible,” said Williams-Derry in a statement to DeSmog.

“Long-term oil prices are drifting down in the futures markets — a sign of supply growth outpacing demand,” he added. “The West Texas (WTI) oil price is $65 a barrel today, trending down to $59 a barrel in 2036.”

Williams-Derry noted that the decline is even steeper when adjusted for inflation.

Though in his keynote address al-Ghais claimed OPEC’s projections are not ideological, and evidence-based, he also alternated between dismissing reports that oil demand is falling — particularly those of the IEA — and warning that such reports are dangerous.

“The consequences of this mixed messaging are serious for a capital-intensive industry with long lead times for investments,” al-Ghais noted. “Bodies that are entrusted with guiding policy on global energy affairs should not reverse course every couple of years if they want to remain credible and relevant. OPEC has been consistent in repeatedly stating that inadequate investments in our industry is a dangerous matter.”

Al-Ghais stated oil investment ambivalence was as bad for producers as much as consumers and the wider global economy. His message was well-received by conference delegates, a number of whom — including Alberta Premier Danielle Smith — referenced his statements throughout the conference to support arguments in favour of continued investment in the oil sector.

However, al-Ghais’ optimistic outlook is challenged by OPEC’s own projections: OPEC cut its demand growth forecast in April, citing first quarter 2025 data indicating lower demand for 2025 and 2026 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff war.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) also anticipates declines in U.S. production and lower oil prices as global oil supply grows.

Perhaps most significantly, the IEA’s May 2025 Oil Market Report projects demand to slow considerably over the course of this year, from 990,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2025 to 650,000 barrels per day for the rest of the year. The IEA noted increasing EV use as a major contributing factor among others for declining oil demand.

Moreover, the IEA’s report predicts global oil supply will increase by 1.6 million barrels per day to 104.6 million barrels per day on average in 2025. The organization notes demand in OECD countries (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development — 38 leading advanced industrial economies in North America, East Asia, Oceania, Europe, and Latin America) is projected to decline by 120,000 barrels per day in 2025, and by 240,000 barrels per day in 2026.

While falling demand is encouraging for those concerned about the environment, a radical increase in the global oil supply brings its own issues.

“A 1.6 million barrel per day increase (to global oil supply) is obviously a problem,” said IEEFA’s Williams-Derry in response to questions from DeSmog. “Oil supply must drop down if the world is going to avoid catastrophic climate change.”

Oil Growth Now Unrelated to Economy

However, Williams-Derry also notes that oil has decoupled from economic growth.

“The global economy is expected to grow by 2.8 percent this year, while oil supply is only growing by about 1.5 to 1.6 percent,” he said. “This reinforces a longer-term trend: [the economy and oil demand] no longer move upward in lock step.”

Williams-Derry further notes that the mismatch between supply and demand growth will likely push oil prices down.

“This helps explain why oil prices have fallen to their lowest level in years, and futures markets expect them to continue to fall,” he added.

“It doesn’t do OPEC nations much good if 1.5 percent demand growth requires prices to stay in the $70 range, which is generally too low to support OPEC countries’ fiscal needs for oil revenue.”

Williams-Derry believes this applies to private oil companies too.

“It doesn’t do oil companies much good if oil sales volumes are growing but oil prices are too low to support robust profits,” he said.

Though at the conference, al-Ghais pointed out that OPEC “takes climate matters very seriously,” he also said the world faces an emissions challenge — but not one pertaining to energy sources.

“I’m sure you have all been seeing the recent pushback against the unsustainable rush to unrealistic net-zero targets, and deadlines that were just fixated on deadlines and policy proposals really detached from reality,” al-Ghais told the audience. “We welcome the recent moves towards policies grounded in pragmatic energy realities and that recognize that we face an emissions challenge and not an energy sources challenge.”

Experts have long countered al-Ghais’s ideas. The UN Climate Change organization notes most nations’ climate action plans are insufficient to meet Paris Agreement targets. Climate scientists have also long argued that the quickest way to reducing emissions is to speed up the widespread transition to renewable energy sources.

Unlike al-Gais, Stephen Legault, senior manager of Alberta energy transition with Environmental Defence, doesn’t believe it’s the IEA that has flip-flopped.

He said the IEA has identified what has become the reality for the global energy market. “Starting in 2021, [the IEA was] among the first major industry forecasters to recognize that, due to the devastating impact of climate change on human life, and the global policies put in place to curtail emissions, oil consumption and, consequently, production would decline,” Legault said in a statement to DeSmog.

Legault notes no credible, non-producer-generated, oil-futures forecast exists that doesn’t show oil consumption peaking around 2030, including the IEA.

“OPEC has a vested interest in maintaining a high level of production for its member states, and as a result, appears to be viewing the world through rose-coloured glasses,” he said.

The IEA further expects global oil supply will considerably outpace demand growth, with oil inventories expected to jump by 720,000 barrels per day in 2025, to 930,000 barrels per day in 2026.

“This sets the stage for a further rebalancing of supply and demand fundamentals,” concluded the IEA’s May 2025 Oil Market Report.

“The futures market is anticipating weak demand, abundant supply, and declining prices,” said IEEFA’s Williams-Derry. “That spells trouble for the oil industry’s finances. But you won’t hear that from OPEC. As Upton Sinclair once quipped, ‘It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.’”",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OPECchief.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 23:03:46.916983

For vehicles already priced in luxury territory, a $5,000 increase might seem like pocket change to some. But it’s actually a 6% jump, equivalent to adding a year’s worth of insurance premiums or several thousand miles of road trips to your purchase price. That’s real money, even for buyers shopping in this bracket.

What’s driving the higher sticker prices?

Tesla’s justifying the increase with tangible improvements. The Model S Long Range now delivers up to 410 miles per charge, addressing range anxiety, which is one of EV owners’ biggest concerns. New wheel designs, more aerodynamic bodies, upgraded suspension, and better noise cancellation round out the enhancement package.

The Model X also features more space for third-row passengers and cargo.

But here’s what Tesla isn’t saying directly: this move likely reflects broader market dynamics. The company has weathered production challenges, supply chain pressures, and shifting demand patterns. By packaging improvements with a price increase, Tesla’s testing whether its brand power and loyal customer base will absorb higher costs without flinching.

This could signal a new pricing strategy for premium EVs across the board. When the market leader raises prices, competitors often follow suit, especially if buyers prove willing to pay more for incremental improvements.

Where to find better value in EVs

If that extra $5,000 has you reconsidering, you’ve got options worth exploring.

The used Tesla market suddenly looks more attractive. Pre-owned Model S and X vehicles from recent years offer similar technology without the fresh price bump. You’ll sacrifice the latest improvements but could save significantly off new prices while still getting a modern luxury EV.

Competing brands deserve a serious look too. Each brings distinct advantages, including different interior craftsmanship, tech approaches, or value propositions, without Tesla’s recent adjustment.

Consider playing the waiting game as well. Tesla has historically adjusted prices both up and down based on demand. If sales slow after this increase, we might see incentives or price cuts within several months. The company’s done it before, particularly when quarterly sales targets loom.

How to time your purchase strategically

For committed buyers, timing matters more than ever. Federal EV tax credits may apply to these vehicles if you meet certain requirements. But there’s a catch: various price caps and eligibility rules could affect whether you qualify. Check current guidelines before assuming you’ll receive any credits.

If you’re cross-shopping other luxury brands, leverage Tesla’s price increase in negotiations. Dealers for competing brands know about Tesla’s move and might offer better incentives to capture buyers priced out of Tesla’s ecosystem.

Here’s another angle: consider leasing instead of buying. With EVs evolving rapidly and prices fluctuating, a lease lets you enjoy the latest technology without committing to long-term ownership during this volatile period. You’ll also sidestep concerns about battery degradation and resale values.

Your next move in today’s market

The luxury EV landscape is shifting. Tesla’s $5,000 increase might be the first domino in a series of adjustments across the premium electric segment. But savvy buyers who understand their options can still find value.

Whether you absorb the increase for Tesla’s latest features, pivot to a competitor, or strategically explore the used market, the key is moving with intention rather than impulse.

The worst decision? Rushing into a purchase because you fear more increases coming. The second worst? Waiting indefinitely for the “perfect” moment that might never arrive.

Take time to test drive alternatives, crunch the numbers on used options, and honestly assess whether those new features justify the premium. In a market where a single announcement can shift the price you pay by thousands of dollars, your best defense is flexibility backed by solid research.",https://www.moneytalksnews.com/workers/images/width=1920/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/29174541/shutterstock_1461009344-scaled.jpg?s=2715cb49842f09282672d652d9b91fa34da1aca050320500c6263e3db61e98f4,N,,2025-06-14 02:01:40.359912

Washington, D.C. – Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and Jon Husted (R-Ohio), along with Reps. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) and Scott Peters (D-Calif.), introduced the Nuclear REFUEL Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would simplify licensing requirements for nuclear recycling facilities in order to increase nuclear energy production in the U.S.

“More zero-emission nuclear power can help meet our growing energy demand while strengthening our energy independence and national security. By making it easier to safely recycle spent nuclear fuel, we can reduce nuclear waste, lower energy costs, and further America’s longstanding global leadership in nuclear energy. I’m pleased to co-lead another bipartisan, bicameral nuclear bill to support U.S. clean energy dominance,” said Whitehouse.

“Ohioans need reliable and affordable energy sources, and America’s national and economic security depends on onshoring and expanding energy production. The Nuclear REFUEL Act would inject additional sustainable energy options into our economy by expanding clean nuclear energy production here at home. I am proud to lead this bill because it would give our homes and businesses more of those choices,” said Husted.

“It’s important that we make it easier to produce more energy in this country—not less. The Nuclear REFUEL Act will streamline nuclear regulatory licensing and increase investment of nuclear energy right here in the United States, helping to unleash American energy. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan solution with my colleague, Rep. Peters, so we can get back on track to establishing American energy dominance,” said Latta.

“We must find a way to recycle nuclear fuel to reduce nuclear waste and make nuclear power more economically viable. Right now, nuclear operators are not allowed to recycle and reuse spent fuel responsibly, but our bill will change that by creating a regulatory pathway to allow the practice. While we work toward a permanent long-term solution to nuclear waste storage and disposal, proposals like this will help us safely utilize nuclear waste,” said Peters.

“With this bill, Congress is stepping up in a bipartisan way to provide solutions for fuel availability for advanced reactors and for used fuel management. This helps accelerate the deployment and adoption of clean energy powered by advanced fission technologies. The changes proposed in this legislation will facilitate efficient NRC licensing for facilities that recycle used nuclear fuel and produce fuel for advanced reactors. Domestic recycling of used nuclear fuel also enhances the supply chain resilience and security of nuclear fuel for advanced nuclear power plants, like Oklo's powerhouse, securing America’s future of clean energy abundance,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo Inc.

“For decades, the United States government has failed to provide a meaningful solution for what to do with spent nuclear fuel. Technology currently exists to recycle the roughly 95% of spent nuclear fuel’s remaining energy generation capability to refuel nuclear reactors, and as a country we should do so. Recycling will help secure our domestic nuclear fuel supply and help alleviate the massive cost that onsite storage has burdened American taxpayers with for far too long. USNIC commends Senator Husted for introducing the Nuclear REFUEL Act and encourages the [S]enate to act swiftly to move this legislation forward,” said the United States Nuclear Industry Council.

Background:

Nuclear fuel recycling technology, known as pyroprocessing, creates a uranium- transuranic (U/TRU) fuel. Advanced reactors can use this fuel to generate electricity, which reduces the waste that accumulates after energy plants consume nuclear fuel.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) policies do not provide a clear regulatory pathway for how the NRC should license recycling facilities. The NRC can license such facilities under 10 CFR Part 50 or 10 CFR Part 70.

Part 50 is used for licensing nuclear reactors but does not address the process of recycling nuclear fuel. Part 70 involves a single-step, quicker licensing process designed for fuel cycle facilities. In particular, Part 70 governs how uranium enrichment and fuel fabrication facilities become licensed. Licensing recycling facilities under Part 70 would make the process of recycling U/TRU fuel more efficient, as this licensing process would eliminate extra steps and thereby streamline the practice of nuclear recycling.

The Nuclear REFUEL Act would deliver legislative clarity for licensing plants that can recycle U/TRU fuel by bringing them under the authority of Part 70. As a result, the bill would increase America’s speed of recycling and ability to recycle nuclear fuel and equip the economy with additional sustainable energy options.",https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&File_id=9D6334F6-3E6F-42C5-A38E-6EF5A3792389,N,,2025-06-14 09:04:18.373644

Democratic Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin was the sole Democrat who voted for it.

Tim Minotas is deputy legislative and political director with the Michigan Sierra Club. He said Slotkin's vote is disappointing.

Thirteen states, plus Washington, D.C., were following California's push to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.

""To vote to undermine these crucial programs can very well exacerbate asthma and cancer in front line communities,"" he said, ""and risk investments and jobs in the clean transportation industry — and cede global leadership to China and other countries.""

The resolution initially had the support of some other Democratic senators, but they voted no after the Senate pushed the resolution through using the Congressional Review Act, or CRA. It allows the House and Senate to reject some agency-finalized rules within 60 business days of their being notified.

California has had its EPA waiver for many years.

Slotkin said while she voted for the resolution, she was concerned about future abuses of the CRA.

""Unfortunately, the way Senate Republicans brought this vote to the floor will have longstanding implications for how we change and make laws in the U.S. Senate. That is why I voted at least 11 times against the Republican attempts to change the Senate rules and bring this provision to the floor.""

Slotkin said her vote reflected her special responsibility, as Michigan's U.S. Senator, to stand up for the more than 1 million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.

She noted that none of the 13 states were anywhere close to meeting California's stricter emissions standards — but she still favors policies to support electric vehicle manufacturing.

Minotas said despite his group's disappointment in Slotkin's vote, going forward, Slotkin has another chance to support electric vehicles and clean energy in the federal budget negotiations in the Senate. Many EV-related grants and tax credits, both corporate and individual, were eliminated in the House version of the budget.

NSP Commends EPA Proposal for Record Biofuel Volumes, Enhanced Focus on U.S. Agriculture

WASHINGTON (June 13, 2025) — National Sorghum Producers today voiced strong support for the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. The proposal, marking the 20th anniversary of the RFS, calls for the highest total renewable fuel blending obligations ever and underscores a renewed focus on domestic energy security and agricultural markets.

The EPA’s proposal sets total renewable fuel requirements at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027. Conventional ethanol remains at 15 billion gallons annually, while advanced biofuel targets rise sharply to 9.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 9.46 billion gallons in 2027. The rule also includes structural changes aimed at reducing reliance on foreign feedstocks and better aligning the program with U.S. production capacity.

“The EPA’s proposal sends a strong market signal that prioritizes rural economies and sustainable fuel solutions made here at home,” NSP CEO Tim Lust said. “Sorghum continues to gain traction as a dependable, low-input advanced biofuel feedstock, and this rule lays important groundwork to expand our role in current and future advanced biofuel markets. We look forward to working with EPA and USDA to ensure the final rule promotes fair access and recognizes sorghum’s value across the advanced and conventional fuel space.”

The rule also proposes reducing the value of RINs generated from foreign biofuels and feedstocks to 50 percent of their domestic equivalents, a move intended to bolster American biofuel investment and reduce dependence on foreign oil by as much as 150,000 barrels per day, according to EPA estimates.

NSP supports the removal of renewable electricity (eRINs) from the program and continues to advocate for accurate lifecycle emissions modeling and improved market access for low-carbon sorghum-based ethanol and advanced biofuels.

Sharon Kelly reports for DeSmog.

In short:

In Colorado, Chevron’s oil well blowout near an elementary school exposed gaps in fracking chemical disclosures, with over 30 million pounds of “trade secret” chemicals injected statewide despite a 2022 transparency law.

In Louisiana, a new law threatens massive fines for community groups that publicly share air pollution data unless they use costly, state-approved equipment, prompting a federal lawsuit.

In Virginia’s booming data center corridor, tech companies use non-disclosure agreements with local officials to keep energy use and environmental impacts hidden, complicating public accountability and regulation.

Key quote:

“How many data centers currently exist in Virginia? How many proposals are in the works? These are good questions. It’s also extremely difficult to provide an answer, given there is no publicly available dataset or state-level tracking of these facilities.”

— The Piedmont Environmental Council, which attempts to track known data center projects in the state

Why this matters:

This is what environmental deregulation looks like in practice: a patchwork of laws that silence watchdogs and hide harm. While the federal government shrinks from its role, the fight for clean air and public data has become hyperlocal — and deeply unequal. Pollution data secrecy leaves families, first responders, and communities exposed to hidden environmental health risks, especially in frontline areas like Cancer Alley.

What matters most is that Africa’s energy transition reflects the continent’s realities, resources, and aspirations, not the preferences of financiers in faraway boardrooms.","This article was originally published by Project Drawdown. Read the original post here.

Africa is home to nearly one-fifth of the world’s population, but accounts for less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

It is a continent of paradoxes: rich in renewable energy resources but plagued by energy poverty; endowed with critical minerals but facing capital flight; courted as a climate partner but chronically underfunded when it comes to implementing solutions. As the world races toward net-zero, the question is no longer whether Africa will transition, but rather what that transition will look like, who will pay for it, and how it can be made truly fair.

Let’s explore the financing landscape shaping Africa’s energy transition by examining how things currently work, where they fall short, the actors involved, the structural barriers that persist, and the systemic changes needed to unlock a just and development-focused energy future. Understanding these interwoven dimensions can help in imagining a financing framework that supports Africa’s climate goals without sacrificing its development ambitions.

A tale of two realities

Today, Africa exists in a separate climate reality from that of the Global North. High-income countries are phasing out coal plants, banning internal combustion engines, and building out renewables at record speeds. Meanwhile, about 600 million Africans still live without access to electricity, and nearly 1 billion rely on wood, charcoal, and other forms of traditional biomass for cooking and heating. Indoor air pollution from traditional stoves causes over 600,000 premature deaths annually across the continent.

Africa’s energy transition is therefore about more than decarbonization. It is about escaping a developmental deadlock. It is about powering homes, hospitals, schools, farms, and industries. Yet the continent faces an uphill climb to achieve these goals while adhering to global expectations of carbon neutrality by mid-century. Meeting Africa’s energy and climate objectives will require more than doubling current energy investments of US$90 billion by 2030, with nearly two-thirds directed toward clean energy.

The problem with the current financing paradigm

The climate finance currently flowing to Africa is neither adequate, accessible, nor appropriate. Globally, Africa receives just about 2% of total climate finance, highlighting a significant gap in funding relative to other regions. Moreover, most of this funding is in the form of loans, not grants, further burdening countries already facing debt distress. Many multilateral development banks (MDBs) and climate funds prioritize risk-averse, commercially viable projects. This often means favoring large-scale solar and wind farms in politically stable African countries, while ignoring the urgent need to finance rural electrification and productive energy use projects in fragile African states.

The very architecture of global finance is skewed. African countries pay higher interest rates than countries in some other world regions, even with similar credit histories. This is due to structural biases in credit ratings, risk perceptions, and the lack of hedging instruments to manage currency risk. As a result, a solar project in Nigeria could cost three times more to finance than an identical one in Madrid. Furthermore, energy finance in Africa is rarely development-focused. Too often, it is shaped by donor priorities or corporate returns rather than African needs. This leads to skewed investment portfolios; lots of money for so-called climate mitigation projects, little money for productive energy use or climate-adaptation and resilience infrastructure.

Principles for a fair energy transition

To correct these imbalances, the global community must adopt a new financing framework rooted in justice, partnership, and pragmatism. Three principles, in particular, could guide this effort:

Development-centered decarbonization: Africa’s energy transition must be about powering growth, not just reducing emissions. Financing clean energy for job creation, food security, industrialization, and public services should be treated as more than climate action. After all, sustainable development is the best form of climate resilience.

Equity in burden sharing: High-emitting countries must bear a larger share of the financing responsibility. This is not just about historical responsibility; it is also about capability. The Global North has more fiscal space and mature capital markets, and has reaped the benefits of fossil-fueled development. Africa should not be forced to choose between financing clean energy and its own development.

Structural reform, not charity: Africa does not need pity or one-off pledges; it needs a seat at the table and access to fair finance. That means reforming the rules of the global financial system to unlock capital, reduce borrowing costs, and shift more decision-making power to African institutions.

Who pays and how?

Financing Africa’s fair energy transition requires mobilizing funds from multiple sources, domestic and international, public and private, but with new rules of engagement.

Domestic resource mobilization: African countries must lead with credible energy strategies, regulatory reforms, and improved public financial management. In May 2023, Nigeria removed fuel subsidies that had cost around US$10 billion the previous year, four times the health budget. These subsidies were largely poorly targeted and mostly benefited wealthier groups. Public-private partnerships and sovereign green bonds are also growing in popularity. Kenya, Morocco, and South Africa have issued green bonds to fund climate-friendly infrastructure. But the scale remains limited by small capital markets and weak investor confidence.

Multilateral development banks and climate funds: MDBs must do more than lending; they must also lead. This means de-risking investments in Africa through blended finance, offering long-term concessional loans, and investing in upstream infrastructure, such as transmission lines. The African Development Bank has launched innovative instruments like the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) and the Desert to Power initiative. But more needs to be done. The World Bank and others must simplify procedures and align their strategies with African energy access goals.

Carbon markets and global taxation: A share of revenues from global carbon taxes, aviation levies, or carbon border adjustment mechanisms could be earmarked for African countries. If wealthy countries tax carbon-intensive imports from Africa, those revenues should be reinvested in just transition investments within the exporting African countries.

Private sector investment on fairer terms: Private capital is essential, but it must be patient, pro-poor, and fit for purpose. Current returns expectations and risk aversion exclude too many impactful projects. Blended finance, credit guarantees, and currency hedging facilities can reduce risk and attract investors. Initiatives like the African Guarantee Fund and the Alliance for African Multilateral Financial Institutions must be scaled. Additionally, development finance institutions should stop crowding out local capital and start empowering African financial intermediaries.

Loss-and-damage and reparative finance: At COP28, the operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund marked a breakthrough. Though still underfunded, it sets a precedent: the Global North owes a climate debt to the Global South. Financing Africa’s energy transition should be part of that moral obligation; not just mitigation, but redress.

Structural barriers beyond money

Finance is only part of the equation. A fair energy transition in Africa also requires fixing systemic bottlenecks that prevent money from flowing into the continent.

Lowering the cost of capital: Africa’s high cost of capital is driven by risk perceptions, weak credit ratings, and currency volatility. Global institutions must support efforts to improve creditworthiness, expand risk insurance schemes, and localize capital markets.

Strengthening institutions and capacity: Weak utilities, slow permitting processes, and a lack of bankable project pipelines often stall progress. Capacity-building at the national, local, and project levels is essential.

Promoting regional integration: Africa’s power systems are highly fragmented. Regional integration through initiatives like the West Africa Power Pool or the Eastern Africa Power Pool can enable economies of scale, reduce redundancies, and expand markets for clean power.

Investing in human capital: A just energy transition must also be a jobs transition. Africa needs engineers, technicians, policy experts, and entrepreneurs to design, install, operate, and maintain clean energy systems. Financing skills development is climate action.

Africa’s right to define its own path

The narrative surrounding Africa’s energy transition must change. It is not about catching up with the Global North or meeting externally set global timelines. It is about building an energy system that is African in design, scale, and purpose. That could mean some instances where natural gas is used as a bridge fuel in select countries. It might mean investing in transmission and local manufacturing instead of imported climate solutions. That’s all a part of the transition, not apart from climate action. What matters most is that Africa’s energy transition reflects the continent’s realities, resources, and aspirations, not the preferences of financiers in faraway boardrooms.

The financing of Africa’s energy transition is not a test of Africa’s capacity; it is a test of global solidarity. To make the energy transition real and fair for Africa, we need bold actions such as canceling climate-related debt, lowering interest rates, shifting control to African institutions, and treating energy access as both a human right and a climate imperative. By following the principles outlined here, rethinking how the transition is financed and who pays, and eliminating structural barriers, the rest of the world can work alongside Africa to usher forth a fair energy transition. The question is no longer whether Africa will transition; it is whether that transition will lead to a better, fairer future.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/21091738/AfricaPowerlines_Feature_1b.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 22:02:38.040102

Some situations may present novel questions for businesses operating consistent with state EJ programs.","Key Takeaways

While the Trump administration has taken action to eliminate environmental justice (EJ) programs at the federal level, state programs with EJ laws and policies remain in place and apply to regulated entities.

These state EJ programs remain fully applicable, and as often occurs in the absence of federal actions in a given area, states may increase their EJ activities. Some states have already signaled interest in expanding their EJ activities.

However, the regulated community should be aware of potential tensions between federal law and policy, and state programs. State programs could ultimately be subject to future scrutiny by the Trump administration as has occurred in other areas.

As businesses continue to navigate this dynamic, EJ and other effective means of community engagement remain valuable opportunities to mitigate risks of challenges to project development and build meaningful relationships in the communities in which they operate.

Background and Recent Actions on EJ By the Trump Administration

EJ, historically defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the “fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies,” experienced an unprecedented renaissance under the Biden administration. Bipartisan legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) allocation of billions of dollars to advance environmental health in historically overburdened communities compounded this paradigm shift.

However, federal EJ policy—which has never been enshrined in any binding federal authority—is uniquely susceptible to shifting political winds. As demonstrated by the Trump administration’s slew of executive orders (EOs) issued almost immediately upon assuming office, the era of federal prioritization of EJ has been replaced by one in which the federal government has become actively antagonistic to its previous EJ initiatives—and, at times, antagonistic to the regulated community’s approach to EJ. The Trump administration has reversed many prior federal actions on EJ, including through the following actions:

EO 14148, Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions, which revoked Biden-era EJ EOs expanding the federal government’s commitment to addressing EJ in the context of revoking prior diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives;

EO 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, went a step further, withdrawing the 1994 EO 12898, the first federal action requiring agencies to systematically consider EJ as a part of their respective activities, and, until a few years ago, represented the only express federal EJ authority;

EO 14151, Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, directed agencies to “terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law,” all EJ offices and positions; and,

EO 14154, Unleashing American Energy, instructed agencies to immediately pause disbursement of funds appropriated under the IRA or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

More recently, the administration released EO 14281, Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy, which instructs DOJ to repeal or amend all disparate impact regulations derived from Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits acts that have an unjustified disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin, even without evidence of discriminatory intent. In the context of EJ, claims of “disparate impact” have been used to challenge federal actions such as permitting decisions and uses of federal funding that allegedly have an adverse and disproportionate impact based on race, color, or national origin.

Agencies have moved quickly to implement the EOs. For example, EPA has eliminated its Office of Environmental Justice and Civil Rights, placed 168 employees involved with EJ work on leave (then subsequently reinstated some of them), canceled hundreds of grants designed to fund EJ projects, and removed EJScreen—its hallmark EJ mapping and screening tool that has existed for almost a decade—from its website. In late January, the Department of Energy (DOE) directed the suspension of all initiatives requiring, using, or enforcing community benefits plans designed to direct the benefits from federal investments to workers and communities, including in binding contracts the previous DOE administration had entered into with grantees.

In February, the Department of Justice (DOJ) terminated its Office of Environmental Justice. In one of her first actions as U.S. Attorney General, Pam Bondi ordered each component of DOJ to confirm the termination of all EJ programs, offices, and jobs by March 15, and rescind all prior EJ policies, directives, and guidance within two days. In April, DOJ terminated its first EJ-focused settlement agreement with the Alabama Department of Public Health and Lowndes County under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 addressing alleged inequities in access to basic sanitation services. The agreement required the state to, among other things, conduct a comprehensive assessment of appropriate septic and wastewater management systems and suspend the criminal enforcement of sanitation laws where violations were based on a failure to afford basic septic systems. At the same time, the fate of all DOJ and EPA disparate impact regulations under Title VI hang in the balance as the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana—after enjoining EPA and DOJ from these regulations in the state of Louisiana—considers whether or not to vacate the regulations in their entirety.

Implications for the Regulated Community

The reversal of EJ policies, even if somewhat anticipated, nonetheless puts the regulated community—particularly companies operating in states with standalone EJ laws on the books and companies that recently ramped up their EJ efforts in response to Biden-era policies—in a precarious position. States have continued implementing and enforcing their EJ laws and policies. We may see an increase in state EJ activity, NGO advocacy, and litigation in an attempt to fill the void created by the new administration. At the same time, the administration has warned state agencies not to use federal dollars to advance EJ programs. The administration has also set a precedent of threatening to pull—and actually withholding—federal funds from entities that do not comply with its anti-DEI policies—and could do the same with EJ. The administration could also target EJ laws in a similar fashion to its recently-filed challenges to laws in New York and Vermont relating to climate change.

This landscape affords little predictability, certainty, or clarity regarding how the regulated community should act when facing conflicts between state and federal directives on EJ. Ultimately, how the federal government engages with independent state EJ laws remains to be seen. Early signs, however, suggest that the federal government may not impede states from implementing their own independent EJ laws and policies—as long as federal funding is not involved. For example, EPA Region 2 recently upheld a Clean Air Act Title V major source permit issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection that contains EJ requirements stemming from New Jersey’s 2020-era landmark EJ law. At the same time, failure to comply with applicable state or local laws and regulations could result in immediate adverse consequences, such as an enforcement response or permit-denial—even as the federal government continues to dismantle EJ programs and policies.

Some situations may present novel questions for businesses operating consistent with state EJ programs. For instance, EO 14173 requires federal contractors to certify that they do not have DEI programs, and DOJ recently launched an enforcement initiative targeting recipients of federal funding that have DEI policies. Could abiding by state EJ mandates implicate this requirement? Or could federal funding, or some other link to federal law (such as a joint federal-state enforcement action) change the applicable legal analysis? The possibility that the federal government may take further steps with respect to state EJ programs may also raise concerns for those participating in such programs.

Although companies should be aware of these issues, they should continue to stay engaged in community relations efforts to mitigate oppositional risks, smooth the way for project development, and cultivate meaningful relationships with communities. At its core, EJ is fundamentally about being a good neighbor—something that can only be good for business.",https://www.bdlaw.com/content/uploads/2025/06/Environmental-Justice-Marquee-Image-community-areal-view-default-social-share-social-sharing-image-22364.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 00:00:45.217409

Electric utilities have cited federal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions, as well as emissions of toxic metals, for retiring coal power plants.
But they will no longer be forced to shut down coal plants due to federal emissions regulations.
The power plant rules were immediately mired in lawsuits, while the EPA oscillated in imposing the rules between the first Trump and Biden administrations.
“EPA is proposing that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the statute,” the agency said.","by Dustin Bleizeffer, WyoFile

The Trump administration announced Wednesday plans to repeal “all ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions standards for the power sector,” as well as Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxins Standards “that directly result in coal-fired power plants having to shut down,” the federal agency said.

“These Biden-era regulations have imposed massive costs on coal-, oil- and gas-fired power plants, raising the cost of living for American families, imperiling the reliability of our electric grid and limiting American energy prosperity,” the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said in a press release Wednesday afternoon.

Wyoming politicians and coal proponents cheered the news.

“Today, I welcome the proposed repeal by the EPA of the so-called Clean Power Plan Version 2 that [EPA] Administrator Lee Zeldin and I have discussed over the past several months, and I encourage him to proceed with it with all due urgency,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a prepared statement. “The lopsided and misguided policies of the Biden administration have already wreaked enough havoc on our nation’s power supply and delayed our progress providing the beautiful clean coal President Donald Trump recognizes as essential to having a reliable, affordable and dispatchable energy supply for our nation.”

Wyoming is the nation’s largest coal producer, and more than 90% of the commodity is shipped to coal-burning electric generating plants in the U.S. The state’s coal mining industry has declined precipitously since 2008, while many communities that rely on mining — as well as coal power plants — have struggled to chart an economic future.

Electric utilities have cited federal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions, as well as emissions of toxic metals, for retiring coal power plants. But they’ve also pointed to cheap natural gas as an alternative at the same facilities and the fact that most coal plants in the nation are simply too old to affordably operate.

If utilities still choose to close down a coal-fired power plant due to aging facilities or to cater to customer preferences for renewables and other cleaner forms of energy, “that’s on them,” EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western told WyoFile. But they will no longer be forced to shut down coal plants due to federal emissions regulations.

“This [repeal] gives those utilities the ability to turn around and say, ‘We now don’t have to deal with the regulations that were putting us in these really difficult situations,’ where they’re having to increase these utility bills by 20%, by 30% you know, which, obviously, we saw in Wyoming,” said Western, a Republican and former Wyoming lawmaker. “These regulated, required shutdowns are no longer a fact. That is a priority of [EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin] and the White House — to ensure that we keep these open. And if [some are] shutting down purely for economic reasons, it’s not because it’s the EPA breathing down their necks and forcing them to introduce early shutdowns.”

The repeal

EPA intends to repeal what’s commonly referred to as the “power plant rules” first established under the Obama administration. The original rules were based on the premise that greenhouse gases that contribute to the climate crisis are a pollutant, and the Obama administration admitted that the more stringent standards would require existing and new coal-fired power plants to employ carbon capture technologies to meet them.

The power plant rules were immediately mired in lawsuits, while the EPA oscillated in imposing the rules between the first Trump and Biden administrations. The U.S. Supreme Court in October declined to halt the EPA rules in the last months of the Biden administration, making Wyoming officials nervous right before the November presidential election.

Now, under President Donald Trump, the EPA is challenging the long-held notion that greenhouse gas emissions from power plants should be considered a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, according to the agency.

“EPA is proposing that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the statute,” the agency said.

Western added, “The people of Wyoming want affordable, reliable electricity — and they deserve it. Protecting access to low-cost, dependable power ensures families can keep the lights on without breaking the bank.”

The results affirm Hounen Solar’s ability to deliver modules that don’t just meet expectations—but exceed them in the face of extreme weather.

Raising the Bar in Hail Resilience

Hail damage represents a growing concern for PV installations in many U.S. regions, particularly as weather volatility increases. PVEL’s HSS test replicates real-world hail events far beyond standard IEC testing, firing 45 mm ice balls at terminal velocity (30.7 m/s)—each impact transferring more than 20 joules of energy to the module surface.

Hounen Solar’s module emerged from the test with exceptionally low power loss (just 0.57%), no glass or cell fractures, and no electrical failures, such as open circuits or bypass diode damage. Post-test insulation resistance reached 12,916 MΩ·m², substantially outperforming the baseline IEC 61215:2021 standard.

“These results speak to the robustness of our module design and the discipline behind our quality control systems,” said Guo Min, Technical Director at Hounen Solar America. “We’re building more than efficiency—we’re building long-term, high-performance assets.”

Technology Built for Real-World Challenges

The tested HNM7-SHDB144-550/M module reflects a blend of innovation and durability. Designed for utility-scale and C&I applications, its specifications include:

10BB bifacial monocrystalline PERC cells

Up to 21.48% front-side efficiency

Up to 25% rear-side gain, enhancing total energy yield

Excellent PID resistance and superior low-light response

Certifications including IEC 61730, UL 61730, and compliance with ISO 9001, 14001, and 45001

Manufactured at Hounen’s facility in Orangeburg, South Carolina, the module meets domestic content requirements for IRA-aligned projects and is optimized for performance in high-stress field environments.

A Step Forward for U.S. Solar Manufacturing

With this achievement, Hounen Solar joins a select group of manufacturers whose products are not only domestically assembled but independently verified to deliver durability in harsh conditions.

The rapid clip of expansion is partially due to falling battery manufacturing costs, with Rystad Energy predicting this trend to continue over the next five to seven years amid ongoing design improvements.

Rystad Energy estimates that this growth will continue, predicting an increased installation rate of approximately 16 GW per year by early 2026.

As energy demand rises in the US due to increased electrification, grid resilience will continue to be critical, with batteries playing a key role in meeting this need, along with both traditional and renewable energy sources. The US grid-scale BESS market delivered a very healthy growth of around 60% in 2024, rising from six gigawatts (GW) of capacity added in 2023 to 10 GW of installations. Planned inventory is a very strong leading indicator of actual capacity additions and we believe this rate of growth will create increased annual battery demand for grid-scale BESS

Learn more with Rystad Energy’s Renewables & Power Solution.States that are witnessing the highest levels of BESS market growth are Texas and Arizona, with the California market stabilizing last year. Texas became the largest US BESS market in 2024 and currently exhibits an installation rate of around four GW per annum – similar to California. Contrary to California, the BESS inventory in Texas has increased from five GW to more than seven GW in the last 12 months, pointing to a likely further increase in installations this year.

Notwithstanding the growth in Texas, it is the rest of the country that is currently experiencing a BESS boom. Led by Arizona, the BESS inventory across all emerging US markets grew from three GW in the second quarter of last year to seven GW currently. The actual installation rate currently stands at around three GW – perfectly in line with the inventory level 12 months ago. While some construction delays are expected, there is no doubt that these emerging markets will drive most of the growth in the second half of this year and first half of next year, and even beyond.

In the most mature markets, batteries play an increasingly important role during peak power demand periods as they ‘extend’ solar generation curves into evening hours. In the last 90 days, batteries have satisfied 13% of the power demand of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) during battery discharge hours. Although the trend is new, the days of batteries delivering more than 16% of electricity during discharge hours are becoming increasingly common. While the average contribution during all discharge hours stands at around 13%, the typical peak contribution during discharge hours is already close to 30%. The 90-day average peak hour contribution currently stands at 26%, adding 10 percentage points over the last 12 months.

Looking at the share of CAISO power demand satisfied by renewables – mainly solar, wind and hydro – we observed that the annual average increased from less than 30% in 2021 to more than 40% in the last 12 months. While the peak of renewable contribution in springtime is growing each year – renewables met more than 65% of daily demand on some days this year, for instance – winter dips remain similar, with renewables delivering only 20% to 25% of demand. As a result, renewables integration has to date only been able to reduce CAISO’s dependency on energy imports, which have declined from around 27% to about 16% of system demand in the last four years.

As both BESS and solar PV installed capacity continue to grow in California, it is important to remember two things in particular: which power system challenges are being addressed by batteries, and what batteries cannot really help with. Whether it is theoretically possible to have all renewable plus BESS systems in CAISO and what kind of overbuild – and economic implications for project developers and end consumers – will be associated with it remains to be seen

On June 9, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signed a proposed rule that, if approved, would grant Texas primary enforcement authority, or primacy, for permitting Class VI Underground Injection Control (UIC) wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). This significant regulatory change could expedite permitting for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in the state.

Four states — Louisiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming — have received Class VI primacy to date. Most recently, EPA proposed granting Arizona primacy for all well classes, with a final rule anticipated after the public comment period ends on July 3, 2025.

Proposed Rule: Class VI Primacy for Texas

The SDWA covers six classes of injection wells, each designed for specific purposes: Class I for deep waste disposal; Class II for oil and gas production fluids (commonly known as Enhanced Oil Recovery or EOR); Class III for mineral extraction; Class IV for hazardous waste in groundwater cleanup; Class V for non-hazardous fluid disposal; and Class VI for carbon dioxide storage. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality already has primacy over Class I, III, IV, and V wells. The Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) — the state agency with jurisdiction over the oil, gas, and pipeline industry — has Class II primacy.

If the proposed rule is approved, the TRC would be the state agency charged with permitting Class VI carbon storage injection wells under the SDWA. Texas’s petition for Class VI primacy follows an April 29, 2025, memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the TRC and EPA, which outlines the state’s plans for administering its Class VI well programs. Following a review of the state’s program, EPA determined that Texas’s Class VI program meets all requirements for approval, ensuring consistent implementation and enforcement under the SDWA.

Texas officials expressed support for the proposed rule, touting the potential for primacy to create greater efficiency when permitting and deploying Class VI wells in the state.

EPA is inviting public comments on the proposed rule within 45 days after it is published in the Federal Register and will hold a public hearing on July 24, 2025. Interested stakeholders can take advantage of these opportunities to interact with regulators and express concerns or support for the rule.

A Broader Trend: Other States Pursuing Primacy

Earlier this year, EPA approved Class VI primacy for West Virginia. Several states — including Alaska, Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, Nebraska, and Utah — are actively pursuing Class VI primacy or revising existing Class VI programs. Additionally, as noted above, EPA’s proposed rule granting Arizona primacy is under consideration and subject to public comment until July 3, 2025.

These efforts reflect a growing recognition of the importance of state-level management in advancing CCS projects. By obtaining primacy, states can tailor regulatory frameworks to their specific needs, potentially leading to more effective and efficient project permitting, project implementation, and emissions reductions.

WHITING — BP has suspended its plans to produce blue hydrogen at its Whiting refinery, citing economic uncertainty, a sluggish hydrogen market in the Midwest and “lack of certainty for long-term federal government support for low carbon hydrogen.”

The project was part of the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen, or MachH2, a coalition involving Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. The group was selected by the Biden administration in 2023 to receive up to $1 billion in federal funding to develop one of seven regional clean hydrogen hubs.

Blue hydrogen is made through converting natural gas into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, with the CO2 captured and stored underground. The low-carbon fuel has potential uses in industries such as power, steel, and agriculture.

BP said in a statement that it remains committed to its operations in northwest Indiana but is indefinitely pausing the hydrogen effort at Whiting.

A key challenge has been the inability to identify a suitable site for carbon storage. A BP spokesperson said that storing captured CO2 is essential for developing blue hydrogen. The company has been exploring potential sites in several counties, including Benton County, where local opposition has emerged over safety concerns.

U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan, D-Highland, previously said the MachH2 project could create roughly 16,000 jobs and attract up to $6 billion in private investment.

But momentum has stalled. In November, MachH2 received $22.2 million in initial federal funding to support infrastructure development and workforce training. Since then, progress has slowed, and officials in northwest Indiana say the project remains in limbo.

After taking office in January, Pres. Donald Trump signed an executive order to “unleash American energy,” which included a freeze on funding for hydrogen hubs under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Last month, Mrvan and Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., sent a letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright urging the administration to prioritize the Indiana hub.

“The Engine Technology Forum welcomes EPA’s announcement today of the establishment of a robust and growth oriented renewable fuels policy. The policy will boost our American energy portfolio, where fuels from below the ground and those from above the ground are valuable and contribute to our energy security and sustainability.

“Today’s proposed rule was boosted by the coming together of the renewable fuels and petroleum sectors around shared goals and vision for meeting our increasing demands for energy. ETF joined fuels industry leaders in supporting the call for a minimum of 5.25 billion gallon biomass-based diesel volume, and EPA delivered more.

“Advanced engines and renewable fuels together are a sustainable solution for power and mobility. Internal combustion engines are key to both producing our renewable and traditional fuels and realizing the benefits from them to power key sectors of our economy. Biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, and ethanol already play a vital role in our nation’s transportation system and key industries. Thanks to this proposal, that role will be expanded in the future.

“Today’s welcome action by Administrator Zeldin ends a period of stagnation and uncertainty for fuels needed to help power our agriculture and transportation sectors in the future. We look forward to working with our members and EPA on the many important details of the proposal on the road to a final rule.”

In a report issued May 22, the GAO stated the USDOT’s deferral of these $5.4 billion in funds meant for building EV charging stations, issued under the Biden-era National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, violated a provision of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a federal law that regulates the president’s ability to withhold funds approved by Congress.

The White House Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to USDOT on June 3 instructing the department to disregard the GAO’s opinion on the NEVI funds, according to a June 4 report from Politico.

The OMB and USDOT did not respond to separate requests from Equipment World for a copy of the memo.

Politico quoted Mark Paoletta, OMB’s general counsel, in the memo as saying the GAO’s opinion was “wrong and legally indefensible” and that the USDOT does not need to “take any action to adjust the recording of its NEVI program obligations, nor change its practices with respect to obligating funds for any of its [Federal Highway Administration] programs in response to GAO’s incorrect opinion.”

The GAO, which serves as a bipartisan investigative arm of Congress, gave the following rationale in its May 22 report for why the funds could not legally be deferred:

“Under the ICA, a section referred to as the fourth disclaimer prohibits withholding from obligation or expenditure funds appropriated for programs where there is a mandate to spend therefor. We conclude that the NEVI Formula Program is covered by the fourth disclaimer. Therefore, DOT is not authorized to withhold these funds from expenditure and DOT must continue to carry out the statutory requirements of the program.”

The GAO did point out USDOT can find other ways to rescind the funds, though they must be approved by Congress. The GAO does not have the legal ability to enforce its findings, and the USDOT is not required to immediately unfreeze the NEVI funds.

Rescinding policies and programs that support EVs was an immediate goal for President Donald Trump’s administration.

Yet these price fluctuations do not necessarily represent a broader decline in the PPA space, nor a diminishment of the value of renewable power in the European energy mix.
“In Iceland, we’ve seen a large geothermal PPA, but [not] in continental Europe, where geothermal resources are not the same.
“What’s nice about PPAs is that, essentially, a PPA is a contract between two different parties,” said Brihi.
“You see that PPAs as produced are not as common and offtakers and corporates need complex PPA delivery methods.","The growing role of PPAs has been demonstrated by figures published before this year’s procurement summit. According to Pexapark, Europe announced offtake deals for 1.6GW and 1.4GW of renewable capacity in March and April, respectively, with Europe contracting more than double the renewable power capacity in March than in the previous month.

However, the price of these deals has fluctuated more dramatically. Pexapark reports that its EURO Composite, an average of the prices secured for PPAs signed in Europe, fell 1.6% between March and April this year, with significant month-on-month price declines of 6.8% in Poland, 2.6% in Belgium and 2.2% in Germany.

Yet these price fluctuations do not necessarily represent a broader decline in the PPA space, nor a diminishment of the value of renewable power in the European energy mix. Instead, they reflect what Nahel Brihi, corporate sustainability analyst at Bloomberg, told PV Tech Premium at this year’s Renewables Procurement & Revenue Summit was an increasing interest in signing PPAs for smaller capacities of renewable power, and for lower prices, with deals more tailored to the markets in which they are signed.

“I think as the sector evolves, PPAs will inevitably evolve with them, and then it becomes that challenge of how to develop [PPAs] and communicate them effectively to buyers so they can negotiate or share the risk,” explained Brihi. “PPAs will change as the macro environment changes.”

European PPA trends

When asked about this shift towards more tailored PPAs, Brihi added that he has seen more complex and nuanced deals signed, both in the global renewable sector in general, and European clean power in particular.

“We’re definitely seeing those trends in terms of co-located or hybrid PPAs – by co-located we just mean a mix of technologies – and we see this growing trend, especially in the US, which is the biggest market for green corporate PPAs in general,” he said, noting that Bloomberg tracked 740MW of off-site hybrid deals in Europe in 2024, compared to 17GW in the US.

Still, he noted that European PPAs can be “interesting”, as they seek to combine several financial and policy mechanisms to ensure producers and offtakers alike are comfortable with the terms of their agreement.

“In Europe, for example, what’s quite interesting is that, in the UK, we saw on the first PPA that was blended with a contract for difference (CfD),” Brihi said. “We are seeing more cross-border PPAs in Europe, which is a very good market for these sorts of things.”

The diversity in the types of deal being signed in Europe is reflected in the diversity of companies now involved in the European PPA space. Olivier de Nomazy, head of energy sourcing and market intelligence at French data centre operator DATA4, told PV Tech Premium at this year’s Renewables Procurement & Revenue event that recent fluctuations in power prices had all but obligated DATA4 to involve itself in the PPA space.

“It’s fair to say that three to four years ago, we were nowhere in PPAs, we were just buying electricity from suppliers in a very traditional manner,” said de Nomazy, whose comments are available in full above.

“The volatility of prices has pushed us to reconsider our approach. Besides, we also have very big and growing demands; I think year-on-year our consumption has been growing by a 30% average between 2023 and 2024.”

However, de Nomazy also noted that PPAs, in their current form, are not a perfect means to deliver on the goals of the energy transition in a manner that reliably meets the power demands of offtakers. While speaking on another panel at the event, he pointed to Spain as an example of a country where, despite the financial security of a PPA, the threat of curtailment means that he does not consider pureplay solar offtake agreements viable.

“Spain, for example, right now is the prime example of getting close to saturation when it comes to corporate deals and renewable additions in general,” added Brihi, who pointed to the recent Iberian blackouts as an example of a region’s broader energy environment undermining some of the security that a PPA can offer. “That could prompt both sellers and buyers to maybe take a step back and diversify their portfolios.”

Stability through multi-technology PPAs and battery storage integration

A key tool for diversifying offtake portfolios, and reducing reliance on a single technology type in a single market, is to invest in multi-technology PPAs. Brihi noted that while it is challenging to forecast what hybrid PPAs will look like on a scale as broad as Europe as a whole, he said that he was “really excited” about the future of multi-technology deals in markets across the continent.

“I don’t know what it’s going to look like in Europe,” said Brihi, who noted that “we might see the first nuclear PPA in France, which would be really exciting.

“In Iceland, we’ve seen a large geothermal PPA, but [not] in continental Europe, where geothermal resources are not the same. We might see more hydro PPAs; I know, at some point, there were a few small hydro deals being signed, and that would be really interesting too.”

When asked about battery storage systems, which are often linked to renewable power sources and heralded as a way to limit the uncertainty that can arise from relying on more variable renewable power, de Nomazy was keen to stress that, in his opinion, batteries are useful up to a certain point.

“We see batteries as a very good solution to deliver peak production, and work on demand management sorts of things to support the grid,” de Nomazy said, whose comments are available in full above. “At the level of price that we have in Spain, for example, we cannot consider the batteries are a good way to transform the solar curve into the baseload curve, which is the ideal product that we would like to buy.”

Unsurprisingly, predictability remains the priority for offtakers, with many interested in matching power procurement to baseload, and securing this electricity consistently, rather than investing in a particular technology type. Magdalena Hilgner, head of energy department at Polish telecoms company PLAY, told PV Tech Premium as much during last year’s Large Scale Solar Central Eastern Europe event, and this sentiment was echoed by Karim Rizk, business development manager at TokWise, which provides software and AI models for the renewable energy industry.

“I think the right word would be ‘volatility’,” he said, speaking to PV Tech Premium at the Renewables Procurement & Revenue summit. He went on to suggest that investing in multi-technology PPAs is one way to tackle this volatility, but there are other steps that can be taken, including more nuanced financial mechanisms and the use of AI tools to better manage power purchasing.

“The idea is for every market player to find a way to manage that [volatility],” Rizk said. “On the PPA side, you see a lot of settlement closes now negotiated on how they’re going to handle the negative prices.”

Securing stability through market mechanisms

Brihi also spoke to this idea of using more nuanced financial tools to deliver the kind of stability that offtakers value.

“What’s nice about PPAs is that, essentially, a PPA is a contract between two different parties,” said Brihi. “Right now, what we’re seeing is that there are more elements that keep getting added in the contracting process, which can make things more difficult, but it shows that PPAs evolve.”

When asked about the deals his own company has agreed, de Nozomy pointed to a ten-year PPA signed with Edison Energia to acquire electricity generated at a 148MW project in Italy. The contracted power alone will account for one-tenth of the company’s electricity consumption in its Italian operations, and de Nozomy suggested that the flexibility of both companies involved in the PPA discussions was a key reason for the deal’s completion.

“Edison showed good flexibility, because the deal [includes] ramp-up scenarios so it accompanies our growth expanding the size of the PPA over time: starting slightly small and growing during the six or seven first years of the contract,” said de Nozomy. “They were also integrated with their supply contract in an easy manner.”

According to Rizk, the increasing appetite for PPA deals, and the increasingly close relations between independent power producers (IPPs) supplying this power and the offtakers keen to acquire power in increasingly tailored and specific manners, means that IPPs are starting to resemble energy suppliers.

“At the end of the day it’s a strategic decision for IPPs to move in that direction; it’s not just a one-off thing,” said Rizk, whose comments are available in full above.

“IPPs usually have a view of the next ten, 15 years, and we see that IPPs want to move to being energy suppliers, so that’s the motivation behind [the thinking]: ‘okay, we need to have this kind of capability, and since we have the tools that enable us, we can do that.’

“If you have that kind of capability, you will also have the opportunity to offer more complex products,” he continued, referring once again to increasing PPA complexity in Europe. “You see that PPAs as produced are not as common and offtakers and corporates need complex PPA delivery methods. If you don’t have the capability on how to manage the residual volume you have, or the shortage you have, on the short-term market, you will not be able to offer such products.”

“We need to have a very tailored, very accurate view on every single detail of those PPAs,” agreed de Nozomy, who went on to describe the increasingly close relations between IPPs and offtakers as an “interesting” space, that suggests the future of the European PPA space could be one of close personal relationships and more compelx financial mechanisms.

“Seeing the supplier getting into those PPAs is interesting because, as a supplier, they do monitor our consumption on a daily manner so they can anticipate and understand our needs almost as good as we do,” de Nozomy said. “That’s why working with those guys is quite useful.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54550204917_75708b5443_k.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 00:00:18.321171

The thermal power arm of India's Adani Group, Adani Power, has set up a Middle Eastern arm in Abu Dhabi. Given the number of renewable schemes in the Gulf, it might have been expected the renewables arm Adani Green Energy would have moved in. But the renewables market is highly competitive in the Gulf. The thermal market is not.

While there are plenty of bidders for renewable schemes, there are not for the new baseload gas-fired capacity, which is clearly needed in the region. It is unclear what Adani Power Middle East will be up to but there is certainly a need for new blood in that market.

In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland PJM region covering 13 US states and the District of Columbia, the development of new gas-fired plant has stalled after a fruitful decade in the 2010s.

The fact that prices in the latest capacity market auction jumped 800% from US$28.92/MW-day to US$269.92/MW-day for the 2025/26 delivery period should certainly send a development signal. But thus far just Calpine has come out and said it will look to develop new gas-fired generation, although it states clarity is needed on state-level air emission regulations.

In the meantime existing generators will make hay while the sun shines. Four term loan B refinancings have been put to bed since the auction, and stock prices are up for existing generators. LS Power has pooled all its gas-fired assets across PJM, ISO-NE, and NYISO into one 11GW unit Lightning Power and quickly raised a competitive debt financing.

The cost of the latest auction is US$14.7bn, up from US$2.2bn in the 2024/25 delivery period. Oops.

There are some specific factors that made the PJM capacity increase so much higher than would normally be expected. New Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules in late 2019 impacted the way the PJM auction process was conducted and since then there have been plenty of new changes. The latest auction was the first in two years, a catch-up auction. Another auction is planned in December and then the normal auction schedule should return.

But a further specific factor is extreme weather events. But is this really a PJM specific event? Winter Storm Elliott in late 2022 saw 23% of the PJM generation capacity out of action so FERC called for better risk-monitoring of assets winning capacity contracts during extreme weather events.

The poor performance during the storm has been put down to the fact renewable subsidiaries in the region increased the headline generation figure, lowered capacity market prices but not capacity during cold and hot days. That said, renewable industry proponents say it was the gas-fired plants that really failed, froze up, during the storm. Maybe both are to blame.

Of course a key issue has been supply and demand – the ongoing retirement of coal-based load plant with new capacity not filling the gap due to transmission constraints and economics, that is higher construction and interest costs.

Capacity market payments are on the rise across the world. In the UK, prices have doubled. The 15-year T-4 capacity market cleared at £65/kw/year earlier this year, up from a record high of £63/kW/yr in the 2023 auction, £30.60/kW/yr the previous year and £18/kw/yr in 2020. That said, as in PJM, thus far only the existing generators have benefited. In 2022 a host of new gas-fired power plants were proposed, 3.5GW in total. But none have since been built.

The previous UK government started to raise the possibility of building new base load gas-fired plant, simply because the supply demand numbers do not add up in the next five to 10 years. Whether the new Labour Government follows this lead will be interesting. It could opt for the German solution and say 10GW of new gas-fired plant will be hydrogen fuelled at some time in the future.

Various solutions are, of course, needed. Renewable generation linked with storage is one. In PJM the new services queue is made up of 94% renewables. But in its report ""Energy Transition in PJM – Resource retirements, replacements and risks,"" PJM said given the ""operating characteristics of these resources, we need multiple megawatts of these resources to replace 1MW of thermal generation"".

In PJM 40GW of existing generation could be offline by 2030.",https://media.pfie.com/prod/images/gm_preview/e3b1e87716be-us-gas-power.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 11:08:14.680005

“Targeted tax credits supporting domestic production and clean energy innovation have helped accelerate private-sector growth across the state.","69,000 jobs and $58 billion in investments in Arizona in jeopardy without federal tax credits

Arizona Senator Mark Kelly joined Governor Katie Hobbs, Arizona elected officials, and business leaders in opposing provisions in Trump and House Republicans’ budget bill that would jeopardize Arizona’s economic momentum as a hub for innovation in energy, clean tech, and manufacturing industries by rolling back critical tax credits created in the Inflation Reduction Act.

“Arizona has worked to make sure we’re a great place to do business—with the help of both Democrats and Republicans over the years. Because of this we’ve benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits. We see it in the big solar and battery storage projects bringing low-cost, reliable power to the grid and in the dozens of companies who have invested to bring manufacturing here, creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Republicans’ plan to cut these programs will put thousands of Arizonans out of work and make energy prices go up. I’m working with Governor Hobbs and others to stop the bad Republican plan and protect Arizona’s economy,” said Sen. Kelly.

“Trump and House Republicans promised to make life affordable. Instead, they’re actively cutting jobs. This isn’t just a tax plan—it’s a direct assault on Arizonans who simply want to get ahead and provide for their families. Slashing clean energy tax credit jeopardizes billions in investments by stalling our state’s economic momentum,” said Sen. Gallego.

“If clean energy tax credits are repealed, Arizona loses out on tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and families’ energy bills go up,” said Rep. Stanton. “I want the industries of the future here in Arizona, not overseas.”

“What we have seen so far from the Trump Administration and House Republicans has been chaos and now they want to further jeopardize Arizona’s economy with cuts to jobs and historic investments,” said Rep. Ansari. “This is just bad policy. I’ll continue to work with my colleagues to secure Arizona’s investments and future.”

“The Arizona Promise is built on creating opportunities for working-class Arizonans and growing our economy,” said Gov. Hobbs. “Over the last three years, Arizona’s economy has boomed, and business investment and job creation have accelerated by leveraging federal tax credits created in the IRA. Since its passage, Arizona’s economy has attracted 134 existing, potential, and announced projects that would be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits. These projects together represent more than 69,000 existing and potential new jobs, and $58 billion in capital investment to grow the state’s advanced manufacturing, energy, technology, and infrastructure industries. The federal government should be working with us in furthering Arizona’s economic success, not undermining our growth.”

Arizona Investments secured in the Kelly-shaped Inflation Reduction Act that are now at risk:

These tax incentives have created historic investments in economic and workforce development around Arizona. Through growth in energy, advanced manufacturing, and other improvements in supply chains and innovation, these federal investments are growing and maintaining Arizona’s energy and tech economy. The Arizona Commerce Authority, which leads economic development efforts, has found repealing the tax incentives for energy infrastructure and manufacturing could jeopardize:

$58 billion in potential, existing, and announced private-sector investment in Arizona and 69,000 potential new jobs created.

134 project leads attracted to communities statewide.

The Clean Energy Buyers Association has also projected an 11.4% increase in annual electricity bills per household by 2029 if the Republican-led bill is enacted.

See what other Arizona leaders are saying:

“Arizona’s competitive edge in advanced manufacturing is no accident—it’s the result of smart policy, strategic investment, and strong partnerships,” said Danny Seiden, President and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry. “Targeted tax credits supporting domestic production and clean energy innovation have helped accelerate private-sector growth across the state. Preserving them is critical to sustaining Arizona’s manufacturing momentum and keeping us at the forefront of next-generation industries.”

“We are investing billions of dollars in Queen Creek and look forward to creating high quality jobs in Arizona, as we bring our advanced manufacturing expertise and experience to the United States. We hope Congress will endorse the current tax credit that will help secure a strategic U.S. supply chain and to manufacture leading-edge batteries in Arizona,” said Richard Ra, President of LG Energy Solution Arizona.

“Continuation of 45X and other clean energy policies give businesses like Lucid certainty to deepen our investments in U.S. production and the communities where we operate. These pro-manufacturing, pro-clean energy, pro-worker policies support our commitment to Arizona and the U.S. as we create good-paying jobs, expand American high-tech manufacturing, develop domestic supply chains, and export more automobiles to foreign markets,” said Jessica Nigro, VP of External Affairs of Lucid Motors.

“With our highly skilled workforce, reliable energy, and attractive business environment, Arizona has been a big winner for advanced manufacturing projects receiving investments under the Inflation Reduction Act,” said Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “Phasing out or eliminating these financial programs could seriously jeopardize projects in our pipeline as well as those that have already selected Arizona.”

“Arizona leads the nation in building a clean energy economy that attracts investments, creates jobs, lowers costs, improves air quality, and saves water. A repeal of these tax credits will hurt Arizona workers, communities, and businesses,” said Maren Mahoney, Director of the Arizona Governor’s Office of Resiliency. “Without these federal investments in clean energy technology, Arizona families stand to lose out on good-paying jobs in manufacturing and construction, and risk even higher energy bills.”",https://www.kelly.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Kelly_Logo_Social.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 00:00:21.545686

Tri Pointe Homes now includes its “LivingSmart” package in every house it sells in the region. Standard items range from dual-zone HVAC and formaldehyde-free insulation to WaterSense faucets and pre-wired electric-vehicle chargers.

“You’re gonna save about 30% on your heating and cooling bills,” said James Flanagan, vice president of community experience at Tri Pointe Homes.

Mary Blevins and her husband, Ron Colello, moved latt year into a LivingSmart home in Pittsboro.

“I would say we saved anywhere from $75 to $90 a month,” Blevins said. “We’ve had gas bills as low as $15 in the summer.”

Their favorite upgrade is a tankless natural-gas water heater.

“You don’t run out of water,” Blevins said. “You can do the clothes, the dishwasher, the showers, all at the same time. It’s extremely efficient.”

Residential buildings account for about 20% of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Flanagan said cutting that footprint is good for business, too. Energy-saving perks have helped push Tri Pointe’s Triangle sales up 20% in the past year.

Even older houses can benefit from small changes. Raising the thermostat two degrees when residents are away can trim about 6% from a cooling bill. Replacing incandescent bulbs with LEDs can cut lighting energy by roughly 75%.

Statewide Economic Boost: $20B Amazon investment expected to create 1,250 jobs and accelerate energy infrastructure modernization.

Amazon has expanded its nuclear energy partnership with Talen Energy, securing 1,920 megawatts of carbon-free power to support its growing AI and cloud infrastructure needs. The electricity will be sourced from Talen’s Susquehanna nuclear plant and delivered under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) through 2042, with potential for extension.

Talen President and CEO Mac McFarland called the agreement a “long-term, steady source of revenue,” adding, “We remain a first mover in this space and intend to continue to execute on our data center strategy. Talen is well-positioned to support Amazon’s energy needs as it invests further in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

The deal also sets the stage for future innovation, as Amazon and Talen will explore the deployment of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and capacity expansion at Susquehanna. These initiatives aim to inject new clean energy into the PJM grid, reinforcing Pennsylvania’s energy independence.

Amazon’s $20 billion investment in the state—the largest private sector commitment in its history—will create 1,250 high-skilled jobs. “Amazon is proud to help Pennsylvania advance AI innovation through investments in the Commonwealth’s economic and energy future,” said Kevin Miller, AWS VP of Global Data Centers.

The current co-located power arrangement will shift to a “front-of-the-meter” setup after a transmission reconfiguration in Spring 2026. From then, Susquehanna’s nuclear output will feed directly into the PJM grid, with PPL Electric Utilities managing transmission.

“Connecting large load customers like data centers to our transmission system helps lower the transmission component of energy bills for all customers,” said Christine Martin, president of PPL Electric Utilities.

Policymakers welcomed the deal as a catalyst for energy and economic growth:

“This partnership… will power the largest economic development project in Commonwealth history,” said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. “We stand ready to work with Talen Energy and its partners to review permits for this project as efficiently as possible.”

“Our communities will benefit not only from economic development but from the Susquehanna plant’s role as a major employer,” said U.S. Representative Dan Meuser (R-PA).

“Our members, friends, and families all benefit from the jobs and community growth this investment… will bring,” noted IBEW Local 1600.

The agency raised the levels 67% from 2025 to 5.61 billion gallons for 2026 and upped volumes to 5.86 billion gallons for 2027.

The levels for 2026 exceeded the industry’s recommendation of 5.25 billion gallons, according to Kurt Kovarik, Vice President, Federal Affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America:

“EPA’s math would indicate that the volume requirement for biomass -based diesel for 2026 is going to be about 5.6 billion gallons, which by any measure, if they’re close or in the ballpark, This is a significant step change from the 3.35 billion gallons that was mandated for biomass -based diesel for 2025, which is exactly what we asked for.”

Biofuels and Feed Stock Imports Discounted

To level the playing field, EPA is also discounting the value of the RIN credit by half for foreign biofuels imports or the use of foreign feed stocks.

“So, only 50% credit for a fuel that’s produced abroad and imported or a fuel that’s produced domestically from a foreign feed stock. And in this case, foreign is any country other than the United States. So even feed stocks from Canada and Mexico,” he explains.

EPA Decision Signals Growth

Both of these actions will send a huge message of growth to farmers and the industry, which is already producing biomass based diesel near these levels.

“This is a real recognition of the investments that have made in in feed stock development the investments made by soybean farmers the enormous expansion of capacity in renewable diesel and biodiesel production,” he adds.

Small Refinery Exemptions Could be Reallocated

While EPA did not deal with the backlog of 169 Small Refinery Exemptions in this proposal, the agency has signaled reallocation, a precedent set under the first Trump administration.

“So by estimating or committing to estimate those gallons and reallocate them. It means that biofuels producers will be held harmless the small refiners will get the Relief that they seek but those that those gallons or those that mandate won’t simply evaporate,” he says.

Meanwhile, the mandate for conventional corn-based ethanol will remain at 15 billion gallons for both years, which is in line with what the industry recommended.

This proposal now goes through a comment period but EPA has indicated they expect to have it finalized by November 1 at the latest.",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/39da5a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x720+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-farm-journal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fc1%2Fc8dd9b4d4fb598c3fd4786c0314f%2Fd4ae82ef07c942b8b45950e673683dd8%2Fposter.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 22:02:54.503086

The administration has proposed cutting funding for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s sprawling in-house research arm, by 5%, or $90 million, to $1.7 billion.
Even at current funding levels, those agencies have been beset by resignations and internal turmoil.
It also sustained current funding for NIFA’s $445 million Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), USDA’s prime source of competitive grants to academic researchers.
Such a step would likely block or at least complicate the administration’s plans for science spending and spare researchers a devastating blow—at least for now.","The Republican-controlled Congress this week offered the first signs that it will resist at least some of President Donald Trump’s proposals to slash federal spending on science. A key committee in the House of Representatives rejected the administration’s plan to make deep cuts to research programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the leader of the Senate’s appropriations panel called plans for a 40% cut to the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH’s) $47 billion budget “disturbing.” Members of another Senate committee also signaled bipartisan opposition to cuts at the U.S. Forest Service.

The clearest sign of unease with Trump’s plans came on 11 June, as the full House Committee on Appropriations met to begin finalizing its version of a bill that sets USDA’s spending for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins on 1 October. The administration has proposed cutting funding for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s sprawling in-house research arm, by 5%, or $90 million, to $1.7 billion. And it wants to cut the budget of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), a major source of funding for research done at universities, by 38%, or $642 million, to about $1 billion.

Even at current funding levels, those agencies have been beset by resignations and internal turmoil. At NIFA, for example, grant programs have not accepted new proposals since 23 January because all of the agency’s solicitations are “under review.” NIFA staffers were also recently told that a new USDA “efficiency team,” set up by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initially run by Elon Musk, will review all future recommended grants. DOGE “is now embedded in the system,” said one NIFA staffer.

Against that backdrop, the House panel opted to ignore the administration’s proposed cuts, instead keeping funding for both programs roughly flat: about $1.8 billion for ARS and $1.7 billion for NIFA. It also sustained current funding for NIFA’s $445 million Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), USDA’s prime source of competitive grants to academic researchers. The administration had proposed cutting AFRI by 9%, or $40 million.

In a report accompanying the bill, the committee also “rejects proposed research program terminations.” The language appears to refer to a proposal to shut down or relocate several major ARS research programs: the country’s soybean gene bank, which maintains a collection of thousands of varieties at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC); a citrus collection in Riverside, California; and a research station in Delaware dedicated to finding natural predators of invasive agricultural pests.

A USDA spokesperson defended the proposed cuts in an email, saying they target “research sites across the Nation that have exceeded their ideal lifespan.” But that claim is “just not true,” says crop scientist Adam Davis of UIUC. The ARS facilities at UIUC recently underwent renovation and had “received a facility condition rating of 96 out of 100” in a recent evaluation, he said.

Davis suspects the facilities were targeted because of partisan politics. “One is in Delaware, one is in Illinois, and one is in California,” he notes. Those are the respective home states of former presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, and former Vice President Kamala Harris—all Democrats.

The Republican-dominated House panel’s rejection of the USDA cuts came as a pleasant surprise to Julie McClure, vice president at the Torrey Advisory Group, a lobbying firm that represents the American Society of Agronomy and several farm organizations. She credits the bipartisan support that agricultural research has long enjoyed in Congress. “Part of that is because a lot of land-grant universities, where this research is done, are in Republican districts and states.”

In the Senate, key Republicans pushed back on White House plans for a much bigger cut, in NIH funding, at a 10 June hearing of the appropriations subcommittee that sets the agency’s budget. Senator Susan Collins (R–ME), who chairs the full appropriations committee, called the proposed $18 billion cut “so disturbing” and said “it would undo years of congressional investment in NIH and it would delay or stop effective treatments and cures.” Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R–WV), head of the subcommittee, noted that “supporting biomedical research is a priority for me. … [I]t is important that America remains the leader in biomedical innovation and research.”

At an 11 June hearing held by a different Senate spending panel, lawmakers expressed bipartisan concerns about a White House request to cut the Forest Service’s budget by 65%, or $4 billion, to $2.1 billion, and eliminate the agency’s $300 million research program. Senator Jeff Merkley (D–OR) was particularly critical. “Instead of slashing these programs,” he said, “we should be investing in good science.”

Congress is still in the early stages of crafting the 2026 budget, and it’s not clear whether lawmakers will ultimately agree to ignore or soften some requested cuts. There are also increasing signs that Congress and the White House will be unable to agree on final 2026 spending numbers by 30 September, when the current fiscal year ends. In that event, lawmakers would likely pass a continuing resolution that freezes spending at current levels, possibly for up to a full year. Such a step would likely block or at least complicate the administration’s plans for science spending and spare researchers a devastating blow—at least for now.

Science advocates note even that outcome would not undo the damage they say the Trump administration has already done to many science agencies by terminating or delaying grants and contracts and firing or pushing out staff. At NIFA, about one-quarter of the program’s staff have taken the administration’s “deferred resignation” offer and left their jobs, according to former NIFA Director Sonny Ramaswamy. And according to a May report in Politico, more than 15% of ARS staff has resigned. “Lots of people are looking to leave, just to get out of the system and all of the drama,” says Charles Rice, a soil scientist at Kansas State University.

Meanwhile, Rice has been wondering whether his graduate students, many of them from other countries, should travel to Canada in July for a major soil science meeting. “We’ve been cautioned not to go, because they might not get back into the country,” he says. “That’s really frustrating for me. Not to be able to show your work, make connections for jobs. So I’m trying to decide, do we risk it?”",https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zpomeg8/abs/_20250612_on_reverseusdacuts.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 23:03:16.783164

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.): “We are making great progress on our Republican reconciliation bill that will lead to a stronger and safer America. And those two are intertwined, because you can’t have a strong and safe America – you can’t have a prosperous America unless you have a safe America.And so prosperity and security, safety are all issues that are intertwined, and our budget reconciliation bill addresses all of the above.” (Senate Majority Leader: Thune: Senate Republicans’ Bill to Create a Strong, Prosperous America – 6/10/25)

Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.): “Americans want safety. They want security. American families deserve safe communities. For too many, like those in Los Angeles, that safety feels out of reach. Republicans have a bold solution to change that. It starts with securing our borders and deporting illegal immigrant criminals. We have to pass it as quickly as possible. The American people are demanding it.” (Sen. Barrasso: Barrasso on LA Riots: Democrats Side with Illegal Immigrants and Rioters, Not Law-Abiding Americans – 6/11/25)

Senate Republican Conference Chairman Tom Cotton (R-Ark.): “The threat from the radical left is clear: Don’t enforce immigration laws. If you do, left-wing street militias will burn down cities, and Democratic politicians will back the rioters. The president is absolutely right to reject this threat, enforce immigration laws, and restore civil order… Further, the Republican budget bill provides a huge funding boost to immigration authorities so they can secure our border and deport criminal illegal aliens out of our country.” (The Wall Street Journal: Opinion: Tom Cotton: Send In the Troops, for Real – 6/10/25)

Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.): “Donald Trump won a decisive mandate last November on an America First message of securing America’s borders against Joe Biden’s unlawful invasion. Now more than ever, we need to pass President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill so that ICE has the resources it needs to continue deporting illegal aliens. We either have a country and respect for the rule of law or we do not. What’s happening in Los Angeles is nothing but an anti-democratic riot, which Democrats are only encouraging. Shameful.” (Sen. Banks: post on X – 6/8/25)

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.): “The Big Beautiful Bill will deliver the largest tax cut in history, and it even includes what I’ve been working on for years: No Tax on Social Security for seniors. We’re going to get this across the finish line.” (Sen. Blackburn: post on X – 6/11/25)

Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.): “This bill takes a commonsense approach to reforming SNAP—cutting waste, increasing state accountability, and helping recipients transition to self-sufficiency through work and training. It’s about being good stewards of taxpayer dollars while giving folks the tools to succeed. At the same time, our farmers and ranchers are facing real challenges, which have been unaddressed for too long. This legislation delivers the risk management tools and updated farm bill safety net they need to keep producing the safest, most abundant and affordable food, fuel, and fiber in the world. It’s an investment in rural America and the future of agriculture.” (U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry: Chairman Boozman Releases Agriculture, Nutrition, & Forestry Budget Reconciliation Text – 6/11/25)

Grassley: Grassley on the One Big Beautiful Bill – 6/12/25)

Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.): “So, I think that my colleagues need to certainly take into account the fact that this is a pro-growth bill. This tax package is going to stimulate more economic activity here in America. We will see growth that’s not captured in these CBO estimates, but will have a material impact on our economy, on our wellbeing, and frankly, in terms of going the right direction to reducing the deficit.” (Sen. Hagerty: ICYMI—Hagerty Joins Balance of Power on BloombergTV to Discuss Budget Reconciliation, GENIUS Act – 6/4/25)

Sen. Jon Husted (R-Ohio): “Growth helps reduce the deficit. I've been visited by many, many small business owners who are saying, ‘Please, please get this done.

Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.): “I like where we landed. The @SenateAgGOP proposal includes robust farm safety net investments, which I have long advocated.

Failure is not an option, so let’s get to work and finish the One Big Beautiful Bill.” (Sen. Hyde-Smith: post on X – 6/12/25)

Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.): “Border Security is National Security. Border Security is Economic Security. The riots in LA have made this clear. OBBB will give Border Patrol what they need to continue to keep our country secure. It provides funding to:

Finish President Trump’s border wall

Hire 10,000 new ICE personnel

Hire 5,000 new customs officers

This will allow agents and officers to detain and deport AT LEAST ONE MILLION illegal immigrants annually. In my opinion, passage of the OBBB is a no brainer.” (Sen. Lankford: post on X – 6/9/25)

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah): “This is President Trump’s agenda: cut the Green New Scam, reduce the deficit, and unleash American energy.

This is how we make government smaller, freer, and work for Americans.” (U.S. Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources: Chairman Lee Releases ENR Budget Reconciliation Text – 6/11/25)

Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.): “Senate Republicans have one mission these next few weeks: pass a One Big Beautiful Bill that helps Wyoming's working families, drives economic growth, cuts federal spending, and strengthens America.

Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.): “When you start talking about the One Big, Beautiful, Bill… we need to pass this because it’s not just the 10,000 new ICE agents, but it’s also the enforcement… the equipment, the training that they have, and plus, we’re going to finish building the wall that’s going to keep these criminals from just simply walking across dry land and getting into the United States.” (Fox Business: The Bottom Line – 6/9/25)

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.): “I will never support a budget process that weakens our military or puts our men and women in harm’s way. The reconciliation bill will strengthen our strategic weapons capabilities to such a degree that our adversaries will think twice before ever considering war with us.” (Sen. Rounds: post on X – 6/6/25)

Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.): “The only people who lose coverage under this are illegal immigrants and people who aren’t eligible; that’s it.

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.): “As the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, I’ve found billions of dollars to put back in the pockets of American taxpayers. When government spending goes down, inflation goes down– and that’s good news for everyone.” (Sen. Scott: post on X – 6/10/25)

Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.): “The most important thing is to protect Medicaid… for the people that really need it. And that's exactly what we're doing by shoring up these programs for the people who actually need it and reducing the fraud, waste, and abuse for those who do not need it.” (Senate Republican Communications Center: post on X – 6/10/25)

This is the third environmental lawsuit Vermont has brought against the Trump administration since President Trump took office in January.","Vermont is joining 11 other states in suing the Trump administration for revoking California’s long-standing ability to regulate air pollution from cars and trucks more stringently than the federal government, and to require the sale of more electric vehicles within its borders.

At stake is Vermont and other states’ ability to phase out the sale of new gasoline and diesel powered cars, in favor of electric alternatives.

The lawsuit alleges that Congress — and the president in signing resolutions earlier this week — acted illegally to revoke waivers that allow California to set these stricter standards, and other states to follow their lead.

Vermont is one of 17 states plus the District of Columbia that have adopted California’s rules.

In a statement issued Thursday, President Donald Trump was critical of California’s policy:

“It is the Federal Government, not states, that should establish vehicle emissions standards given the inherently interstate nature of air quality,” he said. “A patchwork of state vehicle regulations on this subject is unworkable.”

In a statement, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark called the move an “inappropriate overreach” by Congress and the administration.

“Vermonters believe in protecting our environment and we understand the importance of transitioning to cleaner cars and trucks,” Clark said. “And critically, Congress cannot circumvent the processes enshrined in the Clean Air Act.”

Vermont is one of several states that has adopted California’s standards for cars and trucks, which would phase out the sale of new diesel and gasoline powered vehicles by 2035.

To date, it’s the biggest step outlined in Vermont’s Climate Action Plan that the state has taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.

Reducing climate-warming pollution from cars and trucks will be crucial for Vermont to meet its statutory commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions under the Global Warming Solutions Act, as transit is the state’s biggest source of emissions.

Gov. Phil Scott issued an executive order this spring pausing Vermont’s implementation of the latest phase of California’s EV rule, which was set to require car manufacturers to send more electric vehicles to Vermont car dealerships starting in January 2026.

More from Vermont Edition: Why did Gov. Scott pause the electric vehicle mandate?

Vermont first signed on to follow California’s lead in regulating car emissions decades ago. Clark said it reflects the state's longstanding commitment to protecting the environment — and a system that has been in place and worked well for a long time.

“Twenty-five years ago we jumped on board, and we've been able to live in our values for this whole time,” Clark said. “Now we're in a situation where it's really disappointing that we have a president who doesn't want to follow the rules, and we're having to waste time in court fighting for what we should be able to have just by virtue of the law.”

The lawsuit filed Thursday argues that Congress and the federal government are circumventing the established process to roll back the waivers. The states say this flies in the face of long-standing legal precedent under the Clean Air Act and other laws, and is unconstitutional.

They allege the Trump administration is violating states’ rights and subverting the separation of powers, among other complaints.

Elena Mihaly is a lawyer with the environmental nonprofit Conservation Law Foundation. She applauded Vermont's lawsuit, and said these rules are critical for New England states in particular.

""Transportation is one of, if not the largest, source of carbon pollution in New England,"" Mihaly said. ""It's really important that we retain having a way to tackle that pollution issue.""

California, Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington are among the other states filing suit.

Mihaly said it's critical that even small states like Vermont take a stand against efforts to roll back environmental protections at the federal level.

""I think this is a time where we need states to be not abandoning their own climate policies and not letting the Trump administration tell them what they can and cannot do in terms of tackling climate change in their state,"" she said.

Rystad Energy estimates that this growth will continue, predicting an increased installation rate of approximately 16 GW per year by early 2026.

As energy demand rises in the US due to increased electrification, grid resilience will continue to be critical, with batteries playing a key role in meeting this need, along with both traditional and renewable energy sources. The US grid-scale BESS market delivered a very healthy growth of around 60% in 2024, rising from six gigawatts (GW) of capacity added in 2023 to 10 GW of installations. Planned inventory is a very strong leading indicator of actual capacity additions and we believe this rate of growth will create increased annual battery demand for grid-scale BESS

States that are witnessing the highest levels of BESS market growth are Texas and Arizona, with the California market stabilizing last year. Texas became the largest US BESS market in 2024 and currently exhibits an installation rate of around four GW per annum – similar to California. Contrary to California, the BESS inventory in Texas has increased from five GW to more than seven GW in the last 12 months, pointing to a likely further increase in installations this year.

Notwithstanding the growth in Texas, it is the rest of the country that is currently experiencing a BESS boom. Led by Arizona, the BESS inventory across all emerging US markets grew from three GW in the second quarter of last year to seven GW currently. The actual installation rate currently stands at around three GW – perfectly in line with the inventory level 12 months ago. While some construction delays are expected, there is no doubt that these emerging markets will drive most of the growth in the second half of this year and first half of next year, and even beyond.

In the most mature markets, batteries play an increasingly important role during peak power demand periods as they ‘extend’ solar generation curves into evening hours. In the last 90 days, batteries have satisfied 13% of the power demand of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) during battery discharge hours. Although the trend is new, the days of batteries delivering more than 16% of electricity during discharge hours are becoming increasingly common. While the average contribution during all discharge hours stands at around 13%, the typical peak contribution during discharge hours is already close to 30%. The 90-day average peak hour contribution currently stands at 26%, adding 10 percentage points over the last 12 months.

Looking at the share of CAISO power demand satisfied by renewables – mainly solar, wind and hydro – we observed that the annual average increased from less than 30% in 2021 to more than 40% in the last 12 months. While the peak of renewable contribution in springtime is growing each year – renewables met more than 65% of daily demand on some days this year, for instance – winter dips remain similar, with renewables delivering only 20% to 25% of demand. As a result, renewables integration has to date only been able to reduce CAISO’s dependency on energy imports, which have declined from around 27% to about 16% of system demand in the last four years.

As both BESS and solar PV installed capacity continue to grow in California, it is important to remember two things in particular: which power system challenges are being addressed by batteries, and what batteries cannot really help with. Whether it is theoretically possible to have all renewable plus BESS systems in CAISO and what kind of overbuild – and economic implications for project developers and end consumers – will be associated with it remains to be seen

As the global mobility industry accelerates toward an electric and autonomous future, Michigan continues to lead the charge. Long recognized as the birthplace of the automotive industry, the state is redefining what it means to be a mobility powerhouse by fueling innovation, advancing electrification, and investing in the skilled workforce needed to power the next generation of transportation.

Michigan’s leadership in the electric vehicle (EV) and automotive sectors is anchored by bold investments in education, workforce development, and industry collaboration. From new training programs to strategic statewide initiatives, the state is laying the foundation for sustainable growth and long-term industry success. By strengthening the link between education and industry, the state is accelerating the development of a highly skilled workforce ready to meet the demands of electrification and advanced mobility.

At the forefront of this momentum is the Michigan EV Jobs Academy, a statewide collaboration that brings together employers, educators, and training providers to ensure Michigan’s talent pipeline aligns with real-time industry needs. More than 400 courses across the state’s community colleges have been reviewed by the academy and refined to prepare Michiganders for high-demand careers in EV manufacturing, battery technology, and semiconductor production.

Strategic partnerships with institutions like Western Michigan University and Kellogg Community College are expanding hands-on training in EV systems and semiconductor technology. Designed with direct input from industry collaborators, these programs are tailored to support Michigan’s growing mobility ecosystem, creating a talent pipeline that’s both deep and diverse.

In 2024, Michigan strengthened its commitment to talent development with a $10 million investment in the Michigan Semiconductor Talent and Technology for Automotive Research (MSTAR) initiative. This public-private partnership advances Michigan’s competitive edge in semiconductor research and training, essential to the future of EV production and innovation.

These efforts have not gone unnoticed. In April 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration announced Michigan would welcome the nation’s first-ever statewide EV Workforce Hub—a distinction that recognized Michigan’s leadership in cultivating a domestic, diversified EV supply chain and retaining high-quality, good-paying jobs.

Coordinating these initiatives is the Talent Action Team, a strategic effort led by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) that works directly with industry leaders like Ford, GM, Mobis, Toyota, and KLA to ensure that talent development keeps pace with the rapid evolution of the mobility and semiconductor industries. The team serves as a critical connector, bringing together employers, regional workforce boards, training providers, and higher education institutions to build a more responsive and resilient talent pipeline.

The Talent Action Team plays a vital role in translating Michigan’s commitment to innovation into real, measurable outcomes, ensuring that its workforce is prepared for today’s opportunities and ready to drive the EV and automotive industries forward.

With its rich manufacturing legacy, forward-thinking policies, and unmatched commitment to workforce innovation, Michigan stands at the forefront of the mobility revolution.

The credit for loans involved with Project Hestia is a less lucrative subsidy.
After receiving the federal loan, Sunnova faced congressional scrutiny for its alleged history of predatory practices and scamming elderly clients.
The largest funding was allocated to Sunnova, which aimed to provide residential solar energy to low-income households in the United States and Puerto Rico.
The accusations have brought to mind a solar company called Solyndra that failed during the Obama administration, costing American taxpayers $535 million.","The Trump administration has canceled a partial loan guarantee of $2.92 billion that had been awarded to troubled residential solar panel installer Sunnova Energy, as part of its review of government financing for alternative energy. The Department of Energy (DOE) had ‘de-obligated’ the loan guarantee, which means that the federal government is not responsible for the financing. Sunnova is restructuring its debt and has warned that it may not be able to continue to stay in business. In a regulatory filing in March, it indicated that it did not intend to use the DOE facility, Project Hestia, for the foreseeable future. Sunnova sold $371 million in bonds that are backed by the Project Hestia loan guarantee, but those notes were not included in the debt that the company is seeking to restructure.

The Biden administration announced a partial loan guarantee of up to $3 billion to support financing for approximately 100,000 rooftop solar installations, primarily for low-income homeowners, in April 2023. Biden’s Energy Department declared the facility as the largest ever commitment to solar power made by the U.S. government. The loan program became less attractive to Sunnova because the company could market cheaper, leased systems to homeowners using tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The credit for loans involved with Project Hestia is a less lucrative subsidy.

Project Hestia is a 568-megawatt project comprising rooftop solar installations, residential battery systems, and intelligent software. Hestia was expected to provide loans for these technologies to homeowners in the United States and Puerto Rico. After receiving the federal loan, Sunnova faced congressional scrutiny for its alleged history of predatory practices and scamming elderly clients. The company was accused of scamming dementia patients on their deathbeds into signing five-figure, multi-decade solar panel leases, according to interviews and state consumer complaint records obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

Since 2009, the DOE loans office has issued more than $35 billion in loans and loan guarantees, and has been repaid by some companies, including Tesla. In 2011, during the Obama administration, a $535 million federal loan to Solyndra failed, and many are worried that other solar company failures will follow.

Under the Biden administration, the DOE loan office sought to accelerate the development of the “clean” energy sector and provided loans to companies that struggled to secure private financing. Residential solar has struggled as higher interest rates have pushed up financing costs. If the House budget bill passes in its current form, the residential solar industry will continue to falter as tax credits will be going away, rather than being uncapped as in the IRA.

Sunnova Is Not the Only Loan Cancellation By DOE

The Energy Department is cancelling seven major loans and loan guarantees that had been conditionally approved under the Biden administration. Besides Sunnova’s Hestia project, two other projects include a transmission project by a New Jersey utility company and a Monolith Nebraska factory to produce low-carbon ammonia.

Monolith received a $953 million conditional loan guarantee to accelerate its clean hydrogen and carbon utilization project in Nebraska. The company received backing from BlackRock and NextEra Energy, was valued at over $1 billion in 2022, and produces hydrogen fuel using renewable energy (which can be used to make ammonia for fertilizers) and carbon black. In September 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company was “running short on cash and facing project delays.”

New Jersey’s Clean Energy Corridor, which is run by Jersey Central Power & Light Company, received a conditional loan guarantee of up to $716 million in January to support the state’s goal of introducing 11,000 megawatts of offshore wind-generated electricity by 2035. When Jersey Central’s owner First Energy announced the project in 2022, Danish energy company Orsted was planning two large wind projects off New Jersey’s coast, but the projects were canceled in 2023. Another offshore wind project in New Jersey was stopped after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded the project’s environmental permits.

The other four projects, which collectively received over $3 billion, include three battery factories and a plastics and recycling facility, all of which were previously canceled by their companies.

Conclusion

DOE is canceling seven “clean” energy projects for which the Biden loan office provided loan guarantees. The largest funding was allocated to Sunnova, which aimed to provide residential solar energy to low-income households in the United States and Puerto Rico. Sunnova, however, is restructuring its debt and does not plan to use Project Hestia in the foreseeable future. The company has also been accused of scamming the elderly into signing up for residential solar projects, which has led to scrutiny by Congress.

This proposal would also repeal all previously finalized greenhouse gas standards for fossil fuel power plants.
NRECA has called the rule a costly mandate with no appreciable health benefits that would force the premature retirement of some coal-fired units that are critical to electric reliability.
“These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run,” Matheson said.","The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed to repeal power sector greenhouse gas and mercury emissions rules that NRECA says threaten grid reliability and affordability for electric cooperatives and their members.

The rules, which the Biden administration finalized in 2024, “are unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable,” NRECA CEO Jim Matheson said. “And they will jeopardize the reliability of the electric grid for as long as they remain in effect.”

The proposed repeals “are a welcome course correction that will help electric co-ops reliably meet skyrocketing energy needs and keep the lights on at a cost local families and businesses can afford,” Matheson said.

The Trump administration’s main proposal for the greenhouse gas rule would repeal the 2024 regulation, which required many existing coal-fired plants and new natural gas-fueled plants to either install carbon capture and storage technologies, run at lower capacity or shut down. This proposal would also repeal all previously finalized greenhouse gas standards for fossil fuel power plants.

NRECA and its members fought the 2024 regulation in court, saying the Biden-era rule exceeded the EPA’s authority and required the use of inadequately demonstrated CCS technology. Four large electric grid operators echoed NRECA’s concerns, stating in a friend-of-the-court brief that the rule will drive the early closure of crucial generation sources.

The EPA on Wednesday also proposed repealing the Biden administration’s mercury and air rule. NRECA has called the rule a costly mandate with no appreciable health benefits that would force the premature retirement of some coal-fired units that are critical to electric reliability.

Comments on both proposals will be due 45 days after they are published in the Federal Register.

“These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run,” Matheson said. “Both of them are textbook examples of a bad energy policy that compounds today’s reliability challenges.”

Similarly, foreign automakers have loads of factories in the US, with more on the way. Toyota has one of the larger American footprints, and its Indiana factory has made quite a few of its cars. That became apparent this week after it built its 1-millionth hybrid.

The Plant Makes More Than Hybrids, But Hybrids Are A Big Portion

Toyota's factory in Indiana is in Princeton, and its millionth hybrid off the line was a 2025 Toyota Sienna in Wind Chill Pearl. That's far from the only model built there, though. The factory currently builds Grand Highlanders, Lexus TXs, combustion and hybrid Highlanders, and, of course, Siennas. Of those, the Highlander is the biggest seller, with Toyota moving more than 89,000 of them last year, and Sienna is close behind, with more than 75,000 of them finding homes.

Naturally with these other models and different ones before them, Toyota's Indiana plant has made far more than a million cars. It has, in fact, built more than 6 million vehicles since it started producing them in 1998. Still, with that in mind, it means that at least a sixth of the plant's production has been of the hybrid variety, which is quite impressive.

These investments help drivers save money by providing expanded access to lower cost and cleaner burning homegrown biofuels like E15 (Unleaded 88). The cost-share grants were awarded by the RFIP Board during its quarterly meeting on June 4.

The approved project sites are in 48 different counties and total $1.23 million in state cost-share.

A complete list of the projects, sorted by county, is available here.

“Biofuels provide value for drivers, open new markets for farmers, support rural jobs, reduce emissions, and advance the goal of greater American energy dominance,” said Secretary Naig. “Expanding access to Unleaded 88 gives drivers more ways to save at the pump, and those savings really do add up over time. In 2024, Iowa set a new record for E15 sales, and that momentum will continue as more stations upgrade or install new fuel equipment.”

The Iowa Department of Revenue announced on April 3 that Iowa E15 sales hit an all-time record in 2024, eclipsing the previous record from 2023 by 44 percent. With 256.7 million gallons of E15 sold in Iowa in 2024 at an average price discount of 15 cents per gallon compared to E10, Iowa drivers saved over $38.5 million last year by choosing E15 at the pump.

These investments are helping more Iowa fuel stations come into compliance with the E15 Access Standard. Iowa is the first state to enact an E15 Access Standard, which requires most fuel retailers to offer E15 by Jan. 1, 2026. The law was passed by the Iowa Legislature and signed by Gov. Reynolds in 2022. For those convenience stores and fuel stations that need assistance coming into compliance, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship can provide cost-share funding through the RFIP. Since the cost-share grant program began in 2006, the Department has invested more than $62 million toward expanding renewable fuels infrastructure within Iowa. This has been matched with more than $270 million by Iowa convenience stores and fuel retailers.

Specifically, the EPA is proposing to repeal the 2015 emissions standards for new fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Obama-Biden Administration.
It is also rolling back the 2024 rule for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Biden-Harris Administration.
The agency is taking comments on the efficiency-based requirements for new natural gas power plant requirements.
“These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run.","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued proposals to repeal all “greenhouse gas” emissions standards for the power sector and repeal amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS).

Specifically, the EPA is proposing to repeal the 2015 emissions standards for new fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Obama-Biden Administration. It is also rolling back the 2024 rule for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Biden-Harris Administration.

The first Clean Power Plan was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022. In West Virginia v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the major questions doctrine barred EPA from misusing the Clean Air Act to manipulate Americans’ energy choices and shift the balance of the nation’s electrical fuel mix.

Then the Biden Administration issued its own rule in 2024, which many critics say is just another attempt to achieve the unlawful fuel-shifting goals of the Clean Power Plan. Zeldin said the rule is similarly overreaching.

“Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream and a natural byproduct of national energy dominance,” Zeldin said. “According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence.”

The EPA said that any potential public health harms have not been accurately attributed to emissions from the U.S. power sector. In light of this, EPA is proposing that the Clean Air Act requires the agency to make a finding that the targeted emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution before regulating these emissions from this source category.

Further, the EPA is proposing that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the statute.

Thus, the EPA is proposing to repeal the emission guidelines for existing power plants, and carbon capture and sequestration/storage-based requirements for new combustion turbines and modified coal plants. The agency is taking comments on the efficiency-based requirements for new natural gas power plant requirements.

This proposal would save the power sector about $19 billion in regulatory costs over two decades beginning in 2026, or about $1.2 billion a year.

The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) supports the proposals.

“Today’s announcements are a welcome course correction that will help electric co-ops reliably meet skyrocketing energy needs and keep the lights on at a cost local families and businesses can afford,” NRECA CEO Jim Matheson said. “These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run. Both of them are textbook examples of a bad energy policy that compounds today’s reliability challenges.”

Matheson said the existing power plant rule exceeds the EPA’s authority, disregards prior Supreme Court decisions, and requires the use of inadequately demonstrated carbon capture and storage technology. Further, he said the mercury and air rule has no appreciable health benefits and will result in the premature retirement of some coal-fired units that are critical to electric reliability.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shutterstock_132921929.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:07:09.662956

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said the draft rule, which proposes a total 24.02 billion gallon blending level in 2026, is a “very strong starting point for further discussions.”

Shaw said the association will need time to evaluate the proposal, specifically as it relates to changes in credits for imported fuels and feedstocks.

According to the proposal, EPA is considering “several regulatory changes” to the RFS program that would reduce the number of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs which is the measuring unit for renewable fuel, for imported renewable fuels and renewable fuels produced from imported feedstocks.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports imported biodiesel feedstocks, like used cooking oil, tallow and canola oil have all increased over the past several years due to the high cost of domestic feedstocks. According to the same report, in the 2023 and 2024 marketing year, the U.S. consumed nearly 30% of biofuel feedstocks exported globally.

The news to prioritize domestic feedstocks was welcomed by Iowa Soybean Association President Brent Swart, who said biomass-based diesel supports “roughly 10% of the price per bushel of soybeans.”

“Biomass-based diesel has long provided significant value to soybean farmers, helping us weather difficult economic times and supporting our state’s thriving agriculture industry,” Swart said in a statement.

The EPA program sets overall standards and specific standards for different types of biofuels. The draft rules propose biomass-based diesel standards equivalent to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons in 2027.

These figures are a significant jump from 2025 targets from EPA, which set an annual volume requirement of 3.35 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel.

“This is a significant step toward putting the market back on track,” Swart said. “It is also a long overdue recognition that Iowa farmers, soybean processors and the state’s biodiesel producers, can contribute even more (to) America’s energy output.”

Swart said the announcement “provides added certainty” for soybean farmers during the growing season and he thanked the Trump administration for supporting “farmers’ critical role” in U.S. energy policy.

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said USDA and EPA have “never been more aligned” on the demand for domestically grown biofuels.

“This is the highest ever Renewable Volume Obligation and it sends a strong signal to the U.S. biofuels industry that President Trump has their backs and gives them the incentive to invest in American products for American consumers and to export around the world,” Rollins said in a statement.

The EPA proposal additionally waives the 2025 cellulosic biofuel volume requirement and reinstates the values through 2026 and 2027, due to a shortfall in the production of the fuels made from nonfood-based renewable feedstocks, like cellulose or lignin.

The draft rule also removes renewable electricity as a qualifying renewable fuel under the program, which follows a move from the Trump administration to block state-specific mandates on emissions that encouraged the use of electric vehicles.

U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst celebrated the move and the EPA announcement in a statement, saying it brings RFS “back on track.”

“By eliminating the electric vehicle mandate and restoring the RFS’ original focus on liquid transportation fuels, prioritizing domestically grown crops over foreign imports, setting record-high volumes to revitalize the biofuel industry, and adopting safeguards to prevent small refinery waivers from gutting the program—it is clear the Trump administration is committed to championing rural America,” Ernst said.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig similarly applauded the move, including the proposed regulation changes to steer producers away from foreign-made feedstocks.

“President Trump is once again demonstrating his commitment to showcasing how Iowa-made biofuels can be central to his effort to make America energy dominant,” Naig said in a statement. “Biofuels are a win for drivers and American farmers – they save drivers money at the pump, directly support corn and soybean prices, expand markets for farmers, and support rural jobs and communities.”

EPA will host a public hearing on the rules July 8.

Shaw said IRFA plans to work with EPA through the commenting period and to secure a final rule from the agency.

“Agriculture is hurting, having just endured the largest two-year drop in net farm income in history,” Shaw said. “We need forward leaning RFS blending levels to maximize American energy dominance.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rollins-at-Elite-Octone-e1743702883930.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:07:30.344836

Meanwhile, natural gas prices are forecast to rise as strong export growth continues to outpace US production. View the full June STEO report here for detailed insights on energy prices, production, inventories, and more.

Oil spot prices

The weekly West Texas Intermediate oil spot market price trended lower from the start of the year through May, approaching lows last seen in early 2021. As of June 6, the spot price ticked up to a two-month high of $64.06 per barrel (b) (Figure 1). Recall that in February, oil prices fell below the $70-90/b range they had generally been in for the previous two years.

The June STEO forecasts oil spot prices will decline through the end of the year to $61/b and for 2026 to average $59/b (unchanged from May).

Gas spot prices

Following the multi-decade lows seen in 2024, natural gas spot prices surged last winter due to increased heating demand, touching a two-year high of $5.90/mmBtu (million metric British thermal units) in February. The market has calmed since, driven by milder weather and higher-than-normal storage injections. As of June 6, the weekly spot price has eased to a six-month low of $2.84/mmBtu.

EIA adjusted its natural gas forecast lower in June for the second month in a row, though prices are still expected to increase. Prices are forecast to average $4.00/mmBtu in 2025 (down from May’s estimate of $4.20/mmBtu), and $4.90/mmBtu in 2026.

Rig counts

US drilling activity has edged lower since early May, remaining at reduced levels for the past year. The latest drill rig count fell by four this week to 555 rigs, the lowest weekly rate recorded since November 2021 (Figure 2, left). Compared to the same week of 2024, there were 35 fewer rigs operating in the US this week.

EIA noted that US rig counts fell further than expected in May, and drilling activity is expected to soften further through 2026.

Canadian counts recently broke their seasonal decline, rising by 24 rigs this week to 138 (Figure 2, right). Canadian activity typically surges early in the year, then declines through May as thawing ground conditions limit access to drilling sites. This time last year, there were 22 more rigs in operation.

Curtis Tate spoke with former Economic Development Secretary Mitch Carmichael, who supports preserving the tax credits.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tate: What’s at stake in West Virginia? What does the state stand to lose?

Carmichael: Well, I could just tell you, from West Virginia’s perspective, there are many projects that have been oriented towards these tax credits. You think of Form Energy. You think of the Fidelis project in Mason County that was set up for carbon capture and sequestration. The Nucor project, writ large, is about producing green steel, ultimately low carbon steel. The Berkshire Hathaway project. Those are just projects that I know for a fact, having worked in economic development and devoted my career to helping jobs and growth and opportunity in the Mountain State, that in this region, because I’ve worked on a lot of economic development projects in this region, not just West Virginia. There are many projects that are seeking these energy tax credits.

Tate: How does preserving the tax credits align with the president’s agenda?

Carmichael: This is really the quintessential American response to create an energy dominant economy that provides great jobs, future-oriented manufacturing, reshoring manufacturing. It’s so much different than what would traditionally be considered a grant or a handout to businesses. These are actual rewards for doing jobs, for creating the opportunities in America and keeping down the cost of energy and helping transition. It’s not about climate ideology or anything like that. It’s about transitioning to a more America-first, manufacturing-dominant economy that provides low-cost energy. So why would anyone want to take away energy tax credits? We’re already experiencing too much inflation in terms of our energy and power costs. Just look at your residential power bill.

Tate: Do the tax credits help create microgrids that can support AI and data centers?

Carmichael: I’m very familiar with the way microgrids work, because of the Jackson County Berkshire Hathaway designation as a microgrid and the creation of that titanium plant that’s going to be the world’s most advanced titanium manufacturing plant, with over 200 to 250 great jobs. So the way this works is an area will be designated as the microgrid that can then power with any number of energy sources. It can be geothermal, hydrogen, biomass. It can be traditional coal, oil, natural gas, that can all be then carbon sequestered. So that works in conjunction with manufacturing entities or data centers to have these areas that they can quickly get power at a reasonable price, and provide the jobs and new growth.

Tate: How do they help maintain a supply of critical minerals?

Carmichael: These tax credits are not just about energy, per se, they’re also about rare earth elements. So these tax credits can be utilized to create incentives for going out and mining these rare earth elements, these critical minerals that are involved and utilized in everything from medicine to fighter jets that are often imported from countries that are adversaries to America, and they can potentially weaponize those minerals against our energy dominance and our manufacturing and our economy. So we need to maintain these tax credits in order to assert American dominance in terms of our energy manufacturing base and secure our supply of natural critical minerals.

Tate: The credits are geared toward coal and power plant communities, right?

Carmichael: West Virginia is the only state in America that is completely within the Appalachian Regional Commission designation. So all 55 of our counties will qualify for these tax credits. And it’s so beneficial as an economic development to go out and tout these tax credits for businesses to locate in our state. We’ve seen the results, as I alluded to earlier.There are many, many more, but Berkshire Hathaway, one of the world’s largest entities, decided to put a solar field in Jackson County and build a new factory powered completely by solar energy. And then we have the Form Energy project in the Weirton-Follansbee area that has 750 manufacturing jobs. And for those who think, “OK, this is about the demise of the traditional fossil fuel industry.” That’s not the case at all.

Tate: Did you say the credits can support fossil fuels as well?",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Justice-Form-Energy-Announcement-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:06:43.401880

JFF and GNOF presented these outcomes at the recent 2025 Horizons Summit: “Dare to be Brave”.

The Quality Green Jobs Regional Challenge

Only six months after winning the JFF Quality Green Jobs Regional Challenge, GNOF has already made a big difference in the region.

“Drawn from a pool of over 100 applicants nationwide, GNOF’s proposal stood out for its innovative approach to creating green jobs in New Orleans—particularly in response to the growing challenge of water management,” said Sara Vander Zanden, a director at Jobs for the Future.

According to JFF, there is significant potential for green economy growth across the region. “GNOF is currently working with regional partners to map the full landscape of employment opportunities across green industries, including energy, construction, green infrastructure, water management, and waste management,” said Vander Zande. “As federal and state resilience investments are finalized, we expect to have more concrete data on specific job projections and employer engagement.”

JFF estimates that the Greater New Orleans region could see $5.3 billion in resilience investments creating more than 12,000 green jobs. According to JFF, by engaging with industry partners, GNOF builds trust which translates into real-life training. The acquired skills then translate into job opportunities in construction and green infrastructure.

“Equally important is GNOF’s commitment to breaking down systemic barriers that have excluded Black, Indigenous, justice-impacted, and rural individuals from economic opportunity,” said Vander Zanden. “The GNOF team also recognizes that these communities are living on the front lines of climate change and are most likely to experience its most severe consequences.”

Working with Local Partners

Over the past few months GNOF and JFF have worked with community-based groups like Thrive New Orleans, Groundwork New Orleans, and Louisiana Green Corps, to train local, underrepresented residents for high-quality green jobs in stormwater management.

Groundwork New Orleans

Groundwork New Orleans, one of the GNOF partners, is a productive local nonprofit engaging residents, volunteers, businesses, and local organizations in practical projects that enhance quality of life, restore environmental function, and support sustainable development. These projects transform the living environment and include stormwater management, tree planting, and solar installations.

Louisiana Green Corps

“Our partners at Louisiana Green Corps provide specialized training in green infrastructure and construction, with a particular focus on opportunity youth,” said Vander Zanden. “Their model integrates workforce training with environmental restoration and community resilience building.”

Thrive New Orleans

Thrive New Orleans is a training provider in the green construction and infrastructure workforce ecosystem, focusing on underrepresented populations including justice-impacted individuals. Their programs emphasize both durable and technical green skills development.

“With a strong track record of launching job placement initiatives and deep expertise in disaster response and philanthropic innovation, GNOF have demonstrated the capacity to execute complex, multi-stakeholder initiatives effectively. We’re fortunate to be working alongside them,” said Vander Zanden.

“Dare to Be Brave” 2025 Horizons Summit

The 2025 Horizons Summit, “Dare to Be Brave”, was held in New Orleans June 10–11 and hosted by Jobs for the Future. Since its inception in 2018, this annual gathering has grown into a major national event.

This year around 2,000 leaders in education, workforce, philanthropy, policy, and industry sectors discussed workforce and economic development opportunities, showcasing local partnerships as a model for equitable climate adaptation.

Andy Kopplin, President and CEO of GNOF, was a key panelist on the main stage event “Rebuilding for the Future: Workforce Resilience in the Gulf Coast”. Other panelists included Lauren Alexander Augustine, Executive Director, Gulf Research Project, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and Rachel Wolfe, Economics Reporter with The Wall Street Journal.

GNOF and the Gulf Research Program (GRP) have complementary approaches: GNOF focuses on community engagement and resilience-building while the GRP provides research and strategic insights to guide long-term workforce development.

Another session at the Summit covered “Building Resilient Regional Economies: Tools for Assessing Risk, Readiness, and Workforce Agility” with Sarah Bennett of Jobs for the Future, Anne McHugh of Portland General Electric, Jacob Robinson of GNOF, and Stacey Johnson of SUNY Buffalo.

The session introduced a practical framework and interactive data tool designed to help regions assess their economic risk, readiness, and capacity for workforce resilience and ability to grow jobs for infrastructure growth and energy efficiency.

“The coordination across construction, green infrastructure, energy, and coastal restoration sectors demonstrates how regions can build comprehensive green economy ecosystems, rather than isolated training programs,” said Vander Zanden. “We believe this model is especially relevant for regions facing similar challenges—high incarceration rates, increased climate risks, significant rural and BIPOC populations, and the need to transition traditional industries toward more sustainable practices.”",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/06/JFF-and-GNOF-Dare-to-be-Brave-Summit.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 17:09:59.963123

Sher was already a user of the car-sharing platform Turo, and the idea of turning a Tesla into an even bigger moneymaker was an attractive proposition.

But as years went by, Musk failed to follow through on that promise. So, in 2021, Sher assembled a small team and brought on co-founder Saimah Chaudhry to start his own company. “Hey, we’re just going to do this ourselves,” he thought at the time.

What they built was a new peer-to-peer car-sharing startup called Zevo, which is broadly similar to Turo, but focused exclusively on electric vehicles.

The Dallas-based startup has been in operation for around 10 months, and on Friday it announced it has raised $6 million in funding as it looks to expand across more major U.S. cities. Sher told TechCrunch that Zevo is already tracking over $8 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), and has a wait list of more than 3,500 customers — all with essentially no marketing to date.

On the renter side, an overwhelming portion of that interest is coming from gig workers, Sher said. Some 90% of people using Zevo to rent an EV are doing so to ferry passengers on Uber or Lyft, or make DoorDash deliveries.

Sher said he thinks Zevo has “the secret sauce on how to make car sharing very lucrative for the host and very affordable for the renter.”

So what’s the secret sauce?

“It’s gonna sound crazy, but the secret sauce is not raising hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to build something that can be a powerful marketplace,” Sher said. “We very intentionally raised private capital. We rejected VC capital for that reason. I didn’t want to be on a 12-month to 18-month runway of ‘spend, spend, spend, spend,’ which is how corporate America likes to do things in this world.”

Bootstrapping Zevo allowed Sher to gather good engineers, develop a strong go-to-market strategy, and cause “true disruption,” he said.

By keeping things focused, Sher said Zevo is able to send more money to the vehicle owners than they’d get on platforms like Turo.

Sher also talked up Zevo’s “contactless” process, which allows owners and renters to share a car without having to hand over keys or key cards.

That’s not novel — plenty of other car-sharing services have adopted a similar contactless process. But Sher argued that Zevo’s contactless nature is front-and-center because the service only uses EVs, which tend to be more technologically capable and therefore easier to integrate in a smartphone app.

This connectivity also makes it easier to integrate other important pieces of the car-sharing equation, like commercial insurance, Sher said. Removing red tape like that is what has made the platform so attractive to gig workers, he said, especially since many of them don’t have the credit scores required by larger car-sharing or rental services. Sher said one user likened Zevo to the MetroPCS of renting cars.

“There’s [usually] a lot of red tape: insurance cards, incidentals, tolls, supercharging, invoices, reimbursements. We’ve been able to really automate all of that,” he said. Add in that EVs tend to require less maintenance — which means more uptime — and it’s easy to understand why gig workers are interested.

The result of all this is that, in the early going, Zevo is seeing a median rental of around 80 days. Hosts, meanwhile, can make back between 35% and 65% of the cost of their car in just a year, according to Sher. Since 90% of the vehicles on the platform are Teslas, that has Sher feeling pretty confident that he’s been able to find a different way to deliver on Musk’s promise from 2019.

Of course, Tesla is now finally on the precipice of launching a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and potentially other U.S. cities later this year. There are many unanswered questions about how that service will operate, whether Tesla’s self-driving software will perform safely, and how easy it will be for owners to put their cars on the network. But it does seem like Tesla is closer than ever to putting Musk’s vision to the test.

That doesn’t worry Sher, though. He said Zevo is laser-focused on disrupting car-sharing, and doesn’t want to mess with the ride-hailing piece that Tesla is after. He thinks Zevo can break $100 million ARR with a staff of just 30 people and minimal future investment.

Even if Tesla were able to eat into the gig economy with a fleet of robotaxis — which remains a very big if — Sher said Musk would need to find a way to make millions more cars than it already does to meet the total demand for rides and deliveries.

“There’s enough for everybody here on the table,” he said.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2709.jpeg?resize=1200,933",N,,2025-06-13 17:09:20.233758

EPA proposes repeal of Biden’s Clean Power Plan 2.0

On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed the repeal of Biden’s greenhouse gas regulation of power plants (Clean Power Plan 2.0). As part of the proposed rule, the agency is arguing that “greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” If this were to be upheld in court, it would put an end to greenhouse gas regulation of power plants. In addition, the agency is focusing on the unrealistic assumptions made in the Biden rule regarding technological feasibility. There are many issues that CEI and allies will need to address in the comment period to support this critical proposal. The comment period will end 45 days after the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register.

EPA proposes the repeal of Biden amendments to mercury regulation

In addition to the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan 2.0, the EPA on Wednesday proposed the repeal of the Biden EPA’s 2024 amendments to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for power plants (MATS). For many years, the EPA has been pushing MATS regulation even though the agency has struggled to find any monetized benefits from reducing emissions of mercury from power plants. In the 2024 rule, the agency was unable to quantify a single dollar worth of benefits from reducing mercury emissions. According to the EPA, the 2024 rule has a net cost. The comment period for this proposed rule also ends 45 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

President Trump signs CRA resolutions rescinding EPA’s CA waivers

Yesterday, President Donald Trump signed into law three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval killing off the Biden EPA’s waivers given to California to transform the nation’s car and truck industry. This includes a CRA resolution rescinding the Biden EPA waiver greenlighting California’s Advanced Clean Cars II, a rule that would have banned the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. As a result of these resolutions, the EPA can’t take an action that is “substantially the same.”

Senators should stay strong and repeal the IRA subsidies

Lobbyists for the companies hoping to cash in on the many alternative energy subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are crying foul now that the recently-passed House budget reconciliation bill pares back several of the biggest handouts. But none of their defenses of these market-distorting giveaways hold water. Deliberations are ongoing in the Senate over its version of the bill, and Senators should at least retain – or better yet strengthen – the House limits placed on these ill-advised provisions.

United Nations report says climate change policies can exacerbate wildfires

Many forests today in the western United States are overgrown. This is one of the main reasons why wildfires have become so much more destructive recently than they have been historically. When fires have more fuel to burn through, they are more destructive. A recent report from the United Nations University, describes how climate change policies, like carbon markets and the Paris Agreement, further exacerbate this problem by planting more trees in the wrong forests.

President Trump signs four executive orders on nuclear power

President Trump recently signed four executive orders related to nuclear power. These lay the groundwork for reforming nuclear regulation and enabling nuclear power to play a role in meeting rising power demand. If successful, the Trump administration believes its efforts will increase nuclear capacity to 400 gigawatts (GW) by 2050—double the target pledged by the Biden administration.

ESA reform: Congress should adopt policy that will help end sue and settle abuse

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is overdue for an update. Significant amendments haven’t been made to the law in 37 years. Fortunately, Rep. Bruce Westerman’s (R-AR) bill, the ESA Amendments Act of 2025, offers a myriad of provisions that would amend the ESA to better reflect what we know now about recovering species. If passed, one such provision would replace the one-year deadline imposed on the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to respond to petitions with the National Listing Workplan. Doing this would help ensure that outside organizations are not able to control FWS’s ESA agenda through sue and settle strategies.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) on Thursday reintroduced the Cost RecoveryCost recovery is the ability of businesses to recover (deduct) the costs of their investments. It plays an important role in defining a business’ tax base and can impact investment decisions. When businesses cannot fully deduct capital expenditures, they spend less on capital, which reduces worker’s productivity and wages. and Expensing Acceleration to Transform the Economy and Jumpstart Opportunities for Businesses and Startups (CREATE JOBS) Act that would substantially reform the taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. treatment of business investment. The legislation permanently enacts expensing for equipment and machinery and research and development. It introduces a neutral cost recovery system for structures (NCRS), which is economically equivalent to expensing.

Among tax legislation introduced this Congress, the CREATE JOBS Act contains the most pro-growth and fiscally responsible tax reform ideas while avoiding saddling businesses with complicated rules. By building on the most pro-growth elements of the TCJA—namely expensing of investment, and similar treatments like NCRS—this bill will make US industry more competitive and incentivize domestic investment.

What does the CREATE JOBS Act Do?

The first section of the proposal makes 100 percent bonus depreciationBonus depreciation allows firms to deduct a larger portion of certain “short-lived” investments in new or improved technology, equipment, or buildings in the first year. Allowing businesses to write off more investments partially alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more, which, in the long run, raises worker productivity, boosts wages, and creates more jobs. for short-lived assets, or Section 168(k), permanent. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) temporarily provided 100 percent bonus depreciationDepreciation is a measurement of the “useful life” of a business asset, such as machinery or a factory, to determine the multiyear period over which the cost of that asset can be deducted from taxable income. Instead of allowing businesses to deduct the cost of investments immediately (i.e., full expensing), depreciation requires deductions to be taken over time, reducing their value and discouraging investment. , but it phased down beginning in 2023. One hundred percent bonus depreciation permits firms to immediately write off investment in assets with lives of 20 or fewer years. Currently, businesses can only immediately write off 40 percent of their investment, with the rest deducted over time, and it will phase down to 0 percent in 2027. The bill makes 100 percent bonus depreciation retroactive to the end of 2022.

The second section of the proposal would improve the cost recovery treatment of investments in structures and buildings by implementing NCRS, providing the same economic benefit as full expensingFull expensing allows businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of certain investments in new or improved technology, equipment, or buildings. It alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more, which, in the long run, raises worker productivity, boosts wages, and creates more jobs. using a different mechanism. Under NCRS, the deductions currently taken under the 27.5- and 39-year depreciation schedules for real estate investments would be adjusted to maintain their real value over time.

NCRS would apply to new structures that businesses put in place as well as the deductions that have yet to be taken going forward for existing structures.

The third section would restore immediate deductions for research and development (R&D) costs. Because of a change made in the TCJA, R&D costs currently must be amortized over five years or 15 years, a departure from the historical norm of expensing R&D. The bill would make R&D expensing retroactive to when the policy expired in 2021.

What is the economic impact?

According to the Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model, the CREATE JOBS Act would grow the long-run economy by 2.9 percent, expand the capital stock by 5.3 percent, lift wages by 2.3 percent, and expand hours worked by more than 775,000 new full-time equivalent jobs. Retroactive extension of policies does not contribute to long-run growth, but it does add to the fiscal cost of the bill.

How does this bill compare to other major tax legislation?

The Tax Foundation estimates that making the entire TCJA permanent, which includes permanent extension of 100 percent bonus depreciation and full and immediate write-offs of R&D investment, would grow the economy by 1.1 percent, lift wages by 0.5 percent, and expand hours worked by 847,000 full-time equivalent jobs. It would cost $4.5 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis, $3.8 trillion on a dynamic basis.

Earlier versions of the TCJA did include expensing for structures, but lawmakers dropped the provision from the final bill due to budgetary and industry concerns.

We estimate that the House-passed version of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) would grow the long-run economy by 0.8 percent, boost wages by less than 0.05 percent, and expand hours worked by 983,000 full-time equivalent jobs. It would cost $2.6 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis, $1.7 trillion on a dynamic basis.

The OBBBA temporarily extends bonus depreciation and full write-offs of R&D expenses. Further, it includes a temporary provision that provides a full and immediate write-off for structures in select industries. However, temporary policy does not contribute to long-run growth.

The CREATE JOBS Act prioritizes permanence for the most cost-effective tax reforms—expensing and NCRS—to boost growth in a relatively fiscally responsible way. To further reduce the fiscal impact, policymakers could avoid retroactive extension.

Revenue projections of the CREATE JOBS Act are forthcoming and will be added to this analysis.

Utilities given too much control: opponents Independent power producers contend that ERAS would allow utilities to act as a gatekeeper to the interconnection process.","Dive Brief:

State utility regulators and utilities such as American Electric Power and Southwestern Public Service Co. are urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to approve the Southwest Power Pool’s fast-track interconnection proposal, according to filings at the agency on Thursday.

However, NextEra Energy Resources, other independent power producers, clean energy trade groups and environmental groups asked FERC to reject the proposal, which they contend would give utilities and other “load-responsible entities” the sole ability to select projects for the process without state regulatory review.

“We are concerned that [SPP’s Expedited Resource Adequacy Study] framework will undermine open access and enable preferential grid access for utility-affiliated generation, elevating the risk of uneconomic resources advancing through the queue, locking up transmission capacity, and raising costs for consumers,” the Clean Energy Buyers Association said in a filing.

Dive Insight:

Like some other grid operators, SPP is proposing to address near-term power supply needs by creating a temporary interconnection process that would run separately from its normal interconnection queue.

SPP expects available capacity to drop below its reserve margins by 2027, according to its proposal, which it filed on May 22, a week after FERC rejected a similar proposal from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

Under the proposal, load-responsible entities must verify whether a project can help close their resource adequacy deficiency, according to SPP. To enter the ERAS process, projects must meet readiness standards and other requirements.

State oversight will help prevent utilities and other load-responsible entities from exercising undue preference, according to SPP. “LREs are subject to state regulation that mandates certain processes for resource selection and scrutinizes the prudence of the utility’s resource adequacy procurements, including ensuring cost-effective procurement to protect consumers,” the grid operator said in its proposal.

The ERAS proposal was unanimously supported by the SPP Regional State Committee, which represents utility regulators from 12 states.

“Based on a detailed assessment of projected demand growth, declining reserve margins, and generation interconnection uncertainties, the RSC concludes that the SPP ERAS is essential for maintaining reliability across the SPP region,” the committee said in a Tuesday filing at FERC.

In support of the ERAS proposal, a group of utilities said it also furthers the Trump administration’s national energy dominance policy priorities, which were outlined in executive orders from the president.

“ERAS … squarely addresses the executive orders issued after the declaration of the energy national emergency, answering the call for a more resilient grid that will meet the rising demand in load caused by the need for artificial intelligence dominance,” said the utilities, which include AEP, Evergy, Xcel Energy’s SWEPCO and Nebraska Public Power District.

Utilities given too much control: opponents

Independent power producers contend that ERAS would allow utilities to act as a gatekeeper to the interconnection process.

“ERAS represents an unprecedented departure from nearly thirty years of open access policy that will empower LREs to provide their own and affiliated resources with preferential access to interconnection service while erecting barriers to entry to competing suppliers,” NextEra, Geronimo Power, Pine Gate Renewables, Enel Green Power North America, EDF Renewables, EDP Renewables North America and Clearway Energy Group said in a joint filing.

SPP’s plan has the same flaw as MISO’s version of ERAS, the group’s filing says: it lacks objective criteria to make sure that resources admitted to the process are better suited to meet identified reliability needs than those excluded from the process.

The cap on how much capacity that load-responsible entities can propose for including in ERAS is based on their own resource adequacy forecasts, the companies said, noting that SPP’s proposal allows utilities and other load-responsible entities to update their peak demand values seven days after the opening of the ERAS window.

Clean energy trade groups argued the proposed process lacks adequate oversight.

“ERAS would facilitate utility self-dealing by allowing LREs to access preferential queue treatment with self-supplied generation resources, and lock up valuable transmission capacity — long before a state regulator ever sees the proposed resource, let alone conducts a review for public convenience and necessity,” Advanced Energy United, Advanced Power Alliance, the American Clean Power Association, the Solar Energy Industries Association, the Interwest Energy Alliance and the Colorado Solar and Storage Association said in a joint filing.

SPP’s proposal is based on flawed assumptions and biased evaluations that overstate the grid operator’s estimates of its resource needs, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and Sustainable FERC Project in another joint filing.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/QDiv9TYq0wUC2GsEbsq_DxtsaKs60g1BAdLJ8EuZBWo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDU0MDU2MDk1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-13 17:07:12.440090

Gavin Newsom directing state officials to find another path that would move the state’s drivers toward electric vehicles and encourage companies to make them.
The resolutions Mr. Trump signed on Thursday also revoke waivers for two other California clean-air policies.
One blocks California from requiring that half of all new trucks sold in the state be electric by 2035.
“This is a completely improper use of the Congressional Review Act,” Mr. Bonta said in an interview.","President Trump signed joint resolutions of Congress on Thursday that block California’s effort to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles, his latest attempt to reduce the power of the nation’s most populous state.

The Republican-led Congress passed the resolutions in May to reverse the Biden administration’s approval of California’s electric vehicle efforts. When signed by the president, joint resolutions revoking federal rules carry the force of law and are not subject to judicial review.

Even so, the move drew an immediate legal challenge from California, as well as an executive order from Gov. Gavin Newsom directing state officials to find another path that would move the state’s drivers toward electric vehicles and encourage companies to make them.

Mr. Trump signed the resolutions at a time when he was battling California on several fronts, most notably in a dispute over immigration enforcement, in which the president has sent National Guard and Marine troops to Southern California in an extraordinary use of military force.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump took aim at California’s longstanding authority under the federal Clean Air Act of 1970 to set pollution standards for the state that are more strict than federal limits, and at Governor Newsom’s ambition to fight climate change with an aggressive transition to electric vehicles. Repealing California’s automobile policy is central to Mr. Trump’s agenda of bolstering the production and use of fossil fuels in the United States, while eliminating policies that promote renewable energy and reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Mr. Trump’s action reversed a Biden administration decision that allowed the state to require that electric vehicles make up a progressively larger share of new vehicles sold in California until 2035, when the state would ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars entirely.

Speaking in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Trump called the California plan a “disaster” and said it “would effectively abolish the internal combustion engine, which most people prefer.”

Republican lawmakers, automobile and trucking industry leaders and oil industry executives including John B. Hess, chief executive of the Hess Corporation, were in attendance. California’s policy promoting electric vehicles would have been a major blow to the oil and gas industry.

Anticipating the president’s action, California leaders responded on Thursday with a two-part plan. Rob Bonta, the state attorney general, filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to overturn the resolutions. And Mr. Newsom directed his administration to develop new rules that encourage the use of electric vehicles and reward car manufacturers who agree to follow California’s plan to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles.

“Trump’s all-out assault on California continues, and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement.

Republican lawmakers, automakers and the fossil fuel industry applauded Mr. Trump’s action.

“Everyone agreed these E.V. sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” said John Bozzella, chief executive of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major automakers. “Customers don’t want the government telling them what kind of car to buy,” he said.

For more than 50 years, the Clean Air Act has allowed California to set pollution standards that are stricter than federal rules, as long as the state obtains waivers for them from the Environmental Protection Agency.

The resolutions Mr. Trump signed on Thursday also revoke waivers for two other California clean-air policies. One blocks California from requiring that half of all new trucks sold in the state be electric by 2035. Another stops the state from putting limits on allowable emissions of nitrogen oxide from cars and trucks. Those emissions can form smog and contribute to respiratory problems like asthma.

Chris Spear, president of the American Trucking Associations, said that ending California’s electric truck policy was “common sense,” because the policy would have forced long-haul trucks and others to transition away from diesel power far faster than the existing infrastructure for electric vehicles could support.

“We looked at this as a mad dash to zero,” Mr. Spear said.

Ten other states joined California’s lawsuit challenging the legality of all three resolutions, which were the first ever passed by Congress to revoke California’s Clean Air Act waivers.

With nearly 40 million residents, California has enormous market power on its own, and 11 other states had intended to follow the state’s lead on electric vehicles. Together, they account for about 40 percent of the U.S. auto market. Manufacturers do not want to create two separate fleets, one for those states and one for states that go on allowing unlimited sales of gasoline-powered vehicles, so California’s policy would have had an impact nationwide.

Republicans have come to resent California’s market influence, and they have long hoped to repeal California’s ability to shape how consumer products are made and sold.

State leaders argue that the federal revocation of California’s waivers will harm public health and reduce economic benefits created by the state’s clean-car plan. Pollution from gasoline-powered cars has been linked to respiratory illness, cardiovascular problems and cancer, Mr. Bonta said, and the plan to phase them out has spurred technological innovations that have boosted California’s economy.

“We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a president who is a wholly owned subsidiary of big polluters,” Mr. Newsom said.

The crux of the lawsuit is an allegation that Congress illegally used the Congressional Review Act to pass the resolutions that Mr. Trump signed. The 1996 act allows lawmakers, by a simple majority vote, to overturn rules that have been approved recently by the executive branch. Republicans asserted that the act also allowed Congress to overturn the E.P.A. waivers.

The Senate passed the resolutions over the objections of the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian and an independent watchdog, which both had ruled that lawmakers lacked the legal authority to revoke the waivers.

“This is a completely improper use of the Congressional Review Act,” Mr. Bonta said in an interview. “The Congressional Review Act applies to rules, not to waivers. It’s never been applied to any waiver, ever.”

But the act includes a provision that could stymie California’s lawsuit, because it prohibits judicial review of actions passed under the act.

The lawsuit argues that the resolutions Mr. Trump signed violate the constitutional separation of powers and encroach on states’ rights, and says that “the federal government blasted gaping holes in longstanding state regulatory programs.”

California’s ability to set tough emissions standards dates back to 1970, when heavy smog clouded the skies of Los Angeles. Since then, the state has received dozens of waivers allowing a range of policies to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Air quality has improved, but remains poor in some regions, particularly in the Central Valley. State leaders see the transition to electric cars as a tool to improve it.

California’s ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered cars did not apply to used vehicles, so it would not have completely eliminated them from the roads. But voter concerns about the state’s high cost of living gave Republicans and some Democrats reason to object to California’s plan, because electric vehicles tend to cost more than comparable gasoline-powered models.

The executive order that Mr. Newsom signed Thursday directs the California Air Resources Board to come up with new ways to encourage electric vehicle use and reduce emissions, according to the governor’s office. Under it, the state would prioritize funding for E.V. rebates and will seek to develop new incentive programs. And it would steer state agencies to purchase fleet vehicles from manufacturers who agree to phase out new gasoline-powered cars.

“I’m signing an executive order to keep California on track with our world-leading transition to cleaner cars,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/12/multimedia/12nat-ca-waiver-clqv/12nat-ca-waiver-clqv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:06:33.572466

With this action, President Trump is bringing back common sense, reversing the dangerous and costly energy subtraction policies pursued by the last administration.
Today’s announcement by President Trump represents a return to sound science and common-sense.
Thankfully, President Trump has revoked the Biden Administration’s “Restoring Healthy and Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish Populations in the Columbia River Basin” Memorandum.
This was exactly the right thing to do and provides a foundation for protection of the Four Lower Snake River dams.","President Donald J. Trump took bold action to revoke the Biden Administration’s “Restoring Healthy and Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish Populations in the Columbia River Basin” Memorandum, which would have eliminated secure and reliable energy sources.

Key administration officials, Members of Congress, and industry leaders are supporting President Trump’s action to restore common sense to the Columbia River Basin:

Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum: “This administration will not stand by while American energy is threatened. We are fiercely committed to keeping energy affordable, reliable, and made in America. Today, President Trump took decisive action revoking a Biden-era policy that jeopardized four critical hydroelectric dams powering communities along the Snake River. Now is not the time to shut down American energy. Instead, we’re keeping the lights on, costs low, and putting the American people first.”

Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright: “The Snake River Dams have been tremendous assets to the Pacific Northwest for decades, providing high-value electricity to millions of American families and businesses. With this action, President Trump is bringing back common sense, reversing the dangerous and costly energy subtraction policies pursued by the last administration. American taxpayer dollars will not be spent dismantling critical infrastructure, reducing our energy-generating capacity or on radical nonsense policies that dramatically raise prices on the American people.”

Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick: “For far too long, we’ve sidelined America’s energy potential in the name of politicized programs that had nothing to do with real conservation efforts and hurt our farmers, fishers, and producers. President Trump’s actions today will give families access to reliable, affordable energy and redefine how we safeguard our environment.”

Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, D. Lee Forsgren: “Under President Trump’s leadership, the Army Corps is eager to work with our federal partners to advance American energy dominance and provide vital flood risk management, navigation, hydropower generation, water supply and recreation benefits to the Pacific Northwest and the nation.”

White House Council on Environmental Quality Chief of Staff, Katherine Scarlett: “President Trump has once again showcased his commitment to unleash American energy dominance and prioritize policies that work for everyday Americans. The Council on Environmental Quality stands ready to coordinate with agencies to save millions of dollars of federal funds that would have otherwise been wasted on misguided policies, hindering the advancement of reliable energy sources.”

U.S. Senator Mike Crapo (ID): “President Trump is demonstrating once again his commitment to listening to the will of people on the ground and the sound science that backs the current state of the dams. The Biden Administration’s controversial proposal was doomed from the start. The flawed initiative ignored congressional authority over the dams, as well as the views and feedback of regional stakeholders and constituents in Idaho. The path forward for a solution to salmon recovery must include a truly collaborative approach that involves all—including both public and private—stakeholders in the region.”

U.S. Senator Steve Daines (MT): “The Snake River Dams support agriculture production, provide a reliable energy source, and provide critical transportation. Biden’s Columbia River Memorandum was an attempt to breach the dams and appease radical environmentalist groups, with Montana communities left to pay the price. I’m grateful for President Trump’s leadership in revoking this damaging policy and for his consistent track record of supporting Montana-first priorities.”

U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (WY): “For far too long, the Biden administration’s anti-American energy policies stifled American energy production and burdened western communities. I applaud President Trump’s decision to restore common-sense energy policies that will unleash our nation’s vast natural resources and create good-paying jobs while strengthening America’s energy independence and national security. The west has long been ready to lead America’s energy renaissance, and the Trump administration’s commitment to removing regulatory barriers will benefit not just our region, but all Americans who deserve affordable, reliable energy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​“

U.S. Senator Jim Risch (ID): “The Biden administration’s one-sided, backroom agreement blatantly disregarded the essential role the lower Snake River dams play and the Idaho communities that rely on them. Today’s announcement by President Trump represents a return to sound science and common-sense. I’ve long fought the attempts by radical Democrats, unelected bureaucrats, and activist litigants to tear down our dams. Congress authorized these dams, and only Congress has the power to remove them.”

U.S. Representative Cliff Bentz (OR-02): “I have worked for more than 30 years to protect the irreplaceable Columbia River hydropower electrical system. The Biden Administration did its best to initiate the destruction of that system through improper manipulation of environmental laws and policies. This manipulation was reflected in a memorandum of understanding. Thankfully, President Trump has revoked the Biden Administration’s “Restoring Healthy and Abundant Salmon, Steelhead, and Other Native Fish Populations in the Columbia River Basin” Memorandum. This was exactly the right thing to do and provides a foundation for protection of the Four Lower Snake River dams. The President’s order is totally consistent with our nation’s fight to win the race for artificial intelligence, superiority, and energy dominance. The people of nation and especially the rate payers of the Northwest are incredibly grateful for this action.”

U.S. Representative Russ Fulcher (ID-01): “President Trump’s action to revoke the misguided 2023 Biden memorandum, which quietly laid the groundwork for breaching the Lower Snake River dams, puts a stop to an alarming effort to bypass Congress. I applaud this decision for standing up and responding to those of us who called on the Administration to stop this reckless attempt to tear out critical infrastructure in the West!”

U.S. Representative Dan Newhouse (WA-04): “Throughout my time in Congress, I have stood firm in my support for the Lower Snake River Dams and the critical role they play in our region’s economy. Today’s action by President Trump reverses the efforts by the Biden administration and extreme environmental activists to remove the dams, which would have threatened the reliability of our power grid, raised energy prices, and decimated our ability to export grain to foreign markets. I want to thank the President for his decisive action to protect our dams, and I look forward to continuing to work with the administration for the benefit of the Fourth District.”

Idaho Lt. Governor, Scott Bedke: “The Lower Snake River dams are essential to Idaho’s way of life. They provide irrigation, energy, and access to markets. The Biden plan threatened all of that without real input from the people who would have paid the price. President Trump is right to shut down the deal. Idaho is ready to help unleash America’s energy dominance.”

National Grain and Feed Association, Mike Seyfert, President and CEO: “We applaud the Trump administration’s leadership in rescinding the 2023 directives and recognizing the fact that these dams are critical to transporting U.S. grain and oilseeds to global markets. One barge tow moves the equivalent of 140 rail cars or 538 trucks – infrastructure that cannot be easily replaced. Breaching the dams would have caused a ripple effect throughout the U.S. agricultural value chain, and a significantly negative impact on U.S. exports and the rural economy.”

National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Jim Matheson, CEO: “President Trump’s announcement smartly helps preserve affordable, reliable electricity for families and businesses across the Pacific Northwest,” Matheson said. “Hydroelectric power is the reason the lights stay on in the region. And as demand for electricity surges across the nation, preserving access to always-available energy resources like hydropower is absolutely crucial. We appreciate the administration’s continuing commitment to smart energy policies and unleashing American energy.”

Northwest Public Power Association, Kurt Miller, Executive Director and CEO: “This withdrawal is a necessary course correction toward energy reliability, affordability, and transparency.”

Northwest RiverPartners, Clark Mather, Executive Director: “Now is the time to come together and chart a sustainable path toward effective solutions that protect salmon and maintain affordable and reliable hydropower needed by millions of people in the Pacific Northwest. This politicized agreement between the former administration and only a fraction of impacted sovereign entities, devalued hydropower, our region’s largest source of affordable, clean electricity. Northwest RiverPartners remains committed to working with all sovereign Tribes, state leaders and other stakeholders to identify science-based, durable solutions.”

Pacific Northwest Waterways Association, Neil Maunu, Executive Director: “The divisive issue of dam breaching has prevented the type of partnerships necessary to work together on productive strategies and actions to improve salmon populations for the benefit of all Pacific Northwest residents. We can have salmon and a robust economy at the same time.”",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 16:02:32.309663

The dispute between California and the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.
""Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process.
Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act.
Congress also blocked California’s 2020 Advanced Clean Trucks rule, an unprecedented measure that requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035.","President Donald Trump on yesterday signed three measures that block California’s mandates to phase out gas-powered cars and clean up diesel trucks. And California immediately struck back with a lawsuit and a vow to continue setting standards.

The move by Trump and Congress deals a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles and could upend its decades-long authority to clean up its air pollution, which is the worst in the nation.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate,” Trump said at the White House. “And they’re never coming back.” He said the state's zero-emission car phaseout ""has been a disaster for this country.""

Last month, Congress used the Congressional Review Act to revoke three waivers that the Biden administration granted to California to set standards phasing out gas-powered cars and diesel trucks. Trump’s signing makes that official. The dispute between California and the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.

Many legal experts, along with the Government Accountability Office and Senate Parliamentarian, said Congress has no authority to revoke the waivers.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit against Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, arguing that it’s an unlawful use of the review act.

""Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process. We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement Thursday.

Ten other states that are enforcing California's emissions rules joined the lawsuit — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

Newsom on Thursday also issued an executive order that reaffirms the state's commitment to phasing out gas and diesel-powered vehicles. He directed the Air Resources Board to craft another mandate for cars and trucks — to either bolster its existing mandates or replace them in case they lose in court.

Newsom also directed the air board to create a public list of automakers and truck manufacturers that are following California's emissions rules, and companies that take early action to convert fleets to zero-emission trucks ""regardless of the status of those regulations under federal law."" And he ordered state agencies within 60 days to determine what more can be done to help consumers with the transition to electric vehicles, including eliminating obstacles to building more charging stations.

Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act. Before now, the federal government has never blocked any of California’s dozens of rules.

Under California’s mandate enacted in 2022, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. It builds on decades of tightening emissions standards for cars sold in the state.

Congress also blocked California’s 2020 Advanced Clean Trucks rule, an unprecedented measure that requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035. A third vote revoked the waiver for a 2020 state regulation reducing nitrogen oxides — a key ingredient of smog — emitted by trucks and buses..

Trump said his actions mean those rules ""are fully and expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act and cannot be implemented.""

""Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation,"" he wrote.

By Karl A. Karg, Stacey L. VanBelleghem, Nikki Buffa, Devin M. O’Connor, and G. Jack Mathews

On June 11, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a proposed rule under the Clean Air Act (CAA) titled “Repeal of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units” (the Proposed Repeal).

Under the current Obama- and Biden-era greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations, new fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs) are subject to GHG emissions standards. Certain existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs must reduce their GHG emissions rates by specific amounts over a period of years leading to 2032, and in some instances, these requirements depend on their planned retirement date. (For more details, see this blog post.)

The current GHG regulations are subject to ongoing litigation in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, but those cases have been paused, pending EPA’s reconsideration of the challenged rules. In the interim, the Trump administration issued the Proposed Repeal to revoke the Obama and Biden administrations’ GHG emission rules.

The Proposed Repeal

The Proposed Repeal outlines and seeks comment on alternative grounds for repeal. The primary approach would repeal both the Obama and Biden administrations’ GHG emissions rules for new and existing EGUs. A secondary, alternative approach would repeal the emissions guidelines for existing coal-fired power plants, the emissions standards for coal-fired power plants undertaking a large modification, and the emissions standards for new base load combustion turbines (i.e., natural gas-fired EGUs), while leaving in place certain other standards for new sources. The Proposed Repeal’s inclusion of these options will provide EPA some flexibility on how to proceed after gathering public comment.

Primary Approach

Under the primary approach, EPA would make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” In contrast to previous GHG power plant rules, EPA now interprets CAA Section 111 to require EPA to make this finding specifically for a source category before EPA can regulate GHGs for that category. EPA proposes this interpretive change, pointing to contextual arguments regarding certain provisions of the CAA and prior EPA practice. EPA also notes and seeks comment on certain potential legal considerations for its reinterpretation, including reliance interests on prior interpretations, the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, and the major questions doctrine.

After describing this statutory interpretation in the Proposed Repeal, EPA explains its proposed finding that fossil fuel-fired EGUs do not significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution. As an initial matter, in a nod to Loper Bright, EPA states that CAA Section 111 delegates authority and confers discretion to EPA to consider policy issues in determining the meaning of “significantly contributes,” including cost and effectiveness of emissions controls, impacts on industry, and impacts of emissions on public health and welfare.

EPA’s proposed findings include that GHGs are global pollutants and that US power plants’ emissions are low in comparison to global concentrations of GHGs. EPA proposes finding that fossil fuel-fired EGUs do not significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution, and therefore proposes to “repeal all [GHG] emission standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants.”

Secondary Approach

As an alternative, the Proposed Repeal would revoke a more specific set of requirements that are based on 90% carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) as a Best System of Emission Reductions (BSER) at existing fossil fuel-fired steam EGUs that intend to operate in the longer-term, coal-fired steam EGUs undertaking large modifications, and new base load stationary combustion turbines. EPA concludes that 90% CCS is not BSER for the relevant EGUs because “it has not been adequately demonstrated and because the costs are not reasonable.”

EPA also proposes that 40% co-firing of natural gas is not BSER for coal-fired power plants that intend to operate in the medium term. EPA determines that coal-fired power plants co-firing natural gas are an inefficient use of natural gas and constitute generation shifting, which the Supreme Court has previously found to exceed EPA’s statutory authority under CAA Section 111. Therefore, EPA is proposing to repeal the previous BSER determinations along with any emissions guideline requirements and associated presumptive performance standards. EPA would repeal existing emissions guidelines related to natural gas- and oil-fired steam EGUs as well, because they “comprise a relatively small part of the source category” such that any benefit from reductions would be offset by the cost of preparing state plans. This would eliminate or reduce most of the performance targets for the power sector.

Under either approach, EPA’s regulation of GHGs at power plants would be curtailed. The primary approach is a more absolute declaration that the requirements of CAA Section 111 have not been met and that EPA’s previous attempts to regulate GHGs in the power sector were invalid. The secondary approach does not make the same statutory declaration, but it does eliminate much of the practical impact by declaring that CCS and forcing natural gas co-firing at coal-fired plants are not BSER and may exceed EPA’s authority Section 111 as well. The secondary approach would eliminate or reduce most of the performance targets for the power sector with no clear indication from EPA that they would replace them in the near term.

Potential Impact

The Proposed Repeal follows the Trump administration’s January 20, 2025, executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” which directs all federal agencies to review and identify actions that may impose undue burdens on domestic energy production.

If enacted, the Proposed Repeal will have a significant impact on many existing and future power-generation facilities that are otherwise facing significant compliance obligations to reduce their operations, offset their emissions, and/or implement new technologies such as CCS. EPA estimates that the Proposed Repeal will create compliance cost savings of up to $19 billion. EPA’s regulatory impact analysis also includes an assessment of estimated foregone health co-benefits associated with anticipated criteria pollutant reductions related to the rules EPA proposes to revoke.

EPA’s economic and other technical considerations, along with the proposed interpretive findings, are likely to face extensive public comment and litigation challenges if they are finalized.

Next Steps

EPA will hold a public hearing 15 days after the Proposed Repeal is published in the Federal Register and will accept comments on the proposal until 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

On March 12, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to repeal Biden-era regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions, including the updated Clean Power Plan and stricter Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS).

This move aligns with President Trump’s energy agenda and is framed as part of the “Power the Great American Comeback” campaign. According to the EPA, the rollback could save the power sector $19 billion over two decades, or roughly $1.2 billion per year, starting in 2026.

Trump-Era EPA Move Targets Biden’s Climate Rules: Will the Climate Impact Be Severe?

EPA Administrator Zeldin highlighted,

“Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream and a natural byproduct of national energy dominance. According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence.”

The 2024 Clean Power Plan 2.0, finalized under the Biden administration, was expected to cut 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2047. That’s equivalent to taking over 320 million gasoline-powered cars off the road for a year.

The U.S. is the world’s second-largest emitter and has the highest per-capita emissions. That puts a big responsibility on the country to lead climate action.

But hitting the 2030 climate goal won’t be easy. The Rhodium Group says emissions must fall by 7.6% every year from 2025 to 2030. And undoubtedly, that’s a steep drop.

By revoking this plan, the U.S. risks losing one of its most ambitious tools for slashing power sector emissions. The plan also targeted other air pollutants known to harm human health, including fine particulates and heavy metals like mercury and arsenic.

EPA Seeks End to CO₂ Limits for Power Plants

The EPA’s proposal includes eliminating all greenhouse gas standards under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act for both new and existing fossil fuel plants. The agency argues that CO₂ emissions from power plants do not significantly contribute to “dangerous air pollution” as defined under the Act. Therefore, they say these emissions shouldn’t be regulated in this way.

The proposal would also reverse a 2024 rule requiring carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology on new natural gas and modified coal plants. Instead, the EPA is considering less strict efficiency-based rules for new gas plants.

RELATED: Is Trump’s Coal Comeback Derailing America’s Climate Commitments?

Repeal of Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) Amendments

Alongside the carbon rules, the EPA wants to eliminate amendments made in 2024 to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. These changes had tightened mercury and particulate matter limits for coal- and oil-fired plants. The rollback would revert the standards to their 2012 levels.

The agency estimates this repeal could save the power industry another $1.2 billion over ten years beginning in 2028. However, environmental groups argue that the 2024 MATS updates were necessary to protect communities, especially in states like West Virginia, Texas, and North Carolina, where coal power remains a key energy source.

Cites Supreme Court Ruling in Justification

The EPA is leaning on the 2022 Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v. EPA, which limited the agency’s authority to reshape the U.S. energy mix under the “major questions doctrine.” Critics of the Biden administration’s rule say it tried to revive the original Clean Power Plan, which had been blocked by the courts years earlier.

It now argues that regulating power plant CO₂ emissions exceeds its authority and shifts energy decisions away from states and consumers.

Energy Security vs. Climate Commitments

The rollback is being pitched as an effort to lower energy costs, boost national security, and strengthen U.S. manufacturing. Supporters say it removes red tape for coal and gas plants that supply reliable baseload power, especially important for sectors like AI, data centers, and heavy industry.

But critics argue that the proposed changes put the U.S. at odds with its international climate commitments. The Biden administration had pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and cutting power plant emissions is a key part of that roadmap.

What’s Next for U.S. Climate Policy?

The proposed repeals are subject to public comment before being finalized. However, the EPA’s new direction signals a dramatic shift away from federal climate regulation—one that could reshape everything from clean energy incentives to carbon trading strategies.

For now, the message from the EPA is clear: the focus is shifting from emissions cuts to energy affordability and independence. But at what cost? The answer may lie in future carbon market trends, climate data, and the response from U.S. states and industries.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_2187169479.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 16:02:16.475253

Company last requested a regulatory review of rates in 2022

GREENVILLE, S.C., June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy Progress today asked South Carolina regulators to perform a public review of the company's current rates.

This is the company's first request to review rates since 2022. It comes as the company continues working to increase system diversity and reliability, enhance the customer experience and meet future energy demands.

Duke Energy Progress serves about 177,000 customers primarily in central and northeastern South Carolina.

By the numbers: The company's application in front of the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) requests an overall revenue increase of $74.8 million, which represents a 12.1% increase over current revenues.

If approved, monthly electric bills for typical residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase $21.66 a month – from $144.85 per month to $166.51 – effective Feb. 1, 2026. Commercial customers will see an average increase of 12.8% and industrial customers will see an average increase of around 3.6%. The amount of increase per customer class can vary based upon how much more additional revenue is needed to ensure that the class is covering the cost to serve them.

Why it matters: Duke Energy is committed to meeting customers' increasingly higher expectations around reliability, responsiveness, affordability and value.

This proposal reflects the investments we have made to strengthen the grid, improve storm readiness, maintain and enhance our generating fleet and serve a growing customer base.

It also reflects how the company is doing that work: with discipline, with a focus on operational excellence, and with a thoughtful approach to how and when we seek rate adjustments.

Investments in action: The company's grid investments have positioned it well for storm response.

For example, as Hurricane Helene made its way across the Carolinas, grid improvements were already helping to combat power outages from the storm.

Smart, self-healing technology installed across the Duke Energy Progress service territory helped to automatically restore more than 10,000 customer outages and saved more than 28,000 hours of total outage time, showing the value of the self-healing programs.

Our view:

""We know families and businesses are juggling a lot and we do not take a request to increase rates lightly but being upfront and timely with our request is the right thing to do and in the best interest of our customers."" – Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president

Background:

Since he helped establish the RFS in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Grassley has worked to ensure the executive branch implements the law as intended. Grassley also supported the Energy Independence Security Act of 2007, which included requirements for cellulosic ethanol and set a mandatory RFS requiring fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel in 2022. Grassley pushed ensuing administrations to keep to this number. Last Congress, Grassley joined the No Fuel Credits for Batteries Act to nullify a proposed Biden-era E-RINS rule that props up the EV industry while devaluing incentives for ethanol and biodiesel expansion.

But behind their mechanical might lies a quieter, more pressing issue that impacts all of us: energy usage.

Electric motors are among the top energy utilizing components in industrial operations. As global energy demands rise, improving the efficiency of these motors is no longer a technical upgrade—it is a strategic and financial necessity.

The Scale of the Challenge

Electric motors account for nearly 45% of global electricity usage, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). In energy-intensive sectors like mining, oil and gas, pulp and paper and steel production, large motors—500 horsepower (hp) or higher—often turn equipment like pumps and fans continuously, consuming vast amounts of power.

This scale of usage means that even small improvements in efficiency can lead to significant energy savings. For example, a single 94% standard efficient 600 hp motor operating 24/7 at an electricity rate of $0.10 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) can cost over $400,000 annually to run. Multiply that type of operating expense across a facility—or an entire industry—and the numbers become staggering.

Dollars & Sense: The Economic Case

When evaluating motor systems, many organizations focus on upfront acquisition costs, but the reality is that the purchase price of a motor represents just 5%-10% of its total cost of ownership. The remaining 90%-95% of the cost comes from energy consumption over the motor’s lifetime.

This is where energy efficiency becomes a powerful lever for cost reduction. A motor that is just 1%-2% more efficient can save tens of thousands of dollars per year in reduced energy costs. Over a 15- to 20-year lifespan, those savings can easily exceed the initial purchase price multiple times over.

Breaking Down Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

For a simplified example, consider a user who is comparing two motors:

Standard efficiency motor: 600 hp

(478 kilowatts [kW]), 94% efficiency, $40,000 purchase price

Super premium efficiency motor:

600 hp (478 kW), 96.5% efficiency, $55,000 purchase price

Assuming continuous operation (8,750 hours/year), an electricity rate of $0.10/kWh and that the high efficiency motor costs 15%-25% more in acquisition:

Standard motor annual energy use:

448 / 0.940 * 8,750 = 4,170,000 kWh

$417,000/year

High-efficiency motor annual energy use:

448 / 0.965 * 8,750 = 4,060,000 kWh

$406,000/year

Annual savings: $11,000

Payback period: Less than 2 years

20-year savings: Nearly $220,000

Environmental Impact: A Hidden Carbon Footprint

The environmental implications of inefficient motors are equally significant. In regions where electricity is still largely generated from hydrocarbons, every kilowatt-hour saved translates into a reduction in greenhouse gas producing emissions. On average, saving 1,000 kWh of electricity avoids the release of 500 to 1,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2).

For companies with sustainability targets—whether self-imposed or driven by governmental directives—motor efficiency offers a clear, measurable path to reducing Scope 2 emissions. Moreover, as carbon pricing and emissions reporting become more widespread, reducing energy use is not just good for our planet—it is good for the bottom line.

Easing the Strain on Power Infrastructure

Beyond individual facilities, improving motor efficiency has broader implications for the electrical grid. High-efficiency motors reduce peak demand, helping to stabilize the grid and reduce the risk of blackouts.

They also allow utilities to defer costly infrastructure upgrades due to population growth, such as expanding substations or upgrading transmission lines. In regions with aging power infrastructure or limited generation capacity, this can be a game changer. For utilities, it means fewer capital expenditures. For industries, it means more reliable power and fewer disruptions.

Regulatory Pressures & Compliance

Governments around the world are tightening efficiency standards for electric motors. In the U.S., the Department of Energy (DOE) mandates minimum efficiency levels for most industrial

motors up to 500 hp.

The European Union enforces similar rules under its Ecodesign Directive, and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has established global efficiency classes (IE1 through IE4 and beyond).

Reliability & Performance Gains

Energy-efficient motors do not just save money; they also perform better. Because they generate less heat for the same power level, they experience less thermal stress, which translates into longer service life and fewer breakdowns. This reduces maintenance costs and improves uptime, both critical factors in industries where downtime can cost tens of thousands of dollars per hour.

Additionally, efficient motors often have better power factor and lower harmonic distortion, which improves overall system stability and reduces energy losses across the electrical network.

These performance benefits further reduce the total cost of ownership by minimizing unplanned outages, extending maintenance intervals and reducing the need for spare parts and labor.

A Competitive Advantage

In today’s market, energy efficiency is more than a cost-saving measure—it is a competitive differentiator. Companies that invest in efficient motor systems can:

Lower their production costs

Enhance their sustainability credentials

Qualify for green certifications like Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 50001

Attract environmentally conscious investors and users

Looking Beyond the Motor

It is important to remember that motor efficiency does not exist in a vacuum. The motor is part of a larger system, often including drives, gearboxes, pumps, fans and control systems. Optimizing the entire system can yield even greater savings.

For example, pairing a high-efficiency motor with a variable frequency drive (VFD) can allow for precise speed control, reducing energy use in variable-load applications. Conducting a motor system audit can identify opportunities to right-size equipment, eliminate unnecessary loads and improve overall performance.

A Strategic Imperative

Energy efficiency in large motors is not a niche concern; it is a strategic imperative that touches every aspect of industrial operations. From reducing operating costs and carbon emissions to improving reliability and regulatory compliance, the benefits are clear and compelling.

As industries search for ways to maximize return on the capital expenditures (capex) investment, the electric motor emerges as a powerful ally. By prioritizing efficiency, companies can not only future-proof their operations but also contribute meaningfully to a more sustainable world.",https://www.pumpsandsystems.com/sites/default/files/2025-06/Pump_101_ABB_IMG1_980x400_0725.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:09:04.078618

This action issued by President Donald J. Trump, protects the power generation of four hydroelectric dams on the Snake River within the Columbia River Basin.

“This administration will not stand by while American energy is threatened. We are fiercely committed to keeping energy affordable, reliable, and made in America. Today, President Trump took decisive action revoking a Biden-era policy that jeopardized four critical hydroelectric dams powering communities along the Snake River. Now is not the time to shut down American energy. Instead, we’re keeping the lights on, costs low, and putting the American people first,” said Secretary Doug Burgum.

The Columbia River Basin is one of the largest hydropower producing regions of the country – producing nearly 44 percent of our country’s hydropower and over 29 gigawatts of generating capacity. This Biden administration policy threatened to eliminate over 3,000 megawatts of secure and reliable hydroelectric generating capacity in this area – which is enough generation to power 2.5 million American homes.

Under President Trump, Secretary Burgum and the Department of the Interior are advancing stable and low-cost hydropower. Hydropower is not only one of the oldest sources of energy – powering our nation for more than 100 years – but it provides reliable and affordable energy for more than 30 million American homes. Beyond powering our homes, hydropower plants can also dispatch power immediately to our nation’s energy grids, helping balance the grids and providing essential back-up power during electricity outages or disruptions.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-06-13 18:24:34+00:00,Heatmap News,The Rule That Would Make IRA Tax Credits 'Unworkable' - Heatmap News,Matthew Zeitlin,,,,,https://heatmap.news/energy/feoc-one-big-beautiful-bill,"The word of the moment in renewable energy is “unworkable.” That’s how the chief executives of two major renewables developers — John Ketchum of NextEra and Jim Murphy of Invenergy — described new requirements inserted into clean energy tax credits by congressional Republicans in recent weeks.
Starting in 2026, the bill mandates that developers seeking to claim the clean energy production or investment tax credits may not receive “material assistance” from China.
Similar strictures were also added to the 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit.
You’re disqualified, all your tax credits for that small modular reactor go away,” Ketchum said.
And then there’s the deadline to even qualify for the clean energy tax credits in the first place, starting construction two months after the bill passes, according to the House language.","The word of the moment in renewable energy is “unworkable.” That’s how the chief executives of two major renewables developers — John Ketchum of NextEra and Jim Murphy of Invenergy — described new requirements inserted into clean energy tax credits by congressional Republicans in recent weeks.

“The way they’re drafted, they’re unworkable,” Ketchum said of the requirements at a Politico summit held earlier this week. He was referring specifically to a new set of provisions in the House budget reconciliation bill which say that to qualify for the credits, companies must divest their supply chains from “foreign entities of concern,” a group of countries comprising Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China. But really, the rules are about China.

Around 80% of the global solar panel supply chain runs through China, according to the International Energy Agency. The batteries used in many stationary storage systems are almost entirely made in China, to name just a couple isolated examples. Starting in 2026, the bill mandates that developers seeking to claim the clean energy production or investment tax credits may not receive “material assistance” from China. That refers to any component or subcomponent (including critical minerals) that was “extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled” by a “prohibited foreign entity,” defined as a company with at least 25% Chinese ownership or 10% Chinese debt holdings, according to a memo by the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. The rules become even more strict in 2028. Similar strictures were also added to the 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit.

A small modular reactor has at least 10,000 component parts, Ketchum told the Politico audience. “We come to find out that one of the screws in the bolts, used by one of the suppliers five layers down … was actually sourcing the bolt and the screw from China. Guess what happens? You’re disqualified, all your tax credits for that small modular reactor go away,” Ketchum said.

“How in the world are you going to trace five layers down to a subcontractor who’s buying a bolt and a screw?”

Murphy, the Invenergy CEO, put it more succinctly at an industry conference last week. “The supply chain can not support that, and won’t be able to support that for several years. It’s just an unworkable provision.”

While these may sound like the exaggerations of executives eager to avoid paperwork or costly new investments, analysts who have looked at the bill’s language have similarly concluded that the language is both so vague and so broad that determining whether a company has complied would be almost impossible.

Analysts at the investment bank Evercore wrote in a note to clients last week that while the new FEOC framework “ostensibly aims to keep China out of U.S. energy supply chains, it would likely bury companies and their suppliers in such onerous paperwork and diligence that the remaining tax credits are rendered largely unusable.”

Foreign entity of concern rules are not new — versions of them appear in the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act’s electric vehicle tax credits. The FEOC rules in the One Big, Beautiful Bill are far more extensive, however.

The Senate may look to loosen the rules, according to Axios, and several House Republicans have signed (yet another) letter, this one referring to the restrictions as “highly restrictive and onerous” and “overly prescriptive and risk undermining U.S. competitiveness.”

Should the FEOC provisions become law, their exact implementation will be up to the IRS. In the case of EVs, the tax agency came out with proposed guidelines in the months after the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted, but didn’t finalize them until 2024. Even complying with those required a “Herculean” effort from the EV and battery industry, Albert Gore, head of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, told me.

Gore also questioned whether the rules would be “workable” as written. To determine whether compliance would be worth it, Gore said, you have to evaluate how close an industry is to complying in the present, and the value of complying in the future, and the cost to get there.

Given that the clean energy and manufacturing credits sunset after 2031 (except for wind components, which sunset earlier), that calculation may very well come out negative. And then there’s the deadline to even qualify for the clean energy tax credits in the first place, starting construction two months after the bill passes, according to the House language.

The EV rules did ultimately support U.S. manufacturing, Gore told me. “It was a pretty efficient investment in American manufacturing, kind of disguised as a consumer EV credit,” he said. “But it was a very, very stringent credit.”

Xan Fishman, senior managing director of the energy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center, was skeptical that the FEOC provisions in the budget reconciliation bill would do anything to bolster U.S. manufacturing. “Intricate and complicated doesn’t make it more effective,” he told me.

“You would have a disallowance of credit if you are a foreign entity of concern, or you are a foreign influenced entity of concern, which might mean that one of your suppliers is a foreign entity of concern, or one of your supplier’s board members is from China or they have a family member that’s from China that runs a foreign entity of concern, or that family member has some business transaction involving debt with a foreign entity of concern, and their suppliers actually might have board members who have family members who have some debt arrangement with the foreign Institute of concern,” Fishman elaborated.

This is where workability really comes in.

“If the result of this is we have less U.S. manufacturing, we won’t have achieved the goal” of raising America’s global competitiveness. “Nor will we have been tough on China,” Fishman said.

The ironies of the legislation abound. “There's sort of that double whammy in there with the start of construction deadline, which to some extent, makes the FEOC moot,” Murphy, the Invenergy CEO, said at the conference. “If you don't start construction by the deadline, who cares about it?”

Ironically, if the Senate put in a more relaxed deadline to qualify for the credits, “then we have to really address those foreign entity of concern provisions,” Murphy added.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDkzODMzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NzMyNjg3Mn0.zZ8HazjqEdExo2NqVv3BFjHoOrC0AiPfF8WvwRUMkME/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C200,N,,2025-06-13 15:03:12.160791

Job Growth and Trade Diversification Clean energy investments are both a job growth and economic diversification strategy.

By investing in clean energy, Canada will be able to attract more investment to diversify our economy and trade partners.","Concerns over the stability of the global economy are running high. Prime Minister Carney’s priority list for the upcoming G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta included energy security and stronger economic partnerships, both of which can be delivered with a focus on building the clean economy. Here’s how:

Cost Stability and Affordability

Clean energy economies run on localized renewable energy sources that are much less vulnerable to the fluctuating costs of imported energy commodities.

While most countries still rely on imported fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) for their energy mix, demand for clean energy is growing rapidly as the business case for electrification and clean energy gets better and better. Clean energy doesn’t just offer more stable energy costs, it’s cheaper, too. Renewables are already less expensive sources of power than fossil fuels and costs will continue to fall. In 2023, 81 percent of newly-commissioned renewable projects produced cheaper electricity than fossil fuel alternatives. And the cost of battery storage (which helps balance out intermittent energy sources like wind and solar in the electricity grid) is projected to drop by 50 percent by 2035. These factors have contributed to the rollout of renewables being even faster than anticipated. Global renewable capacity is on track to exceed countries’ current ambitions by nearly 25 percent by 2030.

Energy Security

With geopolitical tensions and trade under threat, localized clean energy is a good bet, according to the global investment firm the Carlyle Group. That’s because over half of fossil fuels are transported through three vulnerable trade chokepoints. Many countries are questioning the security of imported fuel supplies, and are instead prioritizing the clean economy, where they can reduce their risk by investing in manufacturing or importing tech once that allows them to generate their own power for decades.

Even though Canada has abundant energy of all kinds, we’re not immune to these concerns. Energy commodities are globally traded, meaning Canada can’t control the price — which impacts both producers and Canadian consumers. While we have security of supply, we don’t have cost security. Our electricity demand is projected to double by 2050, highlighting the need for resilient and reliable energy sources. Across the Canadian economy, sectors are increasingly electrifying due to the rapid adoption of new technologies (i.e., electric vehicles, arc furnaces for steel production, heat pumps for homes) and the expansion of new industries (data centres, carbon removal). Low-cost and low-risk clean energy sources can help Canada build the energy security — and cost stability — we need to provide Canadians with affordable energy and help our industries compete.

Job Growth and Trade Diversification

Clean energy investments are both a job growth and economic diversification strategy. Investments in clean energy create more jobs per dollar than investments in conventional energy sources. Investing in building efficiency and solar power, for example, respectively create 2.8 and 1.5 times as many jobs per dollar invested than investments in fossil fuels. And jobs in the clean energy sector in Canada are projected to grow four times faster than the national average.

By investing in clean energy, Canada will be able to attract more investment to diversify our economy and trade partners. Ontario and Quebec, provinces with abundant clean energy resources, have attracted major investments in electric vehicle and battery plants as well as the tech and life sciences sectors. Traditional industries like steel production and mining are using clean energy to decarbonize and optimize their products, making them more competitive to our trading partners who are looking for low-carbon materials. And our clean electricity grid is unlocking new carbon removal technology opportunities for Canada: the leading carbon removal firm Deep Sky recently announced a 10 year power purchase agreement with leading clean energy supplier Low Carbon to power its Alpha facility in Alberta.

Over the last few years, the US has been undergoing somewhat of a manufacturing renaissance.

Thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, both of which included many provisions for green and domestic manufacturing jobs, there has been tremendous investment in US manufacturing, at a much higher pace than prior to those laws being passed.

Overall, Biden’s push for EVs attracted $210 billion in investment and 230,000 direct EV jobs, to say nothing of the additional jobs that would be created to support those jobs and due to increased economic activity.

This was particularly lucrative for certain states in particular, such as Nevada which would experience a 22.87% increase in the state’s manufacturing workforce, New Mexico with a 12.52% increase, or Georgia with a 10.17% boost. Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia would all see a boost of more than 5% in their manufacturing workforces.

But the new budget bill, passed by republicans in the House, would kill all those jobs and more.

We’ve already seen some of these effects, as several projects have been canceled due to job-killing republican policy.

But now, a new analysis by BlueGreen Alliance calculates just how much the republican bill would devastate US manufacturing. It estimates that the elimination of manufacturing credits would threaten nearly 300,000 direct manufacturing jobs.

“The job-creating track record of the clean manufacturing tax credits is undeniable and the changes to them included in the House bill threatens all of that progress. Every bit of data shows clearly that repealing these credits will hurt working Americans. We hope the Senate will see reason and reverse these damaging provisions.”

–Ted Fertik, Vice President of Manufacturing and Industrial Policy, BlueGreen Alliance.

But famously, manufacturing jobs are desirable because of their positive effect on a local economy, creating additional ancillary jobs in addition to the direct manufacturing jobs.

So, BlueGreen’s analysis looked at these as well, and found that a million “indirect jobs” would be threatened. Indirect jobs include things like supply chain jobs, providing parts for auto or clean energy manufacturing.

In addition, 643,000 “induced jobs” created by economic stimulus of the areas in question would be destroyed. These are jobs like restaurant workers, store clerks, and the other types of jobs you’d see when an area increases in population or has more money to spend.

“These numbers make it even more clear, if this bill becomes law, workers are the ones who will pay the price. As this administration blusters about its support for American manufacturing, this bill tells an extremely different story, openly selling out workers to pay for a billionaire tax break.”

–Jason Walsh, Executive Director, BlueGreen Alliance

Seven states would lose over 100,000 jobs, with California leading the pack at 329k, but three Southern states in the burgeoning US “battery belt” will be harmed exceptionally – Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina at 258k, 140k and 135k jobs lost respectively.

Notably, two of those states have two republican Senators – Tennessee and South Carolina. As the House bill has now been passed on to the Senate, it’s up to them whether they want to harm the economies of their state in order to satisfy their oil donors and give a multi-trillion-dollar giveaway to the richest Americans.

Instead of eliminating the tax credits, Congress should restructure them to reward companies that source from within the United States.
A bonus credit for vertically integrated or fully domestic supply chains would further motivate domestic investment.
When designed with America’s national interest at heart, the IRA tax credits can deliver energy independence and an industrial revival.","In the final push to pass the Big Beautiful Bill, Congressional Republicans slashed clean energy tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It’s easy to see why. Over the last several years, billions in taxpayer subsidies werethrown to Biden insiders with little or no oversight. But the corrupt actions of the previous administration shouldn’t stand in the way of sound policy, and Congressional Republicans should understand that the elimination of these credits would be a tremendous mistake . America First conservatives should instead focus on reworking these incentives, to secure our energy independence and fortify America’s supply chains to strike a strategic economic blow against our international rivals.

The current structure of these credits is deeply flawed. It too often remunerates companies that import the cheapest available foreign components, do the bare minimum domestically, and then slap on a “Made in America” label. This not only misleads consumers, it leaves our supply chains vulnerable to economic coercion, geopolitical instability, and evenforced labor. Unfortunately, barring foreign companies from accessing the tax credits under Section 45X of the IRA misses the heart of the problem.

The solar industry is a perfect example. Here China dominates the supply chain for critical components like polysilicon, wafers, battery materials, and rare earth minerals, and it holds much of the intellectual property as well. Sourcing elsewhere is a practical impossibility. Even companies based in allied nations like South Korea and India still depend heavily upon Chinese inputs. The end result is that Chinese origin produced components continue to flood the U.S. market and American taxpayers foot the bill.

On paper, the “foreign entities of concern” (FEOC) provisions in the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” sound like a political slam dunk. Ban materials from countries we don’t trust. Sounds good! But in practice, these measures backfire, crippling domestic supply chains and undercutting American jobs.

The FEOC rules impose rigid sourcing restrictions on critical components like polysilicon and battery materials. These are the building blocks of our energy future, and deep red states like Mississippi that have invested heavily in manufacturing will take the hit. There, Amplify Energy is seeking tolaunch a battery manufacturing facility that could support 2,000 good American jobs. Ill-considered blanket restrictions would impede these developments. Industry insiders estimate that these restrictions jeopardize over $200 billion in energy investments nationwide.

We need a way forward that protects those who would be the backbone of an America First energy policy. Instead of eliminating the tax credits, Congress should restructure them to reward companies that source from within the United States. Specifically, boosting the credit for polysilicon and wafer production would generate the level of investment needed to compete with China. A bonus credit for vertically integrated or fully domestic supply chains would further motivate domestic investment.

Of course, obstacles remain. To encourage the mining of rare earth minerals, the refining of lithium, and the production of polysilicon, our tax policy must be designed to encourage long-term investment. The Trump administration should invoke the Defense Production Act to speed up permitting and approval, while emphasizing the adoption of AI-powered manufacturing to bridge the gap where the United States isn’t yet ready to compete on the cost of labor.

Finally, IRA tax credits were tied to manufacturing, but not to the domestic control of the technology behind it. Republicans in Congress should introduce a targeted credit for domestic technology innovation while providing incentives for companies to assign or license core manufacturing intellectual property to an American entity.

Supply chain security, workforce development, and economic independence are essential to America’s future. When designed with America’s national interest at heart, the IRA tax credits can deliver energy independence and an industrial revival. This is the kind of strategic use of federal power that serves the people, not the elites. It’s how we rebuild the middle class and strengthen our sovereignty. Congressional Republicans who consider themselves champions of the America First agenda should naturally lead the charge on this front.

Launched this month, the $63.8 million GENESIS project brings together a coalition of 58 partners spanning manufacturers, SMEs, research institutes, and universities.

The program, led by France’s CEA-Leti, will run for three years and aims to address emissions, resource consumption, and supply chain resilience across the entire semiconductor lifecycle. In doing so, it aligns with Europe’s broader digital and green transition ambitions.

Building a Circular Economy for European Chips

Rather than tackling the problem piecemeal, GENESIS is structured around a comprehensive roadmap targeting five critical stages of chip manufacturing: materials development, chemical processes, waste monitoring and treatment, air emissions control, and final waste processing.

Real-time emissions tracking is one of the initiative’s key areas of focus. By advancing process monitoring and sensing technologies, GENESIS aims to enable manufacturers to spot environmental impacts during production—not after products are out the door.

Waste reduction is another priority. Researchers are working on advanced recycling systems to recover solvents, gases, and slurries that are typically discarded. At the same time, project teams are developing chemical alternatives that avoid PFAS and offer lower global warming potential, helping to clean up some of the sector’s most problematic processes.

The initiative also addresses Europe’s vulnerability around critical raw materials. GENESIS aims to develop technologies that reduce reliance on scarce inputs while strengthening supply chain resilience—goals that support both environmental and strategic policy objectives in the EU.

A Timely Play for European Competitiveness

The launch of GENESIS is well-timed. With chips now powering everything from AI systems to clean energy technologies, the environmental performance of semiconductor manufacturing is under growing scrutiny.

Laurent Pain, director of CEA-Leti’s Sustainable Electronics Program and project leader, says the consortium expects to deliver around 45 innovations designed to improve sustainability across the entire chip value chain.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250611-123051-94b-ioana-baciu-HNZb5jhftN0-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 15:01:53.159134

Energy ready to keep Indiana competitive.
That means slower progress in bringing new load online—a reality that runs counter to our national energy security goals.","When it comes to powering Indiana’s economy, Hoosiers understand what works: an all-of-the-above energy strategy rooted in reliability, readiness and growth. From traditional sources to renewable technologies like solar and battery storage, Indiana has never been about picking winners and losers. We’ve been about keeping the lights on and the job sites humming.

Today, a new wave of energy demand is cresting across our state. The growth of data centers, advanced manufacturing and defense-critical industries means the need for energy isn’t just coming—it’s already here. That power must come from somewhere, and increasingly, it comes from shovel-ready solar and battery energy storage projects.

As the CEO of a national energy development company with our operations hub proudly based in Indianapolis, I know firsthand that Indiana is one of the best places in America to get energy projects done. In just the past decade, Geenex has successfully developed more than 8 gigawatts of energy generation—enough to power more than a million homes. And right now, we have more than five additional gigawatts in development, including projects in 10 Hoosier counties.

That pipeline matters. Because the best kind of electron in today’s market isn’t a red one or a blue one—it’s a ready one. Energy ready to meet demand. Energy ready to keep Indiana competitive. Energy ready to protect our communities from future crises.

Unfortunately, proposals moving through Congress threaten to disrupt the very regulatory framework that has allowed Indiana to become a national leader in grid expansion and private energy investment. The House-passed budget bill, known as House Resolution 1, would modify the current landscape that provides the certainty to move forward.

Repealing provisions of the current tax credit structure risks slowing down energy projects that are already engineered, permitted and ready to begin construction. That means slower progress in bringing new load online—a reality that runs counter to our national energy security goals.

We know what those goals are because President Donald Trump outlined them clearly in his recent executive orders: Build American energy. Cut permitting delays. Restore energy independence. Secure our supply chains.

We agree. And in Indiana, we’re doing it.

Hoosier workers are building the energy backbone of the future. From the steel mills supplying project components to the union trades installing megawatts of generation capacity, energy is not a concept—it’s a paycheck, a plant expansion, a child’s future in Indiana.

This is not the time to change course. Let’s keep Indiana on the path of energy leadership by staying focused on what matters: readiness, reliability and results. That means keeping a clear regulatory path for projects already in motion and ensuring that Indiana can continue to meet the growing energy demands of the 21st-century economy. The U.S. Senate still has time to act.

When the next job announcement drops or the next facility seeks to locate in Indiana, we won’t have time to waste. We’ll need power on the ground, electrons on the line, and Hoosiers ready to deliver.•

XGS Energy has yet to say where it’ll be building the power plant, and Meta wouldn’t disclose specifics about the deal other than to say it’s not yet a contract to purchase power, but rather an agreement “to advance geothermal energy development” in the state, a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch.

Recently, tech companies, data center developers, and investors have been warming to the technology. Geothermal can generate electricity around the clock without producing emissions, an appealing combination to hyperscalers.

Advanced geothermal, which drills deeper to access hotter rocks, could generate enough electricity in the U.S. to fulfill nearly two-thirds of new data center demand by 2030, according to the Rhodium Group.

Many geothermal startups are pursuing open loop designs, where they inject water down one well and let it flow through cracks in the rock before extracting it from another well. Over time, some of that water is lost to the ground.

XGS Energy, on the other hand, sends water through a closed loop inside a sealed well, minimizing water loss. It also injects a proprietary mud around the outside of the well casing to help transfer more heat from the rocks to the loop.

The partnership between XGS Energy and Meta is the latest in a string of deals racked up by geothermal startups.

On Wednesday, Fervo Energy secured $206 million in financing to continue work on its Cape Station power plant, which, when finished, will be the largest geothermal power plant in the world. The company’s momentum has fueled speculation that it may go public as early as next year.

In April, Google said it was buying 10 megawatts of geothermal from Baseload Capital to power its operations in Taiwan. The search giant also has a deal with Fervo to supply electricity for its Nevada data centers.

The Environmental Protection Agency released its long-awaited renewable volume obligation proposal for 2026 and 2027, which included historic increases in biomass-based diesel volumes and recommendations to strengthen domestic markets for U.S. soybean farmers.

“As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuel Standard, the American Soybean Association applauds the work of President Trump, Administrator Zeldin and Secretary Rollins in promoting American energy dominance and strengthening a key domestic market for U.S. soybean farmers,” said Caleb Ragland, ASA President and soybean farmer from Magnolia, Kentucky. “The significant increase in proposed volumes for biomass-based diesel will support soybean farmers, soybean processors, and biofuel producers in rural America, and serves as a much-needed win for our communities. We thank the Trump Administration for recognizing and supporting this vital value chain for U.S. agriculture.”

The proposed rule makes significant increases in volume requirements for biomass-based diesel, from 3.35 billion gallons in 2025 to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026, or a 67% increase. For years, ASA and others in the domestic biofuel value chain argued that the previous renewable volume obligations missed the mark and did not account for the feedstock availability nor production capacity. If finalized, this proposal would jumpstart a biofuel industry that has largely been crippled by weak Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN) credit values.

Additionally, EPA proposed a new concept to discount the RIN credit value for foreign finished fuel and fuels produced using foreign feedstocks. As soybean farmers struggle to maintain biofuel feedstock market share amid the rapidly growing flood of cheap, foreign feedstocks like used cooking oil, this proposal would once again give U.S. agriculture a competitive edge in the biofuel value chain.

Tesla semis, just the cab, can weigh between 19,000 and 22,000 pounds.","President Donald Trump has had one California policy circled on his list for some time.

Shortly after Trump won the election, his transition team was already making plans to eliminate the $7,500 consumer tax credit for EV purchases enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act.

On November 14, just nine days after winning the election, Trump's team told Reuters that he planned to take away the tax credit enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act.

California Governor Gavin Newsom saw the opportunity to let President Trump and the world know exactly where he stands on the issue.

A few weeks following the Reuters report, Newsom announced on Nov. 25 that if Trump followed through on his threat, the state of California will revive a program that gave its state residents up to $7,500 for EVs.

But on Thursday, June 12, Trump, who has been publicly feuding with Newsom for days over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement immigration raids that have targeted Los Angeles in recent days, did what he could to kill that tax incentive as well.

The ICE raids have resulted in protests that have seen flashes of violence. This has allowed an opening for President Trump to call in the National Guard to quash the protests.

As the two have gone back and forth on social media, Trump used the power of the pen Thursday to get the upper hand on his political rival.

On Thursday, President Trump signed three resolutions barring California from mandating EV sales and setting stringent tailpipe exhaust emission standards to hasten the transition to EVs.

The resolutions revoke the federal waiver allowing California to set its own emission standards under the Clean Air Act. California had also planned to ban new gasoline car sales by 2035, but Trump's resolution also takes that off the table.

The 17 states that adopted California's standards will also no longer be able to mandate EV sales by 2035.

“We officially rescued the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said Thursday.

The president said “the trucking industry“ told him that EV trucks do not work because the vehicles are so heavy, thanks to the large batteries that power them.

According to Trump, EV semis are more than 2.5 times heavier than their diesel counterparts. He went on to say that the U.S. would have to rebuild every bridge in America because they weren't designed for that weight.

This isn't the first time President Trump has claimed EVs will force trillions of dollars in road repairs and improvements across the country.

Federal weight limits allow vehicles that weigh as much as 80,000 pounds, including cargo, on the road and put as much as 20,000 pounds of weight on a single axle.

A diesel tractor weighs between 10,000 and 25,000 pounds, while the empty trailer weighs another 10,000. Tesla semis, just the cab, can weigh between 19,000 and 22,000 pounds. Add a 10,000-pound trailer, and the weight could limit how much cargo each truck can safely and legally hold.

California governor responds to latest Trump jab

Gavin Newsom has been very active on social media over the past week, defending his state from barbs thrown by Republicans over the ICE protests that have sometimes turned violent.

He told NBC that the state will be suing to “stop this latest illegal action by a president who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

Trump, meanwhile, sees the move as a commonsense step to help the auto industry.

But he also took the time to give a light tap to his on-again, off-again friend Elon Musk, who owns the world's most valuable EV company.

The proposal sets biomass-based diesel volumes at 7.12 billion RINs in 2026 and 7.50 billion RINs in 2027. Based on conversion rates provided by EPA, that equates to an estimated 5.61 billion gallons in 2026 — the highest-ever proposed levels under the RFS.

Grant Kimberley, executive director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, issued the following statement:

“While this proposal has some significant program changes that will require further study for us to better understand, over all it reflects the strength, resilience, and growth potential of America’s biodiesel industry. The volumes signal real opportunity for domestic producers, especially here in Iowa, and we appreciate the EPA’s recognition of what this industry is capable of delivering.

“We thank the Trump administration for recognizing that American-made biofuels should be a national priority, and for setting the stage for today’s historic growth in biomass-based diesel.

“For Iowa, these volumes likely mean something even more immediate — getting our idled biodiesel plants back up and running. That’s good news for jobs, for soybean farmers and for communities that rely on biofuels as a driver of economic growth.

“While what happens with small refinery exemptions remains to be seen and is very important to the final outcome, today’s news overall is a win for clean energy, agriculture and American manufacturing.”

Kimberley also thanked Iowa’s Congressional delegation — Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, and Representatives Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Randy Feenstra, and Zach Nunn — for their continued leadership and unified support for Iowa’s biofuel producers and soybean growers.

During panel discussions and interviews at Sustainability Week USA, Economist Impact’s clean tech conference, clean energy consultants expressed frustration over recent setbacks, as well as determination to stay the course.

David Turk, deputy secretary of the Department of Energy during the Biden administration, said in his keynote that he wished Congress had passed the IRA earlier, so Republican districts could have seen the impacts sooner.

“The reason why I don’t think [the IRA] influenced that many Republican representatives—in fact, it influenced zero at the end of the day in terms of who voted, who threatened to vote against the package—was that it wasn’t the jobs already there and they were being pulled back,” Turk told the event’s audience. “It was just jobs that were coming there in a year or two, and it just makes it that much less compelling.”

Similarly, Bipartisan Climate Trust advisor Robin Millican said that “telling people you should fight for these things because it creates jobs” was an uphill battle, especially with Republican representatives voting along party lines. “It is really hard to do climate policy through the tax code,” she said, which is vulnerable to political swings.

“What we’ve had is this very much boom and bust cycle where a tax credit is available and then it gets rescinded, and I think it’s really hard for industry to plan around that with certainty,” Millican said in a panel discussion.

Or maybe it was how the law was branded, Galvanize Climate Solutions’ Chief Strategy Officer David Livingston said: Something like “the Energy Freedom Tax Cut Act,” because in this situation, “semantics matter.”

No matter what, it’s not over, the credits are currently good law—and ClearPath CEO Jeremy Harrell said he actually feels optimistic about how things will play out in the Senate. ClearPath is a conservative clean energy organization.

“I just took the train from DC this morning. I think things are trending in a better direction on the Senate side,” Harrell said during a panel discussion. “You are going to see many of these [incentives] stay in place, particularly for key technologies that we know we need from a climate perspective.”

That’s because, according to Harrell, rising energy demand will drive the need for all forms of energy.

“We can build once we get out of this place,” he said, “and drive forward on things like permit reform that are going to be necessary to scale up new technology.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/3f3dec77d5a88b10d87bdcb1c959b0350ae777ea-2481x1729.jpg?rect=0,213,2481,1303&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-06-13 14:00:30.177399

From the May/June 2025 Issue

Over the past year, the United States auto industry has started to bounce back after several years of turbulence. According to the Kroll Automotive Industry Report in spring 2024, new vehicle sales have surged, with estimates showing a 12-15% increase compared to 2023, as supply chain distributions, particularly the semiconductor shortage, eased significantly. This allowed automakers to restock their dealer lots and reduce customer wait times, fueling demand. The used vehicle market stabilized, with prices cooling from the record highs seen during the pandemic, although demand for affordable used models remained strong.

The electric vehicle (EV) market continues to grow, capturing around 9-10% of total U.S. sales in 2024. Federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, improvements in battery range, and a rapid expansion of charging infrastructure all contributed to this growth. Hybrids saw a resurgence with customers drawn to their combination of fuel efficiency and lack of range anxiety compared to full electric vehicles.

The luxury and premium segments also had strong gains, boosted by affluent consumers less affected by high interest rates. Fleet sales, which had been depressed during the pandemic, rebound as rental car companies, commercial fleets, and government agencies replaced aging vehicles.

Beyond consumer sales, production capacity grew as automakers opened or expanded factories, particularly in EV battery production, often through joint ventures with battery makers. A major driver of production growth came from electric vehicle transition. Automakers significantly expanded EV production capacity by investing in new plants and upgrading existing ones to accommodate electric models.

Automakers increased reshoring of parts production. They invested in modernizing plants with advanced robotics, more flexible manufacturing systems, and digital tools to boost efficiency. This not only expanded capacity but improved the ability to shift between gasoline, hybrid, and electric models as market demand fluctuated.

The commercial vehicle sector also saw capacity growth, particularly for electric delivery vans and trucks. Companies like Rivian, who is partnered with Amazon; BrightDrop, partnered with GM; and Ford scaled up production to meet the rising demand from e-commerce and logistics companies.

The following shows three scenarios in which oil prices increase.
As the price of oil moves toward $70 per barrel, U.S. domestic oil producers will increase volume, dampening the overall impact of hostilities in the Middle East.","The U.S. has been a net exporter of oil since 2019 and energy independent for the better part of the past 15 years.

Now, with hostilities having broken out in the Middle East, this resilience will help the U.S. economy weather the impact of any increase in global energy prices.

Still, the U.S. is not immune to volatility in global energy markets.

About 20% of oil and natural gas flows through the Strait of Hormuz, and Iran still produces 3% global oil supplies.

Read more of RSM’s insights on the economy and the middle market.

The region remains a vital component of global energy markets, so when this trade is disrupted, American consumers will be affected.

Higher oil prices mean higher prices at the pump, which pushes up inflation and, if sustained, restrains economic growth.

Every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil should result in a 0.1 percentage-point increase in inflation and cause a 0.1% drag on overall growth.

Should current conditions hold—an uncertain assumption—the consumer price index would increase to 2.5% at a minimum in June from the current 2.4% and economic growth would be dragged down.

Overall, the impact on the U.S. economy will be muted, but the risks of the conflict expanding remain.

Any increase in oil prices will be quickly passed through to the pump within a matter of days. These higher prices will show up most likely during the week of June 15.

As of Friday morning, the 8% increase in the price of domestically produced oil implies only a modest adjustment in gasoline prices. But given that the conflict might continue, the risk of greater disruption in energy markets is only heightened.

Energy independence

Domestic oil dynamics imply that should oil prices move toward $70 per barrel, production volume will increase.

The price of West Texas Intermediate oil—the domestic benchmark—over the past few months dropped to around $60 to $65, near the average breakeven price for much of U.S. crude oil production.

That breakeven level is a reflection of domestic energy independence as American oil production now stands at 13.4 million barrels per day, 22% higher than five years ago.

This drop in prices stems from an expected global economic slowdown following the shift in U.S. trade policy that would restrain oil demand at the same time that global oil supplies remain strong.

In response to the lower price outlook, oil producers have cut back on their drilling. This is best reflected by the fastest reduction since 2023.

With oil in the $60 to $70 range, producers are simply in “yellow light” territory, taking their foot off the gas pedal.

But should the breakout of hostilities in the Middle East cause oil prices to exceed $70, the higher-price environment would be a green light for producers.

We think that small to midsize producers tend to be more agile than larger ones and will be better positioned to respond to higher prices.

Three scenarios

Because this is a fluid situation, it is necessary to map out the impact on the U.S. economy from a large increase in the price of oil.

The following shows three scenarios in which oil prices increase. In our estimation each scenario, given the risks around rising geopolitical tensions and new tariffs, shows the risk of higher gasoline prices, higher inflation and a greater drag on growth.

Oil Increases to $80: A $12 increase in the price of domestic oil from the $68.04 close on June 12 should result in a 5% increase in the cost of domestic gasoline to near $3.41 per gallon. That would result in an increase in the June consumer price index to a minimum of 2.6% on a year-ago basis, which could increase at a greater pace because of tariffs and exert a modest drag of 0.1% on growth in the second quarter.

Oil Increases to $100: This scenario would result in a 15% increase in the price of regular gasoline to $3.73 per gallon and a 2.7% annual increase in the consumer price index in June, with a higher rate possible because of tariffs. The result would be a 0.3% drag on second-quarter growth.

Oil Increases to $120: This scenario would result in a 3% increase in the year-over-year CPI as the cost of domestic gasoline increases by 20% to $3.90 per gallon and provides a 0.5% drag on overall growth in the second quarter.

Inflation expectations, interest rates and the Fed

The primary risk to the rate outlook is through inflation expectations becoming unanchored.

The New York Federal Reserve’s estimate of one-year inflation expectations stands at 3.2% and the University of Michigan estimate of one-year expectations resides at 5.1%.

Most important, should consumers push near-term expectations higher, then the Federal Reserve will almost certainly push out any notion of a rate cut until December at the earliest, or into next year.

We think that the Fed will keep its policy rate in a range between 4.25% and 4.5% at its meeting next week. A move higher in inflation would modestly impact our estimation of the Fed’s reaction function but would not be sufficient to warrant a sharp change in policy.

But a sharp change in policy would be warranted only if inflation expectations become unanchored and inflation moves decisively to the upside on a combination of tariffs and an oil-induced price shock.

Given the new tariffs and rising energy prices, the Fed should simply wait out the current volatility before acting in either direction.

On Friday, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield moved higher, to 4.41%, as investors priced in greater inflation risks while the U.S. dollar appreciated against 14 of the 16 major trading currencies.

The takeaway

The U.S. has established energy independence, and this is one of the reasons why our shock-based scenarios result in a relatively restrained economic impact of the current events in the Middle East.

As the price of oil moves toward $70 per barrel, U.S. domestic oil producers will increase volume, dampening the overall impact of hostilities in the Middle East.

Should hostilities expand to affect other oil producers in the Middle East, then the adverse impact on the domestic price of energy would be greater than that estimated above.",https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/6_13_2025_energy_1.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 14:02:05.196850

The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California’s attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump’s signing ceremony ended at the White House.

The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

Trump called California’s regulations “crazy” at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.

“It’s been a disaster for this country,” he said.

It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state’s Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.

“The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. “They come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.”

The three resolutions Trump signed will block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.

“I like Tesla,” Trump said.

In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed “are killing our country,” the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he’d risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.

“I’ll take electrocution every single day,” the president said.

When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, “If you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.”

“What this does is it gives us freedom,” said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install “infrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn’t give you any return.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump’s action.

“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Newsom said Trump’s action was a continuation of his “all-out assault” on California.

“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Newsom said in a statement. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

Newsom later Thursday doubled down on his state’s assertion of its right to set environmental regulations. He signed an executive order requiring state air regulators to propose new rules further limiting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks if a court ultimately upholds California’s rules that Trump sought to kill.

Trump’s signing of the resolutions comes as he has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

“This bill represents a tangible solution to a growing environmental crisis, and it has been thoroughly vetted.
To let it languish in committee is a disservice to our constituents and our future.” The press conference, held in the Rhode Island State Capitol, saw several legislators speak passionately about the need for immediate action.

It’s time for the leadership to bring this to a vote and let the full General Assembly decide.” The lawmakers underscored that the bill reflects the recommendations of an 18-month legislative study commission specifically tasked with addressing plastic waste and recycling solutions in Rhode Island.","A coalition of Environmental groups, fifteen Rhode Island legislators, and the city of Providence held a spirited press conference, urging House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson to allow a floor vote on House Bill 6207, widely known as the “Bottle Bill.” The group emphasized the bill’s critical importance for environmental protection and recycling infrastructure in the state, expressing frustration over its current legislative stagnation.

House Bill 6207, introduced on April 9, 2025, aims to establish an extended producer responsibility (EPR) program for packaging and paper products, alongside a comprehensive beverage container recycling refund system (often referred to as a “bottle deposit program”). Despite strong support from environmental advocacy groups like Environment Rhode Island, Save The Bay, Clean Water Action and Zero Waste and an extensive study by a joint legislative commission, the bill was “held for further study” by the House Environment and Natural Resources Committee on May 13, 2025, effectively stalling its progress.

“This isn’t just about littered bottles on our beaches or overflowing recycling bins,” stated Representative McEntee, the sponsor of H6207. “This bill represents a tangible solution to a growing environmental crisis, and it has been thoroughly vetted. To let it languish in committee is a disservice to our constituents and our future.”

The press conference, held in the Rhode Island State Capitol, saw several legislators speak passionately about the need for immediate action. They highlighted that the proposed legislation would shift the financial burden of waste management to producers, incentivize the use of recycled materials, and significantly boost Rhode Island’s recycling rates.

“We’ve seen successful bottle bills in other states dramatically reduce litter and improve recycling,” added Senator McKenny. “Rhode Islanders deserve the same opportunity to contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable state. It’s time for the leadership to bring this to a vote and let the full General Assembly decide.”

The lawmakers underscored that the bill reflects the recommendations of an 18-month legislative study commission specifically tasked with addressing plastic waste and recycling solutions in Rhode Island. This pre-legislative work, they argued, should expedite its passage, not hinder it.

The press conference concluded with a unified call for transparency and democratic process within the General Assembly. “We are here today to respectfully, but firmly, ask Speaker Shekarchi and President Lawson to prioritize this vital legislation,” said Representative McEntee. “Allowing a floor vote on H6207 is not just about this bill; it’s about empowering the legislative body to act on issues that deeply impact our communities and our environment.”

Supporters of H6207 are now looking to the public to amplify their message, encouraging citizens to contact their representatives and the legislative leadership to demand a vote on the “Bottle Bill.” The future of Rhode Island’s recycling system, they contend, hinges on whether this critical legislation is finally allowed to see the light of day.",https://environmentamerica.org/rhodeisland/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SocialCardEnviroC4_RIE.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:09:11.365607

Senator Graham’s Foreign Pollution Fee Act is a smart way to protect South Carolina workers and spur our state’s leadership in clean manufacturing.","With the reconciliation debate in full swing and the fate of clean energy subsidies hanging in the balance, many environmentally minded conservatives like myself are paying careful attention to the US Senate. However, as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” continues to absorb much of America’s attention, one very positive development has gone overlooked in the media, and it promises to be a win for South Carolina’s energy and manufacturing sectors.

I’m talking about the Foreign Pollution Fee Act (FPFA), a bill introduced in April by Senator Bill Cassidy and sponsored by our own Senator Lindsey Graham. The bill would impose tariffs according to the pollution level required to manufacture foreign goods, ensuring that our manufacturers are not undercut by competitors who cut corners on environmental standards.

There’s a reason Senator Graham sponsored this legislation both this Congress and last—the Foreign Pollution Fee Act has the potential to significantly benefit South Carolina and raise revenue to offset tax breaks.

Right now, South Carolina is at a global disadvantage. While our state’s growing manufacturing sector plays by the rules, foreign competitors—especially China—undercut our producers by ignoring environmental standards and flooding our markets with artificially cheap goods.

Not only does this make it difficult for South Carolina businesses to compete, but pollution from other nations also negatively impacts our air and water while contributing to climate change. Our current trade laws effectively subsidize dirty foreign countries by refusing to hold foreign imports with zero environmental standards to the same bar that we expect of South Carolina manufacturers.

Senator Graham’s FPFA would protect South Carolina workers by ensuring foreign manufacturers pay the same environmental compliance costs South Carolina businesses are required to pay. This has the potential to not only reward South Carolina’s efforts in environmental stewardship and energy independence but also protect our manufacturers and workers from the unfair environmental practices of other nations.

The impact of this bill may be more evident than in the advanced energy sector. In addition to our over 270,000 manufacturing jobs – including those in landmark auto manufacturing facilities in Greer and Ridgeville – our state has more than 46,000 clean energy jobs. That number is only growing, especially because South Carolina has a robust clean energy infrastructure. This includes seven nuclear reactors producing over half of our energy in a carbon-free way, the University of South Carolina’s hydrogen and fuel cell research center, and the newly opened ES Foundry solar cell factory in Greenwood, which is set to become the largest such factory in the United States. This solar cell factory is particularly notable because panels made here in South Carolina will produce drastically less pollution than Chinese solar panels advertised as “net-zero,” but made with dirty coal power.

With the FPFA, businesses like these will be free from worrying about unscrupulous competitors that ignore environmental standards and can focus on increasing these clean energy investments here in South Carolina.

Such investments are especially important as countries like China are laser-focused on dominating the clean energy market (ironically, it is a leader in clean energy technology innovation, even while its economy remains remarkably dirty). We can keep those energy jobs here at home. Along with other trade fixes and targeted investments, this move would help the United States be the undisputed leader in the energy of the future.

Unlike other clean energy plans that rely on top-down, economically damaging federal regulations, a foreign pollution fee puts a simple price tag on environmental uncleanness and then lets the market do the rest. It is one of the only environmental tools that promises to raise a significant amount of money, which may be helpful as Congress sorts out its tax agenda.

Here in South Carolina, we know that fair trade is the best trade, that economic growth is the key to prosperity, and that we can have both of those goods, all while defending our environment. Senator Graham’s Foreign Pollution Fee Act is a smart way to protect South Carolina workers and spur our state’s leadership in clean manufacturing.

""We were thinking about rapid expansion of electric vehicles, and clearly we haven't seen that happen.
""We have such a customer-focused portfolio of gas-powered vehicles or electric vehicles,"" she added.
The EV models of both the Equinox and Blazer — as well as the luxury Cadillac Optiq — are made in Mexico.
Equinox and Blazer accounted for some 50% of GM's EV sales, with roughly 22,000 and 11,000 sold through May, respectively.","General Motors Co.'s $4 billion reshoring plan announced this week sketches a blueprint for the Detroit automaker's long-term strategy: ramp up production of the hulking gas-powered vehicles Americans love while growing its expanding fleet of electric vehicles.

The investment to shift production of popular models from Mexico to three U.S. plants is the latest instance of GM tapping the brakes on EVs in response to slower-than-expected growth amid tariffs and federal efforts to scale back emissions regulations and EV incentives.

GM's latest vision for the Orion Assembly Plant, unveiled Tuesday as part of the $4 billion reshoring announcement, represents the company's biggest pullback on electrification yet. Instead of producing EV trucks as previously announced, the Oakland County facility will build gas-powered large SUVs and pickups starting in 2027.

""We had planned for that to be a big EV plant,"" GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said in a Wednesday investor call. ""We were thinking about rapid expansion of electric vehicles, and clearly we haven't seen that happen. So as we look at that capacity (and) we look at the landscape where we are in pivoting that to full-size truck production as well as incremental full-size SUV production, it's going to help create and satisfy the demand that we've already seen in the marketplace for our industry-leading products.""

GM is following a dual track with EVs and ICEs, necessitated in part by slow consumer acceptance of battery-powered models. But its profit-rich trucks and SUVs generate the cash GM needs to fund its EV and battery aspirations.

""Ten years ago, all the manufacturers saw the success of Tesla and expected the market to shift towards electric vehicles, and so they prepared for this new wave of buyers,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of the research firm AutoForecast Solutions. ""That shift was never going to happen. And there was going to be an extended period where gas engines were required to keep their volumes up, to keep sales, (and) to keep customers happy.""

GM's decision to walk away from its $4 billion plan to convert Orion to EV production, announced in 2022, is the automaker's latest move to slow its shift to electrification — and recognize shifting consumer preferences and the prevailing political sentiment of the second Trump era.

Plans to make Tonawanda Propulsion all EV were tossed in May in favor of manufacturing the latest V-8, gas-powered engines at the Buffalo, New York, plant. In April, GM announced plans to beef up capacity at a Toledo plant to build transmissions for gas-powered trucks while pulling out some equipment that had been installed recently to make drive systems for electric vehicles.

""What we're about is offering customers choice,"" CEO Mary Barra told Fox Business last month. ""We have great internal combustion engines, or gas vehicles. We have great EV vehicles. We're meeting the customer in the marketplace where they are.

""We have such a customer-focused portfolio of gas-powered vehicles or electric vehicles,"" she added. ""We're growing both.""

Trucks, SUVs and the draw of V-8s

As lawmakers and policymakers pushed for increasing regulations on fuel efficiency, emissions and other environmentally friendly rules, Fiorani said some drivers responded with renewed interest in size and power.

""Since the 80s, we've seen this need to make more efficient vehicles,"" Fiorani said. ""And buyers have pushed back by attempting to buy the largest, most powerful, the loudest engine they could.""

Ram learned to appreciate customers' devotion to V-8s the hard way, Fiorani said, after dropping its famed 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 from its 1500 lineup and replacing it with six-cylinder engines in 2025. Outrage ensued, and Ram sales overall plummeted 19% last year.

Ram ""screwed up"" when it dropped the engine, Stellantis NV truck brand CEO Tim Kuniskis said last week when announcing the Hemi's return to the 2026 Ram 1500 lineup.

GM's top-selling vehicles in the first three months of 2025 included the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks, the latter of which has an option for a V-8 engine. Those are ""high-volume, high-margin vehicles,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights for Cox Automotive.

Fiorani added: ""Buyers expect to have a large truck and a powerful engine under the hood, and part of that experience is the noise that a V-8 makes. It announces that, this is what I own, and this is what I drive.""

Under GM's $4 billion reshoring plan, the company will produce full-size SUVs and light-duty pickups in Orion; build the gas-powered Equinox compact SUV in Fairfax, Kansas; and assemble the gas-powered Blazer in Spring Hill, Tennessee.

""Talking about trucks and SUVs compared to the small cars we were into, everybody's excited,"" said Gerald Lang, president of United Auto Workers Local 5960 at GM Lake Orion. ""There's a lot of people that had to transfer out with this retooling that are looking forward to coming home.""

Easing GM's way are dirt-cheap gas prices that give drivers little incentive to ditch gas guzzlers.

""Making sure they have all these options for the consumer is the best recipe for success in the next decade or more,"" Fiorani said. ""And GM is finally realizing that the electric market isn't going to be here tomorrow, and buyers are going to expect to have a V-8-powered pickup truck.""

Despite low margins, analysts say GM must continue to invest in EVs to be competitive in the upcoming decades, particularly against intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.

GM trails industry leader Tesla Inc. But the Detroit automaker is gaining traction as buyers grow tired of dated models and CEO Elon Musk's politics.

GM on Tuesday announced it claimed a distant second place in U.S. EV sales through May. Part of the draw is the wide variety of EVs offered under the Cadillac, GMC and Chevrolet brands, including the affordable Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer. The EV models of both the Equinox and Blazer — as well as the luxury Cadillac Optiq — are made in Mexico.

Equinox and Blazer accounted for some 50% of GM's EV sales, with roughly 22,000 and 11,000 sold through May, respectively. Altogether, GM currently fields 11 EV models, including the hand-built Celestiq.

Aiding recent sales overall is buyer anxiety that Trump's tariffs would lead to price hikes. EV drivers also face the threat of Congress axing the $7,500 tax incentives and cancelling federal support to expand the nation's charging network.

The Republican president enacted a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles and auto parts from Canada and Mexico that do not comply with the countries' U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.

He granted the USMCA exemption after intense lobbying and direct conversations with leaders of the Detroit Three automakers. The companies warned of dire consequences from disrupting North America's highly interconnected automotive supply chain, with Michigan likely to suffer the most.

""All of these factors are weighing on the decision-making of buyers today,"" Fiorani said. ""If they believe that they're going to need a vehicle in the next few months, a lot of them have moved to the dealership now to purchase while they believe the prices will be lower.""

Jacobson said GM does not expect the April and May spikes, thanks to pull-ahead vehicle sales in both gas and electric models, to continue through June.

""We've certainly seen that come back down,"" Jacobson said. ""The question out of earnings is going to be: how far does that come down?""

Despite growth, EV sales have not met automakers' optimistic expectations. All-electric vehicle purchases still hover around 10% of the U.S. car market, forcing GM to retreat from a short-lived promise for a fully electric fleet by 2035.

""The industry is still committed,"" Valdez Streaty said. ""There's just going to be shifts in the timeline.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/06/13/BIZ-AUTO-GM-RESHORING-TRUCKS-SUVS-DTN_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-06-13 14:02:57.662178

Introduction

The Trump Administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced two proposals to repeal existing U.S. regulations on power plants, including all existing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) regulations and certain amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.

EPA’s Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) estimates that the proposed repeal of all GHG regulations on power plants would save compliance costs between $9.6–$19 billion (in 2024 dollars) and lead to PM2.5 (fine inhalable particulate matter) and ozone-related health costs of $76–$130 billion; most striking is that the agency does not provide any monetized estimates associated with the increased GHG emissions from the proposed rule.

If the proposed rules are finalized, they will be subject to substantial legal challenges across the country, which would create significant policy uncertainty for players in the U.S. electricity market, such as investors, energy developers, and utilities.

Proposal To Repeal Obama and Biden Regulations on Power Plants

Policy goal

The EPA press release on the proposed rule states the goal of the rule as:

Ensuring affordable and reliable energy supplies drives down the costs of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing while boosting our national security. Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of baseload power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the Artificial Intelligence capital of the world. The proposed repeals would remove regulatory barriers that limit access to our Nation’s energy resources and unleash America’s true potential.

Rationale

The proposed rule states the following consideration behind the Trump Administration’s decision to not regulate GHG emissions from power plants:

Unlike other air pollutants with a regional or local impact, the targeted emissions are global in nature. As a result, any potential public health harms have not been accurately attributed to emissions from the U.S. power sector.

Proposed actions

The proposed rule summarizes the EPA’s planned actions as:

“…proposing to repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants.”

“…proposing that the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires it to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution, as a predicate to regulating GHG emissions from those plants.”

“…further proposing to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.”

“…also proposing, as an alternative, to repeal a narrower set of requirements that includes the emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating units, the carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS)-based standards for coal-fired steam generating units undertaking a large modification, and the CCS-based standards for new base load stationary combustion turbines.”

Under the first proposed action, EPA seeks to repeal all existing GHG emissions regulations on U.S. power plants, including:

The Obama Administration’s regulation issued on October 23, 2015: New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for coal and gas power plants.

The Biden Administration’s regulations issued on May 9, 2024: Specifically, promulgated in the Carbon Pollution Standards (CPS), NSPS for coal-fired steam generating units undertaking a large modification, and new gas power plants, as well as emission guidelines for existing coal-, oil-, and gas-fired steam generating units.

The second and third proposed actions are linked. The former proposes to require the EPA to find that the targeted emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants “contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution” before issuing relevant regulations. The latter proposes that GHG emissions “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.”

The fourth action proposes to repeal additional standards in Biden’s CPS, including the carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS)-based standards for coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) undertaking a large modification, and the CCS-based standards for new base load stationary combustion turbines. As part of this proposal, the EPA will take public comments on the efficiency-based requirements for new natural gas power plant requirements.

A cost-benefit analysis that excludes GHG emissions impact

EPA’s regulatory impact analysis (RIA) provides estimates of the associated quantified benefits and costs in dollar value for the proposed rule and concludes that “the net benefits are negative using the economy-wide cost estimate.”

Here are some selected estimates in the analysis:

“Compliance costs saving”: EPA estimates the proposed rule would save between $9.6–$19 billion (in 2024 dollars).

“CO2 Emissions Changes”: EPA projects that U.S. power plants’ CO2 emissions would increase from the baseline with Biden Administration’s CPS regulation by 38 million metric tons (MMT) in 2028, 50 MMT in 2030, 123 MMT in 2035, 54 MMT in 2040, and 42 MMT in 2045.

“Energy market impacts”: As shown in Table 1 below, EPA provides energy market analysis of the proposed rule similar to the analysis of Biden’s CPS regulation, including price and production projections of electricity, natural gas, and coal for 2028, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045. Of note, the numbers across the two sets of RIAs are the same, but their signs are the opposite. As explained in the analysis by Trump’s EPA, “The proposed action would reverse these potential impacts, so the signs on these projected impacts are the opposite from what they were in the 2024 CPS RIA.” As a result, Trump’s EPA projects that if the proposed rule goes into effect, U.S. coal production for power sector use will increase by 84 percent from the baseline with Biden’s CPS.

“PM5 and Ozone-Related Human Health Benefits”: The estimates in this section are as confusing to interpret as the section title itself. The total estimated “PM2.5 and O3-related health benefits” is between -$76 billion to -$130 billion in present value. In other words, the health costs of PM2.5 and ozone-related mortality and illness between $76–$130 billion. While the Biden RIA of the CPS regulation provides positive number estimates of potentially avoided ozone-related and particulate matter (PM)-related premature deaths, all the estimate numbers are negative in Trump’s RIA. The analysis states that “Estimates of avoided premature mortalities due to this proposed action quantified using the described approach are provided…. Negative numbers indicate avoided premature mortalities that are estimated to no longer occur under this proposed action.” As a result, all the economic-value estimates of the “avoided pm2.5 and ozone-related attributable premature mortality and illnesses” are also negative.

“Non-Monetized Disbenefits”: EPA does not provide dollar-value estimates of the costs, or “disbenefits” as labeled in the analysis, of the negative impacts resulting from the proposed rule, such as increases in Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) and GHG emissions, changes in water quality and availability, or ecosystems changes. It is most striking that the Trump Administration does not provide any analysis of the costs of the increased GHG emissions associated with the repeal of the emissions regulations. In contrast, the Biden Administration calculated the total climate benefits of reducing GHG emissions to be $270 billion from 2028–2047 (in 2019 dollars).

Proposal To Repeal Amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards

Policy goal

EPA states that:

This proposed action would enhance efforts to Restore American Energy Dominance by removing costly burdens on coal- and oil-fired power plants while still accomplishing the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.

Proposed actions

The rule proposes to:

“Repeal certain amendments issued on May 7, 2024, to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units – a rule commonly known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for power plants, or simply MATS.”

“…revert back to 2012 standards that have driven sharp reductions in harmful air toxic pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants.”

“…relieve all facilities of the more stringent filterable particulate matter (PM) emission standard for coal-fired EGUs, the tighter mercury standard for lignite-fired EGUs, and the requirement to use PM Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS).”

Regulatory impact

EPA estimates that this proposed rule would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years, which is about $120 million per year.

Analysis

Trump Administration’s energy and environmental approach

EPA’s proposals to repeal the above regulations on U.S. power plants are aligned with the administration’s overall approach to energy and environmental policy, which is to provide strong support for certain energy sources including fossil fuels and nuclear energy. On day one of President Trump’s second term, he signed several energy-related executive orders (EOs) intended to boost U.S. oil and gas production and exports by declaring a national energy emergency, removing regulatory barriers, and expediting permitting approval for oil and gas projects. On April 8, 2025, he signed several EOs intended to significantly boost U.S. production of “beautiful, clean” coal. On May 23, 2025, he signed several EOs intended to promote U.S. deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.

Additionally, the two proposals are a follow up on EPA’s announcement in March to plan to strike down the agency’s 2009 endangerment finding, which was the agency’ original legal basis for regulating GHG emissions. Previous American Action Forum analysis explains what the endangerment finding is, potential arguments to rescind the finding, and its implications.

A tug of war on emissions regulations on power plants

The proposed repeal of certain regulations on power plants are part of a tug of war between the Trump and the Obama and Biden Administrations.

Back in 2015, President Obama’s EPA releases the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was the first-ever regulation to limit GHG emissions from U.S. power plants.

In February 2016, a majority of the Supreme Court voted to stay the CPP in a case brought by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce against the EPA, which prevented it from being implemented.

In 2019, President Trump’s EPA repealed the CPP and replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.

In 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the ACE and its repeal of the CPP.

In 2022, however, the Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision in West Virginia v. EPA and ruled that EPA lacks the statutory authority to implement the CPP. As a result, the CPP repeal was upheld and the ACE reinstated.

On May 9, 2024, President Biden’s EPA promulgated the CPS, including new emission guidelines and standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants and repealing the ACE.

How much does the power sector contribute to GHG emissions?

GHG emissions from the power sector accounts for about a quarter of total U.S. emissions. According to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. electric power emissions stayed flat over the past few decades, driven by decreasing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, which offsets the increasing emissions from natural gas-fired power plants.

Regulations are costly and inefficient

Sector-based federal regulations are not an ideal approach to reducing GHG emissions. Jonathan Adler, a law professor at the Case Western Reserve University, provides an excellent summary of the pitfalls and vulnerabilities of command-and-control climate regulations:

Greenhouse gas regulations may be vulnerable to legal attacks, state resistance, and administrative delays that will compromise their ability to produce rapid reductions in emissions… climate regulations will be particularly vulnerable insofar as they are not clearly authorized by legislation.

Additionally, regulations are costly and inefficient compared to other emissions policies, such as a carbon tax.

EPA’s perplexing and incomprehensive regulatory impact analysis

While the proposed repeal of the power plant regulations would save a significant amount of compliance and administrative costs, the Trump Administration does not provide any estimates of climate costs associated with the repeal of all GHG emissions regulations on U.S. power plants. The Trump EPA’s regulatory impact analysis is perplexing in some cases as detailed above. Specifically, in some areas, the estimates seem to be produced by simply reversing the signs of the estimates in Biden’s EPA analysis, rather than using comprehensive modeling of all relevant factors.

Dive Brief:

Meta announced a deal with geothermal energy producer XGS Energy Thursday that will provide the tech and social media giant with carbon-free power to support its New Mexico data center operations

In exchange, Meta will support XGS’s development of 150 megawatts of next-generation geothermal energy production capacity in the state, according to the June 12 release. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham reportedly said the new plant will result in a $1 billion private sector investment, in addition to creating 3,000 construction jobs and 100 plant operation jobs.

The deal adds to the growing corporate demand for geothermal energy, which provides carbon-free power generation without weather dependence. Meta previously signed its first geothermal agreement with Sage Geosystems last year for power generation east of the Rocky Mountains.

Dive Insight:

XGS’s new geothermal plant will be built in two phases and is unique, as the company uses proprietary geothermal power production technology that works with zero operational water use, according to the release. The project’s completion will include an initial smaller phase of construction and a later, larger phase, with both expected to be completed and operational by 2030, the companies said.

On its own, this XGS project is expected to increase the total geothermal production in New Mexico by “a factor of 10,” according to the release. Meta Global Head of Energy Urvi Parekh said the social media giant is “excited” to work with XGS “to unlock a new category of energy supply” for its New Mexico operations.

“Advances in AI require continued energy to support infrastructure development,” Parekh said in Thursday's release. “With next-generation geothermal technologies like XGS ready for scale, geothermal can be a major player in supporting the advancement of technologies like AI as well as domestic data center development.”

For Meta, it is the company’s second foray into the geothermal market, following the deal with Sage Geosystems announced August 2024. That agreement will also lead to the development of 150 MW of next-generation geothermal power for the social media and tech conglomerate’s data center needs due to the uptick of artificial intelligence adoption.

XGS CEO Josh Prueher said the company is “pleased to support Meta’s ambitious AI objectives and accelerate access to new round-the-clock power supplies,” and called New Mexico “a growing hub for data center development. XGS’s technology has the ability to decouple geothermal energy production from typical location restraints like the availability of water or permeable or porous rocks. The company is also coming off a $13 million funding round in March.

Lujan Grisham said in a press release that the collaboration between Meta and XGS will strengthen the state’s grid and position it as a “national leader in next-generation renewable energy.”

“We’ve worked hard to ensure New Mexico remains at the forefront of the energy transition, and geothermal energy represents a promising new frontier,” Lujan Grisham said.

Geothermal energy has increasingly become an option for corporate clean energy buyers, resulting in both startup funding and development deals for the industry.

In March, Mastercard announced it would use geothermal energy to replace its natural gas-powered hearing and cooling systems at its Purchase, New York headquarters. That heating and cooling system contributes to Mastercard’s headquarters consuming more natural gas than any of the global payments company’s other offices.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/O9k68t89mFXnBsQlnsFKl-Cz-52eCKi189u9B-kybjg/g:nowe:0:104/c:1024:578/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy03MTM2MTAzOC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-06-13 14:00:34.232034

The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California’s attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump’s signing ceremony ended at the White House.

The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

Trump called California’s regulations “crazy” at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.

“It’s been a disaster for this country,” he said.

It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state’s Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.

“The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. “They come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.”

The three resolutions Trump signed will block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.

“I like Tesla,” Trump said.

In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed “are killing our country,” the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he’d risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.

“I’ll take electrocution every single day,” the president said.

When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, “If you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.”

“What this does is it gives us freedom,” said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install “infrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn’t give you any return.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump’s action.

“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Newsom said Trump’s action was a continuation of his “all-out assault” on California.

“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Newsom said in a statement. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

Newsom later Thursday doubled down on his state’s assertion of its right to set environmental regulations. He signed an executive order requiring state air regulators to propose new rules further limiting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks if a court ultimately upholds California’s rules that Trump sought to kill.

Trump’s signing of the resolutions comes as he has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

Furthermore, to avoid the 25% tariffs on vehicle imports from Mexico imposed by the Trump administration, GM is moving production of around a half-million gasoline-powered vehicles from Mexico to the U.S., E&E News reported.

Sam Abuelsmaid, an auto analyst for a Detroit-area research firm, told E&E that the move means the company is “giving up any hope of achieving that [2035] goal.”

GM’s shift follows cooling consumer demand for electric cars, and diminishing federal support for green energy projects under the Trump administration. On Thursday, Trump signed three bills that block California’s ability to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035 in the Golden State and numerous others, effectively wiping out a key pillar of the Democrats’ de facto national EV mandate.

“We still believe in an all-EV future,” GM stated when asked on Wednesday by E&E about the status of the 2035 goal. Notably, GM CEO Mary Barra has consistently claimed that EVs are the future of transportation, and said in May that “EVs are fundamentally better.”

Behind the scenes, however, GM was actively lobbying the federal government to overturn California’s EV mandate.

“We need your help!” GM said in a recent email blast to its white-collar employees, The Wall Street Journal reported. “Emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

While GM continues to build EVs — such as the electric Chevrolet Silverado, Cadillac Escalades and GMC Sierra— at its Factory Zero in Detroit, E&E reports that the plant is operating far below capacity.

In May, GM said it would halt its plans to produce electric motors at its Towanda Production plant in Buffalo, New York, opting instead to invest $888 million in manufacturing V-8 engines. Additionally, in 2023, GM committed $579 million to renovate an engine manufacturing facility in Flint, Michigan.

The current version of the “one big, beautiful bill” to advance President Trump’s political agenda also includes repealing Biden-era EV tax credits and other green energy subsidies. Moreover, the administration has cut billions in grant funding and loans that were shelled out under the auspices of the Biden administration.

He added, ""With a record amount of clean energy capacity added last year, we’re creating jobs and supporting local communities – all while building a cleaner, more reliable power grid.""

The DCEP will be constructed on 9,500 acres of non-arable land in western Fresno County.

It will feature a 1,150-megawatt (MW) solar facility with approximately 3.1 million panels and up to 1,150 MW (4,600 megawatt-hours) of battery storage, capable of powering 850,000 homes for four hours.

The project is owned by IP Darden I, LLC, a subsidiary of Intersect Power.

CEC Commissioner Noemí Gallardo emphasized the community benefits of the project, saying, ""Today’s clean energy projects must do more than just deliver megawatts. They should create value in the communities where they’re built.""

The DCEP will provide $2 million in community investments over the next decade, create more than 2,000 prevailing-wage construction jobs, and generate an estimated $169 million in economic benefits over its 35-year lifespan.

CEC Chair David Hochschild noted the importance of such projects for California's clean energy future, stating, ""The transition to 100 percent clean electricity by 2045 requires bold, utility-scale projects like Darden.""

He added, ""This project is significant not only for its size but its cutting-edge design and safety measures.""

As California continues to expand its battery storage capacity, safety remains a priority. Governor Newsom initiated a state-level collaborative in 2024 to enhance safety standards for battery storage systems, including updates to the California Fire Code and new safety standards approved by the California Public Utilities Commission.

California leads the U.S. in battery storage capacity, with over 200 utility-scale systems and more than 250,000 commercial and residential installations, totaling over 15,700 megawatts statewide.

Amudalat Ajasa reports for The Washington Post.

In short:

The EPA moved the reporting deadline for unpublished health and safety data on 16 chemicals from March 2025 to May 2026, citing the need to address industry concerns and finalize agency guidance.

The chemicals in question — including benzene, BPA, and vinyl chloride — are used in products ranging from plastics and tires to gasoline and adhesives, and are linked to cancer and developmental harm.

Environmental advocates argue the delay undermines chemical safety evaluations and public health protections by allowing companies to postpone disclosure of crucial risk data.

Key quote:

""This extension invites industry to withhold existing studies from federal regulators and makes it harder for EPA scientists to protect children, workers, and fenceline community residents from highly toxic substances.”

— Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, senior attorney at Earthjustice

Why this matters:

Many of the chemicals in question are embedded in daily life — found in plastics, gasoline, paints, and even rubber tires. Some are well-established carcinogens or endocrine disruptors. The delay in reporting health data could slow federal efforts to evaluate risks, regulate exposure, or warn the public. Communities living near industrial facilities are especially vulnerable to ongoing exposure. Without timely information, regulators can't act quickly to mitigate harm or enforce protections under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The extension signals a broader regulatory shift, raising concern among scientists and health advocates that industry interests will increasingly be prioritized over public health in chemical oversight.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60921434/origin.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 13:02:54.711949

As we’ve pointed out repeatedly, clean energy and electric vehicle production tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 passed by Democrats disproportionately benefit states and districts controlled by Republican Congressmen. It really doesn’t make sense to kill policies that are supporting tens or hundreds of thousands of jobs, that seed the ground for success in the economic powerhouse industries of the future, and that return much more in financial benefit than they cost. But, of course, Republicans in Congress have to toe the party line like sheep and especially have to do the bidding of the oil & gas industry.

Before the so called “Big Beautiful Bill” was passed by the House of Representatives, 21 House Republicans wrote to House Speaker Mike Johnson urging him to not cut clean energy tax incentives. Nonetheless, when it came time to vote for the bill and the cuts to the tax credits were still in there, these Republicans showed how useless they were and voted for the bill.

Now, incidentally, 13 of them in vulnerable districts are trying to get Republican Senators to step up and protect the incentives.

“Led by Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), the lawmakers said they remain ‘deeply concerned by several provisions’ that would aggressively phase down incentives from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law and add strict new supply chain requirements. Such steps could jeopardize billions of dollars in investments and thousands of jobs, companies and trade groups have said,” Politico reports.

In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo, the House Republican lawmakers wrote: “We believe the Senate now has a critical opportunity to restore common sense and deliver a truly pro-energy growth final bill that protects taxpayers while also unleashing the potential of U.S. energy producers, manufacturers, and workers.”

Ah, yes, common sense — too bad they couldn’t deploy that when letting the bill get through the House!

Notably, tax credits were cut for renewables but were not cut for nuclear power or biofuels.

The lawsuit comes one day after the Trump administration proposed to repeal the 2024 MATS, and the 111 Power Plant rule limiting pollution from coal and gas-fired power plants that exacerbate climate-heating greenhouse air pollution.
His proclamation vaguely cited “national security” and “lack of available technology,” even though many coal plants already meet the MATS and proven pollution controls are widely available.
Background on MATS Before MATS was established in 2012, there were no federal limits on how much mercury and toxic air pollution coal power plants could emit.
In 2024, the EPA strengthened MATS, building on what has become one of its most effective air pollution rules.","— Today, community and environmental groups represented by Earthjustice sued the Trump administration over its unlawful decision to exempt dozens of coal-fired power plants from stronger pollution limits set in the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS. The exemptions, issued in April, allow 68 coal power plants to release more mercury, arsenic, and other heavy metals known to damage children’s brain development, trigger asthma attacks, and cause cancer.

The lawsuit comes one day after the Trump administration proposed to repeal the 2024 MATS, and the 111 Power Plant rule limiting pollution from coal and gas-fired power plants that exacerbate climate-heating greenhouse air pollution.

“This is a political favor for coal corporations that results in families and children breathing more mercury and arsenic, chemicals that cause cancers and birth defects,” said Earthjustice attorney Nicholas Morales. “Trump and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Zeldin claim they care about cleaning our air, our water, even our food, and yet their actions consistently tell a different story.”

In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin invited corporations to email the agency to request exemptions from clean air standards. Corporations were told they could cite “national security” or “lack of available technology” as justifications. A month later, two-year exemptions were sent to coal-fired power plants, although many already comply, and pollution controls are installed at most of the plants and are otherwise widely available.

The coal power plants granted exemptions are spread across 23 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Many of the exempted facilities are located in or near working-class communities and communities of color already burdened by pollution.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenges President Trump’s April 2025 proclamation granting pollution exemptions that had been requested by email, sidestepping any form of public process, and contravening the statutory framework. Trump’s power grab hinges on twisting Section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, a provision never used in 55 years and meant for true national security emergencies where pollution controls are unavailable. His proclamation vaguely cited “national security” and “lack of available technology,” even though many coal plants already meet the MATS and proven pollution controls are widely available.

The plaintiffs to the lawsuit are Air Alliance Houston, Clean Air Council, Downwinders at Risk, Montana Environmental Information Center, and Sierra Club, represented by Earthjustice; Center for Biological Diversity; Environmental Defense Fund, represented by Donahue, Goldberg & Herzog; Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future, represented by Clean Air Task Force; Environmental Integrity Project; Dakota Resource Council and Environmental Law and Policy Center (ELPC), represented by ELPC; and NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council).

Background on MATS

Before MATS was established in 2012, there were no federal limits on how much mercury and toxic air pollution coal power plants could emit. The standards led to an 90% reduction in mercury emissions, 80% drop in other metals, and helped save up to 11,000 lives each year. In 2024, the EPA strengthened MATS, building on what has become one of its most effective air pollution rules.

EPA’s own analysis of the 2024 rule found:

$33 million in annual health benefits

Minimal impact on electricity reliability, with no expected retirements

Only 33 plants required upgrades to meet non-mercury metal standards.

Quotes from our clients

“The Trump administration is exempting the dirtiest plants in our country from a simple requirement to reduce their toxic pollution to match the vast majority of other plants, in most cases simply by repairing and using controls that are already in place,” said Sanjay Narayan, Sierra Club Chief Appellate Counsel. “That betrays the communities surrounding those plants, and has no basis in the law or common sense.”

“The Houston area already has some of the worst air pollution in the nation, and now the EPA is giving some of those worst polluters — coal plants — a free pass to pollute health-harming air toxics like mercury and arsenic right into our backyards,” said Jennifer Hadayia, executive director of Air Alliance Houston. “There is no excuse to let families and children breathe cancer-causing chemicals, so that W. A. Parish and coal-fired power plants like it can maintain their status quo.”

“This advances Trump’s polluters-first agenda and exposes families to continued injury from mercury, arsenic, and other toxic chemicals known to cause cancer, developmental damage, and respiratory illness. The law is clear in allowing exemptions only when a technology is unavailable. Forcing frontline communities most burdened by hazardous coal emissions to continue to suffer when the technology is proven and available is both illegal and unconscionable.” said Alex Bomstein, executive director of Clean Air Council.

“There are 170 coal-fired power plants in the country that use the same technology as the Colstrip plant in Montana, and every one of them has installed updated pollution control technology to protect communities from air toxics,” said Anne Hedges, executive director of the Montana Environmental Information Center. “Harming human health to eke out a bit more shareholder profit from a coal plant — especially one that is the nation’s dirtiest for toxic emissions and is frequently broken when we need it most — is misguided, harmful, and expensive. Perhaps the billionaires in charge don’t care about human health or their electricity bills, but everyday Montanans sure do.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-13 13:03:03.966093

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina's robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.

""North Carolina is the perfect location,"" Stein said. ""North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.""

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project discussed earlier Thursday by a state committee that awards economic incentives.

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.35 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee - more than $1 billion over 37 years - is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers' paychecks. The incentives also include up to $785 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and up to $450 million from the General Assembly in part to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.

A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

""We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,"" CEO Tom O'Leary said. ""So this is more than just a factory. It's a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.""

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The 5-year-old company says the plane's shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.

""It's going to deliver a better passenger experience than you've ever had before on any other plane,"" O'Leary said.

Stein said the state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.

The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.

North Carolina's previous largest economic development project, measured by employment, was revealed in 2022, when Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Chatham County, promising 7,500 jobs.

NEW YORK -The Trump administration on Friday proposed to increase the amount of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation's fuel mix over the next two years, driven by a surge in biomass-based diesel mandates.

The move, which also included measures to discourage biofuel imports, was welcomed by the biofuels industry, which had been lobbying on the issue for months.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed on Friday total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027. That compares with blending requirements of 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuels into the nation's fuel supply or purchase credits, called RINs, from those that do.

The proposal is driven in part by an increase in biomass-based diesel requirements. EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026 - a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.

It said it projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons. The EPA expressed the biomass-based diesel requirement in billion RINs in accordance with the agency's proposal to reduce the number of RINs that could be generated from imported biofuels.

After accounting for the reduction for imported biofuels, the EPA said it projected the number of RINs generated for biomass-based diesel would be 1.27 and 1.28 RINs per gallon in 2026 and 2027, respectively. Previously, the EPA projected the average gallon of biomass-based diesel generated 1.6 RINs.

The volume mandate for 2025 for biomass-based diesel was 3.35 billion gallons, a figure the industry had complained was too low.

The oil and biofuel industries, both major lobbying powers in Washington, have highly anticipated the release of the proposal, which, if finalized, determines the fate of billions of dollars in fuel and tradable credit transactions.

As one of the first decisions made by the current Trump administration regarding federal biofuel policy, the proposal signaled the administration's support for the biofuels industry, which has at times been at odds with oil companies.

A coalition of oil and biofuel groups banded together in a historically unusual move earlier this year to request biomass diesel blending for 2026 at 5.25 billion gallons, compared with 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The coalition, led by the American Petroleum Institute, argued that the EPA's previous mandates failed to support the growth of the advanced biofuel industry and undercut the market.

President Donald Trump signed a Congressional Review Act resolution Thursday that revokes California’s authority to set tailpipe emissions standards, upending policy in California and 17 other states that tie their standards to that of the Golden State.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Democratic attorneys general in 10 other states immediately sued to block enforcement of the law. Through a process that allows Congress to undo recent executive branch rules, the law repeals a U.S. Environmental Protection Act waiver allowing California to set a schedule for emissions standards for cars and trucks.

Oregon is among the states suing to block Trump’s action and preserve California’s authority to set emissions standards. “These clean air standards aren’t just about cars – they’re about protecting Oregonians’ health, our environment and our future,” Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “Oregon adopted these rules because we’re already seeing the impacts of air pollution and climate change in our communities, from worsening wildfires to rising asthma rates in kids.”

Trump signed two other resolutions that repeal the state’s authority to ban sales of new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035 and to regulate emissions on heavy trucks.

At a White House signing ceremony, Trump said the law would allow greater consumer choice and lead to less expensive vehicles.

“Your cars are going to cost you $3,000, $4,000 less and you’re going to have what you want,” he said. “Again, you can get any car you want.”

Simple majority vote

The procedure used to pass the law was controversial because of the use of the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, which allows a simple majority vote in the U.S. Senate instead of the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold.

Both the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the EPA waiver was not a rule and that the CRA could not be used. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune used the procedure anyway, and the measure passed 51-46.

The states suing over the law argued that process was illegal, saying that the CRA was “deemed inapplicable by every nonpartisan arbiter and expert who analyzed the question.”

“While all fifty States consented—through their Senators—to these expedited procedures for congressional disapproval of federal rules, no State consented to the CRA as a means for Congress to negate state rules,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote. “Nor would any State have done so.”

The states joining California in the lawsuit are Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Vermont and Washington.

Clean Air Act

The federal Clean Air Act of 1970 generally prohibits states from setting their own air quality standards. But a section of the bedrock environmental law allows California, which had stringent environmental standards at the time the federal law was passed, to set its own standards.

While the other 49 states may not set their own standards, any state can adopt California’s standards as its own.

That means the law Trump signed Thursday has effects far beyond California’s borders, which the president noted.

“The federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry, all over the country, all over the world, actually,” he said.

The law, which both chambers of Congress passed last month, applies to 17 states that follow California standards. In addition to those suing, those states are Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia.",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/06/trump-and-lawmakers-1536x800-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 13:05:52.456399

The governor and XGS Energy CEO Josh Prueher said New Mexico has the exact right geology to greatly expand geothermal projects.
While leaders were tight-lipped about where the projects could go, they said the public is welcome to weigh in via the permitting process.
The state has competing needs for the space underground beyond geothermal, Kenderdine said, such as sequestering carbon underground or developing geologic hydrogen as another fuel source.
“We need to do very, very detailed mapping of the New Mexico subsurface and we need to do it quickly,” she said.","Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Thursday announced what she described as a “big damn deal” for green energy production in New Mexico, one that she said will provide Meta’s New Mexico data centers with huge amounts of green energy they need without using much water or costing taxpayers a dime.

At a news conference at the Roundhouse, surrounded by cabinet agency heads and leaders from the Silicon Valley giant and also XGS Energy, the governor said the deal means XGS Energy would produce 150 megawatts of energy for Meta through its “advanced geothermal technology.”

Geothermal energy taps into heat under the Earth’s surface to generate electricity using steam turbines or further uses for heating and cooling. Leaders touted the “advanced” version of that technology as a way to minimize water usage through a “closed-loop” system and also by using a tiny surface footprint, claiming only 15 acres is needed on the surface for a project that produces enough energy to power 50,000 homes.

In addition to the energy production, the new geothermal plant will mean a $1 billion private sector investment that will create 3,000 construction jobs and 100 “really good” jobs running the geothermal power plant, the governor said.

It’s not clear when the company will break ground on the plant or plants or where they will be located. Company leaders described at least a three-year permitting timeline.

The governor and XGS Energy CEO Josh Prueher said New Mexico has the exact right geology to greatly expand geothermal projects. A 238-page academic report released Thursday claims the state has enough capacity to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power, which the report authors say is more than 15 times the amount of capacity the state had in 2023.

Combine the right geology with what Prueher called an easy permitting process, and then add in an oil and gas workforce that could be trained to work in geothermal technology, and you’ve got an environment that’s “easy and inviting for developers and investors” he said.

The governor said the state helped the deal come together through years of policy and legislative work, but stressed that no taxpayer money would be spent on it. She also said there isn’t any state agency rulemaking required or legislation that will need to pass at the upcoming legislative session.

“This is born from all the groundwork all of us have been laying in the state, which is why, frankly, it’s a great announcement jointly, and it should be a bit of a celebration,” she said.

The governor’s proposal is the latest she’s offered that seeks to enable continued growth while confronting the state’s arid climate, diminishing water supply and reliance on the oil and gas industry. In 2024, she announced a push for a so-called Strategic Water Supply that sought to create a market for wastewater produced by oil and gas drilling, along with brackish water.

The state’s 50-year water plan released last year says the state can expect a 25% reduction in its water supply over the next 50 years, thanks to climate change-caused aridification.

While leaders were tight-lipped about where the projects could go, they said the public is welcome to weigh in via the permitting process.

In a presentation elsewhere in Santa Fe as part of the release of the academic report, Melanie Kenderdine, secretary of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, showed a map that suggested the sites could be in Sandoval, San Miguel, Doña Ana, Catron and Hidalgo counties, and listed an additional 13 other counties that have “most favorable potential for other sites.”

The state aims to move forward with further projects, Kenderdine told attendees at a conference hosted by Project InnerSpace, a nonprofit pushing for further geothermal projects.

The state has competing needs for the space underground beyond geothermal, Kenderdine said, such as sequestering carbon underground or developing geologic hydrogen as another fuel source.

Bid to reject electricity auction results

In a different Senate committee, lawmakers approved a resolution urging federal regulators to formally reject the results of a regional electricity pricing auction that has resulted in skyrocketing utility bills for consumers in New Jersey taking effect this month.

“New Jersey families and businesses are now facing higher electric bills because of a capacity auction process that appears rigged against the public interest,” said Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson).

Last week, Gov. Phil Murphy and Democratic legislative leaders announced a plan to use more than $400 million to help offset the electricity bill increases, which are estimated to run as high as 20% for some consumers.

Their action comes as many lawmakers are gearing up for a November election where all 80 seats in the Assembly are on the ballot.

‘Not only is community solar cheaper and faster, it also creates good, local jobs, and helps increase energy transmission, right here in Jersey.’ — Jasmine Metellus, New Jersey League of Conservation Voters

However, compounding concerns about the state’s rising energy bills — and any political implications — is federal legislation that calls for ending federal tax credits for renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power, as well as hydrogen production and nuclear energy among other policy changes.

By some estimates, these federal changes alone could push electricity costs up by nearly 10% by 2030.

Community solar program

At the state level, a bill sponsored by Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) calls for revising New Jersey’s community solar energy program, including by updating development targets and eliminating capacity caps.

“The growth that is projected here is exactly the growth that we need,” said Doug O’Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, while testifying in favor of the legislation moments before it was cleared by members of the Senate Environment and Energy Committee.

The same bill was also up for consideration in the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee, where it drew praise from Jasmine Metellus from the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

“Not only is community solar cheaper and faster, it also creates good, local jobs, and helps increase energy transmission, right here in Jersey,” Metellus said.

Concerns about data centers

Meanwhile, the same committee took up a measure that calls for establishing regulations and rates that would be levied on “large load” data centers, defined as consuming 100 megawatts or more of electricity.

As the industrial footprint of data centers expands nationally, including to support artificial intelligence businesses, many states are grappling with how to regulate their huge energy demands in ways that also protect residential consumers.

“If we, in New Jersey, are not proactive in creating a plan, and these guardrails, for addressing the problems that data centers can pose to maintaining an affordable and reliable grid, everyday taxpayers and small businesses will pay the price,” said Assemblyman Dave Bailey (D-Salem).

According to Assemblyman Don Guardian (R-Atlantic), the U.S. Department of Energy has predicted wave and other water-generated energy will produce 15% of the country’s electricity by 2030.

The measure received some opposition before the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee ultimately approved it.

Data centers are “the future of economic growth, here in our state, and across the country,” New Jersey Business & Industry Association economic policy research analyst Jack Ramirez told committee members.

He pointed to economic development related to data centers in places like Pennsylvania and Virginia that share the regional energy grid with New Jersey.

Ramirez also warned that higher utility rates for data centers currently up for consideration in New Jersey could “turn away these centers from our state to states with more competitive and better (business) environments.”

Salvation in the ocean?

The same committee also cleared bipartisan legislation calling for additional study by the state Board of Public Utilities of the potential of ocean wave and tidal energy.

According to Assemblyman Don Guardian (R-Atlantic), the U.S. Department of Energy has predicted wave and other water-generated energy will produce 15% of the country’s electricity by 2030. The bill, sponsored by Guardian, calls for making New Jersey a “nationwide leader in ocean energy.”

“It’s really an exciting proposition and absolutely worth exploring,” Guardian said.

Among other energy-related legislation advancing on Thursday were those seeking to:

Require electric public utilities to file an annual report with the BPU on recorded votes at meetings of PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator serving more than 65 million consumers, across 13 states, including New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.

Require a public utility to annually review its actual revenues collected during the year and its total revenue requirement to determine if it collected excess profits during that year. After any year in which a public utility collected excess profits, the utility would be required to redistribute its excess profits to customers, in a proportional manner and in intervals prescribed by BPU, through a refund mechanism subject to board approval.

Update consumer notification requirements under New Jersey’s “Energy Bill Watch” program.

Further delays would cause hardships for tenants who planned to move into apartments last month, the complaint said.","With much fanfare, EMPOWERment Inc., held a ribbon-cutting in April for P.E.A.C.H Apartments, a 10-unit affordable housing complex it developed for low-income residents unable to pay Chapel Hill’s high rents.

At the ribbon cutting, U.S. Rep. Valerie Foushee (D-NC) and other dignitaries praised the nonprofit for its vision and persistence in addressing a critical need for safe and affordable housing in the town that is home to UNC Chapel Hill, the flagship university of the state’s 17-campus UNC System.

Families were supposed to begin moving into apartments for tenants earning at or below 30% of Area Median Income (AMI) the following month but it never happened. The anticipated move-ins were short circuited because Duke Energy Progress refused to run power to the apartments, citing the developer’s decision to use a single meter for billing purposes, according to a consumer complaint EMPOWERment Inc., filed against the energy company with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

“We’ve tried to resolve this conflict, but we have no choice other than file this complaint so our tenants can have affordable housing,” said Delores Bailey, executive director of EMPOWERment INC. “Our building is at risk and 10 families in our community are struggling with housing when they shouldn’t have to be.”

According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 30% AMI for the Durham-Chapel Hill HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Area is $22,250 for a family of one, $25,400 for a family of two, $28,600 for a family of three and $31,750 for a family of four.

Bailey said EMPOWERment Inc., decided to use one meter for the entire apartment complex to accommodate rooftop solar panels installed to reduce energy costs for low-income residents who would rent the apartments. The nonprofit’s contractors submitted plans for the single meter in July 2024 and Duke Energy ran the underground service for the single meter in October 2024, Bailey said, but the power company didn’t notify the nonprofit that it wouldn’t provide service until February 2025.

The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) filed the complaint on behalf of the nonprofit.

“This came about because people who are already doing some of the most valuable community-building work out there found a way to use solar energy to lower the cost of living for our low-income neighbors,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Using solar energy to lower the cost of living to help neighbors who need it is about the best use of solar I can think of. EMPOWERment is absolutely within its rights here and it deserves electric service immediately.”

EMPOWERment Inc., asked the state Utilities Commission for the following relief:

Require Duke connect electric service to EMPOWERment’s PEACH Apartments immediately, while the Commission considers this Emergency Complaint and Request for Declaratory Ruling, to prevent the risk of irreparable harm and health risks from the lack of essential electric service.

Order that Duke permit the use of “master” meters when the lease between landlord and tenant states that the cost of electric and/or gas utilities is included in rental payments, as set forth in G. S. § 143-151. 42(b)(2).

In the alternative, declare that a multifamily residential building is eligible to use a single “master” meter, with the Commission’s approval, when served by a solar array.

Require Duke to provide permanent electric service to the PEACH Apartments under the current single-meter configuration.

At issue in the disagreement is state law prohibiting master meters for electric and natural gas service in new residential buildings. One section of the law outlines an exception to the prohibition if the tenant and landlord agree in the lease that the cost of the electric service or natural gas service, or both, will be included in rental payments. North Carolina has generally required individual meters and service in tenants’ names for each unit in new residential building constructed on or after Sept. 1, 1977.

Bailey told NC Newsline that the energy utility would be paid by tenants in monthly rent payments under lease agreements between the nonprofit and tenants. The amount charged would depend on the number of bedrooms in the apartment, she said.

To rewire the units so that each has a meter would cost the nonprofit about $86,000, Bailey said.

“We don’t have that,” she said. “We don’t have that laying around somewhere.”

Bailey said it would take to three to six months to receive the parts needed to rewire the apartments if the nonprofit decided to go that route.

“My apartments are 85% done,” Bailey said. “I can’t have them sitting around for six months without an air conditioning to control the humidity in North Carolina. When it rains like it does and it gets hot like it does, I’m inviting mold issues.”

Duke Energy said it cannot comment on specific customers’ accounts. But did provide this statement in an email from spokesman Jeff Brooks: “Duke Energy service regulations, in compliance with North Carolina law, require residential units to have individual meters, no one master meter covering the entire building. These guidelines are in place to promote consistency in the quality and reliability of service to all customers.”

The nonprofit was unable to convince Duke Energy to allow the single meter to be used temporarily so families could move in while parts to rewire the building were ordered, Bailey said.

Further delays would cause hardships for tenants who planned to move into apartments last month, the complaint said. Target tenants earn between $11 and $16 an hour, Bailey said, and have been anxiously awaiting news about when they can move into the new apartments.

“EMPOWERment Inc., is a small nonprofit trying to do the right thing for all the right reasons,” Bailey said. “Thirty-percent and below [AMI] income are people like your grocery store baggers or your assistant teacher or the people who take your tickets at the movie theater — that’s who we’re working for.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PEACHdrawing-2048x1152.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 13:04:30.243286

Atalco’s facility in St. James Parish, the last remaining alumina producer in the United States, is facing mounting pressure from Chinese product dumping and environmental activist criticism, as state and industry leaders rally in support of its economic and national defense contributions.

The Gramercy plant supplies alumina, a critical input for aluminum used in aerospace, military, and manufacturing applications. Industry leaders say China’s state-backed overproduction has created artificially low global prices, posing a threat to U.S. supply chain security.

“This is a tactic we see repeated against American manufacturers,” said David Cresson, CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association. “If successful, it could irreparably disrupt the security of supply chains that keep American industry running.”

Gov. Jeff Landry called the issue one of national survival. “We’re not handing our future to foreign adversaries,” he said, citing Louisiana’s role in safeguarding vital domestic industries.

Atalco supports over 550 jobs, 70 percent of which are unionized, and half of which are held by individuals from minority communities. Despite this, the company has drawn criticism from environmental groups, which company officials say distorts regulatory progress and threatens local livelihoods.

“These are our neighbors—raising families here, supporting small businesses, contributing to our schools, and helping fund local infrastructure through millions in local and state tax revenue”, said Ray Gregson, CEO of the River Region Chamber of Commerce. “The work they do isn’t just important—it’s essential to the nation’s defense systems, aerospace, and the supply chain. The impact of Atalco in the River Parishes is real, direct, and irreplaceable.”

The company has invested over $30 million in new residue filtering technology that cuts waste by 35% and moves the site away from wet waste storage. Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois called it a “global first” and praised Atalco’s environmental progress.

Atalco has also invested more than $10 million in dust collection systems and is collaborating with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to enhance compliance.

The Gramercy site produces up to 1.2 million metric tons of alumina annually. Advocates warn that its closure could create dangerous foreign dependence.

Shelley Robbins

Despite massive uncertainty across the economy, Duke Energy is plowing ahead with its plan to build new fossil gas-fired power plants to serve data center, manufacturing, and other large customer load that may not even show up. Duke has asked the NC Utilities Commission for permission to build a combined-cycle (CC) gas plant in Person County, North Carolina, at the site of Duke’s Roxboro coal plant.

SACE has argued against the need for this gas power plant in the Certificate of Public Need and Necessity (CPCN) docket, submitting testimony to the Commission on Monday, June 9, 2025. Here’s a summary of that testimony (prepared by Synapse Energy Economics, Inc.), which explains what this all means for Duke’s billpayers, and how Duke can make changes within its control to protect customers and reduce pollution. These recommendations include:

Not approving this new gas power plant because the risks that it will increase bills are too high. Instead, Duke should improve the processes that are holding back lower-cost renewables and storage, then use renewables and storage to meet new load.

Instead of approving this specific gas plant, the Commission should order Duke to use an all-source procurement process to determine a portfolio of flexible assets that can meet the utility’s needs based on real-world costs.

In the event the Commission approves this gas plant, it should protect customers from high bills due to volatile gas prices by instituting a fuel cost sharing mechanism for the fuel costs spent to run this plant.

Duke Doesn’t Need this Risky Gas Power Plant

Duke’s claim that it needs this fossil gas power plant is based on outdated analysis. In this CPCN docket, Duke relies on its 2023 Carbon Plan Integrated Resource Plan (CPIRP) modeling and the CPIRP supplemental update and analysis filed in January 2024. The world has changed dramatically since then, and it is important that the Commission review the latest information before approving expenditures that will impact customer bills for decades.

Duke’s load forecast – once based on steady, predictable growth – is now subject to significant uncertainty as 1) data center developers look around the country for the best deal and the fastest interconnection to the grid and 2) manufacturers announce projects and then pull back as political uncertainty changes the economics of those projects. Under Duke’s current rate structure, prospective companies and site developers do not need to commit much money to become part of Duke’s load forecast. They have very little “skin in the game,” and Duke currently does not have policies in place to change this. If the Commission allows Duke to build an expensive fossil gas plant for load that doesn’t materialize, Duke’s remaining customers will be on the hook to pay for it.

Duke’s own load forecast updates since 2023 show that there are wild swings in its predictions. In the Spring of 2023, Duke anticipated 8 new large load projects during its 10-year planning forecast period, requiring an average of 169 MW each. Then for Fall 2023 (the supplemental update filed in January 2024), Duke anticipated 35 projects requiring an average of 111 MW each. In Summer 2024, Duke changed its forecast again, projecting 39 projects requiring an average of only 103 MW. And in May 2025, Duke filed an update showing a reduction in the number of projects back down to 35 but a dramatic increase in average need – back up to 169 MW. Duke’s forecasts will continue to show swings up and down – both in the number of projects and megawatts – until Duke has policies in place that require more commitment from the companies that knock on its door requesting service. Duke also has not published information regarding the location of these loads – the latest forecast applies to all of Duke Energy in both North and South Carolina.

It is also important to know that that this gas plant isn’t needed to meet growing load from existing customers or to replace retiring coal plants (according to Duke’s own testimony). This gas plant is being justified by new manufacturing and data centers claiming they will be operating somewhere in Duke Energy Progress or Duke Energy Carolinas territory in North or South Carolina.

Even if the load shows up, this plant won’t be needed for long

Even Duke admits that it doesn’t “need” this fossil gas power plant for very long. These kinds of power plants, combined-cycle plants, are typically used about 80% of the time, i.e. they are “baseload” power plants. But even absent federal carbon regulations, Duke expects this power plant’s usage to decline significantly throughout its 35-year lifetime (from 80% in 2030 decreasing to 46% by 2040 and only 13% by 2050 onwards). As cheaper renewables and storage with zero fuel costs are brought online, they will displace this plant. Duke is proposing to build a giant power plant that will very quickly run less and less – but Duke’s customers will continue to pay for it until 2065—15 years past a state law requiring Duke’s generation fleet to be carbon neutral. This represents a significant change in how power plants are built and run, and this is not in the best interest of Duke’s billpayers. To add insult to injury, Duke hasn’t even procured all of the equipment needed to build this plant, so the costs could skyrocket even more than they already have since last year’s carbon plan proceeding.

Renewables are flexible, would protect customers, and would reduce pollution

Duke’s model only chose a gas plant to meet this capacity need because of limits Duke imposed on the model. Duke claims it cannot interconnect renewables and storage fast enough to meet this capacity need, but the reasons it cannot interconnect those resources faster are all within Duke’s control. As Synapse recommends, Duke needs to update its processes that are holding back renewables and storage from serving customers with low-cost and low-risk resources. These processes include interconnection and transmission planning.

SACE has been advocating for improvements to these processes for years, and Duke has made changes to both its interconnection process and transmission planning. Duke was one of the first utilities in the Southeast to implement cluster studies in its interconnection process, and it is in the midst of the first scenario-based transmission planning exercise in the region. But is there evidence that these updates have helped if Duke continues to limit solar and storage in its future resource modeling? Given the much quicker interconnection process recently demonstrated in Texas, this raises the question of how hard Duke is really trying to streamline renewables interconnection.

Modular, flexible resources such as wind, solar, and energy storage can be adjusted in quantity based on market conditions. As our testimony from Synapse states, “This modularity, combined with the fact that solar and wind have zero exposure to fuel price volatility once they are constructed, makes these resources particularly valuable in the face of trade tariff uncertainty.”

The bottom line is that the Commission needs a lot more certainty about load growth and costs before committing Duke’s billpayers to any type of large fossil gas power plant. We simply do not have that now.",http://www.cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/fossil-gas-plant-4-Credit-rui_noronha-Stock-photo-ID-518628602-Purchased-4_5_24.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 13:02:20.786347

Meanwhile, similar initiatives in steel and aluminum continue to move forward with federal backing—an imbalance that is raising concerns about the consistency of industrial policy during the U.S. decarbonization push.

GPI leaders argue that their industry’s proposals were well-aligned with federal climate goals and based on proven, energy-efficient technologies. Yet DOE officials cited compliance issues and questioned whether the glass sector projects reflected current program priorities.

The industry contends these rejections were based on narrow interpretations and inconsistent criteria. According to GPI, the proposed projects would have delivered measurable emissions reductions and enhanced energy performance across glass manufacturing operations.

DOE’s uneven approach, industry stakeholders say, risks undermining the administration’s public commitments to supporting a broad cross-section of American manufacturing. The decision also threatens progress toward emissions targets within an important—but often overlooked—industrial sector.

Glass Sector Seeks Fairer Approach to Industrial Policy

Glass manufacturing in the U.S. is deeply integrated into critical supply chains, supporting industries ranging from food and beverage to pharmaceuticals. With production and recycling operations fully contained within U.S. borders, the sector supports more than 13,000 American jobs. Many facilities have been operating for generations, embedding the sector within longstanding regional economies.

At the same time, the industry faces mounting competition from lower-cost imports, particularly from China. Despite these challenges, domestic glass manufacturers have made ongoing investments in modernization and sustainable production. Maintaining competitiveness while meeting stricter North American labor and environmental standards remains an ongoing priority for the sector.

Microgrids are localized energy systems that use various power sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen.
Microgrids can offer resilience, sustainability and a cost effective source of clean energy.
“And it would create jobs, both in construction and operations.” Safety and engineering studies are now underway.","The village of Questa, 25 miles north of Taos, lost an important income source and jobs for locals when the 100-year-old mine closed three years ago. Then, drought, catastrophic wildfires, and winds causing power outages began to impact several communities in Northern New Mexico.

That is when Luis Reyes, CEO of Kit Carson Electric Cooperative, began searching for a solution to enhance the city’s energy portfolio and bring new jobs to the area. He landed on something called hydrogen microgrids.

Questa received a grant to study the viability of the project and after 18 months, the National Renewable Energy Lab in Boulder, Colorado returned its conclusion. The proposed project came back as viable.

“The technology is proven. Hydrogen has been around on the private side for a while now. We are just taking that technology and using it for a long duration battery and using it to create electricity for rural areas that are isolated,” Reyes said.

Microgrids are localized energy systems that use various power sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen. Kit Carson Electric Cooperative plans to use the hydrogen fuel cells to power small communities, businesses and critical public services.

“We can create a microgrid where we can serve parts of our system while the other parts may be out of power. There will still be parts of the system that keep critical infrastructure operating for the public safety,” said Reyes.

Microgrids can offer resilience, sustainability and a cost effective source of clean energy. “The members of the coop agree for all these reasons, hydro microgrids are worth it for their community. ""

“If you create the hydrogen through an electrolyzer, it’s clean. And, run it through a fuel cell, it’s clean. It’s clean energy, which our community wants,” Reyes continued. “And it would create jobs, both in construction and operations.”

Safety and engineering studies are now underway. The project is expected to be completed in the summer of 2028. Construction will employ between 1300 and 1500 workers and long-term operations of the microgrids requires 30 full-time employees.

“One of the things I’m looking at is helping local citizens get new skill sets, so these skills are transferable to other towns and cities,” Reyes said. “Then, you kind of take what you learned here and get jobs at other energy projects in the region.”

Reyes admits there are challenges. These challenges include escalating costs for materials, supply chain issues, identifying and preparing for safety issues, and acquiring the highest capacity storage batteries.

The American Public Power Association reports other challenges such as regulatory hurdles and implementing and maintaining technical integrations between multiple systems.

The Kit Carson Electric Coop sells most of its electricity during the winter months and lower during the summer. By using fossil fuels, solar and hydrogen, the coop can select the best energy source for the need, and assure availability in an emergency.

Cities in Colorado and Utah are also developing microgrids while Idaho Falls, Idaho successfully uses hydro power to support customers during critical outages.

The press release states:

Ensuring affordable and reliable energy supplies drives down the costs of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing while boosting our national security. Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of baseload power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the Artificial Intelligence capital of the world. The proposed repeals would remove regulatory barriers that limit access to our Nation’s energy resources and unleash America’s true potential…

The first Clean Power Plan was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022. Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country’s reliance on foreign-made energy.

In West Virginia v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the major questions doctrine barred EPA from misusing the Clean Air Act to manipulate Americans’ energy choices and shift the balance of the nation’s electrical fuel mix. The Biden Administration issued its own rule in 2024, which many critics say is just another attempt to achieve the unlawful fuel-shifting goals of the Clean Power Plan.

The Clean Power Plan 2.0 would have devastated grid reliability across MISO and other regional grids due to coal-fired generator shutdowns. American Experiment submitted a 35-page comment on the Biden administration’s original draft of the rule in 2023, which would have also required existing natural gas plants to capture emissions as well.

American Experiment’s reliability analysis showed that the EPA’s modeled MISO grid would “result in large capacity shortfalls that will cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars” and that shoring up those shortfalls would cost an additional $246 billion. Those costs would have outweighed the estimated net benefits that the EPA found for the entire country.

The EPA estimates its proposal to repeal power plant emissions rules would save $19 billion over 20 years in compliance costs. However, to avert blackouts and maintain reliability, hundreds of billions of dollars would have been spent replacing retiring coal plants with intermittent wind and solar.

On Wednesday, the U.S. EPA proposed repealing Biden administration rules that limit toxic pollutants and planet-warming emissions from coal and gas plants across the country. These plants ​“do not contribute significantly” to ​“dangerous” air pollution, the EPA claimed — something that many, many studies have shown isn’t true. Power plants are the second-largest source of carbon emissions in the country, and they’re responsible for a lot of health-harming pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, too.

When the Biden administration first announced the rules last year, the EPA estimated they would stem 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon pollution through 2047. That’s the equivalent of taking 328 million gas cars off the road for a year, and amounts to an estimated $370 billion in climate and public health benefits.

Those benefits would’ve helped communities surrounding gas and coal plants around the U.S., according to the Sierra Club’s Trump Coal Pollution Dashboard. For example, Montana’s Colstrip 3 plant would have to reduce its toxic pollution under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard, while a slew of plants across the Midwest and Southwest would have to install carbon-capture systems or shut down under the greenhouse gas rules.

The changes will allow coal plants around the country to keep burning. In North Dakota, some state officials are celebrating what they say is a big step toward protecting jobs and the coal industry. But in Georgia, health advocates and scientists warn the preservation of coal plants in their state will fall hard on vulnerable communities, especially those surrounding the facilities.

Still, none of this is set in stone. The EPA’s proposals are vulnerable to several legal pitfalls, including challenges involving the Clean Air Act, the agency’s insistence that power plants don’t produce ​“significant” emissions, and the health, economic, and other costs of increasing pollution, E&E News reports. Analysts with TD Cowen expect the EPA to finalize the rules by early next year, but say legal challenges and uncertainty will continue through all of 2026.

More big energy stories

“Big, Beautiful Bill” threatens rooftop solar

President Donald Trump’s ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” is already having big impacts on the rooftop solar industry. The bill, now undergoing negotiations in the Senate, looks to repeal tax credits for solar installations and other clean energy projects. That includes credits that allowed a North Carolina food bank to install solar panels on the roof of its headquarters, which it anticipates will save the organization $143,000 each year. Other nonprofits are looking to follow suit — but they probably won’t be able to if they can’t access federal incentives, Canary Media’s Elizabeth Ouzts reports.

The bill is also causing problems for two solar companies. Lender Solar Mosaic filed for bankruptcy last week, specifically citing ​“legislation that threatens to eliminate tax credits for residential solar” as a forthcoming challenge. Residential solar giant Sunnova followed with a bankruptcy filing over the weekend.

While both companies’ difficulties predate the Trump administration, it’s clear that the residential solar sector is facing a difficult and uncertain moment, one analyst told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John. An analysis by Ohm Analytics estimates that the House’s version of the bill would lead rooftop solar installations across the country to drop by half next year, and another from Morgan Stanley projects an 85% decrease through 2030.

Bright spots for clean energy

Amid a sea of bad news for clean energy companies, some are still finding success.

Take Sublime Systems, which recently had its $87 million federal grant cancelled: Sublime says private-sector support is allowing its $150 million low-carbon cement factory in Massachusetts to move forward anyway.

Solar panel manufacturer Qcells said it’s launching a new recycling operation in Georgia to repurpose retired panels. Heirloom Carbon is meanwhile keeping its operations rolling by winning over Republican state leadership in Louisiana, where it aims to build a facility that extracts carbon dioxide from the air. Developer Intersect Power got the green light Wednesday to build what would be the biggest solar-and-storage plant in the nation.

And in the Chicago area, Sun Metalon just raised $9.1 million from investors — including Japan’s Nippon Steel — to build its steel decarbonization business, Canary Media’s Kari Lydersen reports. The startup has created an oven-sized box that melts down waste metal and sludge from steel and aluminum production, churning out pucks of reusable, recyclable metal.

Dive Brief:

The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesdayproposed eliminating greenhouse gas emissions standards and loosening mercury emissions requirements at power plants nationwide.

EPA estimates repealing emission guidelines and carbon capture requirementswould save the power sector about $1.2 billion a year beginning in 2026 and repealing 2024 amendments to mercury emissions standardswould save power plants about $120 million a year.

Climate Mayors, a bipartisan network of nearly 350 mayors, responded to the proposed changes. “These rollbacks undermine the ability of mayors to shield their residents from harm and would allow corporations to pollute our air and water, and erode the quality of life for children and families across America,” Climate Mayors Executive Director Kate Wright said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March the agency was reconsidering certain power plant emissions regulations, known as Clean Power Plan 2.0, imposed by the Biden administration in May 2024.

When the rules were announced in 2024,the EPA estimated they would prevent up to 1,200 premature deaths, 360,000 asthma symptoms and 57,000 lost workdays in 2035.

The EPA’s announcement this week states it is moving forward to repeal the 2024 regulations, which it says “have imposed massive costs on coal-, oil-, and gas-fired power plants, raising the cost of living for American families, imperiling the reliability of our electric grid, and limiting American energy prosperity.”

TheU.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that repealing Clean Power Plan 2.0 “would remove a barrier to producing the electricity generation needed to maintain our domestic energy security and our competitive edge in critical fields like artificial intelligence.”

Some community leaders pushed back, saying the repeal would harm their constituents’ health.

“With so many affordable, zero-emission energy sources on the market, it is beyond unacceptable that the EPA would roll back pollution rules for power plants,” Ashley Stolzmann, a county commissioner in Boulder County, Colorado, said in an emailed statement. “In our area, we need to reduce power plant emissions, reverse the damage and clean our air.”

Climate Mayors said weakening safeguards around mercury “not only jeopardizes the health of city residents, especially those in historically underserved neighborhoods, it also hinders the ability of local leaders to build stronger, healthier and more resilient communities.”

The National League of Cities, in an emailed statement, urged the EPA “to consider the perspective of local leaders from America’s cities, towns and villages.”

“As first responders, local leaders across the nation have taken significant steps to mitigate impacts and strengthen their communities,” NLC stated. “Despite the progress local governments have made and their commitment to continuing action, it is clear our work is not done. We urge the federal government to be a partner in these efforts in support of the economy and building resilient communities.”

TheLeague of Conservation Voters vowed to “fight back against these unpopular, dangerous schemes,” and the National Resources Defense Council suggested it will sue. “Our lawyers will be watching closely, and if the EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court,” NRDC President and CEO Manish Bapna said in a statement.

Lawmakers responded along party lines.

U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, a Republican from Virginia,said it gives “communities like mine in Appalachia hope.” He said he would “continue to support federal developments that aim to reinvigorate coal communities and lower energy costs for American families.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/GicBIvWxbb6sZRbjgg6a5I2o-Db_valfo3SkAKxbzms/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE5MTc0OTU3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-13 12:04:15.029437

The Associated Press asked 30 different scientists, experts in climate, health and economics, about the scientific reality behind this proposal.
“This is the scientific equivalent to saying that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the temperature monitoring group Berkeley Earth.
""The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms, infectious diseases, and many other health threats.

The Associated Press asked 30 different scientists, experts in climate, health and economics, about the scientific reality behind this proposal. Nineteen of them responded, all saying that the proposal was scientifically wrong and many of them called it disinformation. Here's what eight of them said.

“This is the scientific equivalent to saying that smoking doesn’t cause lung cancer,” said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the temperature monitoring group Berkeley Earth. “The relationship between CO2 emissions and global temperatures has been well established since the late 1800s, and coal burning is the single biggest driver of global CO2 emissions, followed by oil and gas. It is utterly nonsensical to say that carbon emissions from power plants do not contribute significantly to climate change.”

""It’s about as valid as saying that arsenic is not a dangerous substance to consume,"" said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann.

""The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms, infectious diseases, and many other health threats. These are indisputable facts,"" said Dr. Howard Frumkin, former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and a retired public health professor at the University of Washington.

Climate economist R. Daniel Bressler of Columbia University, said: “We can use tools from climate economics, including the mortality cost of carbon and the social cost of carbon, to estimate the climate impacts of these emissions. For instance, in my past work, I found that adding just one year’s worth of emissions from an average-sized coal-fired plant in the U.S. causes 904 expected temperature-related deaths and over $1 billion in total climate damages.”

University of Arizona climate scientist Kathy Jacobs said: ""Their statement is in direct conflict with evidence that has been presented by thousands of scientists from almost 200 countries for decades.

“It’s basic chemistry that burning coal and natural gas releases carbon dioxide and it’s basic physics that CO2 warms the planet. We’ve known these simple facts since the mid-19th century,” said Oregon State's Phil Mote.

Andrew Weaver, a professor at the University of Victoria and former member of parliament in British Columbia, said: “President Trump is setting himself up for international court charges against him for crimes against humanity. To proclaim you don’t want to deal with climate change is one thing, but denying the basic science can only be taken as a wanton betrayal of future generations for which there should be consequences.”

Stanford climate scientist Chris Field, who coordinated an international report linking climate change to increasingly deadly extreme weather, summed it up this way: ""It is hard to imagine a decision dumber than putting the short-term interests of oil and gas companies ahead of the long-term interests of our children and grandchildren.""

City officials said the public chargers — located at stations at the Warren Hood Building parking lot on the corner of Pearl Street and State Street, as well as Thalia Mara Hall and Union Station — are free to use for now but didn’t know for how long that would stay the case.

As of 2023, Mississippi had the fewest number of electric vehicles on the road per capita, based on registration data from the U.S. Department of Energy. DOE numbers also show Mississippi has the second fewest public charging stations per capita after Louisiana.

In 2018, state lawmakers passed an annual fee of $150 for electric car owners and $75 for hybrid vehicles owners as a way of compensating for lost gas tax revenue.

Entergy bought the chargers from Tesla, and the nonprofit Adopt a Charger installed the units through local contractor Lavallee, which will also maintain them for the city. Jackson’s Planning and Development Director Jhai Keeton said the city is paying just $600 a year for the chargers.

Adopt a Charger partners with private companies, in this case Entergy, who want to sponsor charging stations for public use. The nonprofit, according to its website, has also partnered on stations at the Mississippi Children’s Museum and at Hinds Community College in Raymond.

While there were already several charging stations in Jackson, the ones unveiled Thursday are the first owned by the city. Prior to then, Tupelo had the most charging stations of any Mississippi city with 13, according to DOE data. Hattiesburg and Jackson, not including the new stations, each have 12, and there are 10 in both Biloxi and Gulfport.

The Mississippi Department of Transportation is using $50 million in federal funds to develop electric vehicle corridors with 30 new stations throughout the state, but those projects are likely one to two years away. ___

“It was a significant setback and it’s deeply disappointing,” said CleanAIRE NC spokesman Andrew Whelan, about the recent court decision on the appeal.
CleanAIRE NC used this funding for education efforts and to install sensors that collect data on pollutants impacting health.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs are appealing the decision after filing an “en banc” review, according to Gerald Babao, CleanAIRE NC deputy director.
“But it’s not going to stop the work.” CleanAIRE NC is planning to launch a fundraising campaign this month for air monitoring across the state.","A nonprofit’s plan to continue using EPA grants to monitor clean air across Mecklenburg County was derailed again after a federal appeals court upheld the Trump administration’s decision to slash funding for environmental programs.

In late May, a federal district court judge in South Carolina ordered funding to be restored for environmental programs across the country, including Charlotte-based CleanAIRE NC, according to Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.

A $500,000 Environmental Protection Agency grant from last year was restored to monitor air quality in four northern Mecklenburg communities: Smithville in Cornelius; Huntington Green and Pottstown in Huntersville; and West Davidson in Davidson. This work includes the installation of air monitors.

But that victory didn’t last long.

On June 5, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked a lower court order requiring federal organizations to restore grant funding to nonprofits and municipalities. Earlier this year, the Department of Government Efficiency and the Environmental Protection Agency had begun cutting hundreds of grants nationwide, totaling $1.7 billion, according to an EPA news release.

“It was a significant setback and it’s deeply disappointing,” said CleanAIRE NC spokesman Andrew Whelan, about the recent court decision on the appeal. “It means that we’re once again putting this critical work on hold, when we had just begun to reengage with the communities.”

CleanAIRE NC also installed air monitors in McCrorey Heights in 2024, using a $75,000 EPA grant awarded in 2021. This work included the installation of monitors in several Historic West End neighborhoods such as Washington Heights, Northwood Estates, Hoskins Road, and Oaklawn Park, as well as McCrorey Heights.

The latest grant for northern Mecklenburg County originated from the EPA’s Environmental Justice Collaborative, a Clinton-era initiative designed to address environmental challenges in minority and low-income populations. CleanAIRE NC used this funding for education efforts and to install sensors that collect data on pollutants impacting health.

About the fight over federal funds

Before the funding freeze, CleanAIRE NC had been testing equipment in north Mecklenburg County that was slated for installation.

The court’s recent decision stems from a lawsuit filed in March by the SELC and Public Rights Project against the funding freeze.

This lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Charleston on behalf of 13 nonprofits and six cities, highlighted how the pause furloughed employees and halted programs vital to communities, farmers and public health.

“This ruling echoes what cities and local governments have said all along: the unlawful termination of congressionally approved funds caused real harm to communities,” said Public Rights Project Founder and CEO Jill Habig in May.

The permanent injunction would have restored the majority of the grants that SELC and the PRP represented in the lawsuit, according to the organizations.

In May, SELC Litigation Director Kym Meyer said the organization is ready to challenge the administration’s decision, including taking the appeal up to the Supreme Court if needed.

Details of the case

On June 5, according to court documents, the Richmond, Va.-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted the administration’s request for a stay because the government is likely to succeed in its argument that the district court lacked the authority to issue such an order.

The appeals court found that the dispute likely falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, rather than a district court.

Citing a Supreme Court decision, the Fourth Circuit stated that the payment of money under grant agreements are essentially contract disputes usually handled by the Court of Federal Claims.

“Residents were very excited about the process of finally getting answers about their local air quality,” Whelan said. “We were actively engaged in the process and to have it paused again, it’s a real punch to the gut.”

Government officials said disbursing those funds would cause irreparable harm, as they cannot recoup the money later.

Circuit Judge Toby Heytens filed a dissent in the case. He stated that the government did not make a “strong showing” that it would likely to succeed on the merits to warrant a stay.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs are appealing the decision after filing an “en banc” review, according to Gerald Babao, CleanAIRE NC deputy director. This means all judges of the court, instead of a panel, will review the case

In the meantime, the organization will continue to push for funding restoration and move forward with its work.

“We certainly will continue to diversify funding resources, whether that be applying for state grant funds, through private foundations and community donations,” Babao said. “But it’s not going to stop the work.”

CleanAIRE NC is planning to launch a fundraising campaign this month for air monitoring across the state. Last week, it launched an online dashboard to track real-time air quality in neighborhoods.

Whelan said north Mecklenburg residents have lived with the impacts of industrial pollution and heavy traffic for decades, without any kind of comprehensive studies about air quality.

“The aim of this project is to change that and give them the tools and knowledge to understand their environment and to help them advocate for healthier living,” he said. “The legal setback is frustrating, but it does not diminish the critical needs of this work.”",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/latest-news/ajmjej/picture302755049/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/CleanAIRE%20NC%20(4),N,,2025-06-13 12:05:43.816246

The data comes from Rho Motion, which said that the May sales figures also represented a more modest monthly increase of 8%.

Over the first five months of the year, global EV sales topped 7 million with China seeing sales of 4.4 million over the period. Chinese sales were supported by the authorities extending the vehicle trade-in policy scheme into 2025 to boost consumer consumption and spending and help economic growth.

“The story this month with global vehicle sales is the continued chasm between Chinese market growth which saw one million vehicles sold in May, versus the faltering market in N. America,” data manager Charles Lester said.

Lester added that EV and hybrid sales in Europe were “healthy”, noting the role that government support plays in the growth of EV adoption in the region.

The EV industry had a difficult year in 2024 as key governments tries to phase out subsidies and let sales be driven by the market. They soon found out this was not happening and reinstated the incentives to keep people buying electric vehicles, reversing the sales decline.

Challenges remain, however, as EV makers outside China still struggle to put their electric cars on an economic par with internal combustion engine vehicles despite progress in bringing down costs.

In the United States things are very different than they are in Europe, with the Trump administration axing incentives, leaving carmakers to fend for themselves. The first reactions are already in: GM said this week it will invest $4 billion in expanding its ICE car production in a departure from previously announced plans to go all-electric by 2035.

The Trump administration's proposal is a significant step up compared to the Biden administration's multi-year rule that set biomass-based diesel volumes at 3.35 billion gallons in 2025. The industry has been calling for much higher RFS volumes to match actual production, at a time when biodiesel plants have been cutting back or closing production in light of lingering tax uncertainty.

On small-refinery exemptions, the EPA offered an evaluation of where things stand.

EPA said the total volumes requirements remain the same regardless of SREs but the percentage obligations for non-exempt obligated parties increase when SREs are granted. So, the volume obligations would be achieved by fewer obligated parties.

""There is currently significant uncertainty regarding the number of small-refinery exemption petitions that could be granted for 2026 and 2027,"" the agency said in the proposal.

""We have yet to take further action on these petitions and are still determining how we will evaluate and decide those petitions, which would then inform how we would evaluate and decide any SRE petitions received for 2026 and 2027. We expect to communicate our policy regarding SRE petitions going forward before finalization of this rule.""

EPA provides a range of potential gallons exempted for 2026 and 2027 from what it says are about 34 qualifying and operational small refineries that produce about 18 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel. To qualify for exemptions, the RFS requires small refineries to show disproportionate harm from having to meet their obligations.

Geoff Cooper, CEO and president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the proposal was a good first step for biofuels producers and farmers.

""It represents an excellent starting point for the 2026 and 2027 RVO discussion,"" Cooper said in a statement.

""The entire supply chain is seeking certainty regarding EPA's plans on SREs and today's proposal helps to clarify the agency's approach moving forward. We agree that the agency has a legal obligation to reallocate any exempted blending volumes, consistent with the approach adopted by EPA near the end of President Trump's first administration. However, EPA's top priority for SREs should be maintaining a high standard for evaluating petitions and continuing to take a restrained and limited approach. The marketplace needs to be reassured that the RVOs published by EPA are real and will not be watered down or eroded by SREs.""

American Coalition for Ethanol CEO Brian Jennings said the ""stakes are high"" for this next phase of the RFS.

""Ethanol producers and farmers are under tremendous economic pressure, particularly due to uncertainty caused by current efforts to reorder international trade and we need EPA to substantially increase domestic ethanol blending under the RFS in 2026 and 2027,"" Jennings said. ""This rulemaking is a pivotal opportunity for the Trump administration to fully utilize the RFS statutory authorities by setting ambitious blending targets that reflect the critical role American ethanol plays in strengthening U.S. energy security, boosting rural economies and reducing prices at the pump.""

To accomplish this vision, however, the federal government needs to address key gaps that are preventing the commercialization of its own energy breakthroughs.

Many new energy infrastructure technologies in the U.S. face a structural investment gap that stalls their commercialization, often referred to as the “missing middle.” Addressing that gap is essential to enable private investment and markets to takeover and scale a technology.

The federal government has addressed this gap in the past when technologies aligned with national strategic priorities. SpaceX, for example, benefited from direct procurement and funding by the Department of Defense and NASA. Shale gas drilling innovation, in another example, benefited from targeted federal research and development and tax credits. These were strategic investments by the U.S. government that, in addition to pre-existing conditions, created entire industries worth hundreds of billions of dollars in economic value.

To accomplish current U.S. energy innovation goals, the administration has an opportunity to catalyze commercialization of technologies. First, it needs to be careful not to remove key incentives for emerging technologies that are slated to be cut in the recent House budget reconciliation bill. Beyond that, it should evaluate how the federal government can address nine conditions – characterized in a new systemic bankability framework – needed to accelerate energy technology commercialization. needed to accelerate energy technology commercialization.

The “missing middle” gap

America faces a commercialization gap. Broadly speaking, commercializing large energy infrastructure technologies involves advancing a technology from small-scale research and development (R&D) to widespread commercial-scale deployment. To bridge these end points, technologies need to deploy often costly commercial-scale projects over time that improve the technology, reduce costs, and instill a high degree of confidence in investors that projects can deliver predictable returns.

In practice, however, there is a structural investment gap referred to as the “missing middle” that slows the formation of this bridge. Unlike software startups that can prototype quickly and cheaply, energy infrastructure technologies require large-scale pilot projects that have no natural investor. Demonstration projects require a scale of investment that is too large for venture investors, but too risky for institutional investors. At this stage, the combination of risk and investment scale that has no suitable investor (i.e., a “missing middle”) and technology progress stalls (Figure 1).

Establishing systemic bankability to enable private markets to scale innovation

Together with industry and academics, Clean Air Task Force has outlined nine conditions that need to be established to scale energy infrastructure technologies. Widespread and pervasive existence of these conditions results in systemic bankability – access to large- scale institutional capital that enables speed and scale of deployment.

The nine conditions to establish systemic bankability include:

Construction cost overrun risk: The risk that the construction costs projected at the time of final investment decision get significantly inflated during the construction period.

Technology performance risks: Risks related to the technology or overall project not performing as expected at FID, including lesser output than expected or higher operating costs than expected.

Revenue adequacy risk (volume and price) risks: Risks related to whether the project will earn the necessary amount of revenue to satisfy financial obligations.

Regulatory certainty: Risks related to predictability and efficient implementation of policies relevant for the financial performance of the project, including permitting complexity and timelines.

Access to enabling infrastructure networks: Whether a project can access the necessary infrastructure networks for its operations and performance. Networks may be electricity transmission, fuel pipelines, carbon dioxide pipelines and storage, and others.

Social acceptance: Refers to the social license to locate and operate a project within its community.

Robust supply chains: Refers to the robustness of the supply chains necessary to build and operate a project.

Access to commercial insurance: Whether the project can access commercial insurance to insure its financial performance.

Adequate delivery system: Refers to whether there is enough labor to build and operate a project. Examples include financial deal processing capacity and engineering, procurement, and construction management, and skilled operating labor.

Through a variety of potential mechanisms, the U.S. government can help establish these conditions until private markets take over. Notably, many mechanisms exist beyond direct (e.g., grants) and indirect incentives (e.g., tax subsidies), including government procurement, regulatory reforms, insurance, and more. Without these conditions, technologies will not scale rapidly.

The path forward

Energy infrastructure technologies like nuclear, geothermal, and CCS technologies won’t commercialize through market forces alone – they need the same strategic support that created America’s aerospace and hydraulic fracturing industries.

Recent actions by the Trump administration and Congress are having mixed impacts on the ability for technologies to overcome the “missing middle” and achieve system bankability. For most, these actions have largely reduced the ability to overcome market gaps. Proposed cuts to tax credits in the House’ reconciliation draft undermine revenue adequacy for nuclear, geothermal, and CCS projects, and the ceasing of the Department of Energy’s grant and loan programs will reduce the crowding-in of private investment into the “missing middle” gap. In contrast, the administration’s recent executive orders on nuclear regulatory reforms and deployment only partly address the “missing middle” for new nuclear but overall are insufficient to drive new nuclear deployment.

Going forward, the U.S. government will need to address all nine conditions of systemic bankability for its strategic technologies. This includes, but is not limited to, additional executive orders accelerating deployment and improving bankability conditions, and empowering the Department of Energy to help finance early-stage pilot and demonstration projects.

BOULDER, Colo. — Proponents of a growing movement in the construction industry are asking: Why tear down old buildings with wrecking balls when those materials can be mined for reusable materials?

The practice, called deconstruction, creates a circular economy of reuse for building materials. It keeps waste out of landfills and shrinks the carbon footprint of buildings and infrastructure. It's the kind of idea that sounds like an obvious win-win. But as the built environment rapidly changes over from one generation to the next, communities may not yet have the infrastructure — the sorting facilities and reuse stores — to keep up with new demand.

Deconstruction and reuse industries have taken flight in the past five to 10 years in cities like Portland, Ore., and Boulder, Colo., where much of the original aging housing stock is now being replaced to suit the tastes of a much wealthier 21st-century population. As old homes come down to make way for new ones, specialist contractors like Anna Perks are moving in to handle the materials left behind.

""Our team is systematically unbuilding the structure,"" said Perks, co-owner of Perks Deconstruction, a contracting company that disassembles buildings for parts. She was hired to make a snug three-bedroom, two-bath home near the top of a green, hilly street in Boulder disappear.

Her crew worked quickly. After the first day on-site, the roof of the house disappeared. The siding, too. A crew wielding hammers and crowbars pried pieces of wood sheathing off the studs and carefully sorted materials. Others clawed nails out of two-by-sixes in the backyard.

""We've got a pretty good pile of lumber,"" she said. ""That's all ceiling joists and floor joists. There's a lot of good reusable lumber in there.""

The workers were trained to work precisely and with patience to keep the lumber as intact as possible as they removed it from the house.

""Typically, what happens is a bulldozer will come in, smash it all — it'll all get trashed,"" Perks said. ""But deconstruction, we try to salvage and recycle as much as possible.""

The carbon emissions embodied in buildings

The idea is to limit the climate impact of our built environment, which accounts for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. About half of that comes from the embodied carbon of construction materials, according to Michelle Lambert, the policy and engagement manager at the nonprofit Carbon Leadership Forum.

""Embodied carbon is the greenhouse gas emissions that are generated by the manufacturing, the transportation, the installation, all the way through to the disposal of construction materials that are used in buildings or in roads and other infrastructure projects,"" Lambert said.

For a long time, experts have focused on the climate impact of building operations — the energy used to heat, cool and electrify spaces.

""But in the last five, 10 years, we've really started to understand that the materials and the processes that have created those materials are a really significant piece of the whole carbon footprint of buildings as well,"" she said.

The big promise of deconstruction is in creating a circular economy for building materials: harvesting lumber, say, from an old house, rather than a forest.

""Making use of the materials that we have already manufactured is one of the most impactful ways that we can reduce embodied carbon,"" Lambert said. ""Eliminating all of those emissions that would've been required to create new materials.""

The challenges of deconstruction

Chris Fellows, president of Colorado-based development company Resolute Strategies, hired Perks Deconstruction to dismantle a few crumbling farm buildings on a former homestead he's now building out as a mixed-use residential neighborhood in Aurora. In his brief for the project, he included reusing as many of the original materials as possible on-site.

Bricks from the farmhouse and siding from the barn have been set aside in containers. They'll be incorporated into a new community center for the neighborhood.

""This was a place where there's cool history and culture in the pioneers and the settlers that came out and did dryland farming,"" Fellows said. ""We're trying to honor that part of that culture and history of Colorado.""

Fellows said he and his partners also liked deconstruction as a way to cut the carbon footprint of the project.

""We wanted to be good stewards of the land in terms of the climate and the environment,"" he said. ""So, to the extent that we could reuse and recycle any materials, we wanted to do that, so we don't have to consume as much new material, nor do we have to take as much stuff to a landfill.""

Just because the interest is there doesn't mean the execution is easy. A successful deconstruction program requires local infrastructure for processing and distributing salvaged materials, not to mention local end markets — people who want to buy and use those materials. Boulder, for instance, has a robust deconstruction ecosystem that includes expert contractors and recycling facilities for concrete, masonry and lumber, not to mention several building-materials reuse stores and donation centers.

But a lot of places don't have those resources.

""We have to have a place to take all this material,"" Perks said. ""It gets really hard for contractors when there's nowhere to take the material.""

The extra cost of deconstruction can also make it a hard sell. Homeowners and developers may be motivated by environmental reasons, but the economic incentives aren't there.

Fellows estimates that deconstruction increased project costs 35% to 40% and added at least a year to the schedule.

""Because we had to stage things carefully and do them in a certain sequence,"" he said. ""And we had to find the right people.""

Even so, Fellows said he's glad they went for it and even thinks he'll see an eventual return on the investment when eco-conscious homebuyers learn about the process.

""We'll have to check back in three to five years. We'll see if we think that's happening,"" he said. ""But I think it was still the right thing to do.""

On the books

A handful of local governments, from Palo Alto, Calif., to Fort Myers, Fla., and counting, now either require some percentage of demolition waste be salvaged, reused or recycled, or incentivize those practices. Portland, where an ordinance has been on the books since 2016, was among the earliest deconstruction pioneers.

In Boulder, more than 140 million pounds of materials have been kept out of landfills since a deconstruction ordinance was adopted in 2020, according to the city of Boulder's circular economy policy adviser, Emily Freeman.

""All residential and commercial buildings are required to be deconstructed,"" Freeman said. ""The ordinance requirements are that 75% or more of those building materials are diverted from landfill.""

So far, the city has overshot that goal. Over the last five years, Freeman said, more than 83% of the construction waste generated in Boulder has been kept out of landfills.

As the movement matures, Perks said, the next frontier in deconstruction would be to plan for disassembly before a building ever got built.

""Can you either incorporate reclaimed materials into the new design, or when you're designing, can you think about what's this going to be like to take it down?"" she said. ""And when it gets taken down, can it be reused?""

Perks says the future of climate-conscious construction will be knowing exactly how you'll take a building apart before you even put it together.

The suite of investment, production and residential tax credits enacted and expanded under the Democrats’ own big budget reconciliation bill in 2022, titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change.

The credits have spurred hundreds of billions in investment dollars in advanced manufacturing and production since 2022, and contributed to job creation, largely in states that elected President Donald Trump to a second term.

Small business operators and community leaders from rural and mountainous areas of the United States that have benefited from the boom in alternative energy sources say the campaign to end the tax credits will also cause job losses and cut options for consumers.

Solar projects in Alaska

Chase Christie, director of development for Alaska Solar LLC, said his company installs four to five large-scale solar projects per year in remote Alaskan villages and also fits and services smaller residential solar installations.

“They take a lot of planning, a lot of logistics,” Christie told States Newsroom in an interview Wednesday.

“For going into a remote village where there’s tundra, we might need to go there in the dead of winter so we can work on frozen ground,” he added. “Other places we won’t go until summer. So we have these large gaps in between these larger projects, and a company like ours absolutely relies on the residential installations to keep our workforce going.”

Christie, who met Tuesday with staffers for Alaska’s Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said in January he let a handful of workers go and paused most new hiring.

“Our workforce is roughly half of what it usually is just because we’re not sure which direction things are going to go,” he said.

Christie was among a dozen small energy business owners, municipal government officials and nonprofit employees focused on energy options for low-income households who States Newsroom spoke to Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement: “Senator Sullivan supports energy projects that lower costs for Alaska. The Senator and his team have been meeting with a number of Alaskans about energy tax credits. As we wait for text from the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator is working with his colleagues to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between promoting stable and predictable tax policy, advancing projects that benefit Alaska, and addressing the need to reduce the federal deficit.”

Murkowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elimination of tax credits

Senators are hashing out language for the massive Republican agenda bill that will extend and expand the 2017 tax law, costing roughly $3.8 trillion, and cut spending in other areas to offset the price tag.

A contingent of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam,” won on accelerating the expiration of the energy tax credits and tightening restrictions on eligibility as a way to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts that Trump campaigned on.

The language in a section of the House bill, passed 215-214 on May 22, titled “Working Families Over Elites,” terminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, worth up to $3,200 for homeowners who make energy upgrades to their property.

Among the slate of other affected IRA tax credits, the House bill also speeds up the expiration of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a credit dating back decades that was updated in 2022.

The credit is available to taxpayers who invest in “energy property,” including solar installations to provide electricity and heat, fuel cells, small wind turbines, geothermal pumps, and other electricity-producing technologies.

House Republicans wrote provisions to eliminate the credit for facilities placed into service after 2028 and end eligibility for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

The credit is worth up to 30% of the cost of the project, plus two bonus credits up to 10% each if the project includes mostly domestically produced material and if it’s located in an “energy community,” meaning a place where a coal plant has closed or where unemployment reaches a certain threshold.

The bill also repeals a taxpayer’s ability to transfer the tax credits as a way to finance a project, and introduces restrictions on foreign-made components that industry professionals say essentially makes the credit unworkable.

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, as of June 4, the elimination of the clean energy investment and production tax credits will save roughly $249 billion over the next decade.

Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a right-of-center think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Thursday in a new analysis that “The final House bill makes impressive cuts to the IRA green energy tax credits, but it does so in part by introducing more complexity.”

The group is advocating for senators to reduce the tax credit rates and make clearer complicated language, like the provision around “foreign entities of concern.”

Keeping on the heat during a Montana winter

But Logan Smith, weatherization program manager for the Human Resource Development Council in central Montana, argues the credits have been a lifeline for lower-income rural residents.

“If I can get solar panels on each of the clients’ homes, that means that their power is going to stay on in the middle of winter,” Smith said. “Because every winter we plan for losing power for about a week, that’s just something we grew up with. … But if we have solar panels, the power stays on, the heat stays on.”

Ralph Waters, owner of SBS Solar in Missoula, Montana, became emotional when talking about how an early termination of the tax credits could slow his business and result in having to lay off half his workforce.

He criticized the politicization of the tax incentives.

“Montana is deeply red, but it’s also a very practical place. And so green energy renewables becomes a taboo phrase somehow,” Waters said. “The practical energy needs are undeniable, and so if we can get past our disagreements about the phraseology and realize that it’s electrons, watts, and amps. And it’s cheaper.”

The offices of Montana GOP Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy did not respond to a request for comment.

The Guidance outlines factors for certain markets regulated by the CFTC (""designated contract markets"") to consider when listing voluntary carbon credits derivative contracts.

Under the Congressional Review Act (""CRA""), Congress may rescind a final agency action, including guidance, subject to certain threshold requirements. If a CRA joint resolution of disapproval is passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the president, the rule at issue cannot go into effect or continue in effect. When this occurs, the Guidance becomes ineffective immediately and is treated as if it never went to effect. Additionally, once a rule has been disapproved, the agency may not reissue the rule in ""substantially the same form"" absent additional Congressional action.

The CRA has often been used to overturn traditional administrative rules and guidance documents during transitions between presidential administrations. Since the beginning of 2025, Congress has introduced 26 joint resolutions to rescind Biden-era rules related to the environment, climate, or energy. Two of the joint resolutions have passed in a single chamber, four have been sent to the president but not yet signed, and six have been signed by President Trump. Those signed by the president involve one nullifying the Environmental Protection Agency's rule titled ""Waste Emissions Charge for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems: Procedures for Facilitating Compliance, Including Netting and Exemptions,"" another titled ""National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Rubber Tire Manufacturing,"" and various other rules by the Department of Energy regarding energy conservation.

Although not a formal rule, the Guidance mentioned in the introduction is likely formal enough to be subject to recission under the CRA. According to the Government Accountability Office (""GAO"") database, the Guidance was not submitted for review to the GAO as required by the CRA. But the Guidance is likely still a rule for CRA purposes because it announces the CFTC's ""tentative intentions for the future."" Further, the Guidance mirrors formal rulemaking because it incorporates insights the CFTC gained from public comment and from collaboration with market participants. And though the Guidance is non-binding, it outlines the CFTC's expectations of designated contract markets. Notably, the Congressional Record describes the communication as ""transmitting, pursuant to law, a report of a rule entitled 'Commission Guidance Regarding the Listing of Voluntary Carbon Credit Derivative Contracts.'"" Therefore, the GAO would likely find that the Guidance is a rescindable ""statement of policy"" under the CRA.

Both the House and Senate would have had to pass the joint resolution, and the president would have to sign it, for the resolution to take effect. Although a similar resolution was introduced in the House and referred to the House Committee on Agriculture and House Subcommittee on Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development, there was no further action on either joint resolution by the recission deadline. As the deadline for Congress to act, based on the tentative schedule, was May 12, 2025, both resolutions have failed. But, although the CFTC has not announced an intention to do so, the agency may still rescind the Guidance through notice and comment rulemaking.

In any event, the joint resolution reflects an effort in Congress to quickly nullify Biden-era climate-related rules without forcing President Trump's agencies to undergo the often lengthy rescission process under the Administrative Procedure Act.

When power plants burn coal to generate electricity, the combustion releases toxic substances as a byproduct.","EPA is proposing to roll back some Biden-era regulations on power plants, including those targeting emissions of carbon and air toxics like mercury.

The proposal comes after LG&E and KU joined other utilities in asking the Trump administration to reverse regulations on carbon emissions from power plants.

EPA touted the economic benefits of repealing emission standards, but the costs to human health would be staggering, according to EPA accounting and advocacy groups.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to roll back all greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants, in addition to some restrictions on toxic power plant emissions like mercury, as part of the Trump administration's dismantling of Biden-era environment and climate regulations.

The proposal would pose a major setback in decarbonizing the emission-heavy power sectors of states like Kentucky, and also threatens to hamper efforts to improve air quality. Fossil fuel-fired power plants still make up more than 90% of Kentucky's electricity generation.

The EPA framed the rollbacks as a boon for consumers, the fossil fuel industry and the larger economy, and pointed to forecasts of spiking energy demand from data centers and other sources. The agency downplayed the health and environmental benefits of more stringent power plant emission standards as federal overreach.

""In 2023 and 2024, rules were enacted seeking to suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said June 11, ""seeking to make all sorts of industries, including coal and more, disappear — regulate them out of existence.""

Standing and smiling behind Zeldin as he signed the proposals was U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, Republican for Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District. Guthrie, whose district contains Kentucky's western coalfield, praised the Trump administration's efforts to ""unleash American energy"" and reverse what he called a ""radical, green regulatory agenda.""

Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, applauded the proposed rollbacks as a ""critical course correction,"" and called for a continued role for Kentucky coal in power generation amid ""soaring"" demand.

“In Kentucky, we know energy policy isn’t just an environmental issue — it's a kitchen‑table issue,"" Stivers said in a statement. ""Repealing these illogical mandates is a win for every family trying to pay their electric bill, every business owner managing costs, and every utility worker tasked with keeping our grid stable.""

Zeldin said the proposals would go up for public comment, and acknowledged they would likely face lawsuits from climate groups — but said the ""American public spoke loudly and clearly"" in November in favor of the Trump administration's energy policies. EPA also said the proposals would reduce regulatory costs by more than $20 billion.

EPA's accounting of the health costs of the rollbacks totaled about $130 billion, when considering factors like premature deaths, hospitalizations from lung and heart conditions and lost work days. The agency did not factor in the cost of emissions in the form of future climate-fueled disasters, also known as the social cost of carbon, in compliance with a Trump order.

Advocates were quick to denounce EPA's rollbacks, emphasizing the benefits of stringent regulation on power plant emissions to public health and climate.

""These emissions lead to higher rates of asthma attacks, premature deaths and cardiovascular diseases, and are contributing to worsening natural disasters such as deadly heat waves, hurricanes and wildfires across the world, including in Appalachia,"" Chelsea Barnes, director of government affairs and strategy for Appalachian Voices, said in a statement.

Kentucky has struggled to rein in greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, an undertaking climate scientists say is crucial for avoiding the worst outcomes of climate change. And some of the commonwealth's most impoverished communities, including in Louisville, have suffered from disproportionately unhealthy air quality.

""Undoing these standards would make our air even less safe and jeopardize vulnerable people in Louisville, especially children, older adults, pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions,"" Shannon Baker, director of advocacy for the American Lung Association in Kentucky and Tennessee, said in a statement. ""We cannot afford to strip away tools designed to protect them.""

The climate impact of Kentucky's power plants

In reasoning its proposal to repeal greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, EPA argued these emissions ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution,"" and are a ""small and decreasing part of global emissions.""

However, the U.S. power sector was responsible for an immense climate footprint in recent decades — about 5% of the world's emissions from 1990-2022, and more than all but a few countries' total emissions, according to one recent analysis.

In Kentucky, 21 power plants released more than 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2023, according to EPA data — comparable to driving a gas-powered car from Louisville to Lexington and back about 800 million times.

LG&E and KU, together forming the largest utility in the state, operate three of the five most-emitting plants.

Utilities and other power sector interests have called the carbon emission standards unworkable and argued they would hamper economic growth. In a January letter to the incoming Trump administration, LG&E and KU, Duke Energy and the Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corp. were among a group of utilities calling on EPA to ""immediately"" reverse Biden-era regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, The Courier Journal previously reported.

""We appreciate the U.S. EPA re-evaluating provisions that required utilities to adopt new or unproven technologies to comply with highly aggressive deadlines,"" Liz Pratt, an LG&E and KU spokesperson, said in a statement. ""We had voiced concerns that these provisions could risk grid reliability and would have stringent economic impacts on utilities' customers, local communities and states like Kentucky.

""We share a commitment to a cleaner energy future, and the pace of a clean energy transition — while ensuring there is sufficient energy supply across the U.S. to meet customers' demand and anticipated economic growth — is key.""

LG&E and KU's parent company, PPL, has a stated goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Some advocates are skeptical of whether the utilities will meet that target — and under the Trump administration's policies, they are facing less pressure to do so.

Kentucky has seen firsthand the consequences of a destabilizing climate. Experts have linked some of the state's recent disasters to these changes, as floods grow more intense and damaging, and other disasters, like extreme heat and drought, threaten public health, crop production, worker safety and more. The economic toll from these disasters will continue to climb, experts predict, especially as infrastructure is battered by stronger storms.

Advocates decry air toxics deregulation

In addition to targeting greenhouse gas standards, EPA is also seeking to repeal Biden-era amendments to another set of rules for power plants known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS.

The agency said these rules ""caused significant regulatory uncertainty, especially for coal plants"" in Kentucky and other states. The proposed rollbacks would revert the MATS rules to a less stringent version from 2012, and ""would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade,"" according to EPA.

When power plants burn coal to generate electricity, the combustion releases toxic substances as a byproduct. In recent years, LG&E's coal-fired Mill Creek Generating Station, in southwest Jefferson County, has released hundreds of pounds of neurotoxic metals like mercury, lead and nickel into the air.

LG&E has installed pollution controls to reduce these emissions in recent decades, and more reductions could follow as LG&E converts some of the plant to gas-fired generation.

But advocates said Kentucky communities cannot afford any setbacks in achieving healthier air.

Mercury, for one, ""may have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes,"" according to the World Health Organization, and its emissions join a laundry list of other chemicals released to the air near communities in Louisville and elsewhere.

""The American Lung Association in Kentucky calls on EPA to reconsider this deeply harmful proposal,"" Baker said. ""The health of our families, neighborhoods, and future generations in Louisville depends on it.""","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/02/PLOU/75485950007-mill-creek-03.jpg?crop=2999,1688,x0,y190&width=2999&height=1688&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-13 15:03:43.453214

Zack Colman, Benjamin Storrow, and Annie Snider report for Politico.

In short:

The Trump administration has dismantled Biden-era power plant rules and aims to scrap incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, gutting what little progress the U.S. had made on climate policy.

Legal and political whiplash — from Supreme Court decisions to partisan culture wars — has left the federal government paralyzed on greenhouse gas regulation, forcing states like California and New York to attempt solo action.

While market forces have helped push coal use down and clean energy up, scientists warn this won't be enough to hit climate goals without binding national regulations.

Key quote:

“Given what the science says about the need to act urgently, this will be a lost four years in the United States.”

— Joanne Spalding, legal director, Sierra Club

Why this matters:

Politics, not science, is stalling critical U.S. action on climate, and it's a race against time. Even modest emissions rules are now labeled extremist, fossil fuel lobbyists haunt the halls of Congress. Climate change isn’t waiting for bipartisan consensus. It's already showing up in the form of smoke-choked summers, vanishing coastlines, and illnesses driven by heat and pollution.

There are more options than ever with generous federal and state tax credits, plus big discounts from automakers. Charging networks are expanding quickly and if you’ve driven a modern EV from any brand, you’d know they’re far better to own and drive than their gas counterparts.

And yet, EV sales in the U.S. just slipped for the first time in 14 months. What gives?

In the Friday edition of Critical Materials, we talk about how EVs are caught in a perfect storm that may be stalling momentum. Also on our radar: A fight in Congress could kill key battery manufacturing credits, threatening tens of thousands of American jobs that could damage several Republican-dominated states and districts.

And while EV sales in the U.S. slow down, global EV demand continues to grow—China sold nearly as many EVs in May alone as the U.S. did in all of last year.

30%: America’s EV Sales Cool In April

Photo by: Hyundai

After years of rapid growth and consecutive quarters of record EV sales in the U.S., demand seems to have cooled in April for the first time since February 2024. April EV registrations reached 97,833 units, a 4.4% year-over-year decline, according to S&P Global Mobility data cited by Automotive News.

America’s EV market share also dropped from 7.4% to 6.6%. While the trend is concerning, it’s not necessarily surprising or alarming. The Trump administration, despite once having Tesla CEO Elon Musk on its team, is attacking EVs in all ways possible, ambushing the industry and stalling its growth.

Before we reiterate the administration’s tactics to kill EVs as well as the global headwinds, let’s talk some more numbers, because not every carmaker is suffering.

Tesla’s U.S. EV registrations dropped below 40,000 units in April, marking a 16% decline. Chevrolet, on the other hand, is now America’s second-best-selling EV maker—but still far behind Tesla in the second spot—at 9,160 units, managing a 215% year-over-year growth. So this is mostly a case of winners and losers.

All mainstream General Motors brands are going well, with Cadillac and GMC also clocking serious year-over-year growth. What’s shocking is BMW surpassing Hyundai in April EV sales, with the Korean automaker now clocking back-to-back months of decline—that’s despite offering far more affordable and modern options than BMW does and throwing heavy discounts on them.

Apart from Hyundai and Tesla, the other big automakers facing declining EV sales were Ford, Kia, Rivian and Mercedes-Benz.

EVs are really caught in a perfect storm right now. The Trump administration’s budget bill aims to slash federal credits for consumers and for the manufacturing of EVs and battery plants. It passed in the House and now its fate rests in the hands of the Senate.

Moreover, Congress passed a bill—which the president signed on Thursday—to block California from phasing out gas-only vehicles from 2035. Eleven other states including Colorado, New York and New Jersey were also following California emissions rules, so those states are impacted, too—all of them have high EV adoption rates.

There’s another key reason hurting EV sales, S&P Global Analyst Tom Libby told Automotive News:

Libby said that in addition to anxiety over charging and range, consumers are seeing media reports that government support for EVs is on the chopping block and automaker investments in the technology are slowing, undermining confidence in a product that doesn’t yet have significant organic demand. EVs are often popular at launch when they have strong promotions and fresh looks, then they fade out, he said.

It’s true that the administration acts and then the media amplifies all of that. They’re succeeding in their messaging, flooding the digital town squares and the news cycles with their vision for the auto industry, then backing it up with legislation in Congress. The exact same thing was happening last year with the pro-EV Biden administration, of course in favor of EVs.

Whether this sales slump will linger or prove temporary is anyone’s guess. But when EVs are priced right in popular segments, they sell—just look at the Tesla Model Y or the Chevy Equinox EV. And with more affordable models from both brands on the horizon, it’s far too soon to count out the EV market.

60%: American Jobs At Risk In Republican States

Billions in battery plant investments were supposed to make the U.S. auto supply chain less dependent on China and create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs along the way. But now, Congress is threatening to repeal the manufacturing tax credits that helped get those projects off the ground.

The fallout is already being felt. Some $14 billion worth of clean energy projects have been canceled this year alone, as the nonprofit Zero Emissions Transportation Association (ZETA) points out. And it could get much worse.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) projects the U.S. could lose 130,000 jobs by 2030 if the credits are scrapped. Ironically, Republican-led states like Michigan, Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia stand to lose the most.

If the tax credits are scrapped, job losses are expected across multiple sectors, from vehicle assembly and parts manufacturing to battery production and charging infrastructure installation and maintenance.

90%: The Rest Of The World Is Running Away With EVs

China sold 1.3 million EVs and plug-in hybrids in May alone, nearly as many as the U.S. sold in all of 2024. Let that sink in.

Global EV sales jumped 24% last month, which really must sting for a very solipsistic U.S. While the rest of the world races ahead with high-tech cars, U.S. automakers are being forced to crank out more polluting gas trucks and SUVs instead.

As Reuters notes, the surge was driven by BYD’s booming exports to Mexico and Southeast Asia, plus strong demand across Southern Europe. Meanwhile, North American sales took a hit—thanks in part to Canada ending its EV subsidies.

Despite generous discounts on high-tech EVs, sales are showing signs of cooling in America. But let’s not forget that there are still some excellent EVs to choose from and more are on the way. Think the next-gen Chevy Bolt, smaller Teslas and other affordable models that could shake things up.

It’s also worth noting that early-year sales are typically slower than the fall, when holiday deals pull buyers into showrooms.

Jones, Greg LaRose, Tristan Baurick",,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/06/13/tulane-gag-order/,"Terrell resigned from the New Orleans-based university on Wednesday, saying she would rather leave her position than have her work used as a pretext “to dismantle” the law clinic.
“However,” she said, “I applaud Tulane for their actions standing up for our Louisiana businesses and jobs.” ‘Punished’ for doing her job?
The email said Tulane University President Michael Fitts was facing criticism from elected officials and potential donors of the public-private project unless the university’s leadership curtailed the work of its environmental law clinic.
Terrell said the research on job disparities has already been cited in legal arguments for student attorneys in the law clinic on behalf of clients from industrialized communities.
“The foundation the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic has already built, they can’t tear that down.","Environmental advocates are questioning the actions of a private university in Louisiana following the resignation of a scientist who researches the health and job disparities in a heavily industrialized part of Louisiana known as “Cancer Alley.”

Kimberly Terrell, who served as a director of community engagement and a staff scientist with Tulane University’s Environmental Law Clinic, accused university leaders of trying to censor the work she’s doing to spotlight the harms to local communities plagued by industrial pollution.

Terrell said her research in collaboration with Floodlight highlighting job disparities in hiring at local petrochemical facilities triggered a backlash from state and university leaders. That led to her being put under an “‘unprecedented gag order” by the dean of the university’s law school, Terrell said in a prepared statement issued by a group calling itself the Louisiana Alliance to Defend Democracy.

Terrell resigned from the New Orleans-based university on Wednesday, saying she would rather leave her position than have her work used as a pretext “to dismantle” the law clinic.

“After being affiliated with Tulane for 25 years and leading groundbreaking research at (the law clinic) for seven years, I cannot remain silent as this university sacrifices academic integrity for political appeasement and pet projects,” Terrell wrote in a letter to her colleagues.

On Thursday, a university spokesperson said Tulane is “fully committed to academic freedom” and “the strong pedagogical value of law clinics.” Tulane declined to comment on Terrell’s resignation, calling it a personnel matter.

“Debates about how best to operate law clinics’ teaching mission have occurred nationally and at Tulane for years — this is nothing new,” the university said. “We have been working with the leadership of the law school for the past several years to better understand how the clinics can most effectively support the university’s education mission.”

Kate Kelly, spokesperson for Gov. Jeff Landry, said in an email that the governor never threatened to withhold state funding for the project. “However,” she said, “I applaud Tulane for their actions standing up for our Louisiana businesses and jobs.”

‘Punished’ for doing her job?

Terrell’s resignation is drawing outrage from grassroots environmental advocates in the state who credited her with providing data and scientific research substantiating the harm from the petrochemical industry suffered by the predominantly Black communities in southeast Louisiana.

“It’s appalling,” said Jo Banner, who co-founded a nonprofit focused on community activism and cultural preservation in St. John the Baptist Parish.

“We are frustrated that a person who is just doing their job, and doing it well shouldn’t be punished for it, she would be uplifted,” Banner said.

Her twin sister and co-founder, Joy Banner, added: “I cried at what is being done to someone who is so committed to just helping people, and doing right, and giving people access to objective information … that she is being penalized and censored so much. This is an attack on her freedom of speech.”

An April 25 email provided to Floodlight from Tulane Law School Dean Marcilynn Burke states that “effective immediately all external communications” from the law clinic that were not “client based” would have to be approved by her. That communication included “press releases, interviews, videos, social media postings, etc.”

In another email, dated May 4, Burke noted that the job disparity research was impeding the university from gaining political and financial support for its $600 million downtown redevelopment project in New Orleans. The email said Tulane University President Michael Fitts was facing criticism from elected officials and potential donors of the public-private project unless the university’s leadership curtailed the work of its environmental law clinic.

“At present, the president is focused upon the role of the staff scientist,” Burke wrote. “He understands her role in supporting the clinic’s representation of the clients. Thus, I need an explanation of how the study about racial disparities relates directly to client representation.”

The email goes on to say, “He is concerned, however, that her work may go beyond supporting the clinic’s legal representation and veer into lobbying.”

Job disparities research cited

Floodlight reported on the research Terrell led for the university in April 2024 while it was still undergoing peer review. Preliminary data showed that minorities were being “systematically” underrepresented in the U.S. petrochemical workforce — despite promises that nearby communities would benefit from better job opportunities.

Terrell said the pollution vs. jobs narrative was oversimplified because the tradeoff affected different groups unevenly, with petrochemical jobs mostly going to white workers who don’t live in the predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods that suffer most of the health impacts of that industry. That research and Floodlight’s reporting was recently featured in a documentary produced by The YEARS Project.

Nationally, Terrell’s research found that higher paying jobs in the chemical manufacturing industry disproportionately went to more white people in Texas, Louisiana and Georgia where minorities represent 59%, 41% and 49% of their respective states’ populations but held 38%, 21% and 28% of the better paid jobs within the industry.

In the petroleum/coal industry, people of color were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs in at least 14 states — including Texas, California, Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois, the research found.

Terrell, in her letter to colleagues, said the gag order came after the research had been peer reviewed and published online on April 9 in Ecological Economics.

Terrell said the research on job disparities has already been cited in legal arguments for student attorneys in the law clinic on behalf of clients from industrialized communities. And she said her 2022 study highlighting the health impacts in Cancer Alley ranks in the top 1% for research impact, garnering 28 citations and 87 news mentions to date, according to Almetric, which tracks the reach of research.

“Such impact would be celebrated by most institutions,” Terrell wrote. “Scholarly publications, not gag orders, are the currency of academia. There is always room for informed debate. But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”

The Banner sisters are concerned Terrell’s departure and the university’s focus on restricting the work of the law clinic will likely make collaborations harder going forward.

“They’re following their responsibility, they’re following the mission of the organization, and answering our call for help, and then now they’re getting slammed for it,” Joy Banner said. “The foundation the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic has already built, they can’t tear that down. No one has questioned her findings. No one has questioned her assumptions. The only thing that they have said is: The truth is creating problems for us.”

But a new report takes a big swing at the ethanol orthodoxy of American agriculture, criticizing the industry for causing economic and social imbalances across rural communities and saying that the expansion of biofuels will increase greenhouse gas emissions, despite their purported climate benefits.

The report, from the World Resources Institute, which has been critical of U.S. biofuel policy in the past, draws from 100 academic studies on biofuel impacts. It concludes that ethanol policy has been largely a failure and ought to be reconsidered, especially as the world needs more land to produce food to meet growing demand.

“Multiple studies show that U.S. biofuel policies have reshaped crop production, displacing food crops and driving up emissions from land conversion, tillage and fertilizer use,” said the report’s lead author, Haley Leslie-Bole. “Corn-based ethanol, in particular, has contributed to nutrient runoff, degraded water quality and harmed wildlife habitat. As climate pressures grow, increasing irrigation and refining for first-gen biofuels could deepen water scarcity in already drought-prone parts of the Midwest.”

The conversion of Midwestern agricultural land has been sweeping. Between 2004 and 2024, ethanol production increased by nearly 500 percent. Corn and soybeans are now grown on 92 and 86 million acres of land respectively—and roughly a third of those crops go to produce ethanol. That means about 30 million acres of land that could be used to grow food crops are instead being used to produce ethanol, despite ethanol only accounting for 6 percent of the country’s transportation fuel.

The biofuels industry—which includes refiners, corn and soy growers and the influential agriculture lobby writ large—have long insisted that corn- and soy-based biofuels provide an energy efficient alternative to fossil-based fuels. Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have agreed.

The country’s primary biofuels policy, the Renewable Fuel Standard, requires that biofuels provide a greenhouse gas reduction over fossil fuels: The law says that ethanol from new plants must deliver a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline.

In addition to greenhouse gas reductions, the industry and its allies in Congress have also continued to say that ethanol is a primary mainstay of the rural economy, benefiting communities across the Midwest.

But a growing body of research—much of which the industry has tried to debunk and deride—suggests that ethanol actually may not provide the benefits that policies require. It may, in fact, produce more greenhouse gases than the fossil fuels it was intended to replace. Recent research says that biofuel refiners also emit significant amounts of carcinogenic and dangerous substances, including hexane and formaldehyde, in greater amounts than petroleum refineries.

The new report points to research saying that increased production of biofuels from corn and soy could actually raise greenhouse gas emissions, largely from carbon emissions linked to clearing land in other countries to compensate for the use of land in the Midwest.

On top of that, corn is an especially fertilizer-hungry crop requiring large amounts of nitrogen-based fertilizer, which releases huge amounts of nitrous oxide when it interacts with the soil. American farming is by far the largest source of domestic nitrous oxide emissions already—about 50 percent. If biofuel policies lead to expanded production, emissions of this enormously powerful greenhouse gas will likely increase, too.

The new report concludes that not only will the expansion of ethanol increase greenhouse gas emissions, it has also failed to provide the social and financial benefits to Midwestern communities that lawmakers and the industry say it has. (The report defines the Midwest as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio,

South Dakota and Wisconsin.)

“The benefits from biofuels remain concentrated in the hands of a few,” Leslie-Bole said. “As subsidies flow, so may the trend of farmland consolidation, increasing inaccessibility of farmland in the Midwest and locking out emerging or low-resource farmers. This means the benefits of biofuels production are flowing to fewer people, while more are left bearing the costs.”

New policies being considered in state legislatures and Congress, including additional tax credits and support for biofuel-based aviation fuel, could expand production, potentially causing more land conversion and greenhouse gas emissions, widening the gap between the rural communities and rich agribusinesses at a time when food demand is climbing and, critics say, land should be used to grow food instead.

President Donald Trump’s tax cut bill, passed by the House and currently being negotiated in the Senate, would not only extend tax credits for biofuels producers, it specifically excludes calculations of emissions from land conversion when determining what qualifies as a low-emission fuel.

The primary biofuels industry trade groups, including Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association, did not respond to Inside Climate News requests for comment or interviews.

An employee with the Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers, not ethanol, said the report vastly overstates the carbon emissions from crop-based fuels by comparing the farmed land to natural landscapes, which no longer exist.

They also noted that the impact of soy-based fuels in 2024 was more than $42 billion, providing over 100,000 jobs.

“Ten percent of the value of every bushel of soybeans is linked to biomass-based fuel,” they said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2166100083-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:08:01.223959

The commission held a meeting in the Lansing area on Thursday, the last session before Carreon's term ends.","Lansing — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is expected, in the coming weeks, to replace a member of the state commission that's in charge of setting electricity and gas rates in a move that could impact the debate over the cost of utility bills in Michigan.

Whitmer, a Democrat, appointed Alessandra Carreon, a clean energy advocate from Detroit, to the Michigan Public Service Commission less than two years ago, on July 23, 2023. Carreon has advocated for trying to make the panel's operations more accessible for the public. But the partial term she was picked to fill is scheduled to end July 2.

Two sources with direct knowledge of the deliberations of the governor's office told The Detroit News that Whitmer's team planned, in recent weeks, to pick someone other than Carreon to fill the seat on the three-member commission for the next six-year term. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the governor's plans.

Carreon declined to answer questions from The News, including whether she was seeking another term. If she's not re-appointed, it would mark the shortest tenure any member of the commission has had in about four decades, according to state records, and raise questions about why the governor felt a change was necessary.

Charlotte Jameson, chief policy officer for the nonprofit Michigan Environmental Council, defended Carreon in an interview. Carreon has been focused, as a commissioner, on affordability and residential ratepayers, Jameson contended.

“My understanding is that DTE and Consumers were very unhappy with recent decisions the commission has made around the utilities’ profit margin,” Jameson told The Detroit News, tying the utilities' stances to the governor's upcoming decision about Carreon's future on the panel.

DTE Energy and Consumers Energy are Michigan's two dominant electric utilities and influential players in state politics. When they want to raise rates paid by their customers, it's the Michigan Public Service Commission — featuring three gubernatorial appointees — that must decide if the proposed charges are justified and reasonable.

For instance, in March, the commission approved a $153.8 million rate increase for Consumers Energy electricity customers. The Jackson-based energy provider originally sought a $325 million hike.

Asked if Consumers Energy had advocated for Carreon not to be re-appointed to the commission this summer, Katie Carey, spokeswoman for the utility, didn't answer directly.

""Consumers Energy is not aware of what Gov. Whitmer will choose to do regarding an appointment when Commissioner Carreon’s term expires at the end of the month,"" Carey said. ""As with any Michigan Public Service Commission appointment, we will work with all appointees to deliver reliable and affordable energy service for our Michigan customers.""

DTE Energy's spokeswoman, Jill Wilmot, said the Detroit-based utility ""is not involved in the selection"" of commissioners.

""Our team at DTE works collaboratively with the MPSC commissioners and staff to ensure we’re providing safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable energy to our customers and the state of Michigan,"" Wilmot said.

In January, the commission approved a $217.4 million rate increase for DTE customers. DTE originally requested a $456.4 million increase. In April, DTE began pursuing a new $574 million rate increase.

Attorney General Dana Nessel has criticized the pace of rate increases sought by Michigan's largest utilities.

“At some point, we have to ask how long utility companies like DTE and Consumers Energy will be allowed to treat customer bills and our energy rates like a blank check,"" Nessel said in April.

Bobby Leddy, spokesman for Whitmer, didn't deny on Thursday that Carreon's time on the commission might soon end.

""The State of Michigan has more than 230 boards and commissions,"" Leddy said when asked for comment about Carreon's future. ""Gov. Whitmer takes the appointment process seriously. Our office reviews boards and commissions on a rolling basis.

""We will issue an announcement when an appointment or reappointment is made for any board or commission.""

Carreon's seat on the commission might be the last chance Whitmer gets to appoint someone to the panel before leaving office at the end of 2026. However, the person she chooses would be poised to serve on the commission into the next governor's term. That's one reason the selection is being closely watched in Lansing.

Carreon is a former manager of responsible material sourcing for Ford Motor Co. She also managed carbon-free transportation at the clean energy advocacy group Rocky Mountain Institute.

During a March 5 episode of the Michigan Public Service Commission's podcast, Carreon emphasized the need to make the commission's complex processes easier to understand.

""There's really a vested interest in ensuring there's more public participation in the way we do our work,"" Carreon said.

The commission held a meeting in the Lansing area on Thursday, the last session before Carreon's term ends. Although she isn't expected to be re-appointed, commissioners did not discuss her potential departure.

The two other commissioners, Dan Scripps and Katherine Peretick, didn't return calls from The Detroit News in recent days, and they left Thursday's meeting without answering questions from a reporter who was present.

The members of the commission are paid employees. Carreon's salary was $142,151 in 2024, according to a database maintained by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy.

Asked about Carreon, Amy Bandyk, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, which advocates on behalf of customers, noted that the commission's decisions are usually made with unanimous support.

""There are plenty of decisions that the MPSC have ruled on that we both agree and disagree with,"" Bandyk said. ""It comes with the territory of the work that we do is frequent intervenors before the MPSC.""

VinFast was the previous largest economic development announcement in the state's history.","Aircraft maker JetZero, a startup trying to build a more sustainable commercial airplane, is pledging to create 14,500 jobs and manufacture its planes in North Carolina.

Why it matters: It is the largest economic development win in the state's history, if the jobs come to fruition as planned near Greensboro's Piedmont Triad International Airport (PTI).

Driving the news: On Thursday morning in Raleigh, the state's Economic Investment Committee approved an incentives package for JetZero worth around $1 billion.

The Greensboro area was competing against 25 other sites across the country, according to the state's Commerce Department.

North Carolina has been working to recruit the company for more than a year, including a final phone call between N.C. Gov. Josh Stein and JetZero CEO Tom O'Leary in the past few weeks.

By the numbers: The jobs, which are expected to be added between 2027 and 2037, would pay a minimum average wage of $89,000.

JetZero plans to invest $4.7 billion into the site, in return for state and local incentives.

Guildford County and Greensboro will put $784 million in incentives toward the project, according to the Commerce Department.

The state's contribution, under a transformative-level Job Development Investment Grant, would be $1 billion over 37 years, and it is anticipated the state's General Assembly would appropriate another $450 million toward site preparation and road improvements.

JetZero would only earn the incentives if the company maintains 10,000 workers and invests $3.8 billion locally. PTI would maintain ownership of the land that the state is doing site preparation work on, according to N.C. Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley.

Zoom in: California-based JetZero has designed a blended-wing-body airframe that it expects to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than today's tube-and-wing aircraft, a huge advantage for airlines seeking to decarbonize their operations, Axios previously reported.

The company has attracted investments from several big players in the industry, including Delta and United Airlines, and has said it hopes to begin flying in 2027.

The U.S. Air Force is also investing $235 million into JetZero, and Lee said the state had extensive conversations with the Air Force while vetting the company.

State of play: Greensboro's PTI airport has become a hotspot for aviation manufacturers. It's already home to HondaJet and another startup, Boom Supersonic, is building a factory there.

The jobs in Greensboro would include manufacturing roles to research and development positions, according to Lilley. The Greensboro factory would focus on the body of the planes, while Pratt & Whitney would manufacture the engines.

Under the agreement with the state, JetZero would begin hiring in 2027 and reach 14,500 jobs by 2037.

Between the lines: Some of North Carolina's largest economic development wins in recent years have come from startups seeking to disrupt established industries.

That includes Boom, a company trying to resurrect supersonic travel that makes its planes in Greensboro, and VinFast, a Vietnamese electric vehicle startup whose plans to hire 7,500 in Chatham County have been delayed several times already. VinFast was the previous largest economic development announcement in the state's history.

1 Gigawatt down, 1 Gigawatt to Go

The past week or so has ushered in an avalanche of project development announcements in the clean tech space, including an update on the largest solar-plus-storage undertaking in the United States.

The AES Corporation has completed construction of the 1,000 megawatt (MW) Bellefield 1 project, under a 15-year contract with Amazon. Bellefield is a two-phase project, each phase including 500 MW of solar and 500 MW of four-hour battery-based energy storage, for a total of 1,000 MW of installed capacity. Once completed, the 2,000 MW Bellefield in Kern County, California, is expected to be the largest solar-plus-storage facility in the country.

To accelerate Bellefield’s implementation and ensure system reliability, AES utilized Maximo, an AI-enabled robotic system developed by AES to assist construction crews, improving the safety, speed, and accuracy of solar module installation.

What they’re saying: “Completing the first 1,000 MW of Bellefield demonstrates how rapidly solar and storage can be deployed to meet the growing energy demand of data centers,” said Andrés Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our best-in-class track record of delivering renewables projects on time and on budget is deeply valued by our customers and is one of our key competitive advantages.”

Construction on Bellefield 2 is on track to be completed in 2026. AES has contractual arrangements with major global hyperscalers for 10.1 GW, including the 2 GW Bellefield project.

‘Farm-to-Table’ Energy Company Gets First New York Solar Projects

CleanChoice, which bills itself as the first 100% green company in the U.S. to provide ‘farm-to-table’ renewable energy by owning solar generation assets and supplying only clean energy to consumers, has announced the acquisition of two solar projects in New York State. Once completed, the pair will generate a combined 54.2 MW of clean electricity, effectively doubling CleanChoice’s generation capacity in the Mid-Atlantic region.

The 133-acre Dolan project in Washington County and the 117-acre Hawthorn project in Rensselaer County will each have a capacity of 27.1 MW. Construction of both projects is expected to begin this fall, with a planned interconnection date of Q4 2026 with National Grid. The solar farms were selected by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) as part of its latest round of large-scale renewable energy contract awards. They were two of only 26 selected statewide, highlighting their strategic importance to achieving New York’s goal of 70% clean electricity by 2030.

What they’re saying: “With electric grids struggling to keep up with ever-increasing demand, along with growing consumer demand for more sustainable energy options, investing in solar generation is a win-win solution for everyone,” stated Zoë Gamble, President of CleanChoice. “Bringing a solar project to completion is more than just putting clean energy on the grid. It’s important that we are good stewards of the land by incorporating practices that support the local ecosystem and benefit the surrounding community.”

This news comes six months after CleanChoice unveiled its first solar project, located in Franklin County, Pennsylvania; the company is also continuing construction on a second solar project in Kylertown, PA.

Utilities in the Midwestern United States are tackling tough challenges posed by increasingly extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and an ongoing race to integrate renewable energy while maintaining grid reliability. State decarbonization laws add complexity to the process of bringing power generation online, and as utilities transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives, they are simultaneously managing supply chain issues, labor shortages, and new cybersecurity risks. Service providers must modernize their infrastructure to satisfy increasing demand while keeping pricing affordable, which is a tall task for any-sized utility.

DESRI Digs into Catclaw

This week, DESRI announced that the Catclaw Solar and Storage project in Buckeye, Arizona, has achieved financial notice to proceed and commenced construction. Catclaw, a 205 MW solar facility with a 1,000 megawatt-hour (MWh) storage system, is expected to power approximately 40,000 homes upon commencement of operations in 2026.

DESRI bought the Catclaw project from Avantus. It has a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Arizona Public Service (APS). RES will serve as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor, with EPC Services Company as the high-voltage EPC. Tesla will provide battery storage equipment for the project. Invenergy Services will provide ongoing operations and maintenance services once the facility is operational.

What they’re saying: “Given skyrocketing demand for new energy and capacity resources across the state, our team is happy to pair reliable and cost-effective resources with this need. We appreciate Avantus’s work on the project’s development and look forward to an efficient build,” said Bob Schoenherr, Chief Strategy Officer of DESRI.

“Catclaw will help power Arizona’s growing energy needs with clean, reliable electricity, especially during times of peak demand,” added Cliff Graham, CEO of Avantus. “This milestone is the result of strong collaboration with the City of Buckeye, local partners, DESRI, and APS, and builds on the groundwork Avantus has laid to accelerate clean energy in the region. Together, we’re creating local jobs and strengthening the grid with affordable, resilient energy for Arizona communities.”

DESRI currently owns 131 MW of operating renewable energy assets and 160 MW of solar assets under construction in Arizona, and boasts about 9 GW capacity across the board. Catclaw is its first project with APS.

IPP Scores $630M in ‘first-of-its-kind’ Financing for MISO Project

Independent power producer (IPP) Earthrise Energy has closed on a $630 million, first-of-its-kind tax equity and debt financing for its 270 MW Gibson City Solar project within Illinois’ MISO power market, which is expected to achieve commercial operations in 2026. The debt financing is comprised of a construction-to-term loan, a tax equity bridge loan, and a letter of credit facility. BBVA, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Nord/LB served as Coordinating Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners for the debt financing, and a Fortune 500 telecommunications company provided the tax equity commitment.

This novel transaction is distinguished by its shared point of interconnection between the solar project and Earthrise’s existing thermal power plant, using surplus interconnection service. The transaction is also one of the first solar project financings to utilize the Illinois Power Agency’s Indexed Renewable Energy Credit offtake contract.

What they’re saying: “We are proud to have structured the first solar project finance transactions utilizing surplus interconnection service in MISO. This structure presented attributes that required innovative structuring, and together with the coordinating lead arrangers and tax equity investor, we developed solutions which we believe will serve as a blueprint for similar projects going forward,” stated Kenton Harder, VP Capital Markets, Earthrise Energy.

Earthrise’s current project pipeline represents more than 1.4 GWs of new clean energy capacity expected to be brought online by the end of 2028, with future project financings likely to adopt a similar structure.

Origis Energy Finances a Pair of Major Projects

Origis Energy has closed on the Wheatland solar project with MUFG via a portfolio financing package that supports a pair of projects.

Wheatland Solar, located in Knox County, Indiana, will provide 150 MW of solar capacity and is scheduled for completion in the first half of 2026. It is supported by a PPA with CenterPoint Energy. The Optimist Solar + Storage project in Clay County, Mississippi, will deliver 200 MW of solar power and 50 MW of four-hour battery energy storage. This project is expected to be operational by early 2026 and is supported by a PPA with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The Optimist portion of the MUFG deal closed in late 2024. Origis Energy serves as the developer, owner, and operator for both projects.

Luigi Resta is helping himself to a second plate of pasta this weekend!

rPlus Energies has closed on a tax equity financing commitment exceeding $500 million with RBC Community Investments and a syndicate of investors to support Green River Energy Center (GREC), a landmark solar-plus-storage project in Emery County, Utah. The financing will utilize the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC).

The GREC includes 400 MW of solar PV and 400 MW/1,600 MWh of battery storage, with a long-term power purchase agreement in place with PacifiCorp. It is among the largest solar-plus-storage projects currently under construction in the United States and is expected to generate more than $55 million in direct economic benefits for Emery County over the next 20 years. It has already created hundreds of construction jobs. The project is expected to be completed in 2026.

What they’re saying: “Green River Energy Center is an investment in the long-term resilience of a region that has powered the American West for generations,” said Luigi Resta, President and CEO of rPlus Energies. “This project honors Emery County’s legacy as an energy-producing region while helping to secure its future. By utilizing federal tools, such as the investment tax credit, we ensure that rural communities continue to lead our country’s energy production and dominance.”

This milestone follows the successful close of over $1 billion in construction debt financing for the project announced last year.

Soltage Signs the Dotted Line on Financing Facility

Last but certainly not least, Soltage has closed on a $260 million construction and term debt financing facility. The funds will support the near-term deployment of solar and storage projects from the company’s more than 2 GW development pipeline.

The innovative financing structure includes a revolving construction loan, tax equity bridge loan, and term loan facility, offering Soltage flexible capital to continue developing, building, and operating its growing portfolio of clean energy infrastructure assets. The facility was structured and led by National Bank of Canada, alongside First Citizens Bank, with BankUnited, Cadence Bank, and Siemens Financial Services joining as joint arrangers. Legal counsel was provided by Foley Hoag LLP on behalf of Soltage, and Norton Rose Fulbright LLP represented the lending syndicate.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/O-38.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 15:01:57.359425

WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a major step forward to strengthen American energy security and support American farmers by proposing Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. This action represents a critical and much-needed step in the evolution of this program. This is the 20th anniversary of the RFS program. Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA’s “Set 2” proposal ensures the RFS program remains true to Congress’ original intent of increasing the use of homegrown American biofuels, unleashing American energy, and supporting rural economies.

“We are creating a new system that benefits American farmers while mitigating the impact on gas prices and ensuring the continued existence of liquid fuels,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “We can no longer afford to continue with the same system where Americans pay for foreign competitors.”

“President Trump recognizes how important the Renewable Fuel Standard is for American corn and soybean farmers. This move by Administrator Zeldin is the boldest proposal ever and will provide certainty in a much-needed market for our producers while delivering lower prices at the pump for consumers. USDA and EPA have never been more aligned on the need for more American grown biofuels. This is the highest ever Renewable Volume Obligation and it sends a strong signal to the U.S. biofuels industry that President Trump has their backs and gives them the incentive to invest in American products for American consumers and to export around the world. America’s national security depends on our energy security, and biofuels are a crucial asset that brings more jobs and helps farmers in rural America,” said Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. “As the Trump Administration expands the domestic market for biofuels, at USDA we are working to break down tariff and non-tariff barriers for our American grown biofuels. President Trump’s landmark deal with the U.K. secured zero tariff access for over $700 million in ethanol exports. Not only can we be energy independent, we are unleashing American energy dominance abroad.”

If finalized, these would be the highest volume requirements ever under the RFS program. Under President Trump and Administrator Zeldin’s leadership, EPA is putting Americans back in charge of its energy future.

Today’s action consists of three major proposals:

Sets strong growth targets for key renewable fuels.

Puts America first by reducing the value of renewable fuels and feedstocks from foreign countries.

Furthers the President’s goal of eliminating the electric vehicle (EV) mandate, by removing electricity as a qualifying renewable fuel under the RFS program (eRIN)

Historically, the RFS was a “one dial” system, where the only changes to the program were increasing or decreasing volumes. Today, EPA is proposing a second dial that relates to the value of a RIN based whether the biofuel is from domestic or foreign sources. Specifically, foreign biofuels and feedstocks are only being provided 50 percent of the value relative to domestic biofuels and feedstocks.

The proposed rule strengthens U.S. energy security by reducing reliance on foreign sources of oil by roughly 150,000 barrels of oil per day over the time frame of the Set 2 rule, 2026 and 2027. Additionally, in 2024, about 45 percent of biomass-based diesel (BBD) feedstock and finished fuel came from foreign sources. By reducing the value of the RIN for foreign biofuels and feedstocks, it will decrease America’s reliance on these imports, promote U.S. production, and increase American energy security.

The Set 2 Rule proposes the biofuel volume requirements and associated percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel (BBD), advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for 2026 and 2027. The volume targets are as follows:

Table 1: Volume Requirements 2023 – 2027 (billion RINs)a

a One RIN is equivalent to one ethanol-equivalent gallon of renewable fuel.

The proposal supports President Trump's broader economic vision of strengthening American energy independence, growing domestic agricultural markets, and fighting back against unfair trade practices. These volume requirements, if finalized, will protect investments made by American corn and soybean growers, oilseed processors, and biodiesel and renewable diesel producers, whose products are critical to our country’s energy security and keeping rural economies strong.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:04:18.985022

Since its passage, Arizona’s economy has attracted 134 existing, potential, and announced projects that would be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits.
A repeal of the tax credits will jeopardize Arizona’s economic momentum and the jobs of Arizona workers.
Ending these tax credits early would slow down job growth, drive up costs, and hurt the progress Arizona has made.
Because of this we’ve benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits.","A report from the Arizona Commerce Authority, hardly a bastion of socialism and left wing liberalism, found that if MAGA Republicans follow through on their commitment to gut forward provisions like clean energy tax credits in the Biden/Harris Inflation Reduction Act, the Grand Canyon State will lose $58 billion in investments and 69,000 good paying blue, white, and green collar jobs.

Leading Arizona Democrats voiced their concerns about this potential damage to the states economy.

In a Gubernatorial press release, Governor Katie Hobbs stated:

“The Arizona Promise is built on creating opportunities for working-class Arizonans and growing our economy. Over the last three years, Arizona’s economy has boomed, and business investment and job creation have accelerated by leveraging federal tax credits created in the IRA. Since its passage, Arizona’s economy has attracted 134 existing, potential, and announced projects that would be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits. These projects together represent more than 69,000 existing and potential new jobs, and $58 billion in capital investment to grow the state’s advanced manufacturing, energy, technology, and infrastructure industries. The federal government should be working with us in furthering Arizona’s economic success, not undermining our growth.

“Many Arizona communities are benefiting directly from these programs and businesses are choosing to build, invest, hire, and expand with these incentives. A repeal of the tax credits will jeopardize Arizona’s economic momentum and the jobs of Arizona workers. Making matters worse, rolling back these tax credits would drive up energy costs at a time when Arizona families are already struggling to make ends meet. By 2029, Arizona households would see an 11.4% increase in electricity costs, and commercial and industrial users would experience a 15.9% increase. Politicians in Washington, D.C., are already creating uncertainty with unnecessary tariffs and an escalating trade war. Ending these tax credits early would slow down job growth, drive up costs, and hurt the progress Arizona has made. As Arizona’s population grows and our economy thrives, now is the time to protect these federal investments and Arizona’s economic future.”

Responding to a request to comment, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said:

“Repealing clean energy tax credits would be a huge step back in Phoenix’s effort to unleash affordable, reliable energy while threatening thousands of good, local jobs. It would hurt our economic growth, raise prices for hardworking Phoenicians, and stunt the development of cutting-edge industries that are delivering clean energy at a time when demand is growing significantly. Our federal government should implement policies that make life easier for American families, and dismantling these tax credits would do just the opposite.”

In the same statement from Governor Hobbs, members of Arizona’s Democratic Congressional Delegation stated their perspectives.

Senator Mark Kelly offered:

“Arizona has worked to make sure we’re a great place to do business—with the help of both Democrats and Republicans over the years. Because of this we’ve benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits. We see it in the big solar and battery storage projects bringing low-cost, reliable power to the grid and in the dozens of companies who have invested to bring manufacturing here, creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Republicans’ plan to cut these programs will put thousands of Arizonans out of work and make energy prices go up. I’m working with Governor Hobbs and others to stop the bad Republican plan and protect Arizona’s economy.”

Senator Ruben Gallego conveyed:

“Trump and House Republicans promised to make life affordable. Instead, they’re actively cutting jobs. This isn’t just a tax plan—it’s a direct assault on Arizonans who simply want to get ahead and provide for their families. Slashing clean energy tax credit jeopardizes billions in investments by stalling our state’s economic momentum.”

Representative Greg Stanton relayed:

“If clean energy tax credits are repealed, Arizona loses out on tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and families’ energy bills go up. I want the industries of the future here in Arizona, not overseas.”",https://blogforarizona.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bafkreigssu4yp4wzd2u35estewurz335bgiadtgej4bgu3z6k7qtrtwksy.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 14:00:47.244540

Qualitas has emerged as the leading bidder for the business after interest from KKR & Co.’s ContourGlobal, the other remaining suitor, has cooled, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.

London-based Cubico is owned by Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and PSP Investments. The Canadian pension funds have been working with Bank of America Corp. on the potential deal, seeking a valuation of about EUR 7 billion ($7.9 billion), Bloomberg News reported last year.

A sale of Cubico could rank as one of the largest renewable energy deals this year globally and comes at a time the US administration’s refocus on boosting oil and gas supplies has reduced investor appetite for such assets.

Qualitas may consider bringing in partners to help fund the acquisition or seek to divest some of Cubico’s assets shortly after a deal is completed, one of the people said. There’s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, and ContourGlobal’s interest could still be rekindled, the people said.

Representatives for Qualitas, KKR, OTPP and PSP declined to comment.

These investments help drivers save money by providing expanded access to lower cost and cleaner burning homegrown biofuels like E15 (Unleaded 88). The cost-share grants were awarded by the RFIP Board during its quarterly meeting on June 4.

The approved project sites are in 48 different counties and total $1.23 million in state cost-share.

A complete list of the projects, sorted by county, is available here.

“Biofuels provide value for drivers, open new markets for farmers, support rural jobs, reduce emissions, and advance the goal of greater American energy dominance,” said Secretary Naig. “Expanding access to Unleaded 88 gives drivers more ways to save at the pump, and those savings really do add up over time. In 2024, Iowa set a new record for E15 sales, and that momentum will continue as more stations upgrade or install new fuel equipment.”

The Iowa Department of Revenue announced on April 3 that Iowa E15 sales hit an all-time record in 2024, eclipsing the previous record from 2023 by 44 percent. With 256.7 million gallons of E15 sold in Iowa in 2024 at an average price discount of 15 cents per gallon compared to E10, Iowa drivers saved over $38.5 million last year by choosing E15 at the pump.

These investments are helping more Iowa fuel stations come into compliance with the E15 Access Standard. Iowa is the first state to enact an E15 Access Standard, which requires most fuel retailers to offer E15 by Jan. 1, 2026. The law was passed by the Iowa Legislature and signed by Gov. Reynolds in 2022. For those convenience stores and fuel stations that need assistance coming into compliance, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship can provide cost-share funding through the RFIP. Since the cost-share grant program began in 2006, the Department has invested more than $62 million toward expanding renewable fuels infrastructure within Iowa. This has been matched with more than $270 million by Iowa convenience stores and fuel retailers.

With additional cost-share funding available, the Department welcomes grant applications to assist more fuel stations in improving and upgrading infrastructure.

,Texas American Energy ,2025-06-13 14:29:21+00:00,Utility Dive,Batteries are making the grid more reliable: NERC | Utility Dive,Robert Walton,,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/batteries-grid-state-of-reliability-nerc/750649/,"“Today’s transmission system is demonstrably more reliable and resilient with the severity and duration of outages declining,” the reliability watchdog said.
The North American grid is challenged by the proliferation of large loads, such as data centers, and the operating profile of inverter-based resources, NERC said.
But “reliability improvements were observed in areas with high concentrations of battery energy storage systems,” also known as BESS.
NERC’s report also highlights the potential for batteries to make the grid more reliable.
In Texas, NERC said battery capacity increased to more than 10 GW in December, and an additional 19 GW is planned by the end of 2025.","Dive Brief:

There were 30 weather-related events in the United States and Canada that caused more than $1 billion in damages last year, but “none resulted in operator-initiated load shed, unlike previous events of a similar scale,” the North American Electric Reliability Corp. said Thursday in its annual State of Reliability report.

On whole, the bulk power system “remained reliable but challenged by adverse weather conditions and transitions in resource mix and usage,” according to the report. “Today’s transmission system is demonstrably more reliable and resilient with the severity and duration of outages declining,” the reliability watchdog said.

The North American grid is challenged by the proliferation of large loads, such as data centers, and the operating profile of inverter-based resources, NERC said. But “reliability improvements were observed in areas with high concentrations of battery energy storage systems,” also known as BESS.

Dive Insight:

The size and speed with which data centers are expanding across the country presents “a significant near-term reliability challenge,” NERC said.

Though there is uncertainty surrounding how much data center capacity will be built, and how quickly, experts agree they are driving up electricity demand. Data centers could account for 44% of U.S. electricity load growth from 2023 to 2028, Bain & Company said in an October analysis.

These large loads can be developed faster than the generation and transmission infrastructure needed to support them, “resulting in lower system stability,” NERC said in its report. “Additionally, the voltage sensitivity and rapidly changing, often unpredictable, power usage of these facilities creates new operating challenges.”

NERC said more accurate models of the operational characteristics of data centers “are essential to reliability to prevent instability caused by these large changes in electricity demand.”

There was also more than 45 GW of new inverter-based capacity added to the bulk power system in 2024, according to NERC’s report. “However, the response by IBRs to system disturbances continues to impact some solar facilities, with ride-through issues being observed at large battery storage and wind plants,” it said.

NERC issued an alert last month which provided recommendations for IBR operators around modeling and performance.

NERC’s report also highlights the potential for batteries to make the grid more reliable. Utility-scale battery storage in the United States is poised to more than double over the next two years and will close out 2026 at nearly 65 GW, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its Short Term Energy Outlook published Tuesday.

“Improvements in frequency response are being observed in areas of the country that have high concentrations of battery energy storage systems and incentives in place to encourage or require participation,” NERC said.

In Texas, NERC said battery capacity increased to more than 10 GW in December, and an additional 19 GW is planned by the end of 2025.

“While all industrial battery installations can provide frequency support, in Texas RE, the provision of frequency support (when available) is mandated through a Reliability Standard,” NERC noted. “This requirement combined with the increasing amount of installed capacity, quick response times, and BESS often being in a state of partial charge has positioned these installations as a key part of the Texas Interconnection’s frequency response.”

The Texas grid operated through multiple instances last year where batteries provided up to 100% of the total capacity for frequency regulation services, the reliability organization said.

“These events provide supporting evidence that at current penetration levels, with proper requirements and incentives, BESS can improve primary frequency response, an essential reliability service,” said Jack Norris, NERC’s performance analysis manager.

“While challenges and concerns remain with the rapidly increasing penetration of these resources, their flexible capabilities are currently beneficial to reliability, bolstering their viability as a form of BPS energy storage,” he said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/TxzGzqjHgg6on2P6gn6nKuDRuwHY6_ClN6PiGeMTl8Q/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JbnRlcnNlY3RfUG93ZXIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-13 12:05:34.741494

Both the Highlander SUV and Sienna minivan, which are nearly identical to their North American counterparts, are confirmed to be getting new generations with a range-extender electric powertrain option.

The announcement came during the 2025 GAC Toyota Technology Day, where Toyota shared plans for a closer collaboration with its Chinese joint ventures, focusing on research and development of future models.

Highlander: More Electrons, Same Mission

First launched in 2019, the current fourth-generation Highlander has been a steady presence in Toyota’s global SUV lineup. In China, GAC Toyota offers it with hybrid and plug-in hybrid options, while a near-identical sibling, named the Crown Kluger, is sold through FAW Toyota. For the upcoming fifth generation, a new range-extender electric vehicle (EREV) version is on the way, which Toyota says is better tailored to the preferences of Chinese buyers.

It’s still unclear whether this Highlander EREV will leave Chinese borders. We reached out to Toyota North America to ask if the new powertrain might be offered in the US, but a spokesperson simply said the company “cannot comment on future U.S. products.” Still, considering the growing demand for hybrids and plug-in hybrids, it wouldn’t be all that surprising if a similar offering was sold over here.

According to GAC Toyota, the fifth-gen Highlander will benefit from large-scale updates, possibly referring to a redesigned bodywork and a high-tech cabin. Still, chances are that the model will ride on an upgraded version of the TNGA-K underpinnings rather than using a new platform.

Last year, it was reported that the next-gen Highlander would arrive in 2026, transitioning to a fully electric powertrain. However, the market conditions may have prompted Toyota to change its plans and give a lease of life to the hybrid Highlander, albeit with a heavier dose of electrification. As for the larger Grand Highlander that is not available in China, it is expected to receive a mid-lifecycle update in 2027.

What We Know About America’s Next Highlander

It’s been reported that the next-generation Highlander will debut in North America in 2026 as a fully electric model, possibly being the three-row EV Toyota has confirmed for its Kentucky and Indiana plants. Could it also be offered with a range-extender powertrain? It’s possible, but we haven’t seen any confirmation yet.

Given Toyota’s cautious approach to full electrification, a dual offering wouldn’t be out of character, especially if it helps bridge the gap for buyers not quite ready to go all-in on battery power. As for the larger Grand Highlander, which isn’t sold in China, it’s expected to receive a mid-cycle update in 2027.

Sienna Also Joining the EREV Club

The Toyota Sienna minivan, which entered its current fourth generation in 2020, shares its underpinnings with the Highlander and Grand Highlander. In China, the model is assembled by GAC Toyota, while FAW Toyota offers a nearly identical version under the Granvia name.

While the fifth-generation Sienna has already been confirmed for China, the North American version is rumored to arrive in 2027 with major updates in both design and technology. As in the upcoming Highlander, the Chinese-market Sienna will adopt a range-extender powertrain, likely sharing the same underlying system.

How the Range-Extender Could Work

Toyota hasn’t released detailed specs for the new EREV system yet. Based on typical configurations, it’s expected to pair a small combustion engine with a large battery, where the engine acts solely as a generator. Propulsion should come entirely from the electric motors, which means drivers get the feel and benefits of a battery-electric vehicle, with extended range and less dependence on charging stations.

In addition to the EREV plans, Toyota confirmed that its sixth-generation hybrid system is in development. This new iteration aims to improve both fuel efficiency and performance. The company also highlighted upcoming enhancements to its Toyota Safety Sense 4.0 suite, including upgraded sensors and improved computing power.

Next Camry Gets a Mention

Beyond the Highlander and Sienna, Toyota also briefly referenced a new-generation Camry during the presentation. While details were limited, it’s likely that a replacement for the current model, which debuted in late 2023, will appear later this decade. Expect it to borrow features from the recently introduced Lexus ES, possibly in both design and tech.

While the materials used in sodium-ion batteries are cheaper and more abundant, the trade-off is significant.
He acknowledged growing interest in alternative technologies like sodium-ion batteries, which some Chinese firms continue to develop.
While EVs tend to dominate the lithium conversation, Kletz sees battery storage as the more critical area in the long term, particularly for national infrastructure.
Kletz suggests it may not yet be the right to time re-enter the lithium market, at least for now.","Lithium’s status as a darling of the energy transition narrative is under increasing scrutiny. Prices have plunged from their COVID-era highs, the market is awash in new supply, and geopolitical trade barriers are reshaping the competitive landscape.

Kletz sees lithium as a compelling long-term investment theme, tightly linked to sweeping global shifts such as electrification grid modernization, and the rise of electric vehicles. But he also sees the lithium market as being caught between long-term optimism and short-term pain. After a dramatic run-up during the early 2020s, prices have since collapsed, erasing nearly all the post-COVID gains.

“They had a boom period and they've since basically given up all of that,” he said. “In terms of momentum, the acute phase of that sell off is seemingly behind us. Charts can change direction at a pin drop but the trend is still lower.”

Additionally, China’s entry into the market with lower-cost production techniques has disrupted traditional supply dynamics as Chinese producers can manufacture lithium carbonate from US $8,000–US$10,000 per tonne, far below the US$12,000–US$15,000 range faced by Australian spodumene operations. This cost edge has allowed Chinese firms to flood the market while remaining profitable, putting significant pressure on competitors.

“Undoubtedly, Western manufacturers are watching what the Chinese are doing, and they're going to attempt to reverse engineer the success that those Chinese battery makers have had in making superior battery stacks,” added Kletz. “It’s not something that gets switched overnight but when that happens, you'll see another wave of heightened interest in electric vehicles in the West.”

Driving this reversal is a surge in supply. Australia, for instance, has rapidly transformed from a mid-tier player into the world’s top producer, thanks to a wave of investment. Kletz also pointed to the emergence of technologies like direct lithium extraction (DLE), which could unlock previously uneconomical reserves in the US.

Yet, Kletz raised a critical question. With so much capital flowing into lithium, could it be replaced? He’s closely watching developments in sodium-ion battery technology, particularly from China. While the materials used in sodium-ion batteries are cheaper and more abundant, the trade-off is significant.

“They have much less energy density than lithium,” he noted, adding that sodium-ion batteries would have to be larger and heavier to deliver comparable performance, something that makes them less viable for electric vehicles, where weight and space are at a premium.

Still, he acknowledged that sodium-ion could “potentially displace some demand for lithium-ion at the margin,” but he doesn’t see it as a major threat just yet. He acknowledged growing interest in alternative technologies like sodium-ion batteries, which some Chinese firms continue to develop. These batteries use cheaper, more abundant materials, raising questions about whether lithium could eventually be displaced. But Kletz believes lithium still holds the upper hand.

On the demand side, lithium still benefits from structural tailwinds. Notably, the global push toward electrification, battery storage, and electric vehicles. But Kletz noted that prices remain highly sensitive to external forces such as EV subsidies and fluctuations in Chinese consumer demand. Additionally, the “the prices can be quite volatile in response to those things,” he said.

Despite China having a massive grip on the global battery market, as Kletz pointed to BYD and CATL as major players in both vehicle and battery manufacturing, this dominance is also becoming a liability amid escalating trade tensions as he noted the US is leaning on all of its partners to take more of a hawkish stance on trade with China.

While EVs tend to dominate the lithium conversation, Kletz sees battery storage as the more critical area in the long term, particularly for national infrastructure. He drew a comparison to earlier hesitations around 5G hardware, where many countries were wary of integrating Chinese-made components.

“The rest of the world has a lot of catching up to do to catch up to China and maybe that's not realistic over the near term. But I think competing battery manufacturers outside of China has a big advantage to displace some of China's market dominance by building out and refining capability for lithium,” he noted, pointing to US grid operators, for example, who might be more inclined to choose Canadian batteries, especially if Chinese alternatives become more expensive due to tariffs or trade restrictions.

Kletz suggests it may not yet be the right to time re-enter the lithium market, at least for now. Despite the long-term potential, he’s hesitant to make any moves while prices remain under pressure.

“I would want to see a bit more of a stabilization before dipping my toe back in,” he said. “I think we’re close to it but it would pay to wait a little bit.”",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/bpm/deni_638854180765705774.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:03:25.916141

Aviation hub grows The 400 aerospace companies that operate in North Carolina contributes $88 billion to the state's economy each year, state officials said.
“But we fully believe that they will achieve liftoff here in North Carolina.” WRAL State Government Reporter Will Doran contributed to this report.","JetZero Inc., a California aircraft manufacturer with ambitious plans to build futuristic, fuel-sipping, all-wing planes, has picked North Carolina for the site of its first factory — a $4.72 billion project that could bring more than 14,500 high-paying jobs to the state, officials said Thursday.

The planned factory, to be built at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, is one of the biggest job-creation commitments in state history, buoyed in part by more than $1 billion in state economic incentives. If successful, the project’s impact could spread throughout the state, sprouting suppliers and ancillary services throughout the state and beyond. It could also play a role in transforming commercial air travel.

North Carolina Department of Commerce officials disclosed JetZero’s North Carolina plans during a special meeting to discuss incentives on Thursday morning. The department’s Economic Investment Committee, which evaluates performance-based grants for growing companies, approved an incentives package worth up to $1.57 billion, including a jobs grant worth up to $1.02 billion. The grant would be paid out in installments over 37 years, provided the company meets investment and hiring targets. JetZero expects to hire the employees and make the $4.72 billion investment by the end of 2036.

“You think about what's going into the economy from this project — that's going to go to every county in North Carolina,” Lee Lilley, the state’s commerce secretary, told WRAL in an interview.In addition to the state incentives, Guilford County commissioners on Thursday approved a separate package worth up to $76 million, to be paid out over 20 years. The Greensboro City Council approved additional incentives to the company worth $1,000 per job.

JetZero, whose tecnhology is designed to reduce fuel consumption and lower emisisons, is among the latest clean energy company to target the state. It's also the latest aircraft manufacturer to land in North Carolina in recent years — part of a broader strategy by corporate recruiters.

""Aviation is a cornerstone of our economy and a driver of innovation in our state,"" Gov. Josh Stein said during a news conference on Thursday. ""This decision further solidifies North Carolina's place in aviation and aerospace leadership.""

If fully realized, the factory would employ a workforce larger than the population of most municipalities in the state — slightly bigger than Smithfield or Rolesville and almost twice the size of Kill Devil Hills, where the Wright brothers embarked on the first successful airplane flight.

It could grow the state’s economy by $259 billion, commerce officials estimated. The entire state’s inflation-adjusted gross domestic product was $845.13 billion in late 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

“Not only do you have the direct jobs associated with this project, but you have a number of indirect jobs — service providers, and ultimately, we hope to attract a number of suppliers for the assembly of this aircraft — and they don't all have to be right on site at PTI,” Lilley said, referring to the Greensboro airport. “You can sprinkle them out into other counties. But anytime you create 14,000 direct jobs, that is going to reverberate throughout the entire region.”

Tom O’Leary, the chief executive of JetZero, said the company was attracted to the state’s “innovative, ambitious and capable workforce,” and the quality of the state’s schools and colleges — including community colleges capable of helping build a pipeline of engineers, technicians and advanced manufacturing experts.

“With this announcement, the state becomes the epicenter of the next era of flight,” O’Leary said at a news conference in Greensboro, adding: “This is more than just a factory. It's a launch pad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

Big plans, no flights

The state’s potential investment is a gamble on an aerospace startup with big ambitions — and lots of deep-pocketed partners — but not one flight under its belt.

JetZero’s innovative Z4 plane is still under development. The private company, which is funded in part by a $235 million U.S. Air Force grant, aims to have its first aircraft flying in 2027 and enter commercial service in 2030.

Even though JetZero’s demonstrator hasn’t yet been built, the state felt confident in committing such a large incentives package to the company. Lilley said the state scrutinized the company’s balance sheet, spoke with others in the industry and even the the federal government, which has been involved the Z4’s development.

“They're going to be able to succeed with this product because the engineering checks out,” Lilley said. “There's obviously a demand for it in the market, not only for defense use, but especially for commercial use, and the plane that they're designing is really going to change the way that we do aviation, because it's going to save operators so much money and fuel costs.”

Major airlines and the U.S. government have high hopes for the Z4 because of the cost-savings it promises. Fuel and oil account for more than 25% of airlines’ total operating expenses, according to the International Air Transport Association.

The Z4’s blended-wing design — similar to a Stealth Bomber — is capable of reducing fuel consumption by 50%, according to the company. The design blends the wings and fuselage, enabling the entire wingspan to produce lift, enabling it to fly more efficiently than other aircraft designs. JetZero bills its product as the world’s first commercial all-wing airplane, capable of carrying 250 passengers over 5,000 nautical miles.

More established aerospace companies including Airbus and Boeing, have also been testing blended-wing aircraft. Lilley pointed to the state’s performance model as a safeguard against competitive risks or other threats to the company's viability. Grant payments only occur if the state can verify that the company has met its incremental job creation and investment targets. The state regularly cancels job-creation grants for companies that don’t meet those targets.

But JetZero is also seen as a viable competitor. United Airlines, buoyed by the prospect of cost savings, announced in April an investment in JetZero that could lead the carrier to order 100 JetZero airplanes, with an option for another 100, provided JetZero meets development, safety and financial milestones. Delta Air Lines and Alaska Air Group have also announced partnerships. Delta plans to offer operational guidance on things such as customer experience, which is expected to be much different in a JetZero plane than in traditional tube-and-wing aircraft.

To deliver the planes, though, the company needs to build them. That’s where Greensboro comes in.

Aviation hub grows

The 400 aerospace companies that operate in North Carolina contributes $88 billion to the state's economy each year, state officials said. Over the years, the Triad has blossomed into a hub for aerospace companies luring the likes of jetmaker Honda Aircraft Co. and Boom Supersonic. Those companies have opened massive operations at Piedmont Triad International with thousands of employees.

During the announcement Thursday, Republican lawmakers — who are expected to appropriate of as much as $450 million to cover site preparations; road, water, and wastewater improvements, as well as the construction of the manufacturing and a research and development center for composite structures — touted their legislative efforts to lower taxes and reduce regulations as reasons for the economic success.

""This wouldn't be possible without state policies that have created an environment that enables private sector growth and development all across the state,"" Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said.

JetZero’s factory would dwarf the size of those operations combined if its plans become reality. The company is likely to need thousands of engineers, material scientists, aerospace technicians, electricians and electrical engineers and others to assemble the aircraft. The new factory is expected to include a research and development center for composite structures.

To build up its staff, it’s likely the company would have to pull from the state’s labor pool and beyond. The company hopes to entice workers with high pay; the average annual salary for workers at the facility would be about $89,000. That’s about 53% above the average private sector wage in Guilford county, according to state commerce officials. In all, the project could have an annual payroll impact of about $1.3 billion for the region.

Aviation companies have been drawn to the region due in part to the state’s labor pool and the availability of workforce training — two things JetZero’s CEO lauded in remarks at Thursday’s press conference. The company and state also hope to train people to become competitive for positions at the factory, and at other aerospace manufacturers in the state.

Guilford Technical Community College has been expanding its aviation program, where it offers courses in aerospace manufacturing, engineering, assembly and repair, among other disciplines. The college is planning a multimillion-dollar expansion that could grow its headcount by about 40% when it’s complete in 2027.

Included in JetZero’s incentives package were services from the state’s Division of Workforce Solutions valued at $10.7 million. The package also includes $32 million for specialized training through the state’s community college system. Those will help the company and competitors bolster their ranks. Local leaders realize it'll take time to build those resources and the workforce.

""This is a long term project,"" Brent Christensen, chief executive of the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce told city officials Thursday as they approved local incentives for the project. ""You don't need 14,000 employees on day one. This is a 10-, 15-, 20-year project that will grow the airport and grow our community. But it won't grow overnight. It will be measured in stages.""

Aerospace isn’t the only focus of North Carolina’s recent efforts to bring in new manufacturing industries, to replace the jobs lost in the furniture and textile industries over the past 30 years. Toyota recently opened a massive factory, also in the Greensboro area, where the company promised to hire thousands of people to make batteries for its electric cars. Another electric vehicle company, Vinfast, plans to build its cars in Moncure, on the border between Wake and Chatham counties, though its project has been delayed.

Former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper made attracting the clean-energy industry a key strategy of his economic development efforts. The JetZero announcement shows his Democratic predecessor, Stein, is continuing those efforts — even as Republican President Donald Trump has sought to slow or stop some of the federal funds and tax credits aimed at the clean tech industry that the federal government had previously approved under former Democratic President Joe Biden.

The JetZero talks began under Cooper, but Lilley told WRAL that one of Stein’s first calls after replacing Cooper was to the company, reassuring them of his continued support.

“The real hard work starts now, because we're going to have to get them off the ground,” Lilley said. “But we fully believe that they will achieve liftoff here in North Carolina.”

Being repealed is The Clean Power Plan 2.0, as well as The Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule.

These regulations were seen as burdensome by some in the industry and would have forced states to change their fuel sources for electricity generation.

Repealing these also protected a lot of jobs, saving some mines that were at risk of shutting down.

Jeff Brabant: For example, right now, the cap on full and immediate expensing for equipment for small businesses is $1.25 million.
So this is a small business deduction that cost about $800 billion, the vast majority of that benefit going to the largest small businesses in the country.
Now, Republicans want to make major spending cuts to help partially pay for the tax cuts.
There were small businesses that made a living out of essentially marketing those tax credits and going to homeowners or going to businesses.","Republicans' big tax and spending bill, currently making its way through the Senate, would extend the individual tax cut from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That’s one of the provisions that would lead to it adding an estimated $2.6 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.

Marketplace Senior Washington Correspondent Kimberly Adams has been looking into just how some of the proposed changes in the bill would change the economy, especially for businesses. She joined “Marketplace Morning Report” host David Brancaccio to discuss. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.

David Brancaccio: Now, remember, Congress made the tax cuts for corporations, as opposed to individuals, permanent in that 2017 law. So what's in this reconciliation package for businesses?

Kimberly Adams: Quite a bit, especially for small- and medium-sized businesses. I spoke with Jeff Brabant, who's vice president for federal government relations at the National Federation of Independent Business, and he told me he really feels like businesses came out on top in this bill.

Jeff Brabant: For example, right now, the cap on full and immediate expensing for equipment for small businesses is $1.25 million. Congress wants to double that to $2.5 million, which we think is a really good thing to encourage small business owners to invest in new equipment, buy a new tractor if you're a farmer.

Adams: But the big win, says Brabant, is making what's called the ""pass-through deduction"" permanent and expanding it.

Brancaccio: You're the best Kimberly, because you're going to try to explain the pass-through deduction. How does it work, and what is the GOP want to change?

Adams: So if you're a business that's a sole proprietorship, LLCs, or some partnerships in S corps, you pay your business' taxes at personal income tax rates, which are much higher than what corporations pay. So the 2017 law gave an extra deduction for those businesses, but a lot of people have complained that it doesn't really help small businesses that much. Richard Trent is executive director of the small business advocacy group Main Street Alliance.

Richard Trent: So the initial numbers on this are that the top 1% of small businesses are reaping 50% of the benefit coming from that deduction. So this is a small business deduction that cost about $800 billion, the vast majority of that benefit going to the largest small businesses in the country.

Adams: Right now, that deduction is 20% but this bill would make it permanent and boost it to 23%.

Brancaccio: All right. Now, Republicans want to make major spending cuts to help partially pay for the tax cuts. But how might some of those cuts affect businesses.

Adams: Lots of different ways. So for example, this bill threatens many of the Inflation Reduction Act or green energy tax credits. And Michael Negron with this group Small Business Majority and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress gives this example of possible impact of that:

Michael Negron: There were credits for solar to support solar installation. There were small businesses that made a living out of essentially marketing those tax credits and going to homeowners or going to businesses. Same goes for energy-efficient home improvements, and this bill would just about immediately terminate them.",https://img.apmcdn.org/ccd71ad0a57b546572b4a3ab08176760bd6f8013/widescreen/2e0d7d-20250613-the-silhouette-of-the-us-capitol-at-sunset-behind-trees-2000.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:05:21.987164

For 2027, the total proposed RVO is 24.46 bg, of which 15 bg is conventional renewable fuel and 9.46 is advanced biofuel. Notably, EPA is proposing lower RIN values for imported fuels to ensure that U.S.-produced renewable fuels are prioritized under the RFS.

“This proposal sends a very positive and powerful signal to U.S. renewable fuel producers and farmers. It represents an excellent starting point for the 2026 and 2027 RVO discussion,” Cooper said. “We look forward to providing more feedback to EPA on the proposed volumes during the public comment period, and we’ll continue to underscore the vital importance of a strong RFS to America’s rural communities.”

Cooper also noted that while today’s proposed rule does not specifically address 169 pending small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions, it includes a commitment from EPA to reallocate any SREs that may be granted in future actions.

“The entire supply chain is seeking certainty regarding EPA’s plans on SREs, and today’s proposal helps to clarify the agency’s approach moving forward,” Cooper said. “We agree that the agency has a legal obligation to reallocate any exempted blending volumes, consistent with the approach adopted by EPA near the end of President Trump’s first administration. However, EPA’s top priority for SREs should be maintaining a high standard for evaluating petitions and continuing to take a restrained and limited approach. The marketplace needs to be reassured that the RVOs published by EPA are real and will not be watered down or eroded by SREs.”

In this round of setting volumes for compliance year 2026 and beyond, the broader liquid fuels industry worked together for the first time, supporting robust volumes and a multi-year approach.

RFA was part of a joint letter in February to incoming EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, cosigned by the American Petroleum Institute and others. “As the EPA begins work on policies that promote American energy and renewable fuels, we encourage the EPA to consider robust future renewable fuel volumes for 2026 and beyond. We believe strong, steady volumes for conventional biofuel targets, biomass-based diesel, and advanced fuels would more accurately reflect the availability and ongoing investments in feedstocks and production capacity,” we wrote.

In April, 16 senators called on EPA to put forward strong renewable volume obligations for the 2026 compliance year and beyond. Also In April, the governors of four states—Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota—wrote a joint letter to Zeldin supporting strong renewable volumes, noting that “For our multi-generational farm families, a strong RVO is more than policy – it’s a critical foundation for their future.”",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/796/1000/EPA-Offices.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:04:42.059555

(AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.
The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov.
“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said.
“North Carolina was first in flight.
The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.","GREENSBORO, N.C. -- GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.

The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro’s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.

JetZero has said it's already received about $300 million in investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina's robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.

“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.”

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project earlier Thursday to a state committee that awards economic incentives.

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.3 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers’ paychecks. The incentives also include up to $784 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and $450 million from the General Assembly to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.

A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

“We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O'Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It’s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The 5-year-old company says the plane’s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.

“It's going to deliver a better passenger experience than you’ve ever had before on any other plane,” O'Leary said.

The state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed three resolutions approved by lawmakers barring California’s electric vehicle sales mandates and diesel engine rules, including its landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said on Thursday.
“Trump’s all-out assault on California continues,” California Governor Gavin Newsom responded.
“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process.” The states asked a judge to declare that Trump’srepeal of waivers issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden have no effect on state emissions rules.","A group of 11 states led by California on Thursday filed suit challenging a repeal by Congress of the state’s 2035 electric vehicle rules and heavy duty truck requirements.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed three resolutions approved by lawmakers barring California’s electric vehicle sales mandates and diesel engine rules, including its landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said on Thursday.

“Trump’s all-out assault on California continues,” California Governor Gavin Newsom responded. “And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process.”

The states asked a judge to declare that Trump’srepeal of waivers issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden have no effect on state emissions rules.

“The Federal Government carried out an illegal playbook designed to evade lawful procedures that might prevent the ‘take down’ of disfavored California laws,” said the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in northern California.

The plaintiffs include New York, New Jersey, Colorado, Massachusetts and Washington state. The defendants are Trump, the EPA and its Administrator Lee Zeldin.

In March, the Government Accountability Office said the waivers cannot be repealed under the Congressional Review Act. Senate Republicans rejected the advice of the Senate parliamentarian in moving forward under the act.

Biden’s waiver allowed California to mandate that at least 80% of new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035, with the remainder being plug-in hybrids.

Trump also signed a resolution to rescind the EPA’s 2023 approval of California’s plans to require a rising number of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks, and another resolution on California’s low-NOx, or low-nitrogen oxide, regulation for heavy-duty highway and off-road vehicles and engines.

The lawsuit said regulations requiring “crucial emission

reductions from gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles got swept in for termination too.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing General Motors GM.N, Toyota7203.T, Volkswagen VOWG.DE, Hyundai 005380.KS, Stellantis STLAM.MI and others, praised Trump’s signing, saying the EV rules were unachievable and made cars less affordable, limited consumer choice and reduced industry competition.

Alliance CEO John Bozzella said Trump “got behind this repeal before the EV mandates did real damage to the auto industry in America, stood up for customer choice and helped restore a degree of balance to U.S. emissions regulations.”

Experts and automakers say Trump’s repeal significantly reduces the value of Tesla’s EV emissions credits.

The EPA said the lawsuit lacked merit. “This is nothing more than California throwing a temper tantrum because the American people don’t want the state’s terrible policies,” agency spokeswoman Molly Vaseliou said.

A separate bill passed by the U.S. House in May would end a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and repeal vehicle emissions rules designed to prod automakers into building more EVs. It would also phase out EV battery production tax credits in 2028. Another Senate proposal would eliminate penalties for not meeting federal fuel economy requirements.

Geothermal UK, a coalition bringing together all facets of the geothermal industry, has launched today to champion geothermal energy as a key part of the UK’s clean energy transition.

Founding members include TownRock Energy, Causeway Geothermal, and Eden Geothermal.

The coalition, which includes developers, the supply chain, academic experts and public bodies, aims to unify the sector’s voice and advocate for supportive policy frameworks and investment to unlock the enormous untapped potential of geothermal energy in the UK.

“We’re launching Geothermal UK to raise awareness of all geothermal technologies delivering decarbonised heat, cooling and power, and to speed up the roll-out of this critical clean energy solution,” said Anne Murrell, founder of the coalition. “Geothermal is local and ready to scale, and is indispensable for our net zero future. European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are already experiencing the benefit of their geothermal resources at scale; it’s time for the UK to catch up.”

The coalition’s launch comes amid growing momentum for geothermal in the UK, with many regional initiatives underway and key supply chain trade bodies, such as OEUK, mobilising for geothermal delivery. Geothermal UK plans to serve as the central coordinating voice to support implementation, investment and industry growth.

“Deep Geothermal remains to be a renewable opportunity that we are failing to realise to its full potential. I would always encourage the industry, that understands this very well, to do whatever it can to work together to consistently explain to government what they can offer and the benefits for regional growth, transition jobs, the environment and decarbonisation. I welcome any initiative that helps them to do this.” Dr. Kieran Mullan, MP for Bexhill and Battle and Chairman / Founder of the Deep Geothermal APPG.

“Collaboration is essential if we are to realise the full potential of geothermal energy in the UK. By uniting industry, academia, policymakers, and other key stakeholders through this coalition, we can share expertise, de-risk projects, and build the momentum needed to make geothermal a key part of our energy mix. This is an exciting step towards delivering sustainable, indigenous energy that benefits everyone, ” Stuart Sinclair, CEO, Consortium Drilling

“Geothermal is key to ensuring a just transition of energy jobs, driving local and national economic growth and providing the UK’s energy security. Working together in this coalition is key to achieving scale as quickly as possible,” David Townsend, CEO, TownRock Energy.

“The UK Geothermal industry can transform the efficiency of the UK energy system by reducing the need for electrification. We are standing on a source of clean, cost-effective energy that can be accessed at scale by working in an aligned way; now is the time to go beyond individual projects and establish the systems that will build a new sustainable industry in the UK,” Tom Grand, CCO, Eden Geothermal.

That finding does not bode well for residents who live in rentals without air conditioning.

North Carolina does not require landlords to provide air conditioning in their rental properties. For years, advocates have pushed for an A/C mandate at the city level, but they are met with a common refrain from city officials:

“There's nothing we can adopt in terms of the ordinance at the local level, because we are bound by the state law,” Charlotte City Council member Dimple Ajmera said.

Instead of mandating A/C, the city is partnering with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to provide box fans to at-risk citizens. Ajmera said she has also been monitoring a bill in the General Assembly that would require landlords to provide air conditioning.

“We're watching to see if this bill will be passed,” she said.

However, that bill, sponsored by state Rep. Tracy Clark, looks to be dead for this session. She plans on reintroducing the bill next year. In the meantime, Charlotte residents can keep watch for box fans and cooling centers.

“A/C ought to be a necessity, not an amenity,” Clark said. “It's a human right.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df55403/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1962x1030+47+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F49%2F84%2F67864762457883f6b7a70ad36441%2Fheatmap.png,N,,2025-06-13 12:05:46.981525

Data journalist M.K. Wildeman and science writer Seth Borenstein set out to examine each major EPA rule targeted for repeal under the Trump administration, tallying the projected benefits tied to those regulations. They worked closely with Washington reporter Matthew Daly, who has covered the EPA for years. Many of the data points were buried in lengthy technical documents or had to be drawn from peer-reviewed research and expert analysis. The team dug deep—cross-checking figures, consulting outside experts, and combing through federal documents to highlight the real-world stakes behind the regulatory rollbacks.

At the same time, video journalist Joshua Bickel and reporter Melina Walling traveled to southwestern Indiana to tell the story from the ground up. They found residents whose health and quality of life had improved under existing environmental regulations—and who now fear what will happen if those protections disappear. One local, a lifelong Evansville resident who grew up with asthma, spoke of his concern for his daughter, who’s already showing signs of respiratory trouble.

The result of the team’s work was a comprehensive and sobering estimate: if the regulations are eliminated, the country could see up to 30,000 premature deaths and $275 billion in additional costs annually, largely due to hospitalizations and health impacts tied to pollution.

The team supported its findings with extensive sourcing, including interviews with more than 50 scientists, analysts and current and former EPA officials. The package also featured interactive graphics, produced by Wildeman, that illustrated decades of air quality improvements tied to the rules. Bickel’s video work, along with a vertical-format explainer featuring Walling, gave viewers multiple entry points into the story.

Climate photo editor Alyssa Goodman and senior video journalist Rishi Lekhi edited the visual elements, with Doug Glass serving as lead text editor and Kiki Sideris contributing to social video production.

Top officials, including former EPA chiefs under Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, were quoted in the story, and AP’s findings were vetted and praised by leading scientists.

“This is a rigorous, compelling and much-needed analysis,” said Dr. Howard Frumkin, former head of the National Center for Environmental Health.

When it comes to energy use, no one tops Uncle Sam. With more than 300,000 buildings and 600,000 vehicles, the Federal Government is the nation’s largest energy consumer. That means any effort to conserve power across federal operations directly benefits taxpayers, strengthens national security, and reduces emissions.

Since 1975, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) has been leading that charge. Born out of the oil crisis and authorized under the Federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act (1975), FEMP has quietly transformed how the federal government uses energy, helping agencies save money, modernize infrastructure, and meet ambitious energy goals.

FEMP has been backed by bipartisan support across administrations. In recent years, a bipartisan group of Senators hailing from states across the country—from Hawaii, to Ohio, to New Hampshire, and West Virginia—cosponsored legislation to formally authorize FEMP and establish energy and water reduction goals for federal buildings in an effort to reduce emissions and save money.

Over time, FEMP’s role has expanded to include a wide range of Congressional mandates: from helping agencies leverage funding for infrastructure modernization, to tracking agency accountability, to offering cutting-edge technical assistance. But perhaps its most powerful achievement isn’t written into statute: FEMP saves the federal government billions of dollars.

In fact, FEMP has done the unthinkable: it’s achieved a “50/50/50.”

Over the past 50 years, FEMP has delivered:

A 50% reduction in federal energy intensity

$50 billion in cumulative energy cost savings

And this year, it marks its 50th anniversary

So what’s behind these staggering savings, and how can FEMP build on its legacy of efficiency to meet the challenges of the next 50 years? That is, if its operations aren’t wound down, as DOE leadership has proposed for FEMP in the FY2026 budget.1

The AFFECT Program: Investing in Smarter, Cleaner Government

When it comes to saving taxpayers money while cutting emissions, few programs punch above their weight like FEMP’s AFFECT program—short for Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies.

Launched a decade ago, AFFECT provides competitive grants to help federal agencies implement energy conservation, clean energy, and net-zero projects. These grants help agencies overcome a common obstacle: the lack of upfront capital to fund energy infrastructure improvements. By filling that gap, AFFECT empowers agencies to invest in long-term savings and resilience.

The results speak for themselves. Over the program’s lifetime, AFFECT has funded 160 projects, distributed nearly $300 million, and leveraged a staggering $4 billion in private-sector investment—yielding $137 million in cost savings to date.

These projects align with longstanding federal priorities to reduce costs, support American manufacturing, enhance energy resilience, and strengthen national security—all of which have gotten increased attention recently. AFFECT proves what’s possible when strategic funding meets real agency needs: a cleaner, more efficient, and more resilient federal government.

The Power of Performance Contracts

One of FEMP’s most impactful tools over the past 50 years has been its championing of performance contracting—a financial model that allows federal agencies to upgrade their energy systems without spending a dime in upfront Congressionally-appropriated funds.Through mechanisms like Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs), FEMP helps agencies partner with private-sector energy service companies (ESCOs) to design and install energy-saving improvements. The best part? The cost of the upgrades is repaid over time using the guaranteed energy savings, so taxpayers benefit from day one.

These contracts have helped the federal government leverage billions of dollars in private capital, reducing emissions, modernizing aging infrastructure, and cutting utility bills at no upfront cost.

But FEMP hasn’t stopped there. Many civilian agencies don’t have the legal authority to sign long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs)—a key tool for procuring clean energy from the private sector for agency use. In response, FEMP developed a specialized contracting model: the Energy Savings Performance Contract with an Energy Sales Agreement (ESPC ESA). This innovative tool gives agencies a PPA-like pathway to procure their own distributed energy technologies—like solar installations, solar hot water, wind turbines, geothermal, and combined heat and power.

Here’s how ESPC ESAs work:

Start with a plan. The agency figures out what kind of clean energy system they need and then hires a private energy company, called an ESCO, through a competitive process.

The ESCO builds it—and owns it (at first). The ESCO designs and installs the system and owns it during the contract. Because it’s privately owned, the ESCO can use tax incentives that federal agencies can’t access—like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC)—which helps lower the total cost. However, if Congress rolls back clean energy tax credits like the ITC in the June 2025 reconciliation bill, it will limit one of the smartest tools we have to deliver lower-cost energy upgrades in federal facilities, ultimately costing taxpayers more to achieve the same results.

Agencies only pay for the energy they use. Once the system is up and running, the agency pays the ESCO for the electricity it generates—and only that electricity. The rate must be cheaper than what the agency would’ve paid the utility, which means guaranteed savings.

Eventually, the agency takes ownership. A small slice of each energy payment goes into a savings account that covers the cost of transferring ownership. By the end of the contract (usually within 20 years), the agency owns the system outright—and keeps the clean energy flowing.

So, the federal government gets to invest in reliable energy systems with no upfront cost, guaranteed savings, and long-term benefits. This approach blends financial flexibility with long-term energy independence, offering a win-win for agencies and taxpayers alike.

And the results are real. In FY 2023 alone, FEMP supported 191 federal projects that reported $5.6 million in total cost savings—with actual savings exceeding projections at 101% of estimated values.

Performance contracts aren’t just a workaround for limited budgets—they’re a core strategy for delivering cleaner, more resilient, and more cost-effective government operations. With these tools, FEMP is helping agencies meet today’s energy demands without waiting on tomorrow’s appropriations.

FEMP in Action on Public Lands: Naval Station Newport

FEMP’s commitment to smart stewardship extends beyond office buildings and into the heart of America’s public lands and military installations. At Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island, a 2023 FEMP-led energy and water “treasure hunt” uncovered significant savings opportunities, demonstrating how thoughtful management protects both the federal budget and the government’s consumption of public resources.

The treasure hunt—a hands-on, facility-wide assessment—identified measures projected to save $144,000 annually in energy costs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 288 tons per year. These findings not only highlight a direct benefit to taxpayers through reduced utility bills but also contribute to the Navy’s broader goals for energy resilience and resource stewardship.

By deploying FEMP’s technical expertise and leveraging innovative assessment techniques, Naval Station Newport took an important step toward more efficient operations. This case exemplifies how efficient energy management on public lands protects vital federal resources, enhances mission readiness, and supports America’s energy abundance goals.

Why FEMP Matters Now More Than Ever

The federal government is facing a perfect storm of challenges: the urgent need to cut carbon emissions, historic infrastructure investments in need of implementation, rising energy costs, and a shrinking federal workforce stretched thin. At the same time, global demand for electricity is projected to double by 2050. Meeting these demands without breaking budgets or burning out public servants will require solutions that are smart, scalable, and already proven.

That’s where the Federal Energy Management Program comes in.

For five decades, FEMP has helped agencies modernize their operations, cut waste, and unlock billions in savings. FEMP delivers what every taxpayer hopes for: a government that spends wisely, thinks long-term, and achieves true efficiency. As the next chapter of energy and infrastructure development unfolds, FEMP deserves recognition—and reinvestment. However, despite its proven track record, DOE’s fiscal year 2026 budget proposal requests $8 million to wind down activities at FEMP—potentially shutting its doors for good. That’s a mistake. For decades, FEMP has helped federal agencies save billions in taxpayer dollars, reduce energy waste, and strengthen mission resilience, all without expanding bureaucracy or growing the deficit. If we’re serious about decarbonizing the federal footprint, lowering costs, and building a more resilient future for all Americans, then we need to look to—and continue funding—the programs and public servants who have been doing that work for decades.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/0612-addy-femp.png,N,,2025-06-13 10:02:23.190504

Had the state Department of Labor finalized its workplace heat standard two years earlier, in accordance with a law passed in 2020, Silver might still be playing with his children today.

This tragedy is exactly the kind of situation on workers’ minds when they demand better heat protections. As members of the Heat Justice Now coalition will make clear during an event in Washington, D.C., on June 17, workers across the country have had enough. They’ve had enough of being denied water breaks. They’ve had enough of broken-down air-conditioning units and unfounded accusations of laziness. And they’ve had enough of fainting, throwing up, and fearing for their lives on the job.

Will federal OSHA finish the job it started?

Last year, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued its first-ever proposal for a heat safety standard that would require employers to provide basic human rights on hot days: water, cool places to rest, and education on how to keep people safe.

Remarkably, the Trump administration—which has taken scores of anti-worker actions and embarked on a so-called deregulation initiative—is still moving the proposal forward. June 16 marks the start of two weeks of public hearings, during which OSHA will accept technical and personal testimony from workers, industry groups, union leaders, medical doctors, and many more. In normal times, there would be a post-hearing public comment period, and then OSHA would develop a final heat rule.

These are not normal times.

OSHA already has more barriers to setting new standards than the average federal agency, due to myriad requirements imposed by past presidents and Congresses. Now, because the administration has axed so much of the federal workforce, including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, OSHA no longer has the critical support it needs from heat-health scientists. Cuts to the National Weather Service could also hamper OSHA’s heat inspections, which feed valuable information back into the standards-setting process. And if the president gets his way with congressional appropriators, the team within OSHA that develops standards and guidance could shrink by about a third.

It’s hot everywhere. Why do workers need a special heat standard—and why now?

If you’re mowing your own lawn or cleaning out your attic on a hot summer day, no one can keep you from taking a break, getting a glass of water, or even deferring your task to a cooler part of the day. In the current economy, however, too many workers are denied these basic safeguards on the job.

In a review of more than 200 cases of heat-related workplace deaths, OSHA found that employers frequently failed to provide protections such as water, shade, prompt medical care, and time for new workers to get used to the heat. Some employers actively prevented overheated workers from taking rest breaks. Others left sick workers alone and unsupervised to perish from preventable causes.

Lots of employers do the right thing, of course. But as OSHA put it last year: “The existence of adequate protections in some workplaces speaks to the feasibility of the standard, not necessarily to the lack of need.”

As to the question of “Why now?” the answer is partly climate change. Heat is an old, old problem for workers, and experts in the Nixon administration recommended federal heat standards more than 50 years ago. Workers have been waiting ever since. In the meantime, every season has gotten warmer and heat waves have gotten longer and more intense.

Workers aren’t waiting for Washington, D.C.

Meanwhile, workers and their allies aren’t waiting for a federal heat standard that may never come. In fact, there are more active campaigns for heat protections at this moment than at any time in at least the last seven years—and lawmakers are taking notice. Here are just a few examples.

Arizona: A coalition representing indoor and outdoor workers across multiple industries is calling on the state’s brand-new Workplace Heat Safety Task Force to recommend an enforceable standard.

Florida: Plant nursery workers are negotiating directly with commercial buyers of indoor houseplants to secure heat protections and other basic human rights for themselves and their colleagues.

New Jersey andNew York: Advocates successfully introduced bills to protect workers from heat and are now pushing for those bills to be passed.

New Mexico: Another coalition is urging the state's environment department to swiftly finalize and implement the heat standard it proposed in March 2025.

North Carolina: Labor rights and environmental health groups are urging the state’s new labor commissioner to convene a robust group of stakeholders—including workers—to collectively chart a more productive course on heat protections.

Ideally, there would be one strong, enforceable heat standard for the nation instead of a patchwork of protections that create regulatory uncertainty for employers. It’s outrageous to allow workers to die from preventable heat-related causes when plenty of feasible, commonsense protections are right in front of us. State and local decision-makers should heed the call for heat justice by moving without delay to protect the workers that keep this country running.

In West Virginia, more than one-third of all Medicaid enrollees lived in rural areas.
Finally, Medicaid is a crucial source of care for people living with disabilities, and disability rates tend to be higher in rural areas than in urban areas.
Not only does this proposal extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s tax breaks for the wealthy, but it also adds additional loopholes that skew the tax code even more in favor of the ultrawealthy.
Polling demonstrates that Republican voters oppose the bill when they learn that the tax cuts overwhelmingly benefit those who are already rich.","Last month, House Republicans passed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, on a party-line vote. The bill would make historic cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and terminate clean energy tax credits that have spurred a manufacturing boom in the United States, all to pay for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans. In so doing, the bill would massively raise costs for low-income Americans, lead to 16 million fewer people with health insurance by 2034 when coupled with changes to the Affordable Care Act, put 11 million people at risk of seeing their SNAP benefits cut or eliminated, and put more than half a million jobs at risk. While the effects of this legislation will harm all Americans, people in states won by President Donald Trump in the 2024 election could bear the brunt of these devastating cuts, even though the bill’s tax breaks for billionaires would accrue predominantly for individuals living in states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris.

Medicaid cuts would hurt states and communities that voted for Donald Trump

Medicaid is a foundational pillar of the American health care system, which together with the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage to more than 78 million people—more than 1 in 5 Americans. Many Republican-led states are among those most reliant on Medicaid. In places such as Alaska, Maine, and West Virginia, more than 1 in 4 residents are enrolled in the program. More than two-thirds of the nearly 300 U.S. counties that have seen the largest increases in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment since 2008 voted for Trump in the most recent election. Not only do Republican-led states have some of the highest rates of Medicaid enrollment, but the share of Medicaid enrollees in many of these states is largely in rural areas. For instance, in 2021, nearly 60 percent of all Medicaid enrollees in Wyoming lived in rural areas. In Alaska, around half of all Medicaid enrollees lived in rural communities. In West Virginia, more than one-third of all Medicaid enrollees lived in rural areas. Rural communities, notably, currently vote in greater numbers for Republican candidates.

Medicaid’s popularity and reach extends far beyond current enrollees: Nearly all Republicans (94 percent) recognize the program is important to their local communities, including 95 percent of Trump voters and 95 percent of rural Republicans. People’s personal stakes with Medicaid run deeper than some in Congress may appreciate: Nearly two-thirds of Republicans (62 percent) report that they themselves, a family member, or a close friend have depended on Medicaid at some point in their lives. Among those who voted for President Trump in 2024, about 4 in 10 (42 percent) say that Medicaid is very important or somewhat important to them and to their family directly. These connections help explain why the program has such strong support even within constituencies whose elected representatives have historically opposed it.

Today, Republican voters by and large oppose cuts to the Medicaid program. A new poll from Quinnipiac University released on June 11, 2025, finds that only 18 percent of Republican voters believe Medicaid funding should be cut. KFF meanwhile found that more than two-thirds (67 percent) want Congress to either increase or maintain current Medicaid spending levels. The opposition is even stronger in rural areas, where almost 8 in 10 residents (77 percent) want Medicaid funding preserved or expanded; two-thirds (65 percent) of rural Republicans say funding should increase or stay the same.

Notably, when given the chance to weigh in on Medicaid directly, voters in Republican-led states have repeatedly chosen to protect and expand the program. Voters in states such as Idaho, Nebraska, Utah, Oklahoma, Missouri, and South Dakota have all passed ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid coverage. These repeated successes at the ballot box suggest that efforts to reduce or eliminate Medicaid coverage may face significant public resistance, even within conservative electorates.

Finally, Medicaid is a crucial source of care for people living with disabilities, and disability rates tend to be higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Previous experience shows that states are likely to cut optional Medicaid benefits when federal Medicaid funding is reduced—such as home and community-based supports, dental and denture services, and medical supplies and equipment—which are primarily used by older adults and people with disabilities.

Drastic food assistance cuts would target voters that backed Trump in large numbers

SNAP is the nation’s largest food assistance program and an essential tool to combat hunger when families struggle to make ends meet. The program helps feed more than 42 million people every month, the majority of whom are older Americans and children. Proposals included in the package that would shift benefit costs and additional administrative costs to states, kick 3.2 million people off their benefits by imposing additional burdensome paperwork requirements, and freeze scheduled benefit increases, among others, would amount to the largest cut in SNAP’s history.

Republican-leaning groups of voters would suffer the consequences of drastic cuts to food assistance. SNAP participation is often higher in rural areas and thus makes up a larger portion of food sales than those in suburban and urban areas; as a result, grocery stores and the communities they serve in these areas are at greater risk if the benefit cuts are enacted. Of the roughly 300 counties that are home to more than 27,000 retailers that would be put at higher risk of financial hardship from cuts to SNAP, a disproportional 77 percent of them are in rural areas.

Older Americans in the 50 to 64 age range, who made up the most favorable age group for Trump in 2024 election exit polling, would face additional dangers from the proposal. Specifically, the bill would expand who would be subject to new paperwork requirements from SNAP recipients who are 55 to those as old as 64 for the first time. This proposal puts greater burdens on workers who could be caring for an aging parent or school-age child, or trying to reduce their working hours as they get closer to retirement.

Given the critical role SNAP plays in Republican-leaning areas and that families are already feeling squeezed by the high cost of groceries, it is unsurprising that the vast majority of people oppose cuts to SNAP. Polling repeatedly shows that SNAP is popular, as 85 percent of voters say that the program is important. Substantial majorities support policies that would strengthen and expand SNAP, including nearly 8 in 10 who believe Congress should make it easier for struggling families to qualify for benefits. In fact, 61 percent of Republicans agree that SNAP benefits should be raised, and a majority of Republicans stated they would feel less favorable toward their representatives in Congress if they voted for cuts. This includes 65 percent of white men without a college degree and 64 percent of small town and rural residents—both of which are key groups of voters for the Republican base. This is clearly reflective of the fact that people recognize that SNAP can help ease the burden on household budgets, as nearly half of voters have either relied on SNAP before or know someone who has.

Putting jobs at risk in Trump-won states

Clean energy tax credits enacted through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act are lowering Americans’ energy costs, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and expanding the United States’ energy supply. Trump-won states have benefited the most from the growth of the clean energy economy, receiving 77 percent of investments already spent and 78 percent of jobs created. All of this is at risk of being cut if the House Republicans’ budget bill is passed, including more than $380 billion of outstanding investment for Trump-won states. Cutting these investments translates to more than 530,000 potential jobs in Trump-won states that are at risk of being lost, which is equivalent to 78 percent of all at-risk jobs. In fact, 9 out of the 10 states with the most jobs at risk if the clean energy tax credits are eliminated are states that voted for Donald Trump in 2024. Texas alone has more than 130,000 jobs at risk, which is more than the next three states with the most jobs at risk—California, Georgia, and Michigan—combined.

By ending almost all federal clean energy investments, the House Republican budget bill will cause electricity bills to increase. The states that would see the largest increases in their residential electricity bills by 2026 are mostly Trump-won states: Of the 29 states that will see more than a 5 percent increase, 70 percent are Trump-won states. Four of the 5 states likely to suffer the largest electricity price increases (greater than $200) by 2026 are states where Trump won: Wyoming ($225), North Carolina ($215), Arizona ($203), and Tennessee ($202). Given all the benefits of the clean energy tax credits and risks if they are repealed, it is not shocking that most Americans—including Republicans—oppose cutting these clean energy tax credits. According to recent polling, only one-third of Republicans and 21 percent of all respondents are in favor of cutting funding for clean energy tax credits.

The budget plan guts basic needs for people in Trump-won states while the richest Americans get massive tax breaks

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act would issue the largest transfer of wealth from working-class Americans to the ultrawealthy in the nation’s history. To do so, House Republicans are proposing to cut programs that are essential to people, especially in states that voted for Trump in the last election, in order to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Under this proposal, millionaires would see a larger tax cut than the bottom half of Americans combined—with more than $1.5 trillion in tax cuts going to the top 5 percent. In total, households that make at least $1 million per year would receive roughly twice as much in tax breaks as the bottom 50 percent of the nation combined. Roughly 57 million households in the bottom 60 percent would see a tax increase or a negligible tax change ($100 in either direction) under the House Republican proposal. Not only does this proposal extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s tax breaks for the wealthy, but it also adds additional loopholes that skew the tax code even more in favor of the ultrawealthy. Polling demonstrates that Republican voters oppose the bill when they learn that the tax cuts overwhelmingly benefit those who are already rich.

Conclusion

House Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act would give the wealthiest Americans huge tax breaks while harming everyday Americans—many of whom live in states that voted for Donald Trump—by enacting massive cuts to health care and food assistance. As the Senate prepares to take up this legislation, senators should reject tax and budget proposals that pull the rug out from under working-class people to fund tax breaks that disproportionately benefit millionaires and billionaires. As the U.S. Senate considers changes to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Center for American Progress encourages all Americans to contact their senators to plead with them to reject these devastating cuts that would fall especially hard on Republican-leaning constituencies, rural communities, and states Donald Trump won.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/GettyImages-2217881648cropped.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:02:27.359145

The company announced June 12 that its investment will create 14,500 jobs in the region, perhaps the largest job announcement in the states history.

Calling it “the factory of the future, “the new facility will be located at the Piedmont Triad Airport. To enhance its hiring pool, JetZero will invest $30 million in the North Carolina Community College system to develop a “customized workforce” pipeline to supply the plant with staff over the next decade, according to a state government press release.

Developed in part with $235 million in Air Force funding, JetZero’s initial BWB demonstrator is supposed to begin test flights in 2027. The objective Z4 aircraft aims to fulfill both commercial passenger and cargo roles, as well as become a potential airlift and tanker aircraft for the Air Force.

The Air Force is trying to diversify its supplier base and invested in the startup because of the potential advantages of its design for both military and civilian use. But the Z4 does not have an inside track to win any future airlift or tanker competition, Air Force officials have said.

The factory is planned to be “fully-digital and AI-driven to outpace legacy original equipment manufacturers by ramping up faster, cutting unit costs, boosting quality and hardening the supply chain,” the company said. The airliner version of the Z4, which the company hopes to begin delivering in in 2030, would carry about 230 passengers.

JetZero said it has “secured investments and conditional purchase agreements from Alaska Airlines and United Airlines.” About 14 airlines “have joined JetZero’s Airline Working Group to provide input on their needs, including the requirement for the Z4 to readily fit into today’s airport infrastructure.”

North Carolina Governor Josh Stein’s office said the state’s 2.25 percent corporate tax rate and its low cost of living helped attract JetZero, and the company will also partner with Siemens’ Smart Infrastructure, Electrification, and Automation divisions, which are also headquartered in North Carolina, to design its factory with the most efficient technologies possible.

“Siemens also supports JetZero’s design/build/test model for the demonstrator aircraft, a full-scale prototype slated for first flight in 2027,” the governor’s statement said.

JetZero is readying a non-flying ground version of the Z4 for testing and test flights are already underway using a subscale model. Full-scale fuel tanks are undergoing tests and a wing test article is being evaluated. Cockpit tooling is complete, company officials said, and the critical design review for the demonstrator is expected “soon.”

Once the North Carolina facility is completed, the company will move its headquarters to the new site.

The company describes the Z-4 as “a game-changer, slashing fuel burn, emissions and costs with its ultra-efficient all-wing body design. By maximizing lift and minimizing drag, it will deliver up to 50 percent greater fuel efficiency and associated emissions reduction.” The aircraft will also deliver “a cleaner, quieter and improved travel experience” in airliner service, and be able to operate out of airfields with shorter runways, JetZero said.

The aircraft is being designed and developed in California with the help of Northrop Grumman’s Scaled Composites unit, and is expected to enter commercial service “in the early 2030s.”

Northrop and JetZero are expected to offer a “KC-Z4” version of the aircraft for the Air Force’s Next-Generation Air Refueling system (NGAS) requirement. The concept aircraft would have a gross operating weight of 362,000 pounds, with a total fuel load of 200,000 pounds; that’s comparable to today’s KC-135 and KC-46 aerial refueling jets. But the efficiency of the blended wing-body promises greater range and its cargo capacity is anticipated to exceed the KC-46, 21 pallets versus 18, a difference of about 17 percent.

A cargo-only version would also require a rear ramp, which is not part of the prototype effort, and would require a different tail design, company officials said.",https://www.airandspaceforces.com/app/uploads/2025/06/JetZero-Z4.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 11:02:23.617582

With the installation of a 1.49-MW solar power system on the roof of the factory, Bloomsburg dramatically reduced its operating overhead and energy costs.
Bowman led the effort to bring clean energy to the company’s rooftop to avoid these ballooning energy costs.
That’s when he turned to Evergrow for help finding a buyer and navigating the required tax-credit diligence process.
“We’re proud to support family-owned manufacturers like Bloomsburg Carpet in their transition to clean energy,” said James Richards, CEO of Evergrow.","Evergrow has successfully completed a tax-credit transfer for a rooftop solar project at a carpet factory in Pennsylvania — a much needed energy source for the factory that would not have been possible without incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Bloomsburg Carpet Industries in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, is a third-generation, family-owned manufacturer of carpets for iconic institutions, including the House and Senate Chambers of the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. Supreme Court, Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall. With the installation of a 1.49-MW solar power system on the roof of the factory, Bloomsburg dramatically reduced its operating overhead and energy costs.

With more than 30 looms operating daily, Bloomsburg’s energy demands are significant. CFO Adam Bowman saw that inaction would expose the company to the higher energy costs that energy industry analysts warn will result from a historic rise in electricity demand unfolding across the United States. Industry experts project electricity demand to rise 25% by 2030, leading to higher electricity prices for consumers. For manufacturers like Bloomsburg, the annual cost increases could be staggering.

Bowman led the effort to bring clean energy to the company’s rooftop to avoid these ballooning energy costs. A combination of incentives had started to make going solar more attractive. But it was ultimately the successful sale and transfer of the tax credits generated by the solar installation that got the financing over the finish line.

At just under $2.2 million in qualifying costs, Bloomsburg’s rooftop solar system earned approximately $660,000 in investment tax credits (ITC). Under the IRA, the ITC was made transferable, meaning taxpayers like Bloomsburg can sell their credits to investors after the project is placed into service. This allows small businesses like Bloomsburg to rely less on debt financing to get their projects off the ground.

Bowman initially tried to find a buyer for the credits himself. But as an independent, family-owned business, he encountered difficulties: Buyers worried about the potential risk of tax-credit recapture. Under the law, if a business is forced to sell the asset that generated the tax credits within five years, some or all of the credits can be “recaptured” by the IRS. For this reason, buyers tend to prefer sellers with a track record of long-term project ownership and sufficient assets to cover an indemnity. Bowman found that even though Bloomsburg Carpet had enjoyed decades of good financial standing, buyers still balked.

That’s when he turned to Evergrow for help finding a buyer and navigating the required tax-credit diligence process. Evergrow uses technology to partially automate the diligence process, making it easier for non-experts like Bowman to provide documentation and complete the process. The company also supplies buyers with a diligence guarantee — meaning buyers are reimbursed for any recapture-related losses. Designed to overcome exactly the kinds of barriers Bowman had faced when trying to go it alone, the Evergrow Guarantee provides full assurance to tax-credit buyers that they’ll be reimbursed in the unlikely event of an IRS recapture.

“Evergrow was on our side the whole time,” said Bowman. “The Evergrow Guarantee was really essential — I don’t think the deal would’ve gotten done without it.”

The project’s impact is already being felt. Bloomsburg is now saving approximately $200,000 per year on electricity costs, plus an additional $50,000 annually from Pennsylvania’s Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) program. These savings, along with an improved Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) score, strengthen Bloomsburg’s environmental leadership in the textile industry. More details on the transaction are available in this case study published on Evergrow’s website.

“We’re proud to support family-owned manufacturers like Bloomsburg Carpet in their transition to clean energy,” said James Richards, CEO of Evergrow. “This project is a model for how commercial and industrial businesses of any size can take full advantage of clean energy incentives like the ITC — with the right financial partner.”

While geologic hydrogen discoveries and their benefits may be at first localized, that's not a new story, Hasiuk said.
'So until we see more exploration successes (with geologic hydrogen) it's going to be a very small process.","Emerging science shows geologic hydrogen, created under the Earth's crust naturally, may exist in pools that can be extracted for clean energy.

A U.S. Geological Survey study of where geologic hydrogen could potentially be found shows Michigan as a particularly promising site.

Imagine an abundant form of energy that's so clean, when you burn it, it doesn't create carbon or greenhouse gases; it creates water. Imagine that unlike oil and gas, where when you take it out of the ground it's gone, this underground energy source can be stimulated to keep reproducing itself, creating wells that never run out.

Now imagine that energy source being abundant beneath the surface of the U.S. — and that Michigan in particular is teeming with it.

Emerging science is showing all of the above appears true, but there is a lot more work to do before this potentially revolutionary energy source can be unlocked on a large scale.

It's not some exotic, newly discovered element, but the most ubiquitous one in the universe: hydrogen. It's been used for years in producing metals, in hydrogenating cooking oils for better shelf life, and in the creation of ammonia for nitrogen-based fertilizers used on farm fields across the globe. But that hydrogen comes at a cost, from applying electricity to water — H₂O, two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom — to separate the two elements and retain the hydrogen. Natural gas is often used to provide the energy for that process, but that's expensive and, while better than coal or oil, still pollutes the atmosphere. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are also being applied to this hydrogen extraction process, but it's difficult and costly to do at scale.

Hydrogen is created naturally underground through a reaction between water and certain iron-rich rocks, a process known as serpentinization, or through radiolysis, where natural radiation deep in the Earth breaks down water molecules to produce hydrogen. But scientists for generations — to the extent they thought about geologic hydrogen at all — considered it so diffusive and reactive they believed most was dissipated or converted to some other compound. Historically, when hydrogen pockets were discovered in drilling or mining, it wasn't identified or quantified.. Rather, it was often considered a nuisance to remove so that miners and drillers could get what they really were after: oil, gas, and minerals.

Scientists only recently discovered that geologic hydrogen potentially remains trapped in rock layers in pools that could be tapped, maybe even on a commercial scale.

In a study published earlier this year, geologists with U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a multi-faceted map of the prospectivity of geologic hydrogen in the continental U.S. They looked for areas with all the right ingredients: a source of sufficient hydrogen generation — iron-rich rock is an important catalyst; porous underground reservoirs for storage; and a sufficient layer of sealing cap rock to contain the hydrogen pools and prevent leaking.

The study found that a large swath through the middle of the country has great potential to contain collected pools of geologic hydrogen — and Michigan in particular was one of the areas that really showed promise.

""The source of the hydrogen, the reservoir and the seal, Michigan in particular happens to have all of these ingredients all overlaid with one another, plus a handful of other things that we mapped out,"" said Jane Hearon, a USGS geologist and co-author of the study.

""It was kind of interesting and fun to see Michigan light up that way because you don't think of it as like a Texas, one of these states that has a longstanding tradition of energy production.""

And while one path of research is looking into where geologic hydrogen may be naturally occurring, another is looking into places with the right rock formations and other ingredients where the gas may be stimulated into existence and produced, through injection of water into rock and perhaps with some catalysts such as other elements and microbes, said USGS geologist Sarah Gelman, a co-author on the prospectivity mapping study.

Then-President Joe Biden's Department of Energy in February 2024 announced $20 million in grants to 16 institutions looking into geologic hydrogen's energy potential, including 10 institutions working on stimulated hydrogen projects.

""It's a bit simpler versus finding the accumulations, because you just go where the right rocks are,"" Gelman said. ""But it's got a lot of engineering challenges, and that's where that body of research (is needed).""

Stimulated hydrogen holds promise for iron-rich regions without natural underground reservoirs for accumulating naturally created hydrogen, such as ""the Upper Peninsula and into Minnesota,"" she said.

""It doesn't mean all hope is lost there,"" Gelman said. ""There is some good, good potential (for stimulated hydrogen production).""

170,000 years' worth of energy, created by the Earth

The Earth has produced enough hydrogen under its crust to meet the entire planet's energy needs for 170,000 years — but most of it is lost or inaccessible, said Christopher Ballentine, a professor of geochemistry at the University of Oxford in England.

""But what it does mean is we only need to find a small amount of it for it to be useful societally,"" he said.

Ballentine pointed to USGS studies showing there's potentially enough geologic hydrogen which ""has the potential to be found and discovered and produced"" to meet society's increasing hydrogen demands for the next 200 years.

That has piqued the interest of the oil, gas and mineral extraction world.

[ Help us improve the Free Press experience! Take our short survey. ]

""The industry is following the money,"" Ballentine said. ""About five years ago, there were zero companies in this space. Two years ago, there were 40. There are probably double that today.""

But prospectivity means places where stored, naturally occurring underground hydrogen may be, where the conditions are ripe for it. But it's not a certainty, and searching for it is a costly process that oil and gas production companies approach carefully.

""There are a lot of smaller startups, a lot of independent new companies that are interested in this,"" Gelman said. ""The oil majors are often interested and sitting back and watching a little bit, but they will be the fast followers.""

""We want to get to the wells − that's the exciting part; they actually call it the rotary lie detector, where you figure out what's down there. But there is a lot of groundwork and geology that we're trying to provide to American industry and American policy makers to try and help ease this initial stage.""

Interest, but not much activity so far in Michigan

Current U.S. exploration and drilling for geologic hydrogen occurs most intensely in Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, along the Midcontinent Rift, a geologic formation in the middle U.S. where the Earth's crust began to pull apart millions of years ago. That activity hasn't occurred in Michigan — yet.

""We’ve been following the increased attention on geologic hydrogen, and the prospectivity map certainly shows Michigan in the darkest blues for prospectivity,"" said Adam Wygant, director of the Geologic Resources Management Division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.

""Our sense is there is a fair amount of research going on and companies looking at potential in Michigan,"" both for naturally occurring underground pools and for stimulated hydrogen production.

State officials are encouraging any companies doing geologic testing to include hydrogen in their tests, to better learn where it's found and help zero in on those more costly exploration methods, Wygant said.

Michigan is prepared to regulate any hydrogen production activities through its existing laws, and is monitoring other states where geologic hydrogen exploration is farther along to help identify administrative rules and procedures, he said. The actual extraction process would not be remarkably different from an oil or natural gas well.

""But the hydrogen molecule is a little different from a methane molecule — it’s pesky; it doesn’t like to be contained,"" Wygant said.

""There are specialty products that would be used in well construction, in cements, in surface infrastructure, to properly maintain it.""

Finding the recipe for reproducing hydrogen underground

Multiple avenues of geologic hydrogen research are under pursuit at Sandia National Laboratories, a federally owned facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, operated by a subsidiary of Honeywell International that works on advancing science on energy, national security and other issues.

The lab is participating in a research project experimenting with certain rock types and characterizing how much hydrogen they produce under different conditions, the keys to producing stimulated hydrogen.

""They're doing microbes, catalysts, different chemicals, steam, working at different temperatures,"" said Sandia geologist Franek Hasiuk. ""Right now, the race is to find the right recipe, and there have been early positive results with some of these techniques.""

""We can either do those chemical reactions down in a well deep underground, or we can even do it at a mine, and it's actually a way we could use old mine tailings and mine waste to produce new energy and new revenue streams that can help clean up those mine wastes.""

Sandia is also funding an internal research and development project on the molecular and atomic processes involved in geologic production of hydrogen.

""There is a long way to go; there is still a lot to discover,"" said Donald Conley, acting senior manager of the Geosciences Research and Applications Group at Sandia.

""We are guiding the conversation to what's next for geologic hydrogen. Once we find all these discoveries, how do we make it a viable part of the U.S. energy economy?""

An accidental find helps an African village meet its power needs

Workers drilling a water well in the village of Bourakėbougou in the African nation of Mali in 1987 accidentally hit a vein of geologic hydrogen — a discovery confirmed after a worker lit a cigarette and the gas exploded. The well hole was capped with cement for safety reasons and forgotten until 2012, when Hydroma, a company based in Canada, began a pilot project combusting the hydrogen from the well to produce electricity for the village.

""For more than 7 years, the village of Bourakébougou benefited from free electricity without CO₂ emissions,"" the company states on its website. The company has since proven the existence of other nearby pools of geologic hydrogen, has expanded its footprint in other parts of Africa, and has opened a U.S. division.

A reservoir of geologic hydrogen discovered at an abandoned chromium mine in Albania, and reserves discovered in France's Lorraine region, have also sparked development interest.

While geologic hydrogen discoveries and their benefits may be at first localized, that's not a new story, Hasiuk said.

""When the oil and gas industry started, it was also just like that, very localized pockets where you had oil seeping out of the ground,"" he said. ""In one place, they would use it to line the outside of ships to make them waterproof, or they'd use it in making patent medicines and things like that. It was really when we started moving from collecting it from places where it seeped out of the ground to drilling nearby that we were able to unlock these larger volumes.""

Drilling is very expensive, and companies today generally do it only when they have really good information, he said.

'So until we see more exploration successes (with geologic hydrogen) it's going to be a very small process. But just like with the start of the oil industry, once people started being very successful, then the exploration activities spread rapidly across the country and across the world.""

The cautions and tempered expectations are repeatedly cited, but the excitement about geologic hydrogen's possibilities is undeniable.

""If we can prove this concept and reproducibly find natural hydrogen, it will be a game-changer,"" Ballentine said. ""It will potentially provide a transition of green energy from wind, from solar to a hydrogen economy.""

Losing federal solar credits “would devastate the solar industry” in Michigan, said O’Shea, the president of CBS Solar.
“Lynda and I and our 25 employees plead with you to leave the solar tax credits intact,” he wrote (Lynda is his wife).

O’Shea, who runs his company along with his wife and sons, has been selling solar panels since the 1990s.

He’s witnessed the growing popularity of rooftop solar in the state, which accounted for 19 percent of the state’s total solar power in 2023. Across the nation, residential solar has continually set records for new installations, growing every year for the past five years.

Progress for solar in the United States was kicked into high gear by record-high tax credits for renewable energy, implemented in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Now, the federal budget reconciliation bill, officially titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” threatens to halt that progress.

In its current draft form, the bill proposes ending the residential clean energy tax credit, which allows residents to get 30 percent off the cost of new clean energy projects, like solar panels, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage. It would also end a 30 percent tax credit for companies that lease solar panels to homes and businesses. The bill has already left the House, where it passed by one vote, and is currently being debated in the Senate.

I’m focusing on Michigan because it’s a place that has stood out for the pace of growth in its renewable energy economy.

Since 2022, new clean energy projects there have garnered $27.84 billion in investments and created 26,352 jobs. There have been more new clean energy projects launched in Michigan than any other state, according to a report from Climate Power. Nearly 40 percent of those are in Republican-held congressional districts.

Losing federal solar credits “would devastate the solar industry” in Michigan, said O’Shea, the president of CBS Solar. When we talked on the phone this week, he was in the middle of sending letters to his representatives in Congress, asking them to oppose the federal cuts. “Lynda and I and our 25 employees plead with you to leave the solar tax credits intact,” he wrote (Lynda is his wife). “The effort by the House to balance the budget on the backs of more than 3,000 Michigan solar employees is ill advised and wrong.”

For customers looking to save money on their energy bills, the federal clean energy tax credit has been a key incentive bringing them to CBS Solar. O’Shea said losing the clean energy tax credit would double the amount of time it will take his customers to recoup the costs of installing solar panels, from around 10 years to 20.

It could also make it difficult, or even impossible, for his business to continue. Part of what would make it so challenging is how quickly the change would happen; cuts would go into effect immediately after the bill passes. On the other hand, the 30 percent tax credit for commercial and utility-scale projects is set to stay in place until 2029.

If residential solar tax credits were reduced over the same timeline, O’Shea said it would give his business and other small solar companies a better chance of surviving.

“You’re just talking about pulling the rug out from the solar residential industry,” he said. That will have a direct impact on how many people he can employ. “These are good jobs created for many people that don’t have a college degree. They’re paying their taxes, they’re hard working Americans all over rural America. It would be really a shame to have that loss.”

A majority of job losses from losing the clean energy tax credit will be in states won by President Trump in 2024, according to an analysis by the Solar Energy Industry Association. SEIA calculates that removing solar tax incentives would result in 330,000 jobs lost across the country, 331 factories closed or cancelled and nearly $300 billion in local investments erased.

Policy changes since Trump’s election have already brought challenges to the solar industry. In 2024, more than 100 solar contractors went bankrupt. On June 6, Solar Mosaic, a California-based company that offers loans for solar projects, filed for bankruptcy. Just a few days later, Sunnova Energy, a leading U.S. residential solar installer, followed suit.

O’Shea is getting questions from customers, asking: “Is this really going to happen? Can you fit me in before the end of the year? Why is this happening?”

Under the bill’s current language, if they are able to start construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage and are online by 2028, they’ll still qualify for credits. But O’Shea expects that such a short timeframe will make it hard in particular for churches, schools and nonprofits to get organized in time. “There’s a whole lot of good people out there who are going to lose the opportunity,” he said.

While these cuts would certainly make renewables more expensive, “it’s also very likely that things the Trump administration are doing will make non-renewable power generation more expensive too,” said Douglas Jester, managing partner at 5 Lakes Energy, where he advises clean energy trade associations.

Tariffs on imported parts for natural gas plants, for example, could raise energy prices. “I do think we’ll still see growth in solar in Michigan, but it might not grow as fast,” he said.

Fate of Energy Tax Credits Falls to Republican Senators: Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits that would benefit Republican districts will disappear if the Senate passes the bill in its current form. Multiple Republican senators have said they want major changes to the bill, while others have vowed to vote against it if any clean energy subsidies are preserved, as Arianna Skibell reports for Politico. The Senate can only afford to lose three votes.

Sunnova and Mosaic Bankruptcies Are Part of a Bigger Story of Challenges for Rooftop Solar: Federal cuts to clean energy tax credits are only the latest threat to residential solar companies. High interest rates, plus policy changes in California—the country’s largest rooftop solar market—have all made operations much more expensive in recent years. But Sunnova and Mosaic also made poor business decisions, taking on serious debt that made them particularly vulnerable to collapse, reports Jeff St. John for Canary Media. Experts say it’s still too early to say what these bankruptcies mean for the industry at large.

Now, the company wants to terminate the project, reports Amanda Oglesby for Asbury Park Press. In January, President Trump halted all wind projects. Soon after, the EPA pulled an air permit granted to Atlantic Shores in 2024, forcing the company to end contracts and cancel planned investments.

From Maryland Matters

Martyland is one of the states that adopted the California standards, which would have required electric vehicles to account for 43% of new cars sold in the state by 2027, growing annually until they made up 100% in model year 2028. The state was lagging behind in the move to hithomopidiitveseventually reaching 100% by the 2035 model year.

President Donald Trump signed a Congressional Review Act resolution Thursday that revokes California’s authority to set tailpipe emissions standards, upending policy in California and 17 other states that tie their standards to that of the Golden State.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Democratic attorneys general in 10 other states immediately sued to block enforcement of the law. Through a process that allows Congress to undo recent executive branch rules, the law repeals a U.S. Environmental Protection Act waiver allowing California to set a schedule for emissions standards for cars and trucks.

Trump signed two other resolutions that repeal the state’s authority to ban sales of new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035 and to regulate emissions on heavy trucks.

At a White House signing ceremony, Trump said the law would allow greater consumer choice and lead to less expensive vehicles.

“Your cars are going to cost you $3,000, $4,000 less and you’re going to have what you want,” he said. “Again, you can get any car you want.”

Simple majority vote

The procedure used to pass the law was controversial because of the use of the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, which allows a simple majority vote in the U.S. Senate instead of the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold.

Both the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the EPA waiver was not a rule and that the CRA could not be used. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune used the procedure anyway, and the measure passed 51-46.

The states suing over the law argued that process was illegal, saying that the CRA was “deemed inapplicable by every nonpartisan arbiter and expert who analyzed the question.”

“While all fifty States consented—through their Senators—to these expedited procedures for congressional disapproval of federal rules, no State consented to the CRA as a means for Congress to negate state rules,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote. “Nor would any State have done so.”

The states joining California in the lawsuit are Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Vermont and Washington.

Clean Air Act

The federal Clean Air Act of 1970 generally prohibits states from setting their own air quality standards. But a section of the bedrock environmental law allows California, which had stringent environmental standards at the time the federal law was passed, to set its own standards.

While the other 49 states may not set their own standards, any state can adopt California’s standards as its own.

That means the law Trump signed Thursday has effects far beyond California’s borders, which the president noted.

“The federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry, all over the country, all over the world, actually,” he said.

The law, which both chambers of Congress passed last month, applies to 17 states that follow California standards. In addition to those suing, those states are Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia.",https://southernmarylandchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trump-and-lawmakers-1536x800-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:09:14.344595

The government has confirmed that the spending review allocated landmark new funding to create hydrogen infrastructure, including the first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, and connecting hydrogen producers with vital end-users, such as power stations and industry, for the first time.

This major infrastructure boost will help deliver clean energy while creating thousands of skilled jobs in industrial regions such as Merseyside, Teesside and the Humber, as well as in the supply chain.

This will ensure communities across the country feel the benefits of Britain’s renewal while reducing reliance on volatile international fossil fuel markets.

Benefits of clean energy jobs for the economy

Today’s announcement also follows confirmation in the Spending Review that the government is creating thousands of clean energy jobs nationwide.

10,000 jobs will be created at Sizewell C in Suffolk, a new fusion reactor to be built on the site of an old power station in Nottinghamshire.

Additionally, up to 3,000 jobs are expected to be created through the small modular reactor programme. Funding is also being allocated to kickstart the Acorn project in Scotland and the Viking project in the Humber.

This will support manufacturing sectors that are likely to require hydrogen infrastructure, such as iron, steel, glass, chemicals, and ceramics, forming part of the government’s long-term plan to invest in and secure the country’s industrial future.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “We are investing over half a billion pounds in our industrial heartlands to deliver jobs and energy security for Britain.

“By building hydrogen networks, we are securing homegrown energy that will power British industry for generations to come.”

The unique role of hydrogen infrastructure in the UK’s energy system

The funding will unlock the unique role of hydrogen infrastructure in Britain’s energy system, where it can decarbonise industrial sectors including refineries and heavy transport, while providing long-term energy storage that can be deployed during peak demand periods.

The funding also enables progress in supporting low-carbon hydrogen production through continued Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), building on the success of the First Hydrogen Allocation Round, which saw 11 projects allocated over £2bn in government funding.

“Hydrogen networks are essential for a secure and resilient hydrogen sector, whilst ensuring sufficient energy storage capacity will be critical to energy security and affordability during the energy transition,” explained Brett Ryan, Head of Policy and Analysis at Hydrogen UK.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, added: “By investing in transport and storage infrastructure, the government is rightly joining the dots, connecting already supported hydrogen production with end users across power and industry.”

Hydrogen infrastructure has already attracted £400m of private sector investment in towns and cities such as Milford Haven in Wales and High Marnham in Nottinghamshire.

California files multi-state lawsuit following President Trump’s quashing of the state’s envi...

California files multi-state lawsuit following President Trump’s quashing of the state’s environmentally friendly auto-emissions rules.

The State of California has launched a fresh legal broadside against the US administration, filing a claim late on Thursday 12 June in the US District Court for the Northern District of California in a bid to overturn last-minute federal moves that strip the state of its authority to police vehicle emissions. Joined by ten other Democratic-leaning states – including New York, New Jersey, Colorado, Massachusetts and Washington – the claimants are asking the court to declare unlawful three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions that President Trump signed only hours earlier. Those resolutions extinguish Environmental Protection Agency waivers granted in 2022 and 2023 that underpin California’s plan to phase out sales of new petrol-only cars by 2035, impose stricter low-nitrogen-oxide limits on heavy-duty engines and require a rapid roll-out of zero-emission lorries.

ALL-OUT ASSAULT

At the White House, the president heralded the repeal as salvation for motorists and manufacturers alike. “We officially rescue the US auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric-vehicle (EV) mandate once and for all,” he declared, accusing Sacramento of “lunatic” climate policies that would make cars unaffordable. Governor Gavin Newsom replied that the president’s action was emblematic of “Trump’s all-out assault on California” and would “destroy our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process”. California Attorney-General Rob Bonta, who signed the 73-page complaint, said Congress had “no constitutional warrant” to meddle with waivers that for decades have been treated as executive, not legislative, instruments.

The lawsuit leans heavily on advice issued in March by the non-partisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian (a neutral referee on matters of procedure), both of whom warned that the CRA cannot be used to nullify waivers awarded under the Clean Air Act. The claim argues that lawmakers “carried out an illegal playbook designed to evade notice-and-comment protections” and thereby sweep away rules that promise to cut exhaust emissions by 80% within a decade. The claimant states are therefore seeking an immediate injunction to reinstate the 2035 mandate, pointing out that more than a dozen states already follow California’s standards and had begun adjusting compliance plans.

Federal regulators were unmoved. “This is nothing more than California throwing a temper tantrum because the American people don’t want the state’s terrible policies,” said EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou in a statement. Automotive manufacturers were equally blunt, with the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, whose members include General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen, praising the repeal as a “necessary reset”, and chief executive John Bozzella insisting Mr Trump had “stood up for customer choice and helped restore a degree of balance to US emissions regulations.”

EV TAX CREDITS BINNED

While the legal wrangling unfolds, a wider policy pivot is taking shape on Capitol Hill. The House of Representatives has already approved separate legislation that would scrap the federal USD 7,500 EV tax credit, introduce a USD 250 annual road-user fee for EVs and dilute corporate fuel-economy penalties; a companion Bill is pending in the Senate. Several analysts have warned that the twin assault on incentives and state standards could depress zero-emission uptake nationwide just as China and the EU pull ahead in clean-tech investment.

California hopes to secure a preliminary injunction before the summer recess, arguing that every month of regulatory uncertainty corrodes supply-chain planning. Whatever the initial outcome, most observers expect the fight to rise quickly to the Ninth Circuit and perhaps the Supreme Court, setting up a heavyweight clash over whether states may lead on climate policy when federal priorities change. An undeterred Mr Newsom has already ordered the California Air Resources Board to draft contingency rules that could be triggered if the courts deliver an unfavourable ruling.

ONGOING CONFLICT

The EV dispute is only the most recent front to have opened up in a year of legal trench warfare between Sacramento and Washington. Mr Newsom and Mr Bonta have already sued the administration over its sudden mobilisation of National Guard troops and US Marines to Los Angeles during the ongoing immigration protests, with US District Judge Charles Breyer granting a temporary order to return command to the governor, though an appeals court has since issued a stay.

Still with immigration, in February San Francisco and 15 other “sanctuary” jurisdictions went to court to block an executive order that threatened to cut off federal funding unless local police assisted immigration agents. Last month US District Judge William Orrick agreed, ruling that the order would cause “irreparable injury” by imposing conditions that Congress never authorised.

California also leads a 16-state coalition challenging the Transport Department’s decision to freeze more than USD 3 billion in National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure grants.

Taken together, the barrage of litigation underlines Mr Newsom’s readiness to wield the courts as a shield against policy reversals emanating from Washington. Whether the subject is clean air, public safety or immigration, California’s message is consistent: it will fight to preserve the progressive architecture it built over the past decade – and, in doing so, test the bounds of US federalism.",https://iclg.com/uploads/pages/images/the-war-between-california-and-the-white-house-opens-a-new-front_0_124Xmu2tp9FnwQOoBGWY1YNsc8gaiy4nuwTAsEH8.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:01:56.549472

""Thanks to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), you can have more precise information on the battery's performance and lifetime and predict if it's overheating, or posing safety concerns,” he says.
To make it simple, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is essentially a technique that allows impedance to be identified without the use of sensors.
As batteries consist of hundreds of cells arranged in series and interconnected, if some of them are damaged or age too quickly, the entire series is affected.
“But while in traditional systems you have a sensor that you just design once and use across different applications, with impedance spectroscopy, the cell itself becomes your sensor.","If you’ve attended “The Battery Show Europe” in Stuttgart, Germany, over the past few days, you may have come across a small demo car with a battery installed under the seat and 14 cells in series. At first glance, nothing extraordinary for Europe’s largest battery technology fair, this year themed “Driving sustainability, resilience and innovation in Europe’s battery industry.” Yet, if you looked a bit closer, you might have noticed a display showing a series of figures. The true innovation of this prototype lies precisely here: the data shown doesn’t just include the battery’s charge level, but also the state of health and temperature of each individual cell, thus promising to enhance safety, lifespan, and sustainability. It’s a “battery management system” (BMS), the electronic brain that controls the battery, which its developers have named zBMS. Its novelty lies in the “z” that precedes the traditional acronym. “For the industry and the scientific community, Z stands for the impedance,” explains Andreas Hutter, Leader of the Battery Systems group at the Swiss technology transfer center CSEM. To illustrate what that means, Hutter uses the image of an amount of water being pushed through a pipe: “The water flowing through the pipe represents an electric current, and the pressure pushing the water represents the voltage. Impedance in an electrical circuit is like the resistance to the flow of water in the pipe. If the diameter becomes smaller, the resistance to current flow increases. Similarly, in electrical terms, increased impedance reduces the amount of current that can flow.” In lithium-ion batteries, the current is essentially generated by electrons flowing between an anode, a negative electrode, and a cathode, a positive one, with ions moving back and forth to charge and discharge the battery. “It’s kind of a race, but full of hurdles, and any time they bump into an obstacle, some of them risk getting trapped or lost,” notes Hutter. And since every time this happens the battery’s capacity and performance are reduced, the first step toward improvement is to identify those obstacles. “Compared to today's practices, we measure this impedance at different frequencies, through a non-invasive technique called ‘impedance spectroscopy’ that allows us to make these obstacles visible, without opening the battery,” he adds.

Md Sazzad Hosen, Part-time Professor and Senior Battery Researcher at the Free University of Brussels (VUB), also coordinates NEMO, the European consortium behind the development of the zBMS. ""Thanks to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), you can have more precise information on the battery's performance and lifetime and predict if it's overheating, or posing safety concerns,” he says. To make it simple, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is essentially a technique that allows impedance to be identified without the use of sensors. “The first advantage is that you don’t need additional hardware,” says Jan Philipp Schmidt, Professor for Systems Engineering of Electrical Energy Storage Systems at the University of Bayreuth. “Adding a sensor inside a cell is already quite complex. Then, when it comes to temperature, for instance, sensors only measure it at a single point, whereas with impedance spectroscopy you can determine the temperature of the entire battery.”

One of the main benefits of applying this technique, according to the zBMS developers, is that it ensures good performance even in the case of some internal failures. As batteries consist of hundreds of cells arranged in series and interconnected, if some of them are damaged or age too quickly, the entire series is affected. “If in a battery module there are 15 cells, and two of them get damaged, the individual status check via impedance measurement and the cell management system will allow us to bypass them and rely on the remaining 13,” Hosen explains. “And this will ensure safe and reliable operation.” This is what experts call “balancing.” This process enables two things, clarifies Hutter: “First, we prolong the lifetime of the entire system by keeping all cells at the same health status and, second, we can use the hardware to spot and skip failing cells.”

Schmidt emphasises that further research is now crucial, but other barriers still hinder the widespread adoption of impedance-based battery management systems. “The technology is advancing very fast, and that’s good news,” he says. “But while in traditional systems you have a sensor that you just design once and use across different applications, with impedance spectroscopy, the cell itself becomes your sensor. This means that, yes, you can gather much richer and more detailed data, but also that every time a new generation of higher-performing cells is introduced, all this information needs to be validated from scratch.”",https://www.youris.com/pubimg/2196251/0/0/immagine_2_550x400.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:02:02.528014

‘Enlightened self-interest’ must drive clean energy sector

“Fifteen years ago, we didn’t have deliberate planning for the platinum industry. We exported the raw materials, imported high value-added products, and lost jobs, capacity and economic opportunity.

“Now, we have the chance to change that with renewable energy… but only through industrial democracy that involves workers, communities, business and government,” said Ehrenreich.

He warned that socio-economic transformation cannot be left to chance or to market forces.

“We can’t continue with the same economic players who dominated before 1994. There must be a deliberate plan for transformation… not as charity, but as enlightened self-interest,” he said.

South Africa must address socio-economic fault lines

Ehrenreich noted that failure to address inequality in South Africa could lead to social and economic instability. “We’ve already seen what happened in the mining sector when unrest broke out. It shut down the economy. If we don’t get this right, the same could happen again.”

He also cautioned against focusing solely on export markets while neglecting domestic demand, pointing out that widespread poverty remains a key constraint.

“Forty percent of people in our country don’t have enough food in their stomachs. If people have no disposable income, there’s no demand for electricity, fridges, or stoves… and no driver for industrial growth,” he said.

Ehrenreich called for greater oversight of public funding in the green economy to prevent elite capture, pointing to corruption in sectors like steel, bread and construction.

“Public funds must deliver public benefit. That means a different approach, not one where we simply follow industry’s lead.”

Why skills development is crucial for clean energy sector in South Africa

Candice Moodley, Corporate Services Executive at the Energy and Water Sector Education and Training Authority (EWSETA) emphasised that skills development must be prioritised if South Africa is to build a competitive and equitable renewable energy economy.

“The South African Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM) is a critical blueprint for localisation, economic growth and inclusive participation. But at the heart of it must be the localisation of skills.

“A just transition means no one is left behind.. especially historically marginalised groups like women and youth.”

She noted that public training institutions, particularly TVET colleges, are currently ill-equipped to meet the pace of the energy transition.

“Our colleges lack the capacity to train learners in emerging technologies because lecturers themselves haven’t been exposed to them. The green hydrogen economy gives us a chance to change that… to be agile and responsive.”

Programmes aim to fill the skills gap in South Africa

However, Moodley highlighted recent progress, including the launch of the Green Hydrogen Skills Framework by the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET), which maps out skills needed across the hydrogen value chain – from production to transport and storage.

EWSETA is currently developing full qualifications focused on fuel cells, solar PV installation, battery storage, and micro-grid management, as well as career pathways from artisan to professional engineer in the hydrogen economy.

Moodley also announced the launch of the Global Green Hydrogen Mentorship Platform, in collaboration with the Department of Higher Education and Training and the Department of Science and Innovation. The platform will connect South African trainees with international experts to build skills and share best practices.

“This is exactly what our market needs. A place where mentors and mentees can connect and help drive the sector forward,” she said.

Clean energy masterplan’s localisation of skills focus

Samantha Graham-Maré, South Africa’s Deputy Minister of Electricity and Energy also stressed the importance of skills to service the renewable energy sector.

“We can’t talk about localisation if our wind turbines have to be repaired overseas, or if we have to wait months for imported components to get our goods back online,” she said.

From certified technicians to regional spares hubs and mobile diagnostics teams, Graham-Maré said the services and maintenance industry was essential not only to reliability but to job creation.

“These are jobs that can’t be outsourced. You can’t fly someone in from abroad to come and service a wind turbine in the Karoo. We need people locally.”

South Africa, she noted, already has companies doing this work. “What they need now is volume… a consistent project pipeline to justify investment in facilities, staff and training. SAREM gives them that confidence.”

Local manufacturing of green hydrogen infrastructure – from electrolysers to fuel cells – should be supported by SAREM, not as a niche activity but “as the norm.”

“All of this, from renewables to storage to hydrogen, depends on one thing: people. Infrastructure doesn’t build itself. Markets don’t train artisans. Skills don’t emerge by accident.”

Building strong supply chains in South Africa

Janek Winand, South African Wind Energy Association (SAWEA) Board Member said skills development is a critical area.

“Yes, the REIPPPP (Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme) may not have delivered on all its original promises, but it has still created a significant number of jobs. The industry is growing so fast that companies are competing for the same skilled individuals.”

“Even if some main components weren’t originally manufactured in South Africa, there is now a surge in demand for spare parts and services.

“That’s where real job creation is happening. We are seeing local SMEs thriving, building strong supply chains, and creating thousands of jobs. South Africa is proving to be competitive in many areas… and time is of the essence,” said Winand.

Renewable energy sector as a key skills, jobs driver in South Africa

Rethabile Melamu, the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA) CEO, said the organisation believes the sector has immense potential to create jobs through industrialisation in the renewable energy value chain.

“Initially, I think we were solving for an energy security challenge without comprehensively considering the other socio-economic benefits that renewable energy technologies can offer.

“We have contributed. I don’t believe that the jobs created so far have been unsustainable. On the contrary, the greatest number of jobs have come from the deployment of renewable energy technologies.”

Melamu said South Africa needs to “industrialise not just for our own local market, but also for export.”

Drilling would jeopardize one of the world’s last unspoiled places at a time when we should be shifting to alternative clean energy to reduce the effects of global climate change (and help Iowa’s economy).

It is disappointing that both of Iowa’s Senators support opening the refuge to drilling. One of their reasons is that oil drilling would affect only about 2,000 acres of the coastal plain, but this is not correct. Activities would not be restricted to one block. Drilling and connecting infrastructure would extend to every corner of the refuge, impacting the entire coastal plain that has been called “America’s Serengeti” because of the large herds of caribou and other wildlife that use the area.

It has also been stated that new drilling techniques would lessen impacts. These techniques should be tried first in the parts of the nearby National Petroleum Reserve where oil drilling is already allowed to determine if they work before they are used in the fragile coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

A better approach would be to expand the development of alternative energy, of which Iowa is already a national leader.

Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies that curb tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.
Jared Polis has said he wants more than 2 million electric cars and trucks on the roads by 2035.
Electric vehicles made up 25.3% of new vehicles sold in the state in the third quarter of 2024, placing Colorado ahead of California in EV sales.
Other states were allowed to adopt California’s standards as an alternative to those outlined in the Clean Air Act.","When President Donald Trump on Thursday blocked California’s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, he also stopped Colorado’s requirement that 80% of all vehicle sales in this state be electric by 2032.

Colorado, which had adopted California’s rules two years ago, quickly joined California and nine other states in a lawsuit to challenge the move.

Trump signed a resolution that was approved by Congress last month that aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars, which create 80% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the country. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies that curb tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

“The Trump administration’s attack on clean air is breathtaking,” Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a news release announcing the lawsuit. “We’re in court to defend Colorado’s cost-effective clean car program, which was implemented to improve air quality, reduce harmful ozone pollution, and increase choices that Coloradans have when purchasing an electric vehicle.”

The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission partially adopted California’s rules in 2023, which was allowed under the Environmental Protection Agency’s regulations.

In Colorado, the clean cars standards would have required auto manufacturers to make and sell more electric vehicles starting with model year 2027 and increasing each year until 2032, when 82% of all vehicles sold in the state were to be electric. The standard also required new conventional cars and passenger trucks to lower tailpipe emissions.

Colorado’s adoption of California’s Advanced Clean Truck standards also required medium- and heavy-duty truck manufacturers to sell an increasing percentage of zero-emission vehicles starting in 2027.

Colorado also adopted California’s Heavy-Duty Low Nitrogen Oxides rule requiring heavy-duty truck manufacturers to make cleaner heavy-duty trucks for sale or lease in this state starting in 2027.

Colorado’s clean cars rule was not as stringent as California’s because it did not block all sales of gas-powered vehicles.

Still, the state is pushing zero-emission vehicles as it strives to eliminate almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Gov. Jared Polis has said he wants more than 2 million electric cars and trucks on the roads by 2035.

But Colorado will not be able to enforce its rules if the California standards are blocked by the president.

Transportation is the leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions, and cars and trucks account for 80% of those transportation emissions. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide build up in the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing global warming. Those rising temperatures are responsible for droughts, hotter summers and more intense wildfires in Colorado.

The pollution also creates ground-level ozone when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds — emissions from vehicles — bake in the heat and form a brown smog over the Front Range. That ozone pollution is an ongoing challenge for the Front Range, which is in severe violation of federal air quality standards. It also makes people sick.

Electric cars have proven to be popular in Colorado.

Electric vehicles made up 25.3% of new vehicles sold in the state in the third quarter of 2024, placing Colorado ahead of California in EV sales. The state has also been investing in infrastructure to support the rising popularity.

The Republican rollback of California’s rules, the proposed elimination of federal tax credits for EV purchases, and tariffs on automakers throw chaos into the auto market and environmental efforts, Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, said last month in an interview with The Denver Post.

“There are a lot of wild cards out there,” Toor said. “It’s pretty upsetting to see a federal government that is trying to increase costs to consumers and seems very excited about creating economic disruption and chaos.”

Trump’s signing of the resolutions comes as he has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity said the signing of the resolutions was “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government. Other states were allowed to adopt California’s standards as an alternative to those outlined in the Clean Air Act.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

And it’s the use of that Congressional Review Act that California, Colorado and other states are challenging in the lawsuit.

There is a lot of wait-and-see going on.” Santos will participate in a panel discussion at ModuleTech exploring how the evolving policy landscape in the US is impacting PV module procurement and due diligence.
“Tariffs are affecting all importers and really all producers in the United States because they still rely on imported goods,” she says.
Santos says the situation is considerably worse than in the first Trump term, when there was a certain predictability about policy direction.","“There’s a chilling effect for every segment of the supply chain,” says attorney Angela Santos, partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff, of the current tariff situation. “Developers are a little bit wary of investing huge funds in new developments, and that trickles down to the producers, which trickles down to their supply chain. There is a lot of wait-and-see going on.”

Santos will participate in a panel discussion at ModuleTech exploring how the evolving policy landscape in the US is impacting PV module procurement and due diligence. As counsel to firms throughout the solar supply chain, she has seen firsthand how President Donald Trump’s global trade tariffs have reverberated through the industry, creating huge uncertainty and a legal minefield for anyone seeking to import equipment.

“Tariffs are affecting all importers and really all producers in the United States because they still rely on imported goods,” she says. “The tariff rates keep changing, and there’s a lot of uncertainty in terms of whether these tariffs will remain, because there are a number of court cases pending right now to invalidate the tariffs or limit their scope.”

Unsurprisingly, Santos and her trade team are busy providing advice to companies up and down the supply chain on the likely impacts of tariffs on their operations: “What’s that going to mean in terms of supply chain? What’s that going to mean in terms of costs? And is there anything that companies can do to mitigate the effects of these tariffs?”

But given the unpredictable nature of the situation and the Trump administration’s propensity to change tariffs at a moment’s notice, this is an understandably challenging task. Santos says the situation is considerably worse than in the first Trump term, when there was a certain predictability about policy direction.

“The difficult part now is that nobody knows what’s going to happen, and it could change at any time,” she says. “Even within the administration, you receive conflicting information. What is true today might not be true tomorrow or in two hours. Nothing’s final until it’s final, and even when it’s final, it could change.”

The advice Santos is giving her clients varies from case to case, depending on the particular company and its activities, but typically involves measures such as escalation clauses in contracts in case tariffs suddenly change and render business cases invalid, and developing tariff mitigation strategies to help firms reduce their tariff liabilities. Now, more than ever, Santos says companies need to be prepared for a range of eventualities, given the unpredictability of the trading environment:

“Companies need to really stay on top of all the developments because they’re so fast changing and there’s very little notice provided before they’re implemented. They need to have possibly some inventory on hand because rates could go up overnight. They just have to have strategic planning [in place] to ensure that they can weather these challenges.”

Tax credits on the line

The second major source of worry for the industry is the fate of the various tax credits laid out in the Inflation Reduction Act. These have been an undoubted success, sparking a prolonged boom in project deployment and, as intended, stimulating domestic PV manufacturing.

Even now, that boom is continuing, with the latest figures from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) showing the first quarter of 2025 to be strong both in terms of project deployments and new manufacturing capacity. In the early days of the second Trump term, the industry seemed fairly sanguine about the fate of the IRA, maintaining that its success in creating jobs in Republican-voting areas guaranteed its safety. So it was with some shock that the first draft of Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax reconciliation bill, approved by the House a few weeks ago, went much further than some had feared in outlining proposals to roll back many of the tax credits that have been the industry’s lifeline in recent years.

According to Tom Beline, a partner at law firm Cassidy Levy Kent, who will take part in the same ModuleTech panel discussion as Santos, the immediate response among the US solar industry to the House approval of the bill has been one of anxiety.

“There’s a real possibility that there’s a lack of being able to carry on; that anxiety is palpable,” Beline says. “I don’t think it’s causing any adjustments in the supply chain exactly, but I do feel that people are anxious and that they just want to know: are they alive, or are they dead?”

Having said that, Beline seems reasonably optimistic that the significant amount of political horse-trading that the bill will undergo as it now passes through the Senate could work in favour of the tax credit regime. In particular, he highlights differences of opinion between the House and Senate Republicans over state and local tax (so-called Salt) deductions, which are supported in the House but not in the Senate.

Trump is reportedly not keen to cut these entitlements, as Senate Republicans want, but has indicated that he will consider waste, fraud and abuse in entitlements as a way to find more money, potentially freeing up funds to continue industrial subsidies, which are fundamentally in line with his desire for more domestic manufacturing.

“If that’s the case, and if that’s the sort of direction things are going, I can see a situation where we actually have this big, beautiful bill that does the type of industrial policy that this president wants across the board, including in the renewables space,” says Beline.

This, of course, comes with the heavy caveat that nothing renewables-related should be considered safe under an administration that is ideologically opposed to clean energy. But Beline adds: “This President is different from past Republican presidents, in that he believes in industrial policy, and I think he’s convinced that industrial policy not only needs tariffs, but it needs support from the government to stimulate production activities.

This is particularly the case in the context of recent revelations that possible spying devices have been found in Chinese-made solar inverters. “If these things that came out recently about Chinese kill switches in certain renewables projects [are] corroborated and that gets more play for [Trump], I suspect that that’s going to result in a drive towards creating an environment where you can have a truly domestic manufacturing operation,” Beline says.

Ultimately, the misfortune of the current situation facing the US solar industry is that it is yet another manifestation of the infamous “solar coaster” that has been a defining characteristic almost since its inception. As such, Beline says, this situation does no one any favours long term:

“The unfortunate thing in the solar industry that’s existed for, you know, a decade, is that every time you feel like you’ve got certainty of some form or another, whether it be tariff policy or government industrial policy, it feels to me like you lurch forward for a couple of years and they everything is proverbially pulled out from under you and you’re starting almost all over again.

BOULDER, Colo. — Proponents of a growing movement in the construction industry are asking: Why tear down old buildings with wrecking balls when those materials can be mined for reusable materials?

The practice, called deconstruction, creates a circular economy of reuse for building materials. It keeps waste out of landfills and shrinks the carbon footprint of buildings and infrastructure. It's the kind of idea that sounds like an obvious win-win. But as the built environment rapidly changes over from one generation to the next, communities may not yet have the infrastructure — the sorting facilities and reuse stores — to keep up with new demand.

Deconstruction and reuse industries have taken flight in the past five to 10 years in cities like Portland, Ore., and Boulder, Colo., where much of the original aging housing stock is now being replaced to suit the tastes of a much wealthier 21st-century population. As old homes come down to make way for new ones, specialist contractors like Anna Perks are moving in to handle the materials left behind.

""Our team is systematically unbuilding the structure,"" said Perks, co-owner of Perks Deconstruction, a contracting company that disassembles buildings for parts. She was hired to make a snug three-bedroom, two-bath home near the top of a green, hilly street in Boulder disappear.

Her crew worked quickly. After the first day on-site, the roof of the house disappeared. The siding, too. A crew wielding hammers and crowbars pried pieces of wood sheathing off the studs and carefully sorted materials. Others clawed nails out of two-by-sixes in the backyard.

""We've got a pretty good pile of lumber,"" she said. ""That's all ceiling joists and floor joists. There's a lot of good reusable lumber in there.""

The workers were trained to work precisely and with patience to keep the lumber as intact as possible as they removed it from the house.

""Typically, what happens is a bulldozer will come in, smash it all — it'll all get trashed,"" Perks said. ""But deconstruction, we try to salvage and recycle as much as possible.""

The carbon emissions embodied in buildings

The idea is to limit the climate impact of our built environment, which accounts for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. About half of that comes from the embodied carbon of construction materials, according to Michelle Lambert, the policy and engagement manager at the nonprofit Carbon Leadership Forum.

""Embodied carbon is the greenhouse gas emissions that are generated by the manufacturing, the transportation, the installation, all the way through to the disposal of construction materials that are used in buildings or in roads and other infrastructure projects,"" Lambert said.

For a long time, experts have focused on the climate impact of building operations — the energy used to heat, cool and electrify spaces.

""But in the last five, 10 years, we've really started to understand that the materials and the processes that have created those materials are a really significant piece of the whole carbon footprint of buildings as well,"" she said.

The big promise of deconstruction is in creating a circular economy for building materials: harvesting lumber, say, from an old house, rather than a forest.

""Making use of the materials that we have already manufactured is one of the most impactful ways that we can reduce embodied carbon,"" Lambert said. ""Eliminating all of those emissions that would've been required to create new materials.""

The challenges of deconstruction

Chris Fellows, president of Colorado-based development company Resolute Strategies, hired Perks Deconstruction to dismantle a few crumbling farm buildings on a former homestead he's now building out as a mixed-use residential neighborhood in Aurora. In his brief for the project, he included reusing as many of the original materials as possible on-site.

Bricks from the farmhouse and siding from the barn have been set aside in containers. They'll be incorporated into a new community center for the neighborhood.

""This was a place where there's cool history and culture in the pioneers and the settlers that came out and did dryland farming,"" Fellows said. ""We're trying to honor that part of that culture and history of Colorado.""

Fellows said he and his partners also liked deconstruction as a way to cut the carbon footprint of the project.

""We wanted to be good stewards of the land in terms of the climate and the environment,"" he said. ""So, to the extent that we could reuse and recycle any materials, we wanted to do that, so we don't have to consume as much new material, nor do we have to take as much stuff to a landfill.""

Just because the interest is there doesn't mean the execution is easy. A successful deconstruction program requires local infrastructure for processing and distributing salvaged materials, not to mention local end markets — people who want to buy and use those materials. Boulder, for instance, has a robust deconstruction ecosystem that includes expert contractors and recycling facilities for concrete, masonry and lumber, not to mention several building-materials reuse stores and donation centers.

But a lot of places don't have those resources.

""We have to have a place to take all this material,"" Perks said. ""It gets really hard for contractors when there's nowhere to take the material.""

The extra cost of deconstruction can also make it a hard sell. Homeowners and developers may be motivated by environmental reasons, but the economic incentives aren't there.

Fellows estimates that deconstruction increased project costs 35% to 40% and added at least a year to the schedule.

""Because we had to stage things carefully and do them in a certain sequence,"" he said. ""And we had to find the right people.""

Even so, Fellows said he's glad they went for it and even thinks he'll see an eventual return on the investment when eco-conscious homebuyers learn about the process.

""We'll have to check back in three to five years. We'll see if we think that's happening,"" he said. ""But I think it was still the right thing to do.""

On the books

A handful of local governments, from Palo Alto, Calif., to Fort Myers, Fla., and counting, now either require some percentage of demolition waste be salvaged, reused or recycled, or incentivize those practices. Portland, where an ordinance has been on the books since 2016, was among the earliest deconstruction pioneers.

In Boulder, more than 140 million pounds of materials have been kept out of landfills since a deconstruction ordinance was adopted in 2020, according to the city of Boulder's circular economy policy adviser, Emily Freeman.

""All residential and commercial buildings are required to be deconstructed,"" Freeman said. ""The ordinance requirements are that 75% or more of those building materials are diverted from landfill.""

So far, the city has overshot that goal. Over the last five years, Freeman said, more than 83% of the construction waste generated in Boulder has been kept out of landfills.

As the movement matures, Perks said, the next frontier in deconstruction would be to plan for disassembly before a building ever got built.

""Can you either incorporate reclaimed materials into the new design, or when you're designing, can you think about what's this going to be like to take it down?"" she said. ""And when it gets taken down, can it be reused?""

Perks says the future of climate-conscious construction will be knowing exactly how you'll take a building apart before you even put it together.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/9170x5160+0+788/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F66%2Fa3%2Ff845debf4d9a85a4b16199912d77%2F20250505-perks-deconstruction-jobsite-0001.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:58:59.083146

Key Market Driver: Accelerated Adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs): A major force behind the global lithium-ion battery market is the rapidly growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs). With heightened focus on reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel dependency, both governments and automakers are prioritizing electrification. Lithium-ion batteries, noted for their high energy density, long lifespan, and declining costs, are now the preferred power source for EVs, including passenger cars, commercial fleets, and two-wheelers. Policy initiatives in countries such as China, the United States, India, Germany, and the UK are significantly accelerating this transition through subsidies, tax incentives, and stricter CO2 standards. For example, the EU's Green Deal and Fit for 55 plan support the phaseout of combustion engines by 2035, while the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act introduces significant tax credits to boost local battery manufacturing and EV purchases.

Key Market Challenge: Supply Chain Constraints and Raw Material Dependency: A critical challenge confronting the global lithium-ion battery market lies in the constrained supply chain and heavy reliance on key raw materials. Essential components like lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite are geographically concentrated, exposing the industry to geopolitical tensions, trade limits, and resource-driven nationalism. Over 70% of cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, a region burdened by political instability and infrastructure issues. Lithium is predominantly sourced from Australia, China, and the South American ""Lithium Triangle"" (Chile, Argentina, Bolivia).

These dependencies make supply disruptions and price volatility significant concerns; lithium prices surged over 400% during 2022-2023, straining procurement and profit margins. Moreover, China controls the majority of global refining capacity-processing over 60% of lithium and nearly 70% of cobalt-raising alarms about excessive reliance on one country. For Western nations striving for supply diversification, this presents a substantial strategic obstacle.

Key Market Trend: Technological Advancements and Evolution of Battery Chemistries: One of the defining trends in the lithium-ion battery industry is the continued evolution of battery chemistries and related technological advancements. As demand intensifies in sectors like EVs, renewable energy systems, and personal electronics, there is an ongoing push to enhance battery performance in terms of energy density, charge speed, safety, longevity, and cost. This has led to increased use of chemistries tailored for specific applications.

Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries are gaining ground in EV and stationary energy storage due to superior safety, longer lifespan, and lower cost when compared to Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) batteries. Automakers including Tesla, BYD, and Ford are deploying LFP batteries in cost-sensitive vehicle models. Meanwhile, nickel-based chemistries like NMC and Nickel Cobalt Aluminum (NCA) remain popular for long-range EVs due to their higher energy density. However, efforts to reduce cobalt use-driven by cost, ethical, and supply issues-have led to innovations like NMC 811 and NMC 532, allowing manufacturers to enhance performance while minimizing reliance on controversial materials.

Toyota’s Princeton, Indiana, manufacturing plant has officially produced its one-millionth hybrid vehicle, a significant achievement in the company’s ongoing commitment to electrification. The milestone vehicle, a 2025 Toyota Sienna Platinum in Wind Chill Pearl, rolled off the assembly line, marked by a flash of its lights and the sound of its horn. This accomplishment highlights the plant’s dedication to producing sustainable and popular vehicles for the North American market.

Key Highlights

Toyota Indiana celebrated the production of its 1-millionth hybrid vehicle, a 2025 Toyota Sienna.

The all-hybrid Sienna, known for its efficiency and dependability, is a top-selling vehicle in Toyota’s lineup.

In May, Sienna sales saw a more than 95 percent increase year-over-year, as electrified vehicle sales accounted for nearly half of Toyota’s total volume.

This milestone aligns with Toyota’s broader goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

A Legacy of Production

The Toyota Sienna has been a staple of the Indiana plant’s production since 2003. Now offered exclusively as a hybrid, the minivan is a testament to Toyota’s focus on next-generation mobility. The vehicle delivers an EPA-estimated 36 combined MPG, providing families with an efficient and reliable option for daily commutes and long-distance travel.

The Sienna’s quality was recently recognized in the 2025 J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study, where it earned the top spot in the minivan segment. “It’s a significant achievement to reach this milestone and something our team members should be proud of,” said Jason Puckett, president of Toyota Indiana. “The all-hybrid Sienna demonstrates our commitment to electrification and remains a top-selling vehicle in Toyota’s lineup.”

Driving Toward a Greener Future

The production of one million hybrids at a single plant is a core component of Toyota’s larger electrification strategy. With electrified vehicles making up a substantial portion of sales, the company is making significant strides toward its environmental goals. Toyota’s portfolio currently features 32 electrified options, the most of any automaker.

To support this growth, Toyota is expanding its manufacturing footprint. In the spring of 2025, the company’s new plant in North Carolina will begin manufacturing automotive batteries for electrified vehicles, further solidifying its commitment to a sustainable future.

Investment in Community and Manufacturing

Since breaking ground in 1996, Toyota Indiana has become a cornerstone of the local economy, representing a total investment of $8 billion. The plant employs 7,650 team members and has contributed more than $54 million to local organizations.

Toyota continues to be a major force in the U.S. automotive industry, directly employing nearly 48,000 people across 11 manufacturing plants.

Epstein, an author and founder of a for-profit think tank that promotes fossil fuels, has been influential in House conservatives’ push to secure deeper cuts to renewable energy subsidies in the Republican megabill, GOP lawmakers said in a recent podcast interview. Epstein is also working to push Senate Republicans to go even further to eliminate incentives for renewables.

His involvement in negotiations over the budget reconciliation package — a massive priority for the GOP and the Trump administration — offers the latest indication of Epstein’s influence on Republican energy policy during the second Trump administration.

His profile has risen over the past decade as the oil industry and the GOP have increasingly latched onto his arguments that fossil fuels are widely beneficial to humanity and the world.

A pair of House Republicans thanked Epstein shortly after the chamber passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which would cut off most clean energy tax breaks for projects that start 60 days after it becomes law.

An earlier draft of the tax provisions, released by the Ways and Means Committee, would have given developers until 2031 to get their projects online. Epstein helped get the legislation to its final version, which included moving up the deadline, as well as other restrictions, the lawmakers said.

“You deserve enormous praise for being engaged in this and being a voice that helped us enormously with logic and reason,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said in an interview on Epstein’s podcast.

That interview, recorded on May 26, described how Epstein and House conservatives worked to shrink the timeline for phasing out renewable energy tax credits from the Biden-era climate law dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act.

Rep. Josh Brecheen (R-Okla.) said during that podcast that he was “grateful” to Epstein for making the case to end wind and solar energy tax credits. The incentives have been a sticking point as congressional Republicans have haggled over how aggressively to claw back funding for projects, including many that benefit red districts.

Epstein said he’s been talking to various groups, including the Republican Study Committee, where he’s made “the case for full termination.” He warned against a phase-out that would allow 10-year subsidies in 2031.

“On Donald Trump’s 95th birthday, he can celebrate with wind subsidies still existing,” Epstein said.

“What I was arguing for very strongly is at minimum, you have to get rid of the new subsidies, and you absolutely have to have them all expire and stop under Trump’s term,” he said.

‘I try to be persuasive’

Epstein told POLITICO’s E&E News that his work around rolling back the tax breaks mainly has been about providing data and other information to lawmakers who ask, such as cost breakdowns of certain paths Congress could take. But he acknowledged that he wants to cut off the subsidies as soon as possible and advocates that position.

“I always just tell all politicians that if you want to do the pro-freedom thing on energy, I’ll help you as much as I can,” he said. “I try to be persuasive. But the persuasiveness is intellectual, and it’s in terms of, basically, the fate of the country.”

Epstein argues that subsidies are harmful to the electric grid because they incentivize intermittent power sources. Renewable energy advocates and moderate Republicans argue the very opposite.

Asked about how influential he’s been in the legislative process, Epstein deferred to Roy and Brecheen.

“I am happy with the help I was able to provide between the Ways and Means proposal and the House ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’” Epstein said of the changes in the legislation. “According to the people who are involved in that, they’ve said publicly that I was very helpful. So I’ll take them at their word there.”

He also thinks he’s helped inoculate Republicans against arguments from renewable energy advocates. “What I’ve found heartening about the process is that at least a lot of politicians know to heavily discount what they’re hearing from lobbyists,” he said.

Prodding the Senate for more cuts

Epstein signaled in the May podcast that he was hoping to help nudge the Senate to go even further than the version of the megabill that cleared the House in late May.

“The House bill only cuts those subsidies for new projects, not existing ones, unfortunately,” Epstein said. “By cutting new solar wind subsidies — the House bill does a lot of good — but the Senate can do far more good if it cuts all of them.”

Epstein’s talking points are also included in a June 9 memo that House conservatives sent to Senate Republicans urging the Senate to “more fully end the Green New Scam.”

That memo encourages the Senate to “significantly strengthen the rollback of IRA subsidies for wind and solar to end during President Trump’s term” and to “terminate all the IRA subsidies.”

“I’m providing very valuable ideas in terms of, how can you save even more than the House did,” Epstein told E&E News of his work lobbying the Senate. “I’m very actively trying to talk to literally any senator who is willing to talk to me about this.”

But he specified that he’s aiming to be transparent with his advocacy. “I have no conversations behind the scenes with anybody that do not reflect exactly what I say in front of the scenes.”

The Senate may be moving in the opposite directions. Senior Republicans have said they expected their tax credit language to be more generous to renewables.

Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) told senators Wednesday he wanted to “extend the runway” for the incentives, according to lawmakers in the room.

Companies and groups are lobbying to protect the credits. The Center for American Progress released a report Thursday saying their loss would hurt the grid because of lost generation.

Why this matters:

Carbon dioxide emissions from power plants are a leading driver of climate change, and the United States plays a central role in both emissions and international efforts to reduce them. When government agencies reject established science, it can weaken global climate action, stall progress on clean energy, and fuel misinformation. Heat-trapping gases from burning coal, oil, and gas intensify extreme weather, raise sea levels, and endanger public health — especially in vulnerable communities. These emissions also contribute to dangerous air pollution, which harms lungs, hearts, and developing children.

McMillon said that given the ""magnitude of the tariffs,"" the retail giant wouldn't be able to protect consumers from higher prices.
The importer can absorb the cost of the tariffs or try to pass the cost on to consumers through higher prices.","(The Center Square) – Consumers could face higher prices under a fresh trade agreement with China that will continue import taxes on goods from the world's second-largest economy.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump praised the deal his trade team reached with representatives from China in London earlier in the week, but the president has yet to release details about the pact.

Clark Packard, a Cato research fellow at the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, said that what is known about the agreement – 55% tariffs on imports from China – won't help U.S. consumers.

""Ultimately, consumers will bear these costs,"" he told The Center Square.

Packard gave strollers as an example. He said about 95% of strollers that U.S. consumers buy are made in China and follow American safety standards.

""That is not a product that's at the nexus of national security,"" he said. ""If we were talking about semiconductors and advanced computing, there's more of a national security nexus, but ultimately, like a lot of products that everyday Americans rely on, that in no way implicate national security, are going to be more expensive in the United States.""

Packard said Trump and other American officials have good reason to be frustrated with China's trade practices, including concerns over economic espionage and intellectual property infringement.

Packard said that imposing tariffs isn't likely to change China's practices.

""I don't think that's going to force changes to the Chinese economy,"" he said. ""What it's going to do is just impose costs on American consumers.""

Trump said the London agreement included a provision that China would supply magnets and rare earth minerals up front. Those minerals are needed to produce a wide range of high-tech products including electric vehicles, consumer electronics, industrial robots, fighter jets and missile-guidance systems. China plans to retain control of rare earth exports, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

Tariffs on China will stay at levels agreed to in the deal struck in Geneva last month. In May, the two countries agreed to a 90-day deal to reduce high tariffs. Both countries agreed to cut tariffs that had been so high that nearly all trade between the two nations stopped. The U.S. reduced its tariffs on China from 145% to 30%, while the two nations continued to talk. China cut its levies on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%.

Several retailers have already said that those tariffs – along with other tariffs Trump has imposed during his second term – could put pressure on prices, even at retailers that focus on low prices. In May, Target CEO Brian Cornell said the company's ""merchandising team has been working tirelessly to mitigate the impact of tariffs."" Walmart, the world's largest retailer, said the tariffs were too high and too broad for it to absorb on its own. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told shareholders in May that tariffs will increase consumer costs no matter how hard the giant retailer tries to keep them down. McMillon said that given the ""magnitude of the tariffs,"" the retail giant wouldn't be able to protect consumers from higher prices.

Economic data has yet to show that tariffs pushing up prices. Packard said he expects that will change.

""We're still in the early days of this and companies are spending down inventories,"" he said. ""I do think there will be real serious consequences for everyday Americans.""

Trump has said he wants to use tariffs to restore manufacturing jobs lost to lower-wage countries in decades past, shift the tax burden away from U.S. families, and pay down the national debt.

“Regulate them out of existence,” is how he described the intent of the Biden- and Obama-era rules on power plants.

But EPA’s own analysis that accompanied Zeldin’s proposal, released Wednesday, showed that the rules he is targeting for repeal would have changed the U.S. energy sector very little. For that reason, the agency’s so-called regulatory impact analysis — or RIA, which breaks down the costs and benefits of its actions — projected that the climate rules by the previous presidents would impose modest costs on the electricity sector. In one case, it was nonexistent.

The environmental benefits of the rules, though limited, substantially outstripped their costs to either the power sector or the economy, EPA’s analysis showed. That’s despite the fact that the agency didn’t analyze the likely financial benefits of cutting carbon pollution from power plants under the 2024 rule finalized under former President Joe Biden — or, by extension, the costs of carbon increasing under Zeldin’s plan.

EPA states in its RIA for the draft repeal that it did no new modeling or analysis on the effects of repealing the carbon rule. Nor did it analyze the impacts of erasing it. Instead, the regulatory analysis draws virtually all of its figures and projections from the analysis for the 2024 Biden rule it’s designed to kill.

“[W]e rely on the 2024 [Carbon Pollution Standard] RIA policy case analysis as the baseline for this action. Similarly, there may be other regulatory changes before the promulgation of this proposed action, and these too are not accounted for in the baseline for this action,” said the RIA released by the agency Wednesday.

Alan Krupnick, a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, noted that Zeldin’s regulatory analysis “merely takes the original RIA for [the Biden climate rule] — which was very thoroughly done — and multiplies those numbers by minus one.”

EPA did not respond to requests for comment.

Krupnick notes that the career staffers who compiled the analysis for the repeal probably didn’t have time to run models. EPA sent the proposed repeals to the White House for review in May, just over three months after the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.

Under Biden, EPA analyzed how the 2024 rule requiring existing coal plants and new gas plants to reduce their climate pollution would work with other regulations and incentives to shape the grid.

The analysis showed that the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for wind, solar and other technologies would drive the green energy build-out and deliver the carbon cuts that would nudge the power sector closer to Biden’s climate goals. The climate and mercury rules would play a meaningful but supporting role, the Biden analysis showed, by ushering out aging coal-fired units and spurring a few fossil power plants to invest in carbon capture and storage systems.

And because Zeldin’s repeal uses the Biden climate rule’s numbers and projections, its results are the mirror image of last year’s IRA.

For example, the repeal proposal touts $19 billion in saved regulatory costs over two decades from jettisoning the standards, or about $1.2 billion per year. A number taken from the 2024 document that reflects a relatively small percentage of the overall investments that utilities put toward their coal and gas fleets, not the kind of seismic shift to the economy that Zeldin described.

The draft repeal acknowledges that the Obama-era standards for new coal, which it called “largely non-binding,” has had no impact on costs because no new coal units have been built.

“The relative economics of coal-fired generation have remained challenging, as evidenced by continued retirement,” it states.

It acknowledges that between market forces and IRA tax credits the same kinds of new power plants would likely have been built between now and the start of 2032, when the Biden rule’s tougher standards would have phased in, whether that rule was repealed or not.

The Biden rule would have cut power sector carbon emissions by 123 million metrics tons by 2035 — roughly the annual emissions of the Netherlands. And without the rule, the expectation now is that those tons will go into the atmosphere.

Ben King, associate director of the energy and climate program at Rhodium Group, said his analysis showed that the Biden climate rule would have had a slightly larger impact on investment decisions and emissions than EPA’s modeling projected.

“But it was in the same ballpark,” he said. “Not transformative to the power system, but a step in the right direction.”

But King noted “the EPA rule and the IRA tax credits reinforce each other.”

The Biden EPA’s analysis showed few costs because most of the utility sector investments that would be required for compliance were already projected to happen because of the 2022 law, which invested $369 billion in those technologies. Now, Republicans in Congress are working to deliver a budget package that would greatly reduce those incentives. So EPA’s analysis for its final carbon rule repeal — which is expected later this year — will likely show more savings on compliance, but also vastly more emissions tied to the loss of the Biden rule.

Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at Energy Innovation, said the repeal of EPA’s carbon and mercury standards and a loss of the IRA tax credits would result in higher electricity prices and more health-harming pollution from aging coal plants.

“Health damages from repealing the rule are going to be substantially more than what’s represented in this because they’re, again, drawing on the last year’s analysis that incorporated the IRA tax credits,” he said.

Right now, EPA projects that by 2035 the loss of the Biden rule would result in up to $17 billion in public health costs and premature deaths compared to what would have happened if the rule had remained in place. Those impacts are all tied to particulate pollution and smog. EPA opted not to monetize the impacts from changes in carbon or mercury pollution with or without the rule, even though those are accounted for in the IRA.

Excess death estimates are reached by surveying people about their willingness to pay for policies that reduce their chances of dying. The metric is called “value of statistical life.”

But while EPA listed those figures in lower sections of the RIA for the draft repeal, the numbers were included as net benefits in the document’s executive summary. Those benefits are limited to “regulated pollutants” and savings to industry — a departure from EPA’s historic practice of counting benefits when the rule helps reduce other pollutants.

Krupnick called it a “catch-22″ because he said EPA is choosing not to monetize carbon pollution in the analysis. The agency also did not count other pollution increases toward the net costs of the repeal because they aren’t the pollutants the repeal is targeting, he said.

“EPA, their job is to protect and improve public health by reducing pollution,” Krupnick said. “And you don’t get to not count these [fine particulate pollution] and ozone benefits that are associated with reducing reliance on coal, you don’t get to ignore that. It’s completely antithetical to EPA’s mission.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/5f/21/bb2ba123445daed108dbdbdf0f55/u-s-congress-41034.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:01:57.673051

This isn’t just about clean energy anymore.
Clean energy is now simply energy.","Energy isn’t just one issue among many, it’s a foundational issue. In what the IEA has dubbed the Age of Electricity, if we don’t have enough of it, we enter the economic race to power the future with one arm tied behind our backs.

That’s what makes the House-passed budget reconciliation bill so dangerous: it guts the clean energy incentives that are powering our present and could power our future.

It dismantles the Inflation Reduction Act’s momentum just as the world is moving into a new industrial era, one that will be defined by who has enough affordable electricity to fuel growth.

Let’s zoom out.

Globally, energy investment is booming.

In 2024, $3 trillion was invested in energy. Two-thirds of that ($2 trillion) is going into clean power: wind, solar, nuclear, storage, and efficiency. Only $1 trillion is going into coal, oil, and gas.

China, in particular, is accelerating at breakneck speed, building 277 gigawatts of solar in 2024 alone. To put that into perspective, that’s more clean energy in one year than the entire installed capacity of Texas’s grid (~180GW).

Meanwhile, the U.S. is considering a bill that would eviscerate the progress we’ve made. It would slash the tax credits that have driven private investment into renewables, energy storage, and domestic manufacturing, just as that investment is beginning to deliver.

More than 270 clean energy factories have been announced since the IRA passed. If this bill becomes law, many of them will be canceled outright.

This isn’t theoretical. Projects are already being canceled in Texas due to market uncertainty. This bill pours cold water on an area where the U.S. has been gaining ground in manufacturing, jobs, and grid reliability.

And it’s happening just as we’re entering a new age of electricity demand. AI data centers, robotics, industrial electrification, and electric vehicles are pushing power use higher than it’s been in decades. Even Elon Musk is warning that we could see electricity shortfalls by next year.

You cannot meet 21st-century energy demand with 20th-century thinking. And yet, that's exactly what some policymakers are trying to do by doubling down on fossil fuel exports, suggesting ""LNG power plants"" (which aren’t a thing) are going to power our grids, and pretending we can drill our way to abundance while dismantling the tools that are actually scaling our grid.

In fact, LNG export facilities consume massive amounts of power, up to 700 megawatts each. If you want to power exports and data centers, and still have enough for people to use in their homes, you need a vastly more flexible, modern grid.

That means a diversified portfolio: wind, solar, storage, gas, geothermal, advanced nuclear, and demand-side solutions. It means better transmission planning, smarter markets, and policies that attract investment rather than repel it.

This isn’t just about clean energy anymore. Clean energy is now simply energy. It’s about competitiveness, reliability, affordability and national security.

While we debate whether clean energy tax credits are “too generous,” China is becoming the world’s first electrostate, a nation that doesn’t just consume energy, but manufactures and exports the infrastructure to produce it. China isn’t waiting for the market to figure it out. They’re building fast, and they’re controlling and locking up global supply chains along the way.

The U.S. still has the innovation advantage. We lead in software, in AI, in energy entrepreneurship. But without enough power to run it all, that advantage becomes a bottleneck. As David Friedberg put it recently, energy abundance is necessary for every other kind of abundance. Without it, AI, biotech, and automation all stagnate.

This reconciliation bill would deepen that bottleneck and cut off any hope of growing our way out of our deficit.

We cannot cut our way to energy dominance. We have to build.

If you care about growth, if you care about leadership, if you care about national security, you should care about energy policy. And if you care about energy policy, this bill should concern you.

We need the Senate to fix what the House broke. The tools are there. The economics are clear. The stakes couldn’t be higher.

Washington (June 12, 2025) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee, yesterday hosted virtual teach-ins on Republicans’ proposed cuts to health care, food security, education, and climate initiatives as part of their Big Billionaire Bill (also called budget reconciliation). Senator Markey, Representative Summer Lee (PA-12), and advocates discussed how these cuts would mean people lose their jobs, their health care, their ability to feed their families, and put the future of our country at risk—all to guarantee tax breaks for billionaires. The budget bill is currently being debated by Senate Republicans after House Republicans passed the Big Billionaire Bill in May.

“It’s simple: Republicans want to rip health care from 16 million people, tear food away from hungry families, cut off access to education for working class Americans, kill jobs, raise energy bills, and slash efforts to make our air and water cleaner– all to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. They want to do this through hard-to-understand processes, back-room negotiations, and by lying to the American public about what these cuts will do,” said Senator Markey. “I am using every opportunity I can to guarantee people know Republicans are voting against their livelihoods, their lives, and their future if they support this bill. We have the power to stop these cuts. We cannot agonize – we must organize to end this big billionaire boondoggle once and for all. Our future depends on it.”

“There’s nothing beautiful about forcing families to choose between taking their kids to the doctor or feeding them—but that’s exactly what this budget bill would do if it lands on Trump’s desk. Drastic cuts to healthcare like Medicaid and food assistance like SNAP will hurt millions of people in Western Pennsylvania and across the country,” said Representative Lee. “The power of the people is always greater than the people in power, and in this moment, we must all use our power to pressure Republicans to vote no and put the people first—not the billionaires, not the corporate profiteers, and not the oligarchs in the White House. Lives literally depend on it.”

“The Republican agenda is clear: raise costs on hardworking families and rip coverage away from millions. If they are successful in making the largest cuts to health care in history, 16 million Americans will lose coverage, all to fund tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations. These Republican attacks on Americans’ health care are as extreme as they are unpopular, and we must do everything we can to stop them from wreaking havoc on this country’s health care system. No one should lose access to life-saving care and coverage just so the ultra-rich can pay less in taxes,” said Anne Shoup, Senior Advisor, Protect Our Care.

“The Senate must vote ‘NO’ on any budget bill that cuts or weakens SNAP and takes food away from millions of children, older adults, and people with disabilities. Period,” said Salaam Bhatti, SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC). “SNAP is one of the most effective programs out there, fueling the health and well-being of families, as well as our economy. Simply put, a strong and productive country is only possible when everyone has access to food. We urge Senators to oppose any cut to SNAP and instead work towards building a nation free from hunger.”

“I’ve seen the faces of the people this bill will hurt. I think about the mothers trying to stretch every dollar to keep the lights on, the laid-off workers who need help to get back on their feet, the kids who will go without health care, and the retirees who will go to bed hungry because they can’t afford groceries,” said Zab Martinez, an AFSCME member and Medicaid and SNAP eligibility specialist from Dane County, Wisconsin. “We cannot let this bill pass. I urge you to speak up, write your senators, and demand that they stand with working families, not for billionaire tax giveaways.”

“Republicans’ Billionaire Tax Scam will take health care away from millions, food out of the mouths of children, and raise costs for everyday families all to give trillions in tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations. This is a dangerous and irresponsible piece of legislation designed to benefit the richest Americans, while everyday families suffer – and we are going to continue to uplift the voices of the bipartisan majority of Americans who overwhelmingly oppose this harmful bill,” said Michael Linden, Director of Families Over Billionaires.

“Why would Republicans in Washington gut the basic needs kids and disabled Americans rely on to get by when the cost of groceries and housing are going up? To give the wealthy a tax break. It’s an outrage, which is why over 60% of Americans who hear anything about congressional Republican’s Big Beautiful Betrayal hate it. Now is the time for citizens to learn the consequences of the congressional Republican plan and spread the word so we can stop this Medicaid massacre dead in its tracks,” said Joe Radosevich, Counselor at the Center for American Progress (CAP).

“Rather than protect Medicare and Medicaid, this bill cuts them, denying healthcare to 14 million people. Rather than strengthen public education, it weakens it. Rather than feeding poor families, it rips food out of their mouths. Education is an opportunity agent, and federal supports should not be used as a piggy bank to defund our already underfunded public schools. The bill includes $20 billion for a reckless school voucher program in the guise of a tax shelter for the well-off. Vouchers syphon crucial funds away from public schools into private hands. They are directly responsible for some of the largest student achievement drops ever recorded and mostly go to parents with kids already in private school,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).

“We have 1,600 workers at Ultium and their jobs are going to be at risk. These are good UAW jobs making $30 an hour, and this bill is going to threaten that. It could have a dramatic impact on the auto industry, on dozens of investments across the entire country,” said David Green, Director of United Auto Workers (UAW) Region 2B. “If we don't use our voices, they’re going to continue to take them away from us. And we have to fight for what’s right. And I am always going to be on the front line fighting for good union jobs with benefits because that’s how we move this country forward and that’s how we build the middle class.”

“The energy tax credits on the chopping block during this budget reconciliation process have been utilized by school districts all over the country to install renewable energy projects from roof-top solar arrays to ground-source heat pumps, saving millions of tax-payer dollars on utility bills. These savings can be used to increase teacher salaries and build resilience in communities as schools produce their own power and lighten the load on the energy grid, all while moving us toward a more equitable future powered by clean, renewable energy. In Nevada alone, Washoe County School District is set to receive a $1.7 million check for just one school and Clark County School District, the nation's 5th largest, has at least five solar eligible projects, including an array on Northeast Career and Technical Academy that is also training future solar installers. Please urge your Senators to save energy tax credits in their version of the budget reconciliation bill,” said Liz Becker, IRA Campaign Coordinator of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada (PLAN).

“The big bad boondoggle bill puts West Virginian communities, especially those most vulnerable to pollution, at risk. With cuts to programs that would facilitate a fair economic transition in Appalachia, such as a grant program to replace gas vehicles with electric vehicles and clean energy tax credits, West Virginians are losing out on the chance for safe and good-paying jobs. Furthermore, cuts to air monitoring, greenhouse gas emission data collection, and environmental review resources make our communities less safe and informed about the air we breathe and the water we drink. West Virginians have suffered with generations of corporate pollution and economic exploitation, and this bill would roll back a critical chance to escape the cycle of environmental injustice on which this country was built,” said Dani Parent, Co-executive Director of West Virginia Citizen Action.

“The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,"" a spokesman stated in an April 4 FEMA press release announcing the program's termination.
That's especially true in North Carolina, since many of the state projects involve communities hit hard by flooding from hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018.
Interestingly, the BRIC program was signed into law by Trump as part of the 2018 Disaster Recovery Reform Act.","Leland lost a $1.13 million grant for relocating a sewer lift station, a project aimed at improving community resilience.

State and local officials criticize the decision, citing the program's effectiveness in disaster preparedness and recovery.

Nearly 70 North Carolina projects worth $190 million are now at risk due to the program's cancellation.

LELAND | Is a sewer lift station worthy of a federal grant?

For officials in Leland and at H2GO, that question is an unequivocable yes.

The lift station just off South Navassa Road was in line to receive a $1.13 million grant from the federal government's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which aims to help communities prepare for disasters before they happen to bring down recovery costs. The station was to be relocated away from Sturgeon Creek, which often floods, thereby increasing the resiliency and reliability of the North Brunswick area's sewer system and helping prevent sewer overflows that can quickly become health and environmental hazards.

But in April the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced it was ending the BRIC program and canceling all applications from fiscal years 2020-2023. The agency said if the funds haven’t been distributed yet, they would be returned to the federal government.

“The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,"" a spokesman stated in an April 4 FEMA press release announcing the program's termination. ""It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters. Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, we are committed to ensuring that Americans in crisis can get the help and resources they need.”

State and local officials have called the decision by President Trump's administration short sighted and another sign of the broad, unfocused cuts the federal government's Department of Government Efficiency is taking in trying to rein in federal spending without looking at the real-world consequences. That's especially true in North Carolina, since many of the state projects involve communities hit hard by flooding from hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018.

According to the N.C. Division of Emergency Management, nearly 70 projects across the state worth almost $190 million − with more than $80 million along the N.C. coast − could be in danger of either not getting finished or being only partially funded if Congress doesn't reverse the administration's decision to end the BRIC program.

""The changes to the BRIC program by FEMA are disappointing as this program provides critical federal funding for mitigation projects that build resilient communities,"" said state Emergency Management spokesperson Brian Haines in an email. ""These multi-year, often complex projects would build resilience against the impacts from future storms and would reduce the overall recovery costs for future events.""

Some of the larger projects that could be on the chopping block include dozens of sewer and wastewater improvement projects, constructed wetlands to help deal with flooding woes, a push to move municipal buildings in Princeville out of the floodplain, and several planning and resiliency studies.

Interestingly, the BRIC program was signed into law by Trump as part of the 2018 Disaster Recovery Reform Act. The program, which received strong bipartisan support, was subsequently expanded under the Biden administration.

According to FEMA, canceling the BRIC program means approximately $882 million of funding from the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will be returned to the federal government. The bill made $1 billion available for BRIC over five years, with $133 million to date provided for about 450 applications nationwide.

Spokespersons for New Hanover County and Wilmington said that although both governments applied for project funding through the competitive program, neither was successful in receiving any grants.

Leland Town Manager David Hollis said the municipality in conjunction with H2GO is now seeking other grant opportunities to fund the lift station relocation project, although most of those federal and state programs involve low-interest loans rather than grants, are highly competitive, and don't generally have large funds to draw from.

That's especially true in the Tar Heel State as officials struggle to fund Tropical Storm Helene recovery efforts in Western N.C., a task that has become even more challenging after the Trump administration canceled several disaster-aid grants and programs being relied on by the state.

That includes ending a previous commitment by FEMA to fund 100% of the debris-removal costs for post-Helene damage, something Gov. Josh Stein said will directly impact the state's ability to fund other desperately needed storm-recovery projects today and in the future.

The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov.
“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said.
“North Carolina was first in flight.

The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro’s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.

JetZero has said it's already received about $300 million in investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina's robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.

“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.”

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project earlier Thursday to a state committee that awards economic incentives.

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.35 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers’ paychecks. The incentives also include up to $785 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and $450 million from the General Assembly to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.

A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

“We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O'Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It’s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The 5-year-old company says the plane’s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.

“It's going to deliver a better passenger experience than you’ve ever had before on any other plane,” O’Leary said.

The state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.

Trump blocks California gas car ban in a major political move, stopping the state’s 2035 plan to phase out gas-powered cars. Signed on June 12, 2025, this action overturns California’s authority to enforce electric vehicle rules backed by the EPA. President Trump argues consumers should freely choose what to drive. Governor Gavin Newsom and 11 other states vow to fight back, setting up a fierce legal battle over climate control laws. The decision also rolls back strict emission limits, impacting air quality rules nationwide. Read how this new law could change America’s auto market and environmental future.

Trump blocks California gas car ban in major climate policy clash with Newsom- In a bold move that reignites a long-running feud with California, President Donald Trump on Thursday, June 12, 2025, signed a resolution that blocks California’s ban on gas-powered car sales, which was set to take effect by 2035. The decision puts Trump directly at odds with California Governor Gavin Newsom and could spark a significant legal showdown over state versus federal authority on climate policies. The rule originally allowed California — and 11 other states following its lead — to phase out new gasoline car sales as part of a broader push for electric vehicle adoption and reduced emissions.

Why is Trump blocking California’s gas car ban now?

The Republican-led House and Senate passed the resolution targeting California’s 2035 gas car ban last month, with the House voting 246-164 and the Senate approving it 51-44. The ban was part of California’s aggressive climate action plan, but Trump and GOP lawmakers say it limits consumer choice and overreaches the state's authority. According to a White House official, Trump’s move to sign the bill is part of his broader strategy to push back against ""blue-state"" environmental rules that he argues hurt businesses and consumers.

Trump stated, “Americans should be allowed to choose what kind of car or truck they want to drive,” highlighting his administration’s stance against government mandates on consumer products.

What does this mean for other states following California’s lead?

California isn't alone. Eleven other states, including New York and Massachusetts, have pledged to follow California’s 2035 rule, and together they make up about 40% of the U.S. auto market. By overturning California’s authority, this resolution could undermine those state efforts as well.

California had been granted a waiver by the EPA in December 2022 under President Biden, allowing the state to set stricter emission standards than the federal government. That waiver is now effectively challenged by Trump’s latest action.

Live Events

Could this lead to a legal fight between Trump and Newsom?

Yes — and it almost certainly will. Governor Gavin Newsom’s office responded swiftly and sharply, with spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor saying, “If it’s a day ending in Y, it’s another day of Trump’s war on California. We’re fighting back.”

Legal experts say the Clean Air Act gives California special status to seek EPA waivers for stronger rules, and any move to strip that away will likely end up in court. In fact, both the Senate Parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office have said Congress doesn’t have the legal authority to overrule state climate laws — a key point that could shape the next legal chapter.

What are the auto and trucking industries saying?

The move is being cheered by automakers and the trucking industry, who have long pushed for a single nationwide standard. Chris Spear, CEO of the American Trucking Associations, said: “This is not the United States of California. With the stroke of his pen, President Trump is restoring the certainty the trucking industry needs to deliver for our nation.”

General Motors also voiced support, saying in a statement, “We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles.”

What other environmental rules are being overturned?

Trump didn’t stop at gas car bans. On the same day, he also approved measures that scrap limits on tailpipe emissions and truck pollution rules involving nitrogen oxides, rules that were part of a broader effort to reduce smog and improve air quality. These rollbacks mark Trump’s second major signing ceremony of his term, emphasizing a shift in environmental policy away from federal climate regulations and toward business-friendly deregulation.

This move may draw additional legal scrutiny, especially since the EPA under President Biden had already approved some of these state-level actions.

What happens next in the gas car ban battle?

This sets up a direct clash between the federal government and several major states over who has the right to regulate environmental policy. California, backed by states like New York, New Jersey, and Washington, is preparing for a legal challenge that could redefine state-federal environmental powers in the years ahead.

With the 2026 midterms approaching, this issue is likely to remain a major flashpoint — especially as climate concerns and fuel prices continue to dominate political conversations.

FAQs:

Q1: What is Trump's stance on California's gas car ban?

Trump blocked California's 2035 gas car ban, supporting fuel choice over electric mandates.

Q2: Will California and other states challenge Trump’s move?

Yes, California and 11 states are preparing to fight the federal rollback in court.

Thousands of clean energy jobs to be created through new hydrogen funding.

• Funding for first regional hydrogen transport and storage network to unlock growth and drive investment in Britain’s renewal

• Secures thousands of jobs boosting industrial heartlands as part of the government’s Plan for Change

• Comes as government announces in Spending Review major investment in carbon capture jobs in Scotland and Humber, and nuclear in Nottinghamshire, Suffolk and the East Midlands

Thousands of clean energy jobs will be created in Britain’s industrial heartlands as the government confirms over £500 million for hydrogen infrastructure today, as part of the Plan for Change to invest in Britain’s future as a clean energy superpower.

The government has confirmed that the spending review allocated landmark new funding to create the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, connecting hydrogen producers with vital end users, including power stations and industry for the first time.

This major infrastructure boost will help deliver clean energy while creating thousands of skilled jobs in industrial regions such as Merseyside, Teesside and the Humber, as well as in the supply chain. This will ensure communities across the country feel the benefits of Britain’s renewal while reducing reliance on volatile international fossil fuel markets.

Today’s announcement also follows confirmation in the Spending Review that the government is creating thousands of clean energy jobs across the country, with 10,000 jobs to be created at Sizewell C in Suffolk, a new fusion reactor to be built on the site of an old power station in Nottinghamshire, up to 3,000 jobs created through the small modular reactor programme, and funding to kickstart the Acorn project in Scotland and the Viking project in the Humber.

This investment builds on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

This will support manufacturing sectors likely to require hydrogen like iron, steel, glass, chemicals and ceramics – and forms part of government’s long-term plan to invest in and secure the country’s industrial future, with more detail expected in the upcoming Infrastructure Strategy.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

""We are investing over half a billion pounds in our industrial heartlands to deliver jobs and energy security for Britain. By building hydrogen networks, we are securing homegrown energy that will power British industry for generations to come.

""This will bring in the investment needed across the country to deliver our Plan for Change by unlocking clean energy and growth in our local economies.""

The funding will unlock hydrogen’s unique role in Britain’s energy system, where it can decarbonise industrial sectors including refineries and heavy transport, while providing long-term energy storage that can be deployed during peak demand periods.

The funding also enables progress on supporting low carbon hydrogen production through continued Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), building on the success of the First Hydrogen Allocation Round which saw 11 projects being allocated over £2 billion in government funding.

Hydrogen UK’s head of policy and analysis, Brett Ryan, said:

""We welcome today’s announcement on hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure. Hydrogen networks are essential for a secure and resilient hydrogen sector, whilst ensuring sufficient energy storage capacity will be critical to energy security and affordability during the energy transition. We look forward to working with the government as we continue to deliver hydrogen’s role in reaching net zero and ensuring our energy security.""

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, said:

""This announcement is a key piece of the puzzle and represents very welcome government support to galvanise the UK’s regional hydrogen hubs. By investing in transport and storage infrastructure, the government is rightly joining the dots, connecting already supported hydrogen production with end users across power and industry.

""This strategic thinking builds on the strength of our established industrial regions and supported clusters, unlocking clean energy potential while creating skilled jobs in places such as Merseyside, Teesside and the Humber. It’s a vital step forward on the UK’s journey to becoming a clean energy superpower.""

Hydrogen has already attracted £400 million of private sector investment in towns and cities such as Milford Haven in Wales and High Marnham in Nottinghamshire, and government support will help create thousands of jobs in the sector, including roles for apprentices, graduates and technically trained professionals, such as engineers, welders, skilled construction workers, pipefitters and operations specialists.",https://pressreleasehub.pa.media/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-13 12:04:03.596851

(AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.

The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro’s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.

JetZero has said it’s already raised about $300 million toward investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina’s robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.

“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.”

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project discussed earlier Thursday by a state committee that awards economic incentives.

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.35 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers’ paychecks. The incentives also include up to $785 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and up to $450 million from the General Assembly in part to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.

A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

“We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O’Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It’s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The 5-year-old company says the plane’s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.

“It’s going to deliver a better passenger experience than you’ve ever had before on any other plane,” O’Leary said.

Stein said the state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.

The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.

President Trump says he has a new deal with China to secure their flow

The auto industry may have just dodged a bullet. A reported deal to lower some trade barriers between the U.S. and China could secure the flow of rare earth metals used in many electronic components and motors.

China controls much of the world’s supply of the metals. The country had slowed exports to the U.S. as part of a negotiation over tariffs. That temporarily shuttered at least one car factory and threatened to close more.

President Trump said his administration had struck a deal with China to restore the flow of materials. But no one outside the administration knows what the agreement says – its text has not yet been published.

Rare Earth Metals Litter Modern Cars

They’re in batteries and electric motors, including tiny motors in gas-powered cars

A shortage could be similar to the microchip shortage of 2021-2023

Rare earths are found all over today’s cars.

They’re most common in magnets that power electric motors. Electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids use large electric motors to turn their wheels. All cars, including gas-powered models, use dozens of them to spin fans, provide power steering, and even operate seat belts.

The auto industry, already reeling from tariffs that raise prices on new cars and the parts used to build them, could little afford a significant supply chain disruption.

Industry publication Automotive News explains, “Some industry executives expected the rare-earth restrictions to have an impact comparable to the semiconductor shortage, which caused carmakers to cut more than 17 million vehicles from production schedules in 2021 through 2023, according to an estimate by AutoForecast Solutions.”

The Deal Is Mostly a Mystery Right Now

Trump says he has a deal, and rare earths trade will resume

No one outside the White House has seen the agreement, and it may stay secret

CNBC reports, “Representatives from both sides had on Tuesday revealed that a deal had been reached on trade after a second day of high-level talks in London.”

Posting on his Truth Social network, Trump wrote, “FULL MAGNETS, AND ANY NECESSARY RARE EARTHS, WILL BE SUPPLIED, UP FRONT, BY CHINA.”

However, neither side has released details of the agreement. Bloomberg reports, “Secretary Howard Lutnick said he thinks the London deal will be approved within days and that he didn’t expect a written version of the pact to be released, meaning it could be tough to know exactly what both sides agreed to beyond general outlines.”

Automakers Need Insurance Against This Happening Again

Analysts say China could hit pause again

Automakers are stockpiling and looking for domestic supplies

The crisis may have eased, but it could flare up again easily. A Bloomberg analysis finds that China “hit the world’s pain point” with its rare earths controls, “and will do so again.”

Automakers have begun war-gaming longer-term solutions to the problem.

Hyundai Motor Group, parent company of Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis, revealed that it had stockpiled a year’s supply.

The Detroit Free Press notes that General Motors has “formed strategic alliances with two rare earth mineral processing companies to domestically source rare earth minerals.”

Under the Clean Air Act, California can adopt emissions requirements independent of EPA regulations to meet its air quality challenges.
On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a written statement that Trump’s actions “delivered a decisive blow” to California’s EV mandate.
Today is a great day for consumer freedom.” Congress also approved House Joint Resolution 87 (Advanced Clean Trucks) to nullify other California emissions regulations, including motor vehicle and engine pollution control standards and advanced clean trucks.
“SEMA saw this happening and knew it could not sit idly… Along the way, states not named California got wise to the harms of EV mandates.","President Donald Trump has signed into law three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions disapproving California’s vehicle emission waivers.

The U.S. House passed the reversal of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s approval of a waiver for California and 11 states to ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Shortly after, the Senate approved the reversal.

In December, the EPA granted the California Air Resources Board (CARB)’s requested waiver to implement and enforce its Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) regulations for light-duty vehicles to mandate that all new passenger cars, trucks, and SUVs sold in California be zero emissions by 2035.

Under the Clean Air Act, California can adopt emissions requirements independent of EPA regulations to meet its air quality challenges. The state must seek a waiver from the EPA for new motor vehicle emission standards. Other states can also adopt the regulations.

In February, Zeldin and Trump along with the newly created National Energy Dominance Council, announced that the EPA would transmit to Congress three waiver rules granted by the Biden EPA — California’s Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Heavy-Duty Engine Omnibus NOx to comply with the agency’s duties under the CRA.

The Congressional disapproval of California’s EV mandates is another step toward ending an EV mandate on all Americans under Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” Executive Order, according to the EPA.

On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a written statement that Trump’s actions “delivered a decisive blow” to California’s EV mandate.

“The [former President Joe] Biden EPA rules granting California’s waivers allowed one coast to set national policy while imposing significant costs and limiting consumer choice for Americans in every state,” Zeldin said. “We are working to end the EV mandate because, in part, doing so will usher in a new era of prosperity for American auto workers, providing the economic liberty needed to restore this quintessential industry. Thank you to all the members of Congress who did their part to get these resolutions on President Trump’s desk. The president campaigned on this, the American people voted for it, and this Administration is proudly delivering on this mandate. Today is a great day for consumer freedom.”

Congress also approved House Joint Resolution 87 (Advanced Clean Trucks) to nullify other California emissions regulations, including motor vehicle and engine pollution control standards and advanced clean trucks.

In response to Trump signing House Joint Resolution 88, John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, reiterated that the EV sales mandates were “never achievable and wildly unrealistic.”

“Worse than unachievable — these EV mandates were going to be harmful,” he said in a written statement. “Harmful to auto affordability, to consumer choice, to industry competitiveness, and economic activity. Customers don’t want the government telling them what kind of car to buy. What they want is a range of choices, like efficient gas-powered, battery electric, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

“President Trump deserves credit for identifying this problem and doing something about it. He got behind this repeal before the EV mandates did real damage to the auto industry in America, stood up for customer choice, and helped restore a degree of balance to U.S. emissions regulations.”

Mike Spagnola, president and CEO of SEMA, posted on LinkedIn Thursday that the association was part of the signing ceremony at the White House, adding that “it was a true honor… and to have SEMA’s work on this issue recognized.”

In May, Spagnola posted on the platform that SEMA recognized “a potentially devastating shift in the automotive landscape” three years ago, as EV mandates became a reality, starting in California and then spreading to nearly a dozen other states, leading to the association’s push to stop the mandates.

“Even the federal government got on board,” he wrote. “SEMA saw this happening and knew it could not sit idly… Along the way, states not named California got wise to the harms of EV mandates. Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Vermont each backed off pledges to follow California’s emissions policies, while North Carolina, Texas, Ohio, West Virginia, and 8 other states passed SEMA-supported ‘ban the ban’ legislation to ensure such mandates never take effect again.”

,Louisiana American Energy ,2025-06-13 10:18:57+00:00,www.hellenicshippingnews.com,US EIA's short-term outlook finds that natural gas demand is outpacing supply,Not Available,,,,,https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/us-eias-short-term-outlook-finds-that-natural-gas-demand-is-outpacing-supply/,"“We expect that domestic consumption and exports combined will increase by nearly 4 Bcf/d this year, while US dry natural gas production grows by less than 3 Bcf/d,” the EIA said.
Gas consumption Compared with the May forecast, the agency kept its gas consumption forecast level for 2025 at 91.3 Bcf/d while lifting the 2026 forecast by 400 MMcf/d to 91.1 Bcf/d.
In the near term, the EIA lowered its forecast for second-quarter Henry Hub natural gas spot prices by 20 cents to $3.26/MMBtu.
“We expect natural gas prices to increase throughout the summer as production declines slightly and demand for air conditioning increases the use of natural gas in the electric power sector,” the agency said.
Compared with the May outlook, the agency raised its gas consumption estimates by 400 MMcf/d to 76.8 Bcf/d for Q2, and by 300 MMcf/d to 85 Bcf/d for Q3.","Strong natural gas export growth that persistently outpaces US production is driving higher gas prices in 2025 and 2026, compared with 2024, when spot prices averaged $2.19/MMBtu, the US Energy Information Administration said June 10.

The EIA’s June Short-Term Energy Outlook estimated that Henry Hub spot prices will average $4.02/MMBtu in 2025 and $4.88/MMBtu in 2026, compared with the May forecast of $4.12/MMBtu in 2025 and $4.80/MMBtu in 2026.

“We expect that domestic consumption and exports combined will increase by nearly 4 Bcf/d this year, while US dry natural gas production grows by less than 3 Bcf/d,” the EIA said. “Although natural gas inventories have recently moved above the five-year average, we expect that as demand persistently outpaces supply through much of this year, inventories will fall back below the five-year average by October, putting upward pressure on prices.”

The agency estimated that total market natural gas production will average 115.9 Bcf/d in 2025, up 800 MMcf/d from its May number, but the EIA trimmed its forecast for the 2026 production average by 700 MMcf/d to 116.3 Bcf/d, with the Eagle Ford Basin area leading the 2026 easing. According to the EIA, the 2025 change reflects March results from monthly production survey data, which came in higher than expected, while the lowered 2026 estimate reflects an overall rig count forecast, pushing down the production forecast, particularly for 2026. The 2026 reduction is partly related to low oil prices and is most significant for the Permian and Eagle Ford forecasts, a spokesperson for EIA said.

A number of analysts, including the EIA, have moderated gas production forecasts among primarily oil-producing basins such as the Eagle Ford in light of many operators’ intent to drill and complete fewer wells in 2025 than previously planned.

Gas consumption

Compared with the May forecast, the agency kept its gas consumption forecast level for 2025 at 91.3 Bcf/d while lifting the 2026 forecast by 400 MMcf/d to 91.1 Bcf/d. The EIA estimated that the US consumed 90.5 Bcf/d in 2024.

Adding to the demand are LNG exports that are expected to rise from an average of 11.9 Bcf/d in 2024 to 14.6 Bcf/d in 2025, before growing to 16 Bcf/d in 2026, according to the EIA.

In recent months, demand for LNG feedgas rose steadily and reached all-time highs this spring as the market added liquefaction capacity with the incremental commissioning of both Venture Global’s Plaquemines LNG facility in Louisiana and Cheniere Energy’s midscale expansion of Corpus Christi LNG in Texas.

Another large greenfield export facility, the ExxonMobil-QatarEnergy joint venture Golden Pass LNG, is planned to start up in late 2025.

In the near term, the EIA lowered its forecast for second-quarter Henry Hub natural gas spot prices by 20 cents to $3.26/MMBtu. The Q3 forecast also fell 18 cents from May’s estimates to $4.01/MMBtu.

“We expect natural gas prices to increase throughout the summer as production declines slightly and demand for air conditioning increases the use of natural gas in the electric power sector,” the agency said.

Despite a forecast that assumes about the same number of cooling-degree days this summer as last, the EIA is forecasting that the US power sector will use 3% less natural gas due to higher natural gas prices and level coal costs for generators.

“We expect the price of natural gas delivered to the power sector to average about $3.84/MMBtu from June through September, $1.39/MMBtu more than that period in 2024,” the outlook said.

Compared with the May outlook, the agency raised its gas consumption estimates by 400 MMcf/d to 76.8 Bcf/d for Q2, and by 300 MMcf/d to 85 Bcf/d for Q3.

Power demand forecast

The EIA raised its forecast for US electricity demand growth for 2025 by about 1% to reflect an anticipated surge in demand growth in the commercial and industrial sectors, particularly from the expansion of data centers and manufacturing operations.

The agency now forecasts that US commercial sector electricity consumption will increase by 3% in 2025 and by 5% in 2026. This marks a significant upward revision from the May outlook, in which the EIA had forecast commercial power demand would grow by an annual average of 2% through 2026. The agency said the growth in power demand is notable in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and PJM Interconnection markets.

As a result of the increased power demand, the EIA expects, in the near term, that total US electricity generation will increase by 1%, or 14 billion kWh, this summer compared with the summer of 2024. While gas-fired generation in the US is expected to be lower from June to September, nationwide solar generation is poised to grow by 33%, or 30 billion kWh, in the same period, the report said. The EIA forecasts a 6%, or 5 billion kWh, increase in US hydroelectric generation, citing improving water supply in the western states.

The EIA sees the largest summer-over-summer increase in power generation coming in ERCOT because of growing electricity demand from data centers and new manufacturing facilities in Texas. Gas-fired generation in the state is projected to fall this summer in response to solar growth and a smaller increase in wind generation, the report said.",,N,,2025-06-13 08:03:12.478106

Saul Elbein reports for The Hill.

In short:

Texas regulators are reviewing proposals for more than 100 new gas plants, mostly to power AI data centers, with over 30 already approved.

If built, these plants could emit pollution equivalent to adding 27 million vehicles to Texas roads, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.

Some large gas plants have been misclassified as “minor sources,” potentially bypassing stringent emissions controls under the Clean Air Act.

Key quote:

“To meet its increasing demand for electricity, Texas should be encouraging more clean energy instead of feeding public subsidies to dirty fossil fuels.”

— Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project

Why this matters:

As AI and cryptocurrency operations explode across the U.S., their demand for electricity is reshaping the energy landscape — especially in Texas. These industries are turning to natural gas to power massive data centers, many of which bypass rigorous environmental review. That raises public health concerns as gas plants emit pollutants like benzene, nitrogen oxides, and PM 2.5, which are linked to cancer, asthma, and lung damage. Texas already suffers from poor air quality in regions like Houston and along the I-35 corridor. Adding dozens of gas plants without top-tier pollution controls could intensify that burden, particularly in communities near oilfields or urban centers. While the state leads in renewable energy production, political resistance and grid constraints are slowing the shift away from fossil fuels, even as the environmental and health risks mount.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60929964/origin.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:04:16.949515

“The United States will find itself in an energy crisis if renewable energy investments go on hold.” Less worried?
“If you’re profitable without needing a government check, you’re sleeping fine.” Others go further, stressing that profitable clean energy companies face little threat.
“The Trump administration’s recent policy shifts are a necessary course correction, not a threat to viable clean energy,” said Tracy Shuchart, senior economist at NinjaTrader, a retail futures trading platform.","“Our upbeat outlook on the renewables sector is generally independent of questions about the future of green energy related to the potential impact of the upcoming U.S. elections,” private equity group KKR said in its report titled “Market Review Infrastructure June 2024.”

President Donald Trump’s administration, however, has thrown much into chaos, sources say, and even if green energy cannot be ditched completely because it is an economic success after all, such uncertainty is playing havoc with people’s confidence in the industry’s future.

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the House of Representatives, where the proposed cutting of tax credits and the large-scale repeal of the approximately $370 million Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act’s provisions have created uncertainty, is now weighing heavily on many people’s shoulders. Many players hope clearer heads will prevail once the bill gets to the Senate.

“From what we’ve seen and heard through industry contacts in Washington, there’s reason to believe that the bill in its current form is unlikely to pass the Senate without revisions,” said Landon Wimmer, the CEO of Empower Home Services, a home energy solutions company focused mainly on solar power in California, Arizona, and Texas. “We’re hopeful those changes will be more favorable to the clean energy sector.”

While things remain up in the air — the stated aim of lawmakers in the Senate is that the new legislation, in its final form, gets to the president’s desk in time for the July 4 holiday — most players remain highly concerned about the dicey future of industries such as solar and power, the incompatibility of that with meeting the nation’s increasing demand for electricity, and tackling climate change.

Various players are holding out hope that something less threatening actually gets signed into law.

The need for certainty

The push toward gutting elements of the IRA is chilling to many in the clean energy industry, particularly those who are financing early-stage projects and who may rely more on tax credits and subsidies.

While such possibly highly impactful bills remain in flux, that uncertainty is causing many clean energy businesses to possibly reevaluate their strategies, even though they have no firm idea of what may emerge.

“While operational and near-COD projects are less exposed, developers are reevaluating how future policy shifts could impact return on investment, tax equity appetite, and pipeline valuation,” said Zoe Gamble, president of CleanChoice Energy, a company that owns solar generation assets and provides clean power to consumers. “I see a lot of American solar developers worried that they will be put out of business.”

One major area of concern, too, is in the financing of certain projects for consumers.

Homeowners, for example, can go solar through leasing or power purchase agreement programs. These models rely heavily on the current 30% federal tax credit to keep pricing attractive for homeowners.

“If that tax credit were to disappear almost overnight, it would severely limit the financial viability of these programs,” Wimmer said. “Homeowners would no longer see the same level of savings on their utility bills, which would likely lead to a significant decline in interest and adoption of solar energy.”

Not to mention the overhanging threat of tariffs.

Many essential components needed to build wind farms, solar panels, and electric batteries are manufactured outside the United States and, as a result, are subject to possible and actual tariffs. Such tariffs are making materials more expensive and certainly adding to the uncertainty for people planning for such new assets. For a new nuclear project, for example, you’re talking 15-20 years of planning.

Meanwhile, the insatiable demand for energy from the AI industry can only compound the problem if things become more expensive. Not to mention the threat to climate change initiatives, which fall lower down the priority list in the race to implement energy-guzzling AI data centers.

“As we see in the Big Beautiful Bill Act, instead of turning to renewable resources as a means to power the next generation of AI, the new administration is putting its full weight behind oil and fossil fuels,” notes Aya Saed, director of AI policy and strategy at sustainable software group Scope3. “The United States will find itself in an energy crisis if renewable energy investments go on hold.”

Less worried?

Others are perhaps less concerned. Well-funded companies that do not rely overly on tax credits and subsidies have far less to worry about.

“You can see it in industry chatter on X — folks are worried about what happens if the tax credits dry up,” said Rabbi Yechezkel Moskowitz, founder of the Synergos Fund, a venture capital fund focused on sustainable tech, such as critical minerals, nuclear energy, and wastewater management.

“The administration’s going to back winners who make electricity, plain and simple, renewable or not,” he said. “If you’re profitable without needing a government check, you’re sleeping fine.”

Others go further, stressing that profitable clean energy companies face little threat. Enacting such legislation would level the playing field.

“The Trump administration’s recent policy shifts are a necessary course correction, not a threat to viable clean energy,” said Tracy Shuchart, senior economist at NinjaTrader, a retail futures trading platform. “These changes reflect a more realistic approach to energy security and reliability.”

They do so by showing up the relative unreliability of energy sources such as wind and solar in meeting electricity demand, not something that other sources of power have to worry about as much, she says. “Nuclear and natural gas will thrive under these policies,” she said. “This reset strengthens energy security, lowers costs, and offers a more sustainable future than continued reliance on unreliable renewables.”

But most remain concerned, even as the federal government may not have as much power as it thinks it has when coming up against market forces and the power of individual states and their promotion of renewable energy.

Solar to become major force?

The Energy Information Administration, for example, predicts that solar generation capacity will eclipse that of coal midway through next year and blow past wind power by the end of 2026.

Individual states, utilities, utility customers, industry partners, and local governments will continue to prioritize clean energy and pursue the economic and job creation opportunities that arise from the ongoing transition, said Lesley Jantarasami, the vice president of research and industry strategy at Smart Electric Power Alliance.

The momentum behind renewable fuels and decarbonization infrastructure is being driven by global market forces and strategic imperatives, not just policy, Cresta Fund Management’s Chris Rozzell added.

Historical precedent shows that during periods of federal environmental deregulation, state-level leadership becomes essential for maintaining progress, in this case, on climate goals, Saed added.

All that being the case, it would help if the federal government could be clearer about its goals.

Clarity and consistency from policymakers are critical to sustaining private investment at scale,” Rozzell said.

“Political vendettas and motivations have disrupted the industry in an unfavorable way — the outcome of Trump’s bill will either be the final nail in the coffin or offer a semblance of hope that political tides will not dictate the industry’s success,” U.S. Hispanic Business Council founder and CEO Javier Palomarez said.

TRUMP TARIFFS: BARGAINING TOOL OR PREFACE TO A GLOBAL TRADE WAR?

It’s a tough few weeks ahead, but little compared to what might be a course correction of some magnitude.

“The decisions made in the coming months could shape the trajectory of energy, economic equity, and environmental health for decades to come,” Wimmer said.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Sometimes, a single storm can change a city. For Copenhagen, that storm hit on July 2, 2011.

""It was over 100 millimeters of rain in a couple of hours. It fell directly on the city of Copenhagen,"" recalls Mark Payne, a climate researcher at the Danish Meteorological Institute.

Sewers overflowed, and the streets filled with raw sewage, causing more than $1 billion in damage to property. Video from the weather event shows city streets transformed into waterways and passing city buses generating waves that broke against storefronts, while the rain persisted, relentless and torrential.

Climate scientists like Payne call these storms ""cloudbursts,"" or extreme rain events. As the planet warms, the atmosphere can hold more moisture, which can lead to more intense rainfall events.

""The typical rule of thumb is that for 1 degree Celsius of warming, the atmosphere holds 7% more water,"" Payne says.

Europe is the fastest-warming continent, according to scientists from the United Nations and the European Environment Agency. Temperatures are increasing at twice the global average rate, leading to more fires and flooding.

That means cities built centuries ago are racing to adapt.

In Copenhagen, meteorologists predict the city will receive 30% more rainfall by the end of this century. Just a year after the flood, city officials adopted a ""Cloudburst Management Plan,"" a $1.3 billion public works project to complete 300 flood-mitigation projects over two decades.

Tunnels beneath the city

One of the plan's most high-profile projects is nearly complete: the Kalvebod Brygge Cloudburst Tunnel.

To show it off, engineer Jes Clauson-Kaas carefully descends down nine stories of rickety scaffolding along the edge of a massive concrete hole bored into the earth.

When he arrives at the bottom, he lifts his head and brings two fingers to his lips to produce a loud whistle, its screech echoing along the curved concrete walls above.

""An opera singer's dream,"" he says, smiling.

Clauson-Kaas is chief consultant for the Copenhagen waterworks utility HOFOR, which is overseeing the construction of the tunnel. As he walks the perimeter of a cathedral-sized vault that will soon be the pump room, he motions to a hole in the wall just above his head: It's the terminus of a tunnel that's nearly a mile long and 10 feet in diameter and can hold 10,000 cubic meters of water, equal to the volume of four Olympic swimming pools. It's one of seven new tunnels dug under Copenhagen to hold excess rainwater during cloudburst events.

Clauson-Kaas explains how it works: Once the tunnel is full, he says, the pumps are switched on, ""and they can simply suck out this water into the harbor.""

Collecting rain in ""sponge parks""

Just blocks away from the Kalvebod Brygge tunnel is Enghaveparken, a century-old park that was redesigned after the 2011 flood to transform into a massive reservoir in the event of heavy rain.

Today, neighborhood children play on a soccer field carved deep into the ground. The park itself is enclosed by a 3-foot-high concrete wall with gates that automatically emerge from the ground, sealing the park so that it can hold floodwater.

Storing rainwater on the surface makes more sense than expanding the sewer system, says Jan Rasmussen, director of climate adaptation for the city of Copenhagen.

""You can't expand a pipe as easily as this area can be expanded,"" he says. ""[It's] also much cheaper if we can use areas like this to store rainwater.""

Rasmussen says Copenhagen has transformed 20 green areas like Enghaveparken into what the city nicknames ""sponge parks."" When full, he says, Enghaveparken can hold 25,000 cubic meters of water. When it's not raining, a 2,000-cubic-meter storage tank underneath a rose garden in the park holds rainwater collected from the neighborhood's storm drains, used to irrigate the park's lawns, trees and flowers.

In addition to the sponge parks and cloudburst tunnels, Copenhagen has also just broken ground on a human-made island off its coast, named Lynetteholm. The island will house 35,000 people and protect the city against storm surges, another weather phenomenon happening more often here as the climate warms and sea levels rise. The island is expected to be finished by 2070.

The scale of the city's long-term climate adaptation planning has gained admirers among urban planners throughout the world, says Rasmussen. In addition to penning a collaboration with New York City on climate adaptation, he says, Copenhagen has also consulted with cities in South Africa, China, Germany and beyond on how they can build similar infrastructure to mitigate the increased flooding that comes with climate change.

""The trick to make all of this a success,"" says Rasmussen, ""is intense planning.""

(RALEIGH) Today Governor Stein urged Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo, and North Carolina Senators Ted Budd and Thom Tillis to reconsider the U.S. House of Representative’s efforts to end the energy and manufacturing tax credits that the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 created. These tax credits have helped North Carolina emerge as a top state for clean energy business investment.

“Our state’s clean energy economy is booming, and companies’ decisions to locate their clean energy advanced manufacturing facilities in North Carolina have brought jobs and opportunities to our state,” said Governor Josh Stein. “H.R. 1’s abrupt changes to these credits would jeopardize much of this investment, stifle the demand that many companies were counting on, and conflict with the goals of reshoring manufacturing that the Trump Administration has championed. H.R. 1 would weaken our economy, raise utility prices on consumers, and undermine our national security.”

Since the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 passed, more than $24 billion in clean energy technology investments have been announced across North Carolina. These announcements include batteries for storage and vehicle applications, solar panels, cells, and wafers, electric vehicle charging stations, transformers, critical minerals, and a wide variety of grid-enhancing products. These businesses already or will soon employ tens of thousands of people, in addition to the more than 100,000 people already employed in North Carolina’s clean energy sector. The U.S. House budget resolution’s repeal of these tax credits would threaten jobs in North Carolina and put billions of dollars in investments at risk.

Moreover, H.R. 1 could cause a significant cost in electricity prices for North Carolinians – a more than 13 percent increase for households and a more than 20 percent increase for businesses.

The Clean Energy Labour Council, established by IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol in 2022, consists of 14 labour union leaders. It meets several times per year and aims to give a greater voice to the labour perspective in energy and climate policy discussions.

Earlier this week, the Council released its first publication, Ensuring a Strong Labour Dimension for Just and Inclusive Energy Transitions, which focuses on the importance of ensuring just and inclusive energy transitions for workers and communities. The paper covers a wide range of labour-related issues, such as the need to design high-quality clean energy jobs that can attract new workers to the sector. It also calls for coordinated efforts to properly plan, implement and monitor just energy transitions – stressing the important role of social dialogue and engagement among all stakeholders.

During the meeting, the paper was presented by the Labour Council co-chairs to Ministers, policy makers and representatives of the G20 and COP30 Presidencies – many of whom had been attending the IEA’s 10th Annual Global Conference on Energy Efficiency – with the goal of helping to shape national and international energy and climate discussions.

“Greater efforts are needed to ensure that energy transitions are just, inclusive and people-centred. Workers must be included in these discussions, and all stakeholders should collaborate to ensure new opportunities and quality jobs for the workers and communities that are impacted,” said Brian Motherway, Head of the IEA’s Office for Energy Efficiency and Inclusive Transitions. “To seize the opportunities ahead – and address the challenges – leaders must think locally, as well as nationally and internationally, as they design, implement and monitor new policies.

The metals (dysprosium, terbium and samarium) are used in permanent-magnet motors that power nearly every modern electric vehicle.

Until now, China produced and exported almost all of the global supply, handing Beijing the lever to squeeze or relax shipments at will. On 6 June 2025, that lever moved in Washington’s favor: China issued six-month export permits covering roughly 3,800 metric tons of heavy rare-earth oxides, enough to build an estimated four million EV motors. General Motors and Ford wasted no time calling the decision “welcome” and “stabilizing”.

Why these minerals are key to the industry

Electric drivetrains run hot, often more than 160 °F inside the motor casing. At those temperatures, ordinary neodymium-iron-boron magnets begin to lose strength. Mixing in a little dysprosium and terbium keeps the magnetic field stable, which means better range and stronger acceleration.

Each Ultium-platform SUV from GM uses around 160 grams of dysprosium, a quantity smaller than a smartphone, but irreplaceable in the current design. Ford’s next-generation F-150 Lightning motorsrely on the same recipe.

China sits on the only commercial-scale processing lines that separate these heavy rare-earths from ore. When Beijing tightened export rules last April, spot prices spiked 30 percent, and U.S. auto plants started mapping out worst-case shutdown plans. That crisis is now paused —though not solved— by the new license window.

What changed this month?

China granted six-month export permits to three of its biggest magnet suppliers, covering dysprosium, terbium and related magnets already under contract to GM, Ford and several smaller U.S. EV brands.

The permits free up about 3,800 metric tons of material (enough for roughly four million electric-car motors) and shave spot-market prices for dysprosium oxide by 8 percent in the first trading week.

How GM and Ford benefit

Production security. GM can now assemble about 400,000 Ultium-based vehicles without scrambling for substitutes. Ford avoids a planned ten-week slowdown at its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, keeping F-150 Lightning trucks rolling off the line.

Margin relief. An eight-percent drop in heavy rare-earth prices doesn’t show up as thousands of dollars on a sticker, but it shores up corporate forecasts. GM’s finance team estimates the reprieve protects roughly 0.3 percentage point of its 2025 operating margin—small on paper, big when multiplied across hundreds of thousands of units.

Both automakers have contracts pending with future U.S. magnet plants. The six-month window lets those domestic projects get closer to launch before existing inventories run low.

However, Beijing’s licenses run out in December. Chinese officials can extend, tighten or cancel them case-by-case, keeping leverage firmly in hand. Analysts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies point out that today’s relief could become tomorrow’s squeeze if trade tensions flare. That reality keeps pressure on Washington and Detroit to move fast on domestic alternatives.

What shoppers will notice

If you’ve had an eye on a Chevy Blazer EV, Equinox EV, or Mustang Mach-E, the news means fewer delays and steadier incentives. Late last year, some dealers dropped cash allowances because motor-magnet costs climbed.

With prices now dipping, those rebates are expected to stick through the summer. The average buyer won’t see a steep price cut—rare-earths are only a few hundred dollars of a $45,000 EV, but they won’t see a sudden jump either.

Cost versus timeline

In 2024 the Department of Energy set aside $800 million for magnet supply-chain projects. Even with streamlined permits, the average construction schedule runs about 30 months. A six-month reprieve fills only part of that gap, so a second or third license renewal may be needed before U.S. facilities take over.

The license boost doesn’t help just the Big Two. Rivian, Lucid and Tesla source magnets from the same Chinese giants. With materials now flowing, smaller EV makers avoid spot-market auctions and the cascading delays that hit German and Indian factories last year. Stable supply also trims risk premiums on new battery-plant financing, helping U.S. states lure investment with more predictable cost models.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ev-assembly-line.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 14:01:47.742516

“It’s becoming a test of our resiliency,” adds Sharpe, who notes Astemo is looking for alternatives to rare-earth magnets across the automotive industry.","FARMINGTON HILLS, MI – Supplier Astemo Americas shows off its latest technologies and vows to accelerate its advanced mobility investments while keeping a close eye on the tariff dispute between the U.S. and China, a battle that could lead to shortages of the rare-earth magnets used in components used across the auto industry.

Next-generation technologies for autonomous driving, electric vehicles, chassis, suspension, steering and braking were on display to the media here recently at Astemo Americas’ Detroit-area headquarters, with the supplier noting its goals are a future without accidents and a smaller environmental impact.

“As our industry moves into the age of the software-defined vehicle, Astemo aims to further strengthen as a leader in electrifications and mobility intelligence,” Tim Clark, CEO of Astemo Americas, tells media, adding the supplier is accelerating its investment in advanced mobility. Under that umbrella fall electrification, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous-driving technologies.

The ADAS technology on display here features a multi-camera system that uses artificial intelligence to develop automated driving solutions.

The camera-based system and proprietary AI is less expensive and more effective than lidar, according to John Nunneley, Astemo senior vice president of design engineering and IT, who says some of the features could show up on new vehicles before the end of the decade.

The system can combine signals from the powertrain and chassis and calculate the expected and predicted trajectory and guide the driver to a better path.

Astemo also is advancing new technology for suspensions, such as a camera mounted in a vehicle’s nose to preview road surfaces and potential bumps. It has AI-powered control logic to adjust the suspension on the fly, according to Harsha Badarinarayan, Astemo vice president of advanced engineering. Other new suspension features from Astemo include a damper system for off-road vehicles that can be calibrated first using AI in a virtual lab, which eliminates the need for physical prototypes, Badarinarayan says.

Another future-looking technology is Astemo’s latest braking tech, featuring an electro-mechanical brake-by-wire system that could help steer the vehicle to safety in an emergency. Dubbed Smart Brake, the technology reduces the lag between the pressure from the driver and brake response. Astemo officials say the e-pedal design, because it eliminates the traditional hydraulic connection between pedal and brake, has caught the attention of European manufacturers, who face regulatory pressure to minimize the use of fluids in their vehicles.

The supplier says the new brake-by-wire tech also can simplify assembly, help extend battery range and reduce the need for maintenance.

Astemo is emerging as a major Tier 1 supplier, following a series of acquisitions and its separation from Hitachi, the Japanese electronics giant. It is preparing for an IPO next year, according to Clark, and currently is part of a joint-venture company controlled by Hitachi, Honda and JIC Capital. These changes have led to a name change to Astemo Americas from Hitachi Astemo in the Americas.

The Americas region accounts for about $5 billion of the supplier’s $16 billion in annual revenue, and among its largest automaker customers are Honda, General Motors, Ford, Nissan and Volvo. The U.S.-based business is doing well enough that it has outgrown its current headquarters and technical center in this Detroit suburb and is looking for another site in the area, according to Clark.

Rare-Earth Shortage Fears

While Astemo Americas is touting future technologies, it is keeping close watch on the present state of the auto industry. Clark says he’s tracking the feud over tariffs between the U.S. and China, a dispute that threatens to cut off the supply of magnets used across the industry for electric motors, both large and small, for speakers and other vehicle components.

The concerns revolve around China’s decision to curtail exports of rare-earth magnets. China has relented to a small degree so the magnets can be exported if they are built into a component.

“It’s getting to be a real problem,” says Clark, noting some suppliers in the U.S. already have been forced to curtail production, which could threaten vehicle assemblies across the country. “It’s taking longer to get the export licenses from China,” adds Rob Sharpe, Astemo senior vice president of sales and marketing. “It’s becoming something like the semiconductor crisis,” when the pandemic earlier in the decade created unanticipated shortages of a key building block of modern vehicles.

Astemo, like other suppliers, is scrambling to prepare for shortages triggered by the tariff spat. “It’s becoming a test of our resiliency,” adds Sharpe, who notes Astemo is looking for alternatives to rare-earth magnets across the automotive industry.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt7121b6ec5c11097b/blte997d2553d8d7ac1/6849d84aefd8698605b9ff3a/Hitachi_Ashtemo.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-13 08:01:51.490572

A minority staff report from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee released in May called the administration’s actions a “war on science.”

But amid these cuts, the administration plans to prioritize an environmental program that cleans up toxic waste dumps, also known as Superfund sites.

There are 1,340 Superfund sites in the US. They’re in nearly every state, and many are located near residential areas. An estimated 78 million people—almost a quarter of Americans—live within three miles of a Superfund site.

These sites are some of the most polluted places in the country and often contain highly toxic and cancer-causing materials, such as cyanide, arsenic, dioxin, and asbestos. Some Superfund sites were once home to industrial manufacturing plants, while others are the result of mining operations and military activities.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has overseen the Superfund program since its creation in 1980 and follows a systematic, science-based process for cleaning up these toxic waste sites. The process can take years, even decades. But under the second Trump administration, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has signalled the agency plans to accelerate Superfund cleanups.

“Each Superfund site has its own unique circumstances and challenges, but the overall posture of the Trump EPA is that we want to expedite every timeline possible,” Zeldin said in an email to Bloomberg Law in May.

What Worsening Floods Mean For Superfund Sites

Some environmental lawyers say the administration is emphasizing toxic waste cleanup because these projects have tangible results and are often popular with voters.

“ Cleaning up contaminated sites provides photo-op ready wins,” says Nicole Weinstein, a principal who specializes in Superfund litigation at Beveridge & Diamond in New York City. “Digging up dirty dirt or placing a cap on a contaminated site is visible, easy to understand, and important to communities.”

Superfund cleanups are also focused on past actions, rather than imposing new regulations on businesses, which can be politically risky.

“ Everybody wants to be safe from hazardous chemicals,” says Ben Gibson, counsel at Latham & Watkins in San Diego, California. “There are major partisan disagreements about things like climate change or the scope of permitting requirements. But with Superfund, we actually have a common goal as a country of cleaning up sites that are endangering human health or the environment.”

Some U.S. lawmakers, however, have expressed concerns that mass layoffs within the EPA and a dramatically reduced budget will hinder the agency’s ability to accelerate Superfund cleanups. The Trump administration has proposed cutting the EPA’s overall budget by more than half—from $9.1 billion to $4.2 billion—and eliminating nearly 1,300 jobs. The Superfund program would see a $254 million cut in funding, under the administration’s budget proposal.

“When budgets are cut, work slows down,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said at a Senate hearing in April. “The winners from slashing EPA’s budget and staffing and kneecapping the Superfund program are the planet’s biggest polluters.”

The Trump administration has justified Superfund budget cuts by highlighting taxes on the chemical industry that help finance the program. The Superfund program also received $3.5 billion in funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law under the Biden administration.

Cleaning Up World War II-Era Radioactive Waste

Since his confirmation in January, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has visited several Superfund sites, including the West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri. The landfill, which sits between St. Louis Lambert International Airport and the Missouri River, contains thousands of cubic yards of radioactive waste.

The radioactive waste buried in the landfill is a remnant of the Manhattan Project, a top-secret government effort to develop atomic weapons during World War II. In the 1940s, workers in St. Louis processed 50,000 tons of uranium, which was used in some of the nation’s first atomic weapons tests. Hundreds of thousands of tons of radioactive waste were later dumped across the St. Louis region, including in the West Lake Landfill.

During his visit to St. Louis in March, Zeldin met with community members who have been sickened by the contamination.

“As somebody who doesn’t live here in this community, and I’m here for the first time hearing these stories from the people who lived here, to hear this multi-generationally where people are talking about their grandkids, this is something that should have been addressed a very long time ago,” Zeldin said.

Cleanup of the landfill, which was designated a Superfund site in 1990, was originally set to begin in 2029. But at Zeldin’s request, EPA staffers put together a revised timeline, which bumps the project start date up to 2027.

When asked whether budget and personnel cuts at the EPA will affect the agency’s ability to clean up the radioactive waste, Zeldin said he doesn’t expect staffing to be an issue. The agency, he said, plans to pivot away from studying Superfund sites and instead focus on cleanup efforts.

“There are billions of dollars that we’ve now been able to free up,” he said. “My goal is that if a dollar is spent, that the dollar is spent on directly remediating the environmental issue. I do not want to see a dollar spent to some group to tell us that we have an issue that needs to get dealt with.”

But environmental lawyers say research is an integral part of the Superfund cleanup process.

“It’s critical to study each site and understand the pathways of contamination, the way that contaminants interact with our environment, with people. They all differ and you have to look at the specific site,” says environmental lawyer Nicole Weinstein. If you make assumptions about a site, you can end up with an expensive remedy that’s ultimately ineffective, she says.

In St. Louis, activists who have waited years for the radioactive waste to be removed are cautiously optimistic. Longtime resident Karen Nickel has been fighting to get the Superfund site cleaned up for more than a decade and met Zeldin during his trip to St. Louis.

“One of the most important things he did when he came in, is he put the hammer down,” Nickel says. “What we saw in that meeting was pretty powerful and impactful. There’s just that little bit of movement, and when you have that, it does give this community hope.”

After reviewing the revised timeline with fellow St. Louis activist Dawn Chapman, Nickel says she believes it’s an achievable goal. But, she adds, even after the radioactive contamination is removed, its legacy will be felt for generations.

“This will never end for us,” she says. “We don’t get to just wipe away the devastation that we have seen in our community with these illnesses. … Worrying about our own children and our grandchildren and their children is going to be a lifelong battle.”

,EVs,2025-06-13 10:05:38+00:00,Carbon Brief,US: Trump blocks California electric vehicle rules in latest move to rein in the state,Not Available,,,,,https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/us-trump-blocks-california-electric-vehicle-rules-in-latest-move-to-rein-in-the-state/,"Among the “loopholes” being proposed is the use of “controversial” international carbon credits, the article notes.
As it does so, Politico says the company “quietly closed the door this week on a goal to make only electric vehicles by 2035”.
While the company is not retreating from electric vehicles, the article cites analysts who say that the new investment will make GM’s target unachievable.
The article notes that “it was not immediately clear what steps France would take”, given the EU-wide 2035 target.
In its coverage, the Daily Telegraph blames a “downturn in demand for electric vehicles”.","In what the New York Times calls “his latest attempt to reduce the power of the nation’s most populous state”, US president Donald Trump has signed legislation seeking to block California’s effort to phase out fossil fuel-powered vehicles. The newspaper explains that the Republican-led Congress passed resolutions in May to reverse the Biden administration’s approval of California’s efforts to boost electric vehicle sales. The president has now signed these joint resolutions “at a time when he was battling California on several fronts, most notably in a dispute over immigration enforcement”, it adds. The “ambitious” and “landmark” rules being advanced in California would eventually have barred sales of new petrol and diesel-only cars in the state by 2035, according to the Los Angeles Times. It says attorneys general immediately filed a lawsuit to challenge Trump’s laws, arguing that “Congress unlawfully acted to upend California’s emission rules”. Among the rules that Trump has reversed were measures to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks, according to the Associated Press. The Guardian explains that California has “for decades been able to seek waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency that have allowed the state to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government”, due in part to its high air pollution. Inside Climate News notes that California is joined in its legal complaint by 10 states that follow its “pioneering emissions standards”.

Meanwhile, the Republican-led House of Representatives has voted to pass Trump’s proposal to cancel $9.4bn in previously approved federal funding, including $8.3bn for foreign aid, NBC News reports. [As Carbon Brief has previously reported, climate aid programmes have been targeted specifically by the administration’s aid cuts.] Politico reports that the Trump administration is also working on a new effort to “weaken Congress’ grip on the federal budget”, aiming to freeze billions of dollars more in spending at several government agencies. It says that the Office of Management and Budget is targeting $100m in science funds for NASA, which includes climate research. Inside Climate News covers analysis from the University of Maryland that finds Trump’s climate-policy rollbacks will reduce US gross domestic product (GDP) by $1.1tn by 2035. Another article in the same publication focuses on how the administration’s removal of federal tax credits could “kill” the rapidly growing US solar industry. And Axios reports that a business-backed group with Republican ties called Built for America is running an advertising campaign on right-leaning news outlets to preserve federal tax credits for the energy sector.

Following on from the news yesterday, the Guardian has an article analysing the impact of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversing power-plant pollution standards. It notes that rather than benefiting “Americans”, any financial savings “will go entirely to power plant operators”. Scientific American has a piece titled “inside the EPA’s attempt to roll back climate regulation”.

Meanwhile, for the first time in three decades, the US will not attend the annual climate summit in Bonn, Germany, which has long served as a “stepping stone” to broader international talks at the COP climate summits later in the year, E&E News reports. The move follows the Trump administration announcing the nation’s departure from the Paris Agreement. Finally, the Financial Times reports on a new initiative, led by the $12.5bn Climate Investment Fund, which aims to help developing countries decarbonise sectors such as cement and steel. The article says multilateral financiers are going ahead with the initiative “despite the pushback from the Trump administration”.

China’s offshore wind power generation last year grew by 28%, compared to 2024, according to a report by the Ministry of Natural Resources, industry media outlet International Energy Network says. It also notes that the number of “newly approved sea- and island-use projects” last year rose 70%, “effectively securing…[China’s] needs for [more] major oil and gas and offshore wind projects”. He Kebin, dean of the Tsinghua University Institute for Carbon Neutrality Research, pointed out that technological challenges remains one of the biggest “obstacles” to achieving the “dual carbon goals”, with about half of the technologies needed still at the “experimental stage”, including the “low-carbon fuels…carbon storage and negative-carbon technologies”, commerce newspaper National Business Daily reports. The National Energy Administration called on officials to develop areas with a good “business environment for electricity use”, including with a “power supply of high-quality, green power”, energy news outlet BJX News reports. Business newspaper China Economic Daily says China has developed “world-leading electrified railway technology”.

Meanwhile, China is likely to “cut imports of the lowest grades of coal” due to oversupply and “tightened emissions controls”, Bloomberg reports. As the coal industry shifts from “scale to quality”, industry players have acknowledged that the operation of coal-fired power will “undergo profound changes” to play a “support role” in energy security, reports BJX News. International Energy Net covers the launch of the outlet’s “energy data” report for 2025, in which it says coal-fired power consumption has “not yet peaked”, but has “significantly slowed” and become “highly dependent on industry fluctuations”.

An opinion article in state-supporting newspaper Global Times says western news outlets have been “rolling out a predictable set of suspicions” around the security of Chinese electric vehicles and “green innovation originating in China”, adding that the technologies’ “popularity, especially in the global south, is the clearest and strongest rebuttal to the Western smear campaign”. An opinion article in China Energy Network by Tao Guangyuan, executive director of the Sino-German Renewable Energy Center, urges China to follow Germany’s example of “consum[ing] excess wind power in all areas where fossil energy is used”. Finally, Najib Saad, the secretary-general of the Arab Forum for Environment and Development, says in a commentary for state-run newspaper China Daily that the new US administration’s “climate change policies are perhaps the most striking example of [its] moral decline”.

With the European Commission about to release a new climate target – expected to be a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, from 1990 levels – Politico has conducted a “survey” of the EU’s 27 environment and climate ministries to gauge views on the goal. It finds that only six countries have offered “more or less unconditional support” for the target, with the rest seeking “industry-friendly compromises” that will make it easier to meet. Among the “loopholes” being proposed is the use of “controversial” international carbon credits, the article notes.

A separate Politico article reports that, as lawmakers in the European parliament and country delegations in the Council of the EU discuss proposals to simplify the EU’s environmental rules for companies, a decision has been made to “distance technical experts from the simplification work”. Meanwhile, the Financial Times reports that the European Commission’s competition directorate is blocking an effort to allow governments to subsidise the clean-energy sector’s operating costs using state aid. DeSmog has an article about how “US climate science deniers” are lobbying to undermine the EU’s corporate sustainability due diligence directive, which seeks to align large companies with the Paris Agreement. An article in Euractiv says environmental NGOs are urging EU ministers not to roll back the bloc’s methane regulations.

Finally, Bloomberg reports that a draft of the European Commission’s plan to scale up nuclear power as part of the bloc’s 2050 net-zero target shows that the effort will cost €241bn ($280bn). This poses funding challenges, with market-based instruments to fund the expansion “lacking”, according to outlet’s coverage of the document.

Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturer BYD has launched its cheapest and smallest electric vehicle in Europe, a model called the Dolphin Surf, which will retail for around $25,000 in the UK and EU, Semafor reports. The article describes this as a sign of “the Chinese electric-vehicle price war spread[ing] worldwide”, noting that the price is still three times the domestic one paid in China, partly thanks to tariffs. With other companies releasing their own compact models in order to compete, Semafor notes that the release could help bring electric-vehicle prices in line with those of petrol cars. “Analysts suggest that BYD has a lot of room to cut the price of the Dolphin Surf further,” the Guardian states. However, in an interview with Bloomberg, BYD executive vice president Stella Li describes China’s electric vehicle price war as “not sustainable”. She “stopped short of saying the country’s largest electric-vehicle maker would scale back the aggressive discounting it helped trigger”, the article adds. Elsewhere, the Independent covers a study that finds Europe, China and the US “will all struggle to produce enough lithium domestically to satisfy the demand for electric vehicle batteries”.

Meanwhile, General Motors is investing $4bn to produce more fossil fuel-driven vehicles in the US to deal with “high tariffs and low demand for electric vehicles”, Axios says. As it does so, Politico says the company “quietly closed the door this week on a goal to make only electric vehicles by 2035”. While the company is not retreating from electric vehicles, the article cites analysts who say that the new investment will make GM’s target unachievable. In France, Reuters reports that the industry minister Marc Ferracci has said he is “ready” to think about relaxing the ban on the sale of fossil-fuel cars by 2035. The article notes that “it was not immediately clear what steps France would take”, given the EU-wide 2035 target. Amid this, data from market research firm Rho Motion shows that global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 24% in May, compared to the same period last year, “as strength in China offset slower growth in North America”, Reuters reports.

Finally, France energy giant EDF has agreed to buy Pod Point – which has a network of more than 250,000 electric-car charging points in the UK – for £10.6m, after the company “grappled with weaker electric-vehicle sales and a plunging share price”, according to the Press Association. In its coverage, the Daily Telegraph blames a “downturn in demand for electric vehicles”. [In reality, electric-vehicle sales have continued to grow and have already exceeded 2024’s total-year sales this year.] The Times also has the story.

Germany’s Green party is pushing the federal government to expropriate the Schwedt refinery from Russia’s oil giant Rosneft, which is headed by “a close associate” of Russian president Vladimir Putin. The newspaper quotes the Green MP Michael Kellner, who emphasises that the move would “show unity with Europe and send a clear signal to Putin”. According to the New York Times, in its efforts to reduce the energy dependence on Russian gas, Germany is building facilities to enable more liquefied “natural” gas (LNG) imports, especially from the US. The outlet notes that since the summer of 2022, Europe has been increasing its LNG capacity by about 30% each year, with a significant portion of this increase occurring in Germany. In addition, Süddeutsche Zeitung reports that Germany’s new gas power plants will be concentrated in southern Germany, where the government plans a “southern bonus”.

Meanwhile, Die Zeit highlights findings from the heat vulnerability assessment by not-for-profit Deutsche Umwelthilfe, which shows that cities in southern Germany are especially exposed to heat stress. It also notes that, according to the Robert Koch Institute, around 6,000 people in Germany died due to extreme heat in 2023 and 2024, with deaths occurring in “densely built-up cities with little greenery, lots of concrete and a high proportion of socially disadvantaged population groups”. Tagesschau notes that Germany is “disproportionately affected by global warming”, with temperatures now reaching 2.5C above pre-industrial levels.

Finally, the Kyiv Independent reports that the EU and Germany have added €18m to Ukraine’s Energy Efficiency Fund to boost its “energy independence and green recovery”.

Climate scientist Kate Marvel has an essay in the Wall Street Journal, adapted from part of her upcoming book, on why a “Plan B” of “geoengineering” will be required alongside other efforts to tackle climate change. Geoengineering, she explains, involves “deliberately manipulating our planet’s atmosphere and climate”. She describes different technologies that could be employed, including using aerosols to reduce the solar radiation reaching the planet, direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide (CO2) and dumping an “antacid” of rock dust into the oceans to reduce ocean acidification. Marvel acknowledges that these technologies are controversial – with “unpredictable” and potentially “catastrophic” consequences – but argues that “in a true emergency, you throw everything you have at the problem”. She writes that all of the methods she outlines “have the potential to help, if deployed correctly. The problem is that none has been attempted on a large scale, so no one knows for sure what the impacts might be.” Marvel notes that “with so much at stake, cooling the planet should be a decision made by all of humanity”, but laments the lack of global institutions capable of overseeing such a consensus.

Writing in his Climate Brink newsletter, Carbon Brief climate science contributor Zeke Hausfather looks into what the latest World Meteorological Organization temperature projections mean for the Paris Agreement’s 1.5C warming target. He writes: “If we use the central estimates from the report…they would likely imply a crossing date for 1.5C…that would be earlier than previously expected.”",,N,,2025-06-13 07:59:37.273085

Now some clean energy advocates are concerned about potential job losses, higher utility bills, more spending on energy and lost investments.
“When we make clean energy less economic, less of it gets built and we’re more reliant on fossil fuels that have higher prices,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a clean energy and climate policy think tank, during an Environmental Defense Fund news conference last week.
Will Scott, southeast director of climate and clean energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group, said North Carolina is ninth in the nation for clean energy jobs, with more than 100,000 people working in the clean energy sector.

Josh Stein and North Carolina’s clean energy industry are sounding the alarm on the impact provisions included in Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act could have on the industry and household utility bills.

Members of the U.S. House proposed clawing back the clean energy tax credits created in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for buying clean vehicles, making energy-efficient improvements to homes, building energy-efficient homes or making and selling clean-energy components, among other things.

The tax credits encourage businesses and homeowners to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Now some clean energy advocates are concerned about potential job losses, higher utility bills, more spending on energy and lost investments.

“When we make clean energy less economic, less of it gets built and we’re more reliant on fossil fuels that have higher prices,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a clean energy and climate policy think tank, during an Environmental Defense Fund news conference last week.

Will Scott, southeast director of climate and clean energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group, said North Carolina is ninth in the nation for clean energy jobs, with more than 100,000 people working in the clean energy sector.

Those include projects centering on:

batteries

solar

zero-emissions vehicles

critical minerals

wind

energy storage

Companies announced plans for more than 20,000 clean energy jobs in North Carolina over eight years, with $24 billion in planned capital spending, according to a list released by state government in December under then-Gov. Roy Cooper.

Announced projects include those from:

Wolfspeed

Toyota

Boom Supersonic

Boviet Solar

Natron Energy

And many of these businesses spent money with the promise that some of the tax credits would be available to them.

Individuals also took advantage of the tax breaks, with 85,350 North Carolinians receiving the home efficiency tax credit, saving $2,035 on average, according to a fact sheet from Climate Power, which describes itself as “a strategic communications organization focused on winning the politics of climate.”

Stein urged Congress to protect the tax credits.

“Congress’ proposed repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act could cost North Carolina tens of thousands of jobs by 2030, along with billions in clean energy investments spurred by clean energy and manufacturing tax credits,” the Democratic governor said in a news release on May 28. “Repealing the credits could also raise electricity costs for North Carolina families by $200 per year.”

North Carolina’s 10 House Republicans helped pass the bill through their chamber and onto the Senate.

The House Freedom Caucus warned senators last week if they “stripped out” or watered down” what they called the “IRA Green New Scam rollbacks” they would not accept the bill when it returns to the House.

Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican from Texas, wrote in May that the IRA helped line the pockets of billionaires while building “ineffective, unattractive, and unwanted energy projects.”

“The House Freedom Caucus Board will stand united holding the line,” the House’s most far-right members wrote in a news release. “The American people didn’t send us here to cave to the swamp — they sent us here to change it.”

But members of Congress say they’re hearing continually from industry officials about how the proposal is already harming their companies.

NC’s Thom Tillis steps in

There, Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from Huntersville, is trying to help cushion some of the blow clean energy businesses might face from the IRA repeals.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune received a letter from Tillis, co-signed by Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska; John Curtis, of Utah and Jerry Moran, of Kansas, urging him to consider the potential fallout to businesses and people who invested in clean energy based on the current credits offered.

They told Thune they were most concerned about cutting tax credits for qualified facilities that generate electricity with zero greenhouse gas emissions; for investing in property producing clean energy, including energy storage technology, or for domestic manufacturing with clean energy components like solar, wind, battery, inverter components or critical minerals.

Tillis, Murkowski, Curtis and Moran urged Thune to consider whether the existing tax credits do one of three things:

Spurs new domestic manufacturing and investment;

Reduces utility bills for consumers, especially in rural, remote areas;

Ensures certainty for businesses that have already spent money in the United States based on the current credit structure.

American companies have made substantial investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure based on the current tax framework, they told Thune.

“A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,” the senators wrote.

And they voiced concern that any modifications to the tax code needed to be done without worsening economic pressures on households and businesses.

“For energy credits that provide a direct passthrough benefit to ratepayers, repeals would translate into immediate utility bill increases, placing additional strain on hardworking Americans,” the senators wrote.

But they also said they weren’t against reforms within the tax system to ensure efficiency, accountability, fiscal sustainability and implementation that follows the rule of law.

“We urge a targeted, pragmatic approach that balances these priorities without undercutting current and future private sector investments that are vital to domestic manufacturing, energy innovation and affordability for American families,” the senators wrote.

Tillis’ senior adviser, Daniel Keylin, told McClatchy that Tillis wants to ensure the bill does not unintentionally cost jobs or capital when identifying cost savings.

“Sen. Tillis is not trying to keep these energy tax credits but rather phase them out over time so the jobs created and capital invested will not be lost,” Keylin said. “This also plays a role in supporting an all-of-the-above approach to American energy independence and meeting the energy demands of our nation’s AI advancements.”

Last week, when the Environmental Defense Fund hosted its news conference, many industry leaders echoed the concerns of Stein and Tillis and said they found some relief that Tillis was showing support for the industry.

“Repealing these incentives would not only damage our economy, but it would leave us ill prepared to tackle the rapidly rising demand for energy that is coming fast in North Carolina,” Scott said.

Scott said he’s hopeful that Tillis and Budd “fight to protect the incentives that are fueling the North Carolina clean energy boom and delivering real benefits to our state.”",https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/2j70pc/picture287104920/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_4922.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:59:16.593819

Patrick Morrisey, in a news release Wednesday, called the EPA’s proposal a “major victory” for West Virginia.
West Virginia is home to several of the nation’s highest greenhouse gas emitters.
Carbon dioxide was by far the highest emitted greenhouse gas, with 52.3 million metric tons — about 81% of all emissions — coming from 113 facilities in West Virginia.
According to the data, there were also 11.4 million metric tons of methane released by West Virginia facilities and 233,038 metric tons of nitrous oxide released in 2023.","West Virginia elected officials this week celebrated proposals from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to roll back regulations on emissions from power plants that advocates worry will threaten public health as well as the environment.

The standards the EPA is looking to ease require existing coal-fired and new natural gas power plants to cut 90% of carbon emissions and tightens emission standards for toxic metals like mercury from coal-fired power plants by 70%.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin officially announced the proposed regulatory changes at a news conference Wednesday, where he was joined by Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va, among other congressional representatives from across the country.

Zeldin said the regulations are responsible for increased power costs. Loosening them, he believes, could lower power bills for households across the nation.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told West Virginia Public Broadcasting Wednesday that she was “thrilled” about the proposed changes as she has “long opposed” the standards because of potentially “devastating economic impacts” and “energy reliability concerns.”

Gov. Patrick Morrisey, in a news release Wednesday, called the EPA’s proposal a “major victory” for West Virginia.

“These rules were a direct assault on our coal communities, designed to force a rapid transition away from fossil fuels by imposing unworkable emissions standards on existing power plants,” Morrisey said. “This action by Administrator Zeldin restores constitutional order and delivers long-overdue relief to states like West Virginia that have been unfairly targeted for years.”

As the state’s attorney general, Morrisey successfully argued to the Supreme Court of the United States in a 2022 decision that the EPA lacks the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by changing standards for existing plants without action by Congress.

“We kept fighting and ultimately won at the highest court in West Virginia v. EPA, a decisive ruling that reaffirmed what we had argued all along: major policy decisions like reshaping our energy grid must come from Congress, not from unelected federal bureaucrats,” Morrisey said Wednesday.

The regulations being targeted by the EPA now were enacted through separate acts under President Barack Obama in 2015 and President Joe Biden in 2024. Zeldin on Wednesday emphasized that, at this point, the changes are only proposed. The public will have 45 days to comment on the changes.

Through the rollbacks, the EPA is questioning whether emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants actually “significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution.” Since the pollutants are “global in nature,” according to the agency, “any potential public health harms have not been accurately attributed to emissions from the U.S. power sector.”

Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — as well as other greenhouse gases — are known to be the leading cause of climate change worldwide as they trap heat in the atmosphere which warms the planet. They are also known to increase air pollution and smog, contributing to asthma and other respiratory conditions for people who live in places with high concentrations of them in the air.

“Corporate polluters with access to the Trump administration make more money when they don’t have to worry about protecting our communities’ health, but the rest of us in Appalachia and across the country will feel the negative impacts,” said Chelsea Barnes, the director of government affairs at Appalachian Voices, a regional environmental advocacy group. “This action by the EPA, paired with the broad cancellation of billions of dollars in federal grants meant to help people clean up pollution and congressional and agency efforts to skip and eliminate environmental review for new polluting projects, will undoubtedly make Americans less healthy and less safe.”

According to the Sierra Club, coal plants in Kentucky, West Virginia and Southeastern Ohio could see a 72% increase in carbon emissions if the current standards are repealed.

West Virginia is home to several of the nation’s highest greenhouse gas emitters. In 2023, the state was the 12th highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the country, per data from the EPA. Power plants, according to the EPA data, were the largest emitter in the state, accounting for 72.25% of all emissions from 13 different facilities.

The state’s Harrison Power Station — which is operated by Mon Power, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. — was the ninth highest emitter of greenhouse gases nationally in 2023, releasing about 11.18 million metric tons of greenhouse gases into the environment.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it was moving forward with two efforts. The first would repeal all greenhouse gas emissions standards for the power sector under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The other would repeal amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) which also target coal-fired power plants. In a statement Wednesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that leaving these regulations in place would cause the nation’s remaining coal-fired power plants to close, increase electricity costs on customers, and put strain on an electrical grid with increasing demands on it from data centers. “Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream and a natural byproduct of national energy dominance,” Zeldin said. “According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence.” The EPA released new regulations last year that would have required coal-fired power plants to reduce their greenhouse gas emission by 90% by 2039, moving up a previous requirement by one year. Plants could also utilize underground carbon capture and sequestration to meet the 90% requirement. The new regulations included stricter limits on mercury emissions, the amount of seepage of coal ash into local waterways, and the amount of wastewater discharge from plants. According to the EPA’s own estimates, repealing these regulations could save the electricity industry as much as $19 billion in regulatory costs over a two-decade period beginning next year, while repealing the 2024 MATS Amendments could save as much as $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade. According to the state Public Energy Authority, West Virginia has nine coal-fired power plants accounting for 88.9% of the electricity generated in the state, or a combined net summer capacity of more than 13,000 megawatts. The EPA’s emission standards date back to 2015 under former President Barack Obama. The Attorney General’s Office – under former attorney general Patrick Morrisey – secured two victories against the EPA before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 and 2022 over the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and in defense of a new Affordable Clean Energy Rule recommended during Trump’s first term. “Administrator Zeldin’s decision to withdraw the unlawful Greenhouse Gas Rule and the deeply flawed Mercury and Air Toxics Standards is a major victory for West Virginia, our energy producers, and every American who depends on reliable, affordable electricity,” said Morrisey, now serving as West Virginia’s 37th governor. “These rules were a direct assault on our coal communities, designed to force a rapid transition away from fossil fuels by imposing unworkable emissions standards on existing power plants,” Morrisey continued. “This action by Administrator Zeldin restores constitutional order and delivers long-overdue relief to states like West Virginia that have been unfairly targeted for years.” U.S. Shelley Moore Capito, the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, spoke with reporters Thursday afternoon during her weekly briefing from Capitol Hill. She called the EPA’s move an important step to unleashing energy independence. “I think the repeal of the Clean Power Plan 2.0 will return us to common sense,” said Capito, R-W.Va. “We are looking at a shortage of power in this country. We need more power, not less, and yet this Clean Power Plan would pull some of our baseload power off the grid. I think it would really put us in a perilous situation.” On the other side of the U.S. Capitol Building, U.S. Rep. Riley Moore said leaving the Biden-era coal-fired power plant rules in place would have resulted in job losses and potentially additional power plant closures in West Virginia. “The Biden-Harris war on affordable, reliable American energy ends today,” said Moore, R-W.Va. “By reversing these job-killing regulations, President Trump and Administrator Zeldin make it clear: the Green New Scam is over and American energy dominance is back. These EPA regulations would have shuttered every coal-fired power plant in America, bankrupted many coal mines, laid off thousands of coal miners, and driven up the cost of electricity for every American.” The move Wednesday by Trump’s EPA was not praised by all. The Sierra Club said Wednesday that repealing these regulations would allow coal-fired power plants to increase their carbon emissions seven times over current levels and increase the number of medical issues linked to increased mercury and other pollutants in the atmosphere. “It’s completely reprehensible that Donald Trump would seek to roll back these lifesaving standards and do more harm to the American people and our planet just to earn some brownie points with the fossil fuel industry,” said Patrick Drupp, climate policy director for the Sierra Club. “This repeal means more climate disasters, more heart attacks, more asthma attacks, more birth defects, more premature deaths. “This administration is transparently trading American lives for campaign dollars and the support of fossil fuel companies, and Americans ought to be disgusted and outraged that their government has launched an assault on our health and our future,” Drupp continued. “The Sierra Club will not stand by and let this corrupt administration destroy these critical, lifesaving guardrails.” Steven Allen Adams can be reached at sadams@newsandsentinel.com.

Clean energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration are under debate in the Senate. House Republicans voted to gut these programs, but not all of their fellow Republicans in the Senate are on board. NPR's Barbara Sprunt has more.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: President Trump has long talked about his frustrations with clean energy provisions signed into law by President Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act. Here he is at an April rally in Michigan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round.

(BOOING)

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

Michigan Republican Representative John James led the effort to get the resolution passed in the U.S. House. Michigan's Elissa Slotkin was the only Democratic senator to support the measure.

They said it's necessary to protect Michigan's auto industry.

California quickly announced it was challenging the resolution in court, with the state's attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump’s signing ceremony ended at the White House.

The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

Trump called California’s regulations “crazy” at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.

“It’s been a disaster for this country,” he said.

It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

The state is already involved in more than two dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state’s Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.

“The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. “They come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.”

The three resolutions Trump signed will block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.

“I like Tesla,” Trump said.

In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed “are killing our country,” the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he’d risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.

“I’ll take electrocution every single day,” the president said.

When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, “If you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.”

“What this does is it gives us freedom,” said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install “infrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn’t give you any return.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump’s action.

“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Newsom said Trump’s action was a continuation of his “all-out assault” on California.

“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Newsom said in a statement. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

Newsom later Thursday doubled down on his state’s assertion of its right to set environmental regulations. He signed an executive order requiring state air regulators to propose new rules further limiting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks if a court ultimately upholds California’s rules that Trump sought to kill.

Trump’s signing of the resolutions comes as he has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry.

Company last requested a regulatory review of rates in 2022

GREENVILLE, S.C., June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy Progress today asked South Carolina regulators to perform a public review of the company's current rates.

This is the company's first request to review rates since 2022. It comes as the company continues working to increase system diversity and reliability, enhance the customer experience and meet future energy demands.

Duke Energy Progress serves about 177,000 customers primarily in central and northeastern South Carolina.

By the numbers: The company's application in front of the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) requests an overall revenue increase of $74.8 million, which represents a 12.1% increase over current revenues.

If approved, monthly electric bills for typical residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase $21.66 a month – from $144.85 per month to $166.51 – effective Feb. 1, 2026. Commercial customers will see an average increase of 12.8% and industrial customers will see an average increase of around 3.6%. The amount of increase per customer class can vary based upon how much more additional revenue is needed to ensure that the class is covering the cost to serve them.

Why it matters: Duke Energy is committed to meeting customers' increasingly higher expectations around reliability, responsiveness, affordability and value.

This proposal reflects the investments we have made to strengthen the grid, improve storm readiness, maintain and enhance our generating fleet and serve a growing customer base.

It also reflects how the company is doing that work: with discipline, with a focus on operational excellence, and with a thoughtful approach to how and when we seek rate adjustments.

Investments in action: The company's grid investments have positioned it well for storm response.

For example, as Hurricane Helene made its way across the Carolinas, grid improvements were already helping to combat power outages from the storm.

Smart, self-healing technology installed across the Duke Energy Progress service territory helped to automatically restore more than 10,000 customer outages and saved more than 28,000 hours of total outage time, showing the value of the self-healing programs.

Our view:

""We know families and businesses are juggling a lot and we do not take a request to increase rates lightly but being upfront and timely with our request is the right thing to do and in the best interest of our customers."" – Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president

The UK Government has committed to allocating £14.2bn (US$16.4bn) to the construction of a new nuclear power station in Suffolk, England.

Sizewell C has been given the go-ahead and is set to be a 3,200 MWe power station with two reactors.

This project could be critical to the country's larger goal of sourcing its electricity from environmentally friendly sources by 2030.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “We will not accept the status quo of failing to invest in the future and energy insecurity for our country.

“We need new nuclear to deliver a golden age of clean energy abundance, because that is the only way to protect family finances, take back control of our energy and tackle the climate crisis.

“This is the government’s clean energy mission in action – investing in lower bills and good jobs for energy security.”

BYD and SEC: The World's Biggest Battery Storage Deal

10 June

Battery storage plays a growing role in energy systems, acting as a stabiliser for grids under pressure from rising renewable inputs.

These systems help smooth energy delivery, keep costs manageable and cut dependency on fossil fuels.

Now, BYD Energy Storage and Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) push this technology into new territory.

Their partnership is set to deliver a world-first: 15.1GWh of energy storage across Saudi Arabia.

BYD Energy Storage and SEC have finalised a deal to roll out 12.5GWh of new grid-scale battery storage, making it the largest project of its kind in the world.

Together with an earlier 2.6GWh project, the total capacity under their partnership now stands at a record 15.1GWh.

This agreement puts Saudi Arabia at the centre of energy transition efforts.

It aligns directly with Vision 2030 — a national programme that aims for renewables to account for 50% of electricity generation by the end of the decade.

The new systems will be installed across five different sites in the Kingdom and linked directly to the national transmission grid.

Harnessing nuclear fusion sounds like the stuff of fiction, and for a long time it has been.

This process of combining light atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus releases vast amounts of energy and powers the sun and all other stars.

TAE Technologies is working to deliver the world’s first commercial fusion power with the help of Google.

TAE has raised nearly US$1.3bn in equity capital since its inception and received support and collaboration from the tech giant for 10 years.

“We look forward to TAE’s continued progress with their distinctive pathway to fusion – one of our bets for a cleaner energy future.”

Michl Binderbauer, CEO of TAE Technologies, said: “We’re delighted to continue our relationship with Google, who have not only provided funding to TAE but collaborated closely in research and development over many years.""

Google has taken a significant step towards its 2030 carbon-free energy ambition by signing its first offshore wind power purchase agreement (PPA) in the Asia-Pacific region.

The agreement is with the 495MW Fengmiao I offshore wind project in Taiwan, developed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP).

Scheduled to begin operations in 2027, the Fengmiao I project will furnish clean energy to Google's facilities encompassing data centres, cloud regions and offices in Taiwan.

This step aligns with Google's overarching objective to operate on carbon-free energy continuously by the decade's end.

Fengmiao I is the first project from Taiwan’s Round 3.1 offshore wind auction to reach financial close.

This milestone is expected to catalyse further growth in Taiwan’s renewable energy market as the country works to meet rising energy demand while phasing out fossil fuels.

“Offshore wind is facing headwinds in several markets and therefore reaching financial close for Fengmiao I demonstrates our commitment to delivering offshore wind even in uncertain times,” says Jesper Krarup Holst, Partner and Head of APAC at CIP.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/04adec5b195ffcb8e4e045ce92b4d0cb:d261872a3ffb02a629aec8e2efce72db/szc-og-banner-2.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:58:54.731693

By Jack Grogan-Fenn

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed overhauling two Biden-era regulations that cap greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by power plants.

The two rules in the EPA’s crosshairs are the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). Specially, the agency has taken aim at Section 111 of the CAA which created stricter emissions standards for the power sector and amendments to MATS which have “directly result[ed] in coal-fired power plants having to shut down”.

The EPA is proposing scrapping the 2015 emissions standards for new fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Obama-Biden administration, as well as the 2024 rule for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants implemented during the Biden-Harris administration.

The Biden-led 2024 CAA aimed to strengthen clean air standards, reducing toxic air pollution by 6,200 tonnes each year. The aforementioned Section 111 of the act required new and modified sources of methane emissions to comply with more stringent guidelines and for US states to have similar standards for existing sources of GHG emissions.

In its statement outlining its rationale to remodel the rules, the EPA argued that potential public health harms from greenhouse gases have “not been accurately attributed” to emissions from the US power sector. It added that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution”.

The agency also claimed that repealing the rules could save the power sector as much as U$1.2 billion per year in regulatory costs over a 20-year period beginning in 2026, amounting to U$19 billion in total by 2046.

The EPA has proposed repealing the “most burdensome” requirements for new and existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating units. This includes emission guidelines for existing power plants, and carbon capture and sequestration requirements for new combustion turbines and modified coal plants.

When the 2024 Biden-Harris rule was introduced, the EPA’s regulatory impact analysis had estimated that 1.38 billion metric tonnes of total carbon dioxide would be avoided systemwide between 2028-2047. It had also projected that from 2024-2047 the regulation would galvanise net climate and public health benefits totalling more than U$370 billion, comprising U$270 billion in climate benefits, U$120 billion in health benefits, and U$19 billion in compliance costs.

While the EPA does not intend to eliminate the MATS, it intends to repeal amendments made in May 2024 which would see the standard revert to how it was in 2012.

The amendment had been made to addresses hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal-fired power plants by strengthening the mercury standard for lignite-fired plants.

The EPA claimed that the 2012 MATS saw mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants in 2021 be 90% lower than levels before the standard was introduced. The agency added that it estimates the proposed repeal of the 2024 MATS amendments would save U$1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade, around U$120 million per year.

The EPA had previously reported that the power sector was responsible 25% of GHG emissions in the US in 2022, the second most polluting sector behind only transport which generated 28% of such emissions.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who was selected to lead the agency by Donald Trump in November, had initially announced intentions to “reconsider” the two rules in March.

Data from the World Resources Institute previously showed that the US was the world’s second largest GHG emitter behind only China. The US, India and China, the world’s three largest GHG emitters, were collectively responsible for 42.6% of such emissions.

Tackling emissions is a key priority for investors. In November, Minerva Analytics reported that a coalition of 35 institutional investors representing more than U$2 trillion in assets had called on US states to develop, implement and enforce plans that meet or exceed the EPA’s federal methane standard to substantially reduce methane emissions from the country’s oil and gas sector.

This is the latest in a series of attacks on ESG under Trump’s administration. Last week, Minerva Analytics reported that the US Department of Labor was working to axe a Biden-era rule which permitted retirement plans to consider ESG factors when selecting investments.

The creation of a new rule on retirement plan fiduciaries being able to consider ESG factors when selecting plan investments is expected to be fast tracked by the DOL. Further details are anticipated in the Trump administration’s spring regulatory programme.

Further details are also imminently expected on a report from the US Attorney General Pam Bondi outlining actions taken against state-level ESG-related energy laws. Trump’s ‘Protecting American Energy from State Overreach’ Executive Order issued on April 8 stated that a report would be submitted to the President within 60 days, meaning the report should have been filed by June 7.

The order demanded the Attorney General identify and take “all appropriate action” against state laws that aim to address climate change or involve ESG initiatives, environmental justice, carbon or GHG emissions, and funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes.

(AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.
The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov.
“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said.

(AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.

The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro’s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.

JetZero has said it’s already raised about $300 million toward investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina’s robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.

“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.”

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project discussed earlier Thursday by a state committee that awards economic incentives.

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.35 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers’ paychecks. The incentives also include up to $785 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and up to $450 million from the General Assembly in part to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.

A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

“We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O’Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It’s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The 5-year-old company says the plane’s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.

“It’s going to deliver a better passenger experience than you’ve ever had before on any other plane,” O’Leary said.

Stein said the state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.

The world’s need for affordable, resilient, clean energy is rapidly becoming more important. Developed nations have seen a flatline in the energy generation required, but with the emergence of AI, data centres and hyperscalers, nations are realising they need a lot more power than they were expecting.

Data centres want secure energy; they don’t want energy that is intermittent, they want 100% energy all the time, with their own access to supplies, so they can ensure their centre will never go without power. But with this meaning the energy is no longer accessible by the grid, how do we ensure we’re also meeting the energy needs of the nation? And how do we do this alongside promoting the growth of this sector?

Right now, we have more choice of energy sources than we can actually utilise which, while good, means we’re slowing down the decision making on which option is going to answer our future needs.

One benefit of nuclear is that it’s not new. We can build nuclear reactors, we know the technology, and we understand it well. We have a high understanding of waste streams; we know where they come from and how to deal with them, we can track them, and we know that the waste generated is smaller than other technologies.

Nuclear provides a solid option for baseload power and larger population densities as it has a smaller landmass footprint. You can have a long term energy source like a small modular reactor (SMR) which can power for decades while taking up a fraction of the size of a conventional nuclear power reactor.

Feeding the world

The challenge we’re going to be facing is whether we have enough capacity in the market, across industry, across the world, to manufacture everything we need. We’re going to need a lot of pumps and valves, a lot of large vessels for other energy sources, including hydrogen and carbon capture.

Whichever sector you look at, they’re all pulling on the same manufacturing industry. If we’re all trying to get the same items, how do we utilise the industry best?

For the AMRC, we’re looking at solutions like electron beam welding. For large-scale, thick section, high integrity welds, this method can reduce the welding time by a factor of ten; we can weld a large 2m diameter weld in around two hours, as opposed to 200, potentially producing ten times as many vessels in the same amount of time. And this technique uses less energy, with less CO2 emissions.

But we’re already seeing a shortage in welders and machinists. If we can utilise our workforce better, alongside higher advanced manufacturing techniques, we can achieve the rates we’re expecting to need in the future.

To better our workforce, we need people trained in welding, machining, and inspection techniques – if we can give them the tools to be productive, we give ourselves the future rates. This skills gap needs to be filled by a combination of young people, and upskilled workforces.

Young people need to be shown that this is an exciting industry; manufacturing isn’t what it was 50 years ago, it’s high tech, high value, meeting global challenges. Being part of the manufacturing industry means being a part of a valuable future that you’re making a contribution to; our energy future.

The generation already in our workforce have the skills and understanding of what we’re doing, but how do you apply that to advanced manufacturing? There’s an enormous opportunity in transitioning staff from industries in decline; showing them there is value in joining this emerging industry. The fossil fuel and gas industry use the same materials, the same vessels, and they’re used to high-value, fast-paced jobs. The steel industry has been hit hard recently, and those skills in metallurgy and welding are exactly what we need in nuclear manufacturing.

In for the long haul

Traditional plants have been operating for over 80 years now, and they’re still operating today. Nuclear is a long-term energy source, so it’s a long-term sector. We build a nuclear plant today, and you’re looking at jobs for 80 plus years.

We have a very regulated and safety-conscious industry, and that’s a good thing. It’s important to show the public we’re safe and reliable. We’re de-risking before a concept or product even reaches the market, and by being such a strong regulator, the UK finds other nations looking at nuclear programmes, turning to us for our strong skillset and experience. There’s a real opportunity here for the UK to export to global markets.

One of the biggest projects the AMRC is working on right now is with the United States Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). After starting roughly eight years ago with a key vision of asking if we can reduce the manufacturing time of a large nuclear vessel by 50% and the cost by around 40%, we’ve answered the question – yes! We identified advanced manufacturing techniques that could achieve the goals; electron beam welding, diode laser cladding and Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP).

But the biggest driver is showing that there is a need in industry to manufacture at this rate. Right now we’re showing that these technologies can be used, these targets can be hit, but since we’ve overcome the challenges, we have to show that now is the time to invest in advanced manufacturing technologies, in preparation for potential future demand.

The AMRC: harnessing multiple technologies under one roof

We’ve made the vessels using representative-sized components and demonstrated the actual manufacturing and fabrication methods for SMR pressure vessels. The AMRC has the unique capability of being able to bring those three technologies together into one fabrication; they’ve been demonstrated individually, but this vessel brings everything into one demonstrator.

That’s what makes the AMRC so powerful: in one location we’ve done the machining, welding and inspection; we’ve fabricated a whole vessel instead of individual parts, overcoming issues that might be encountered in the future, and all under one roof. From design and production, through to digital work instructions and tools.

And nuclear manufacturing has scope across the UK’s manufacturing sectors. Anything done on the AMRC’s shopfloor only becomes nuclear when you look at the codes, standards and regulations; a large vessel is the same in any petrochemical industry. Most of a nuclear plant is identical to other generation plants, it only comes down to the heat source that you’re using to generate the steam. As we see hydrogen moving forwards, we’ll see composite vessels on the market, but there will also be large steel vessels needed.

Nuclear is one of the safest industries in the world. We have the challenge that when something goes wrong, it can be a significant issue, but we’ve done this for many years. We have systems in place to address that.

If we want to compete on a global scale in manufacturing, if we want to have data centres, and lead in AI, the energy source has to be affordable and secure. We need affordable, resilient, secure, clean energy. We’ve made commitments as a nation to be clean. If we want to meet those commitments, nuclear has to play a role.",https://www.pesmedia.com/image-assets/c8fb1c47d1a9c716ceded32255daaafa.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:01:03.417284

Chile has reduced its coal use from over 40 percent in 2016 to less than 20 percent in 2024 through aggressive carbon pricing and renewable energy.

Renewable energy sources have become economically superior to coal across the continent.

Chile's dramatic transition

For the first time in history, the entire continent has zero new coal power plants planned. This is a marked change from 2015, when the Paris Agreement was signed and 18 coal power plants were on the drawing board in South America.

Chile represents the clearest change on the continent. The country has gone from being heavily dependent on coal to becoming a global leader in renewable energy in less than a decade. In 2016, coal accounted for over 40 percent of Chile's electricity production. By 2024, this figure had dropped to less than 20 percent.

The transition came through deliberate policy measures. Chile introduced aggressive carbon pricing, strict emission standards for coal plants, and a well-designed renewable energy auction system. The Atacama Desert, one of the world's sunniest places, became host to massive solar energy projects delivering electricity at record-low prices.

Chile also implemented financial mechanisms to enable early retirement of coal plants. Blended financing schemes supported by international lenders have proven highly effective. These measures have made it possible for coal plants to close ahead of schedule.

Colombia's just transition

Colombia joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2021, sending a strong international signal that the coal era was approaching its end. President Gustavo Petro, elected in 2022, explicitly committed to winding down coal power and mining, with careful attention to workers and communities dependent on coal-related employment.

Plans now exist to gradually retire Colombia's remaining coal power plants. Focus is on developing alternative economic activities such as renewable energy, agriculture, and eco-tourism to replace coal mining and related sectors.

Brazil's contradictory development

Brazil controversially extended subsidies and operational guarantees for coal plants in Santa Catarina until 2040 in 2022. However, even this move is a holding pattern rather than genuine expansion. No new coal capacity is planned or seriously considered in Brazil.

Renewable energy continues to flourish in the country. Brazil is a global leader in wind and solar energy growth, adding gigawatts of renewable capacity each year through highly competitive auctions. Market forces overwhelmingly favor renewable energy, and even with extended subsidies, Brazil's coal plants struggle to compete economically.

Economic and environmental benefits

Renewable technologies, particularly solar and wind power, have plummeted in cost, making them unquestionably more competitive than coal across the continent. International financial institutions, previously critical sources of coal plant financing, have largely withdrawn from coal projects. China's decision in 2021 to cease funding overseas coal power was particularly impactful.

Communities previously burdened by coal plant pollution, suffering from elevated rates of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, now experience tangible health improvements. Reducing coal use dramatically cuts air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.",https://www.warpnews.org/content/images/size/w1200/2025/06/Kolkraft-Sydamerika-cover.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:03:07.196580

On April 9, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order (EO)1 directing several federal agencies and subagencies that regulate energy, environmental, and conservation matters,2 including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Energy (DOE), to establish conditional sunset dates for “regulations governing energy production.” The stated objective of the EO is to require agencies to periodically reexamine their regulations to ensure that they continue to serve the public good. For FERC, the order covers regulations promulgated under the Federal Power Act (FPA), the Natural Gas Act (NGA) and the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act (FUA)3, as amended, while DOE must consider regulations promulgated under the Atomic Energy Act (AEA), the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct 1992), the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), as amended (collectively the Covered Regulations).4 To the extent the DOE has been directed to promulgate regulations under various sections of the NGA, FPA and FUA, and FERC has been directed to promulgate regulations specific to the statutes attributed to the DOE in the EO, the EO is silent. The EO expressly does not apply to those “regulatory permitting regimes authorized by statute.”5

On April 8, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) directing the Department of Energy (DOE) to take steps to expand the use of its emergency authority under Federal Power Act (FPA) Section 202(c) to require the retention of generation resources deemed necessary to maintain resource adequacy within at risk-regions of the bulk power system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).1 The EO appears to envision a more active role for DOE in overseeing and supporting the resource adequacy of the grid that deviates from the historic use of Section 202(c) and touches on issues at the intersection of state and federal authority over resource planning.

On March 5, 2025, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) approved Golden Pass LNG Terminal LLC’s (GPLNG) request to extend a deadline to begin exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its terminal facility currently under construction in Sabine Pass, Texas for 18 months, from September 30, 2025, to March 31, 2027 (the Order). The Order amends GPLNG’s two existing long-term orders authorizing the export of domestically produced LNG to countries with which the United States does and does not have free trade agreements (FTA).1 The Order does not amend the authorizations’ end date, which remains December 31, 2050. Under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), the DOE may authorize exports to non-FTA countries following completion of a “public interest” review, whereas exports to FTA countries are deemed to be in the public interest and the DOE is directed to issue authorizations without modification or delay.",https://www.akingump.com/a/web/hzs7j7qNY4F5GXZ2TqR5Jz/aa54Rb/speaking-energy.png,N,,2025-06-13 11:02:14.699722

Snapshot electric vehicle sales in Jan-May 2025 vs Jan-May 2024, YTD %:

Global: 7.2 million, +28%

China: 4.4 million, +33%

Europe: 1.6 million, +27%

North America: 0.7 million, +3%

Rest of World: 0.6 million, +36%

Europe. The European EV market has grown by 27% in the opening five months of the year, reaching 1.6 million units sold. The pace of growth continues to rise for many major European countries, with Germany’s EV sales now at 45% growth YTD and the UK at 32% growth YTD. Other European countries that have previously been slower to electrify, are also growing fast, such as Spain with 72% YTD growth and Italy with 58% increase this year.

Extra relief has also been announced in Germany as it launched a new incentive plan for electric vehicles. The plan aims to accelerate EV adoption among corporate fleets through special depreciation for EVs and other tax relief measures, which Rho Motion anticipates will have a positive impact as the corporate share accounts for more than half of the new vehicle market.

North America. The North American EV market (US, Canada, and Mexico) has grown by 3% YTD in 2025, with the Canadian market holding back the region as it has fallen by ~20% YTD due to the pausing of EV subsidies earlier in the year.

The US market is still experiencing moderate growth of 4% YTD, with tax credits remaining in place for eligible vehicles for the rest of 2025 which is expected to help maintain EV sales growth, as well as result in some pull forward in demand towards the end of the year. The tax credit is then being significantly phased out in 2026, before being completely phased out by 2027.

China. EV sales have reached more than one million units in a month for the first time this year, a feat that first occurred in August last year. The Chinese market increased by 33% in Jan-May 2025 compared to the same period last year.

EV sales went up by 10% month-on-month in May 2025 and by 25% year-on-year.

The energy transition-focused manager promoted managing director and Australian regional head Brian Restall to the CEO position, supporting co-founders and managing partners David Scaysbrook and Rory Quinlan. Restall has been at Quinbrook since Scaysbrook and Quinlan founded the firm in 2015.

“We devolved to regional leadership a couple of years ago reporting to Rory and I. As we were observing the regional leaders and wanting to spend less time on day-to-day management of the business and with Rory and I spending more time on strategy and fundraising, we felt we needed a CEO running the regions,” Scaysbrook told Infrastructure Investor. “Our preference is always to appoint internally, assuming we have the right candidates, and Brian is the logical candidate for that.”

Scaysbrook added: “The business has been gradually building its bench and reducing the key man risk around Rory and I to build the resilience of the business, something LPs clearly look at.”

Restall’s appointment comes alongside the hiring of Giulia Siccardo as managing director and the new regional head of Quinbrook’s North America operations, based out of New York and replacing the outgoing John Lucas. Siccardo joins following an 18-month spell with the Biden-era US Department of Energy, where she was a director for manufacturing and energy supply chains. Prior to that, she was a partner at McKinsey, where she spent 11 years advising on energy-related growth opportunities.

Scaysbrook said Siccardo’s appointment will likely see further hiring in investment roles in Quinbrook’s offices in Houston and New York. Kathryn Lin, a director in Quinbrook’s North American investment team, has been promoted to senior director and leader of Quinbrook’s digital infrastructure strategies, a role also previously spearheaded by Lucas.

Critical supplies

“When I saw [Siccardo] left the DoE and looked into her background, I thought she had exactly the background and experience we’re looking for,” explained Scaysbrook.

Siccardo’s hire is part of a new strategy being launched by Quinbrook with equal weighting to Australia and the US and with a focus on supply chains, manufacturing and critical minerals.

“US manufacturing is not only a bipartisan conviction, it’s one of the areas of the IRA that’s probably going to be left intact. Irrespective of who’s in the White House, we see a bolstering of US manufacturing, particularly electricity-intensive manufacturing. It is now on an irreversible path and will create a lot of infrastructure opportunities in the US,” Scaysbrook said.

“A lot of that is also going to be in the renewables and battery storage supply chain. Giulia’s experience at the DoE is exactly on that thematic and with her network and relationships, it significantly accelerates our plans for that in the US.”

This will include continuing Quinbrook’s focus on large-scale solar and storage, specifically co-located in areas where it believes will host energy intensive manufacturing and processing, according to Scaysbrook.

Quinbrook has previously financed and developed the Gemini project, a 690MW solar and 380MW storage project in Nevada. More recently, it rolled out plans in March to deploy about $3.5 billion in equity and debt from 2026-29 in eight-hour battery storage technology, which Scaysbrook said has “left the phone ringing off the hook”. Also in March, Quinbrook closed a record financing agreement in the UK for a 373MW solar and 150MW battery site.

Scaysbrook also said the firm will be looking to zero in on the clean fuels space.

“These are not heavily dependent on the incentives under the IRA and haven’t been targeted for negative action, [so it is] one of the safer places to play,” he said, while adopting a cautious approach on the rest of the tax credits, currently slated to end by 2028.

“It’s not pens-down in the US for us. It’s a bit of a waiting game around the finalisation of the budget reconciliation, but we have grandfathered a lot of projects in the US that we expect to still be able to benefit, even in the event the House bill becomes what it is,” Saysbrook said.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1465145516.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 06:02:41.787937

That’s because the new GOP legislation essentially repeals the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark 2022 law that has resulted in roughly $800 billion in investments in clean energy technologies.
“The economics of coal plants are the worst they’ve ever been,” said Robbie Orvis, a senior director for modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank.
The latest government inflation data shows that consumer electricity prices are already rising much more dramatically than overall consumer prices.
In this environment, the technology companies building massive data centers to power cloud computing and AI have struggled to find adequate, cheap electricity.","On the campaign trail last year, Donald Trump frequently criticized the Biden administration for new regulations targeting what he called “clean, beautiful coal.” In April, he signed executive orders directing federal agencies to undo any regulations that “discriminate” against coal. Coal-fired power plants produce a significant but shrinking share of U.S. electricity — about 16 percent in 2023 — and are by far the most polluting and planet-warming component of the power sector on a per-kilowatt basis.

So it was no surprise when, on Wednesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin gathered more than a half dozen Republican lawmakers at the agency’s Washington, D.C., headquarters to announce the planned repeal of two rules, finalized under the Biden administration, that established limits on carbon and mercury emissions from U.S. power plants. Once finalized, the Trump administration’s proposals will eliminate all caps on greenhouse gases from the plants and revert the mercury limit to a less strict standard from 2012, respectively.

The Biden-era rules, Zeldin said Wednesday, were “expensive, unreasonable, and burdensome” attempts “to make all sorts of industries, including coal and more, disappear.” With demand for electricity poised to surge in the coming years, especially as tech companies make massive investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure, Zeldin said that the EPA’s new proposals will boost electricity generation and “make America the AI capital of the world.”

His argument was echoed by the slate of Republican lawmakers who followed him at the podium. The old rules “would have forced our most efficient and reliable power generation into early retirement, just as Ohio and the rest of the nation are seeing a historic rise in demand due to the AI revolution, new data centers, and a manufacturing resurgence,” said Representative Troy Balderson. “Between data centers, AI, and the growing domestic manufacturing base, the simple fact is we need more electrons on the grid to power all of this,” added Representative Robert Bresnahan of Pennsylvania.

But despite their vigorous agreement that as many energy sources as possible are needed to power America’s future and keep utility bills affordable, every single representative who spoke on Wednesday had, just weeks earlier, cast a vote for a major bill in Congress that will almost certainly have the opposite effect. Analysts say that the pending legislation, which has the Trump-inspired title “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” will slow the country’s buildout of new electricity sources and eventually lead the average U.S. household to incur hundreds of dollars in additional annual energy costs.

That’s because the new GOP legislation essentially repeals the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark 2022 law that has resulted in roughly $800 billion in investments in clean energy technologies. By rolling back regulations on coal-fired power, the GOP’s hope seems to be that some of those lost energy investments can be compensated by fossil fuels. However, analysts agree that this is highly unlikely, due largely to the sheer cost of new coal-fired power, as well as supply bottlenecks that have sharply limited the feasibility of new natural gas plants. Instead, the result will likely just be more expensive electricity.

“The economics of coal plants are the worst they’ve ever been,” said Robbie Orvis, a senior director for modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank. “Even just keeping existing coal plants online compared to building new renewables is more expensive.”

To justify its repeal of the greenhouse gas emissions rule for power plants, the EPA is arguing that the U.S. power sector is responsible for just 3 percent of global emissions, and as a result is not a “significant” contributor to air pollution, which is the threshold the Clean Air Act sets for when the government can regulate a stationary source of emissions. While the 3 percent figure is factually accurate, experts say the argument is misleading, especially given that the power sector is responsible for about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions within the country.

“You’re dealing with something that has lots and lots and lots of sources, and you can’t just throw up your hands and say, ‘Well, this won’t achieve anything,’” said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit founded by former EPA enforcement attorneys.

If the U.S. power industry relies more on coal and natural gas relative to renewables, as Republicans appear to hope, those emissions could remain stubbornly high, especially as demand for power grows. What’s even more certain is that costs will continue to go up. The latest government inflation data shows that consumer electricity prices are already rising much more dramatically than overall consumer prices. In this environment, the technology companies building massive data centers to power cloud computing and AI have struggled to find adequate, cheap electricity. In fact, so many power-guzzling facilities are being built that lawmakers in Virginia, which is at the heart of the data center belt, have enacted legislation to prevent them from overwhelming the grid.

Since utilities have been unable to meet the power needs of tech players like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon Web Services, some of these companies have begun directly contracting with renewables developers and striking deals with nuclear power plant operators. A trade group representing these companies recently asked the Senate to revise the pending legislation so it restores some of the clean energy provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act, saying the U.S. needs “affordable and reliable power” in order to “maintain its leadership in AI.” Analysts say such leadership is threatened if the Trump administration continues to try to tip the scales toward fossil fuel sources that are not competitive with newer sources of energy.

“The current administration is picking technology winners and losers and making trade-offs,” said Orvis. “And the trade-off they want to make is: get rid of the clean energy tax incentives that are driving all of this new clean electricity onto the grid, which puts downward pressure on prices and will lower people’s rates.”

Orvis added that higher electricity costs raise the cost of doing business for manufacturers, including those at the leading edge of AI, making it more difficult to compete with China.

“We’re at a pivotal crossroads,” said Orvis. “We can either lean in and support the domestic growth of these industries by creating a policy environment with certainty, incentives, and support. Or we can do what the current administration is trying to do, and pull back on all of those things and allow China to step in.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2200431267-e1749764769732.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-06-13 06:00:50.519582

Although Toyota hasn't shared whether the milestone hybrid vehicle is front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, both versions are more frugal than any other minivan on the US market.

Under the EPA's combined test cycle, the Sienna averages 36 miles to the gallon (6.5 liters per 100 kilometers) with front-wheel drive or 35 mpg (6.7 l/100 km) with the optional e-AWD system. To keep things light, Toyota employs a rear-mounted electric drive unit instead of a conventional all-wheel-drive setup.

Only the optional 1.6-liter turbo I4 hybrid powertrain of the 2025 Kia Carnival dares come close to the aforementioned figures, with the South Korean rival netting 33 miles to the gallon (7.1 liters per 100 kilometers). As for the 2025 Chrysler Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid, make that 30 miles per gallon (7.8 liters per 100 kilometers) without any electrical assistance.

The Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid and Carnival Hybrid are both front-wheel drive, and the Carnival Hybrid stands out from its most direct of competitors by means of a torque-converter automatic rather than a continuously variable transmission. While not as efficient as a CVT, a conventional automatic is the better pick for those who prefer a more engaging driving experience.

As per the attached release, Sienna deliveries in the United States market were up more than 95 percent in year-over-year volumes in May 2025. During said month, electrified vehicles accounted for just around half of Toyota's US market sales. The Sienna, however, isn't as big of a seller as other Toyota hybrids.

Toyota Motor North America reported 1,986,623 deliveries in the United States of America in 2024, of which electrified vehicles accounted for 1,006,461 sales. The Toyota division is listed with 883,426 deliveries of electrified vehicles, of which the RAV4 Hybrid and the hybrid-only Camry accounted for 208,356 and 205,156 sales. Insane figures, alright!

As far as self-charging hybrids are concerned, the lineup further includes the Prius, Corolla Hybrid, the Crown and Crown Signia, the Highlander Hybrid and Grand Highlander Hybrid, the hybrid-only Land Cruiser, 4Runner i-FORCE MAX, Sequoia, and the Corolla Cross Hybrid. The mid-sized Tacoma i-FORCE MAX and full-sized Tundra i-FORCE MAX are self-charging hybrids as well.

Care to guess which is the most affordable hybrid of the bunch? The answer is 23,825-dollar Corolla Hybrid, with the compact sedan returning up to in combined driving. At the other end of the spectrum, the Sequoia kicks off at 62,425 dollars (excluding the destination freight charge).

The Prius remains the most fuel-efficient hybrid in the US market for model year 2025, with Toyota claiming up to 57 miles per gallon (4.1 liters per 100 kilometers) with front-wheel drive.

The misnamed Inflation Reduction Act was the largest “climate” spending package in American history, pouring nearly $370 billion into “green energy” boondoggles. Despite the legislation’s promises, the IRA’s green spending failed to reduce inflation and added undue burdens on taxpayers.

Here are examples of the IRS items repealed by the House-passed Big Beautiful Bill:

1. Electric Vehicle and ‘Energy Efficiency’ Tax Credits

The IRA offered tax credits up to $7,500 for individuals who purchased new electric vehicles (EVs) and $4,000 for used ones, alongside credits for home efficiency upgrades and solar technology installations. These subsidies mainly benefited higher-income earners. For example, the clean vehicle credit applies to luxury EVs priced up to $80,000, even though 60% of Americans cannot afford a new car.

The Congressional Budget Office confirmed that nearly 80% of electric vehicle tax credits went to households with combined incomes over $100,000, or the top 20% of earners. Low-income Americans were basically paying taxes to fund EV purchases for the wealthy. Past clean energy tax initiatives also often failed to achieve long-term emissions reductions relative to their cost.

2. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

The IRA had allocated $27 billion to the Environmental Protection Agency to create a ‘Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund’ often considered a federal ‘green bank’. This fund had broad discretion to issue grants and loans to dubious eligible recipients, many of which were non-profits or community development financial institutions for “green” projects. This type of fund is a breeding ground for political favoritism and ineffective oversight. The Fund itself is misguided policy, using taxpayer dollars to fund unreliable energy initiatives.

The IRA had created a fiscal black hole that served as a slush fund for politically aligned entities. Eliminating the fund closes the door to years of bureaucratic misdirect and ends the siphoning of Congressional power to an agency.

3. “Environmental Justice” Block Grants

$3 billion had been intended for “environmental and climate justice” grants. The grants were never about justice; they were about progressive buzzwords like “community engagement” or “resilience” with no measurable environmental benefits. There were no performance metrics or clear goals, and no accountability.

The entire program was just taxpayer-funded activism. A political payout in the name of ‘climate protection’

4. Diesel and Port Pollution Programs

In the IRA, over $160 million was allocated in grants to reduce diesel emissions at ports and vehicles. The grants offered ambiguous data and held poor compliance records. Also, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) already has a diesel reduction program.

5. Carbon Construction Labeling

The IRA had created a new EPA mandate to label construction materials based on “embodied carbon,” a measurement of greenhouse gas emissions released during construction.

Builders would be strong-armed into using EPA-approved materials, oftentimes costlier and harder to source, just to earn a pointless label. Housing costs would be increased and slow construction with no real environmental gains.

6. Corporate Emissions Reporting

An extensive corporate mandate to track and report every greenhouse gas emission was tacked on to the IRA. The left used this mandate as an attempt to impose ESG (“Environmental, Social, Governance”) compliance by force. Companies would be buried in red tape and threatened with monetary penalties for supposed “climate data” offenses.

The rule offered no real emissions impact, but it would have drained billions from American companies in compliance costs, especially from manufacturers, farmers, and small businesses.

7. Methane Emissions Program

Over $1.5 Billion was awarded in grants for methane mitigation at oil and gas operations. The program basically paid companies to continue complying with established EPA rules. It is actually industry innovation that has significantly reduced methane emissions, not some federal handout.

8. Electric Truck Subsidies

Another $1 billion was set aside for “clean heavy-duty vehicles,” including infrastructure and electric trucks. Long-haul EV trucks are too expensive, too heavy, and cannot compete with the range of a diesel 18-wheeler. The technology is not ready for such initiatives, and the infrastructure does not exist.

9. Alternative Fuel Credits

The IRA offered $100,000 per site in tax credits for EV chargers. This allocation would primarily prop up corporate developers building in already-profitable areas. The incentives were redundant in urban markets. This wasn’t about expanding infrastructure, it allowed corporations to write off the cost of something many were already planning on installing. Meanwhile, underserved or rural communities saw little to no benefit.

10. Carbon Sequestration Credit

The tax credit awarded companies with lucrative tax benefits by simply stating that they captured and stored CO2 emissions. The credit, known as 45Q, was billed to limit industrial emissions, but in reality, it was a loophole. In 2020, the U.S. Treasury Inspector General found that 87% of claimed credits were not independently verified. The credit incentivized projects without adequate guarantees for performance or environmental impact. The policy was a multi-billion-dollar grift disguised as green innovation.

___

The Big Beautiful Bill is more than a legislative win; it is a takedown of the left’s overall big government agenda. The bloated mess of green initiatives hidden within the IRA is finally being thrown out like the garbage it is.

Texas lawmakers returned home in early June at the end of the 89th regular session of the Texas Legislature, passing hundreds of pieces of legislation and sending them to the governor for his signature or veto. Here is Public Citizen’s assessment of how issues like energy and the environment fared during this year’s session.

Energy Investments

The Texas Energy Fund received an additional allocation of $5 billion, bringing the total to $10 billion, for a fund that has yielded no results. While nearly all of this investment is for gas plants that are not close to being built, lawmakers did include a commitment to fund the $1.8 billion backup power program included in the original Texas Energy Fund statute.

Nuclear power also got a handout from lawmakers to develop unproven small modular reactors. Public Citizen opposed the use of taxpayer funds because we believe that advanced nuclear power is too expensive, too far from reality, and burdened by too many risks and unanswered questions, such as the handling and disposal of radioactive waste.

This session began with a budget bill allocating $750 million to a new nuclear power fund, with whispers that the number could go as high as $2 billion. In the end, the newly created Texas Nuclear Power Fund will get $350 million, with an additional $120 million for the reactor already in development at the Natura/Abilene Christian University.

More About Nuclear Power

HB 4112 by Rep. Brooks Landgraf paves the way for new nuclear energy facilities by allowing onsite storage of nuclear waste. We successfully supported an amendment to this bill to ensure that waste will not be transported between nuclear facilities in Texas, thereby eliminating unnecessary risk in waste management.

There is still no permanent solution for high-level radioactive waste in the United States. And it’s an open question whether Texas will become the nation’s high-level waste dumping ground on an “interim” basis. We are very concerned about the development of new nuclear energy resources in the absence of a solution to this ongoing problem.

Another new law in the nuclear energy space, SB 1061 by Sen. Tan Parker, will promote the mining of Texas’ abundant uranium resources. As with the development of any nonrenewable resource, we urge a balance between resource exploitation for private gain and the potential for public consequences.

Renewable Energy

Clean, renewable energy is saving Texans billions every year. Since Winter Storm Uri in 2021, 92 percent of new energy in Texas has come from wind, solar, and battery storage.

Public Citizen supported two bills, whose passage will promote energy company recycling of aging turbines: HB 3228 and HB 3229, by Rep. Stan Lambert.

Several bills will improve solar permitting in Texas: SB 1036 by Dean Zaffirini (residential solar permitting), SB 1202 by Sen. King (reducing red tape for solar permits) and SB 1252 by Sen. Schwertner (reducing red tape for energy storage permits). Two bills will improve the handling of battery energy storage systems by introducing new requirements for decommissioning (HB 3809, sponsored by Rep. Darby) and safety (HB 3824, sponsored by Rep. King).

This legislative session saw several attempts to hinder renewable energy development and prop up fossil fuels fail. These included SB 819 by Sen. Kolhorst (attacking clean energy through red tape), SB 715 by Sen. Sparks (a retroactive “firming” requirement for all energy resources), and SB 388 by Sen. King (setting an arbitrary target of 50% “dispatchable” energy). These bills were stopped. Significantly, SB 819, which made another appearance as the most significant, fossil-fuel industry-backed attack on clean energy for a second consecutive session, faced more opposition and was stopped earlier in the legislative process than in 2023. The bill was opposed by at least seventy speakers when it was heard in committee in the Senate—the most opposition testimony for an energy bill in recent memory. It did not receive a hearing in the House.

Legislation attacking offshore wind energy also failed. SB 383 by Sen. Mayes Middleton, which would have effectively banned offshore wind energy development, failed in the House. And HB 3556 by Rep. Vasut, which started as an attack on offshore wind, became a good bill when it was amended to simply require that wind companies consult with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to minimize the impact of offshore wind facilities on migrating birds. We are supportive of the version sent to the governor for his signature.

Rounding out the list of bad energy ideas was HJR 138 by Rep. Alders, a constitutional amendment prohibiting Texas from ever imposing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. Although no one believes our notoriously fossil-fuel-friendly leadership in Texas will ever propose a carbon tax, the bill was seen as a test vote on the issue of climate change generally. It did not receive the required ⅔ vote for a constitutional amendment, failing 93-47.

Energy Efficiency

This session saw slight gains in energy efficiency, which remains the cheapest and easiest to deploy grid stabilization strategy. SB 783 by Sen. Menéndez will allow the State Energy Conservation Office to make rules to promote energy and water conservation in new building codes. We are also encouraged by the creation of the Texas Energy Waste Advisory Committee in HB 5323 by Rep. King. However, we note the failure of the stronger Texas Energy Efficiency Council in HB 3826/SB 2717 (Rep. Hernandez/Sen Menéndez).

The legislature declined to support strong energy efficiency goals (such as the 1% goal suggested by SB 1915/HB 4374 by Sen. Eckhardt and Rep. Turner) or even the moderate compromise goals that were being developed in SB 2994 (Sen. Johsnon).

Other good bills that failed:

HB 1359 by Rep. Hernandez, an income-based bill pay assistance fund, passed the House and failed to move in the Senate.

HB 1483/HJR 102 by Rep. Gervin-Hawkins, which would have provided tax breaks for home energy efficiency upgrades, was not voted out of committee.

HB 3237 by Rep. Turner, energy consumption goals for political subdivision, institution of higher education, or state agency, passed the House. However, its companion, SB 1514 by Sen. Johnson, did not move in the Senate.

Aggregate Production Operations

Yet another session passes without meaningful reform of Aggregate Production Operations, including concrete batch plants, cement crushers, and quarries.

Two bills by Sen. Alvarado that passed into law make minor improvements in concrete plant permitting. SB 763 will require the TCEQ to conduct a protectiveness review of the concrete batch plant standard permit every ten years (a task the agency was already undertaking approximately every 11 years). SB 2351 will revise the standard permit for concrete batch plants to apply to any plants that have not yet begun construction after requesting an extension. While these bills are fine, they don’t amount to real reform of this industry that will benefit communities dealing with pollution from concrete plants. We would like to recognize the consistent effort across sessions to reform this industry by lawmakers such as Sen. Alvarado, Sen. Borris Miles, Rep. Armando Walle, Rep. Terry Wilson, Rep. Nicole Collier, Rep. Senfronia Thompson, and others. This work is not done.

We counted a strategic victory in the defeat of SB 1757 by Sen. Birdwell. This bill aimed to enhance environmental permitting for concrete crushers operating at rock quarries, but it fell short with weak provisions and significant losses to public rights. It would have expanded the size of a crusher that could get a standard permit by more than eight times, and it would have taken away the public’s right to a contested case hearing challenge to new crusher permits. Opposition from Public Citizen, Texans for Responsible Aggregate Mining, and others prevented the bill, which had passed the Senate, from advancing far in the House.

We were very disappointed with the failure of HB 1823/SB 2082 by Rep. Thompson/Sen. Miles. This bill targeted a situation specific to Houston, where a concrete crusher wants to locate next to LBJ hospital, placing a significant source of air pollution near a facility that treats children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory illnesses. State lawmakers continue to claim that Houston can solve its problems through zoning. We agree that the lack of zoning in Houston is a significant burden on poor communities that live in the shadow of industry. Still, it isn’t a reason for state lawmakers to refuse to act to help our vulnerable neighbors.

Lawmakers might be fine with a concrete crusher next to a hospital, but they said “enough is enough” when a cement kiln tried to locate a few miles from a semiconductor manufacturer. SB 1758 prevented a cement kiln in Grayson County from being built until the completion of a multi-year study of the potential impacts of the cement kiln on the semiconductor manufacturer. We hope lawmakers will come to see that, just as industrial facilities don’t belong near high-tech manufacturers, they also don’t belong near hospitals, schools, and communities.

Rep. Armando Walle of Houston has carried concrete bills for many sessions. His HB 573, which would have provided for unannounced inspections of concrete plants at the request of a legislator, passed the House but did not move in the Senate. This is a good bill that we hope to see again next session.

HB 1726/SB 885 by Rep. Collier/Sen. Eckhardt is another bill that has been filed again and again–it would allow schools, places of worship to request a contested case hearing on a concrete batch plant. This bill should have passed several sessions ago, but it made less progress this session than in several prior sessions–it didn’t receive a hearing in either chamber. Perhaps its time will come in another two years.

Texas Emissions Reduction Plan

Texas’ popular program to combat air pollution by replacing old, polluting vehicles will not receive any updates from the 89th legislature. HB 3868, by House Environmental Regulations Committee Chairman Brooks Landgraf, died on the House Calendar. This bill could have been the vehicle for other substantial TERP bills, including HB 4519 by Rep. Ordaz (streamlining specific TERP programs) and HB 4841 by Rep. Anchia (creating a network of older vehicle owners who could benefit from TERP programs).

Wildfires

After Texas saw the largest wildfire in its history in February 2024, lawmakers knew they had to act. An investigative committee of the House, chaired by state Rep. Ken King, identified falling electric infrastructure at oil and gas facilities as the leading cause of wildfires in Texas. Public Citizen followed the committee’s work and made recommendations for next steps.

Chairman King followed through on the work of his committee by filing three bills that have been passed and sent to the governor. HB 143 empowers the Railroad Commission to identify unsafe conditions in electrical equipment and refer them to the Public Utility Commission. HB 144 requires electric utilities to develop a plan to manage and inspect distribution poles and gives the Public Utility Commission oversight of the plans. HB 145 requires utilities to produce wildfire mitigation plans. SB 34 by Sen. Sparks commissions a study of wildfires in the state, creates a state database of firefighting equipment, and increases funding to volunteer fire departments. SB 767 by Sen. Sparks, which the governor signed in May, also creates a new state database.

Artificial Intelligence

Regulation of artificial intelligence and the creation of AI “deepfakes” was a new issue for Public Citizen’s Texas office–part of an effort by our national office to track state legislation regulating AI. Several AI bills have passed the legislature and are awaiting signatures from the governor. HB 449 by Rep. Mary González expands the criminal code to apply to any media made using AI that appears to depict someone’s intimate parts exposed or engaged in sexual conduct. HB 581 by Rep. Mary González takes a new approach to the problem of intimate deepfakes of minors by attaching civil liability to the owner of the Internet website or application used to create deepfakes of minors. SB 441 by Sen. Chuy Hinojosa expands the crime of creating intimate deepfakes without the victim’s consent to apply to all media, not just videos.

Oil & Gas and Miscellaneous Bills

A few other things we were following included oil and gas legislation. HB 49 by Rep. Darby, which has been sent to the Governor, expands the use of wastewater produced from oil and gas operations. We’re concerned that this legislation goes too far in limiting liability for the use of this produced wastewater. SB 1150 by Sen. Middleton requires operators to clean up inactive wells within 15 years. Although this bill should have gone farther, it is a start and will apply to thousands of wells across Texas.

SB 2321 by Sen. King codifies the current practice of giving waivers to air pollution regulations for energy-generating facilities during periods of high energy demand or grid instability. Although we’ve never agreed with the premise that pollution laws somehow hinder energy generation, we supported the bill because it codifies what is already common practice. We worked hard to include public disclosure of pollution reports in the bill, but were unsuccessful in achieving this goal. The bill has been sent to the Governor, and we intend to seek public disclosure in follow-up legislation next session.

SB 3074 by Sen. Birdwell passed the Senate at breakneck speed, having been filed on a Tuesday near the end of the session and passed out of that chamber by Friday. Fortunately, the bill, which would have allowed currently illegal “ex parte” communication between lawmakers and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, did not move in the House.

We counted more defensive victories in the defeat of HB 4313 and HB 4314 by Rep. Cecil Bell. The first of these targeted local programs aimed at combating air pollution, while the second banned the use of ESG criteria in local contracting. Coordinated opposition to these bills slowed them down in the House until the end of the session, when they ran out of time.

No legislation addressing the problem of PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” was passed into law this session. Rep. Kerwin tried to combat PFAS contamination of fertilizer with HB 1674. Sen. Johnson tried to limit PFAS use in firefighter training with SB 1898. We were especially dismayed by the failure of HB 1730 by Rep. Morales Shaw—a simple study of the health effects of PFAS on Texans. These forever chemicals will live up to their name and aren’t going away, but Texans will have to wait at least two more years for any attempt to address them.

There are several other good bills we were disappointed to see fail. These include:",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:04:24.188492

Richie Harding, a 54-year-old resident of Northampton County, is surrounded by places that produce air pollution.

“A little over two miles south of me, there’s a wood pellet facility,” he said. “About a mile away, in the woods, there’s a hog CAFO. And Interstate 95 is about a quarter-mile east.”

Harding, who has for years used an inhaler for his asthma, says he and many of his neighbors live with chronic health conditions that could be linked to nearby sources of pollution. To raise awareness and push for change, he partnered with CleanAIRE NC, a statewide organization that trains residents to collect and share air quality data using low-cost PurpleAir monitors through its Community Science program.

Now, Harding, a trained “citizen scientist,” works with CleanAIRE NC to bring awareness to pollution levels in his community.

Last week, CleanAIRE NC launched a newAirKeeper Dashboard — an interactive mapping tool designed to help North Carolina communities track and understand local air pollution. The dashboard, which displays real-time data from sensors across the state, is part of the organization’s broader effort to position residents to advocate for cleaner, healthier air.

The dashboard is a community-driven tool developed with local “AirKeepers” to highlight pollution’s impact on vulnerable communities and provide access to environmental, health and demographic data, according to a news release.

“Through the AirKeeper Dashboard, community members can examine air quality, investigate pollution concerns, share their findings through maps and reports, and continue to build the case for positive change,”said Z Strawderman, the organization’s environmental justice manager.

The launch comes as federal air quality protections face new threats. In May, Congress advanced a measure to roll back industrial pollution rules, followed by a June 11 announcement from EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to repeal carbon emissions limits for power plants and weaken mercury standards.

Advocates warn that the changes could worsen pollution and harm already vulnerable communities.

Local concerns, national problem

The air quality issues in Northampton highlight a broader pattern affecting communities across the country.

In the U.S., 46 percent of the population (or 156 million people) is “breathing unhealthy air,” according to a 2025 report by the American Lung Association. Exposure to ozone and short-and long-term particle pollution can lead to adverse health effects like asthma and heart attacks, along with lung cancer, according to the report.

The report states that 77.2 million people live in counties that experience unhealthy spikes in particle pollution — a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. Another 85 million are exposed to unhealthy particle pollution levels year round.

In North Carolina, the state’s Department of Environmental Quality says the two most significant air quality challenges are ground-level ozone and particle pollution. The primary sources of these pollutants are automobile emissions and coal-burning power plants.

Despite that, citing better emissions control technology in gas-powered engines and the growing number of electric vehicles, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a 2023 biennial budget (House Bill 259) that cut the number of counties requiring automobile emissions inspections from 19 to just one — Mecklenburg County. The state is awaiting a ruling from the EPA on its revised Inspection & Maintenance State Implementation Plan, according to the DAQ website.

Bridging a gap?

While improvements in air quality and in vehicle emissions controls have prompted calls to scale back state oversight, critics warn that the move is shortsighted and could jeopardize public health.

In addition to health concerns raised by environmental advocates, limiting emissions inspections to a single county would significantly reduce revenue for the North Carolina Department of Air Quality.

At the June 4 state Senate Agriculture, Energy and Environment Committee meeting, NC DEQ Secretary D. Reid Wilson said the change would reduce DAQ’s budget by roughly 15 percent. To offset the shortfall, Gov. Josh Stein’s proposed state budget includes a 27-cent increase in the base fee for automobile safety inspections — a measure aimed at preserving the department’s capacity to protect air quality, according to information provided by a DAQ spokesperson.

Amid these funding uncertainties, CleanAIRE NC is working to equip residents with tools to monitor pollution in their own communities.“North Carolina has [roughly] 23 monitoring stations across the state — but we have 100 counties,” said Andrew Whelan, CleanAIRE NC’s communications manager. “If you’re checking your air quality on the federal AirNow website, but the monitor feeding that data is in a different county, it’s not really giving you useful information.

“That’s the role of the AirKeeper network — our team of community scientists,” Whelan continued. “They help fill in those gaps and provide hyperlocal, real-time data so everyone can understand what’s in the air they’re breathing — today, right now, where they are.”

Whelan noted that the AirKeeper Dashboard combines hyperlocal air quality readings with geographic and community context. It helps users identify pollution sources, track historical trends and view sensitive locations — such as schools or daycare centers — that are in areas with poor air quality. The platform offers a comprehensive, real-time snapshot of what’s in the air and why it matters.

A role for PurpleAir monitors

Low-cost air sensors like PurpleAir may lack the precision of DEQ’s regulatory-grade monitors, but they play a valuable role in filling spatial and temporal gaps in the state’s official monitoring network, said Shawn Taylor, public information officer for the Division of Air Quality.

“It is important to remember the distinction between low-cost sensors and regulatory air monitors, and the difference in the data and how that data should be used,” he said. “Due to the current limitations of sensor technologies and the varying levels of data quality from sensors, their data cannot be verified, validated or integrated into DAQ’s regulatory data.”

Still, efforts are underway to improve accuracy.

“Work has been ongoing in the air quality community, led by the EPA, to create bias correction algorithms that could calibrate raw PurpleAir sensor measurements,” Taylor said. “The goal has been to more closely align PurpleAir measurements, which have significant known biases, to the more accurate (and much more expensive) regulatory monitors that state and local air quality agencies operate nationwide. Thus far, the results have been promising, but not perfect.”

CleanAIRE NC’s Whelan acknowledged those limitations but emphasized PurpleAir’s broader significance.

“It’s true that the PurpleAir sensors have known limitations and require correction algorithms to align with federal-grade monitors,” Whelan said. “However, these are high-quality and reliable air monitors. They are also much more affordable than federal-grade monitors, supporting significantly greater geographic coverage, data justice and community ownership of information — which are essential for creating transparency and trust.”

“We view these tools not as a substitute but as a necessary complement to regulatory networks, particularly in underserved or vulnerable areas.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AirKeeper-Dashboard-Training-1.jpg?fit=1310%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-13 06:02:46.614124

Tesla's Market Share and Financial Standing Tesla's grip on the U.S. EV market is loosening.","Tesla's sales are stalling as demand for EVs soars. Is Musk the problem?

While electric vehicle (EV) sales in the U.S. are reaching record highs, Tesla is charting a different course.

That is one of the key findings from a new analysis by Motointegrator, conducted in collaboration with the research experts at DataPulse Research. Tesla's market share is falling, and investor confidence is also waning-but it is not because drivers are anti-electric. On the contrary, EV sales overall are rising, with electric vehicle sales in the U.S. up 11% for the same period.

Tesla's technology has always led the pack. So, could the problem be less about motoring and more to do with CEO Elon Musk's high-profile political career? Tesla's outlier status has coincided with Musk's increasingly visible role in U.S. politics, suggesting that declining sales and loss of ground to competitors could be part of a deeper brand backlash.

EV Sales Are Accelerating-Just Not at Tesla

New data shows that Tesla's decline is specific to its brand. In Q1 2025, Tesla's U.S. sales dropped by 9% year-over-year, while competitors experienced substantial growth. Porsche (+249%), Toyota (+196%), GMC (+183%), and Volvo (+173%) led with triple-digit increases. Legacy automakers like Chevrolet (+114%), Ford (+12%), and Volkswagen (+55%), also outpaced Tesla.

Among the top five EV brands, which together accounted for two-thirds of all EV sales this year, Tesla's performance stands out as the exception.

Tesla's Market Share and Financial Standing

Tesla's grip on the U.S. EV market is loosening. In Q1 2025, its market share fell to 43.2%, down from 52.7% the previous year-a 9.5-point decline. No other automaker came close to this level of loss. While Tesla lost ground, Chevrolet gained 3.1 points, Toyota and Porsche each climbed by more than 1 point, and other brands like GMC, VW, and Subaru made notable gains.

Investors, expressing concerns about Musk's divided focus, are taking notice. Tesla's stock has experienced a significant decline, dropping approximately 46% from its peak of $479.86 on Dec. 17, 2024, to $284.82 by May 9, 2025. In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla reported a 71% decrease in net income, falling to $409 million, and a 9% drop in revenue to $19.3 billion. This downturn reflects growing reputational challenges. In the U.S., protests and boycotts have emerged, with movements like ""Tesla Takedown"" urging consumers to divest from the company.

Despite these issues, some investors remain optimistic about Tesla's future, citing upcoming product launches like a more affordable EV model. However, the company's ability to navigate political controversies, restore consumer trust, and maintain competitiveness in the rapidly evolving EV market remains to be seen.

Global Losses Reflect a Broader Shift

Tesla's struggles are not limited to the U.S. The company's European sales have dropped sharply in Q1 2025, despite surging EV demand. Competitors like Volkswagen, Renault, Ford, Citroën, and BYD more than doubled their registrations in February, leading to significant erosion of Tesla's regional market share.

What is happening in Europe echoes the message from the U.S.: Tesla may not simply be lagging, it may be losing relevance among the very consumers driving the EV transition.

American and European Consumers Have Soured on Musk

There are several factors driving Tesla's decline, but consumer sentiment appears to play a key role. Recent U.S. public opinion polls underscore this point: Elon Musk's approval ratings dropped sharply following his endorsement of Donald Trump in mid-2024. By early 2025, disapproval had overtaken approval.

A similarly recent YouGov poll showed Musk with near-universal name recognition (98%) but only 30% popularity-a sign that with fame comes not just visibility, but stronger opinions. This backlash mirrors European sentiments, where large majorities in Germany (73%) and the U.K. (69%) have labelled Musk's insertion into politics as ""unacceptable.""

Promise Made, Promises Kept-Musk's Policy, Politics, and Economic Impact

Musk's political role extends beyond public statements. As President Trump's appointed head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk argued that short-term hardship would lead to long-term prosperity.

In practice, however, DOGE policies have led to aggressive austerity measures. In March 2025, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported 275,240 job cut announcements, with 216,670 directly attributed to DOGE actions-the third-highest monthly total in recorded U.S. history, surpassed only by the first two months of the COVID-19 crisis.

Musk's economic agenda is being felt at the household level. According to the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, consumer sentiment has cratered to levels not seen since the peak of post-pandemic inflation, reflecting deep anxiety among households about personal finances, business conditions, unemployment, and inflation.

Notably, the unease cuts across party lines. Since February, Republicans, Independents, and Democrats alike have reported worsening expectations for their finances, employment prospects, and the broader economy. With each new policy shift, consumers are bracing for more economic hardship.

Conclusion: Tesla at a Turning Point

In less than a year, Tesla has gone from market leader to cautionary tale, with falling sales, a loss of market share, and declining investor confidence both at home and abroad. What was once a brand synonymous with innovation is now inseparable from Elon Musk's public profile as a powerful far-right political figure. If the first months of 2025 are any indication, Musk's attempt to fuse corporate power with political authority may be backfiring: with consumers, markets, and even longtime fans turning away. The question now is not whether Tesla can regain ground-it is whether Musk can.

He added that many households are stressed over both paying their energy bills and providing for their families' other needs.

In 2024 alone, the program was utilized more than 219,000 times by households across the state, who received up to $250 per season. Supporters of defunding the program have argued that lower energy prices are on the horizon.

Earlier this year, lawmakers introduced legislation aimed at preventing disconnections during extreme weather events.

Woolery said eastern Kentucky is one of the most energy-burdened regions in the country. Without the energy assistance program as a safety net for working families, elderly residents and people with disabilities, he said, state-level protections are critical.

Michigan taxpayers may end up footing the bill to keep an aging coal plant open.

The J.H. Campbell plant was scheduled to close on May 31, but a last-minute order from the Department of Energy is forcing it to stay open.

The owner of the plant, Consumers Energy, says it wants the facility shuttered, but its hands are tied.

Dennis Wamsted, energy analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the Trump administration can use the Federal Power Act to force aging coal plants to stay open under emergency conditions.

""A really severe winter storm requires plants to continue to operate above what might be their normal generation levels,"" said Wamsted. ""So there are provisions to operate plants or order them to remain online if there's a real emergency. This was not a real emergency.""

Since 2021, Consumers Energy has built new solar and wind generation resources and purchased a natural gas-fired power plant.

These moves were made to replace energy produced by the J.H. Campbell plant and for a complete transition from coal production by the end of 2025.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order in April authorizing the Department of Energy to keep plants open using the Federal Power Act.

Trump said he wants to meet a rise in electricity demand due to an anticipated surge in domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers.

Wamsted said he believes the taxpayer burden to support J.H. Campbell is unfair and expensive.

When estimating the plant's operating costs, he cited an example from 2023, when the owners of a West Virginia coal plant were forced to keep a site open.

Monthly operating costs were at $3 million. Wamsted called that a ""good figure"" for J.H. Campbell's operational costs.

""They have to pay the staff to keep the plant there,"" said Wamsted. ""They have to pay to run the pipes and keep the turbine so it can actually produce electricity. So you end up paying that $3 million or more just to keep the plant able to operate.""

Wamsted said he is not aware of any legal action taken to force the plant's closure, move upkeep expenses out of taxpayers' hands, or recover the money at a later date.

He said things could change if there's a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which would allow outside intervenors to force the plant to close or challenge a tariff.

Pennsylvania's U.S. Senators are being asked to do what they can to safeguard federal clean energy tax credits, which are on the chopping block in the big budget reconciliation bill in Congress.

The nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation said repealing these credits could lead to a loss of 26,000 jobs in Pennsylvania by 2030 and even more by 2035.

Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis for Energy Innovation, said losing tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act would make clean energy manufacturing and clean power projects less viable and increase household energy bills.

""In Pennsylvania in particular, we found that the loss of the clean energy tax credits would lead to $60 per year in higher household energy bills by 2030 growing to $80 per year by 2035,"" Orvis reported. ""That amounts to more than $2 billion more in spending on energy for Pennsylvanians between 2025 and 2035.""

He added the lost incentives would also mean $5 billion in lost state gross domestic product by 2030, and $6 billion by 2035. In Congress, Senators are divided over whether to keep the Biden-era tax credits.

Aaron Nichols, solar policy and research specialist for the Bucks County system installer Exact Solar, said solar allows thousands of Pennsylvania homes and businesses to save on energy bills and gives them a choice beyond big utilities. The tax credits make the switch easier.

""Solar energy made up 66% of the new electricity-generating capacity added to the grid last year,"" Nichols pointed out. ""As people have taken advantage of these incentives, the solar industry has grown, creating thousands of good-paying jobs.""

Mike Zimmerman, senior attorney for electrification at the advocacy group EDF Action in Pittsburgh, said they have seen more than $1 billion in clean energy investments in the state from battery manufacturing in Turtle Creek to solar manufacturing in Leetsdale and grid technology production in Williamsport. He added 27 gigawatts of mostly solar, wind and battery projects are waiting to connect to the grid.

""These facilities are doing much more than creating jobs,"" Zimmerman emphasized. ""They're cutting energy costs for families, meeting growing energy demand and reducing the pollution that threatens our health and our state's natural resources.""

Backers of keeping the clean energy tax credits said repealing them would lead to more fossil fuel use, which worsens air quality and is linked to serious health problems.

An influx of data center infrastructure in neighboring Virginia will likely leave Mountain State residents with higher energy bills, according to a new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Regional grid operator PJM has proposed building two new high-voltage transmission lines to increase power capacity for data centers beginning in 2027. Both lines would cut through parts of West Virginia.

Cathy Kunkel, energy consultant at the institute, said data centers are massive computing facilities used by artificial intelligence, cloud computing and other large-scale computing industries.

""We found that West Virginia ratepayers are going to be contributing over $440 million to the cost of those transmission lines, even though the benefit is to data centers and the tech industry,"" Kunkel reported.

West Virginia ratepayers are served by subsidiaries of two utilities, FirstEnergy and American Electric Power. Kunkel noted the multimillion dollar price tag for the lines was determined by estimating the annual cost or revenue requirement of each of the two transmission lines during their useful life and then allocating the costs to the utilities.

Kunkel added the West Virginia Public Service Commission will have to decide whether the transmission lines ultimately serve the interests of residents.

""I do think it's unfair that data centers are imposing all these costs on the electrical grid and not fully paying for them,"" Kunkel asserted.

According to the report, as of 2023, data centers already account for 26% of Virginia's total electricity consumption. Power demand in Virginia's ""Data Center Alley"" transmission zone is expected to double over the next two decades.

With this expansion, Lucid has found itself to opportunistically reemploy a significant number of the workforce impacted by Nikola's downfall. Over 300 jobs have been offered, with 250 of those individuals now joining Lucid's Coolidge facility.

Lucid's expansion is more than a mere growth tactic; it's a bright spot within an auto industry riddled with challenges, including new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Price conveyed uncertainty regarding the impact of these tariffs on vehicle prices, yet was optimistic about Lucid's integrated approach. ""I don't know. I think there's a big broader impact across the whole of the automotive industry, and Lucid is uniquely positioned because of our integration to more protect the customers from that, because so much of it is sourced locally or sourced in the U.S.,"" Price shared with FOX 10 Phoenix.

The company is not holding back on its ambitious plans. Lucid is pushing forward with the prototypes of a new midsize crossover anticipated to be priced under $50,000 and scheduled to begin production at the recently acquired Coolidge facility next year. This is a signal that amidst the bankruptcies and buyouts that have beleaguered Arizona's EV industry, Lucid is forging ahead, ready to charge full steam into the future of electric mobility.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/6/lucid-motors-ignites-electric-vehicle-innovation-with-new-phoenix-hub-expanding-production-and-job-opportunities.webp,N,,2025-06-13 13:04:00.757253

One of these is Fervo Energy, which announced $206 million in funding this week, adding to the $255 million they secured earlier this year.
Vertical Drilling for Water Conventional geothermal works by drilling vertical wells into underground reservoirs of hot water or steam.
The company says that’s a 79 percent reduction in drilling time compared to the US Department of Energy baseline for ultradeep geothermal wells.
“Principally, there's virtually an unlimited amount of geothermal energy,” Latimer said.","Between power-hungry AI data centers, domestic manufacturing growth, and electric vehicles, US electricity demand is set to soar in coming years, and utilities aren’t yet sure where the supply to meet this growth will come from. Geothermal power is increasingly looking like a viable option thanks to companies deploying next-generation technologies.

One of these is Fervo Energy, which announced $206 million in funding this week, adding to the $255 million they secured earlier this year. The new funding round was led by Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, part of Bill Gates’ climate investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

Fervo’s approach, which uses technologies developed for the oil and gas industry, could help push geothermal’s share of total US electricity supply from its current 0.4 percent to 10 percent or greater.

Vertical Drilling for Water

Conventional geothermal works by drilling vertical wells into underground reservoirs of hot water or steam. Wells are up to 10,000 feet (or about 3 kilometers/1.9 miles) deep—and those are the easy ones. The hot water accessed through vertical wells is brought to the surface, where it’s turned into steam that’s used to spin turbines.

A major advantage of geothermal over solar and wind is that it’s not limited by intermittency; the rocks in the Earth’s crust are hot 24/7. This means geothermal is a reliable source of baseload power, and tech companies including Meta and Google have jumped on the geothermal bandwagon.

However, easily accessible underground reservoirs only exist in a handful of geologically active spots around the globe, like Iceland, Kenya, and New Zealand. These countries are positioned over sections of the Earth’s crust that have high heat flow and permeable rock relatively close to the surface, as they’re close to fault lines and areas where there’s volcanic activity.

Such areas exist in the western US as well, namely in California, Nevada, Utah, and Hawaii. In fact, the US leads the world in installed geothermal generating capacity—yet we’ve tapped less than 0.7 percent of our geothermal resources. The majority of those resources can only be accessed via enhanced geothermal technology—and that’s where Fervo comes in.

Horizontal Drilling for Heat

Rather than only drilling vertically to access naturally occurring reservoirs of hot water, Fervo and other enhanced geothermal companies also drill horizontally to create artificial reservoirs in hot, dry rock. After drilling vertically to depths of about 8,000 feet, they bore horizontal tunnels then pump water through them, essentially creating artificial reservoirs. Heat from the rock transfers to the water, which is brought to the surface and used to generate electricity. The water is typically recycled and pumped back into the ground again.

Besides putting more surface area in contact with geothermal fluid and maximizing heat transfer, horizontal drilling allows multiple wells to be drilled from a single surface location. This means there’s a smaller surface footprint and less impact on the environment surrounding the wells.

Horizontal drilling was developed for oil and gas production to find new fossil fuel deposits. Fervo’s cofounder, Tim Latimer, started his career in the oil and gas industry, but after a 2015 flood in his home city of Houston, he realized the urgency of the climate crisis and decided to find a way to apply fossil fuel technologies to renewable energy.

Horizontal drilling isn’t the only technology Latimer repurposed for geothermal. Fervo installs fiber-optic cables in its wells to monitor real-time data on flow, temperature, and performance. They also use an advanced drill bit technology called polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC). PDC contains lab-grown diamond, one of the hardest and most resilient materials in existence. The drill bits can cut through harder types of rock, do so faster, and go longer without wearing down. In addition, Latimer said in an interview with Time Magazine, “One of the things that we drove forward was a way of pumping fluid down while we're drilling that cools your drilling system more efficiently than in an oil and gas operation.”

Fervo set multiple drilling performance records with its recent completion of an appraisal well in southwest Utah (part of the larger project the company will use its new funding on): The 15,765-foot-deep Sugarloaf well will reach a temperature of 520 degrees Fahrenheit and was completed in 16 drilling days. The company says that’s a 79 percent reduction in drilling time compared to the US Department of Energy baseline for ultradeep geothermal wells.

Beyond the Low-Hanging Fruit

Fervo’s technology is making it feasible to develop geothermal power plants in areas where they wouldn’t have been possible before, mainly because the economics wouldn’t have made sense. The company plans to use the $206 million in new funding to keep building out its Cape Station plant in Beaver County, Utah. Phase I of the project plans to deliver 100 megawatts of power to the grid starting in 2026, and Phase II will add another 400 megawatts by 2028. The site has received permitting approval to expand up to two gigawatts.

Fervo ultimately has ambitions to go far beyond those two gigawatts—and the resources to do so definitely exist. A US Geological Survey assessment published last month says geothermal energy in the Great Basin alone, which spans Nevada and neighboring states, could produce electricity equal to one-tenth of the current US power supply.

“Principally, there's virtually an unlimited amount of geothermal energy,” Latimer said. “The world is really big, and the world is really hot. We've got billions of years of energy under our feet. It's all a question about how much you can access economically.”",https://singularityhub.com/uploads/2025/06/Fervo-energy-geothermal-cape-station-beaver-county.jpeg?auto=webp,N,,2025-06-13 08:01:29.595031

The Trump administration in April moved to pause the case while it assessed the litigation and the rule.","The Trump administration will propose scrapping a Biden-era rule about oversight at coal mines that it says is too burdensome on mining companies and intrusive by the federal government, the Interior Department said on Thursday.

It’s the latest jolt in an ongoing tug of war between Republicans and Democrats, who have taken turns modifying the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement’s (OSMRE) “10-day notice” rule to suit their agendas. The proposal comes amid President Donald Trump’s broad plans to develop domestic energy resources, including coal.

Under the 10-day notice rule, citizens can report possible violations they spot at mines, such as excessive dust or pollution getting into lakes or streams. If OSMRE believes a violation exists, it notifies the state, which then has 10 days to respond with its findings.

The first Trump administration changed the process in 2020 to require OSMRE and state regulators to review the alleged violations before deciding whether it was serious enough to trigger the 10-day notice period.

Four years later, the Biden administration not only erased those changes but pushed the triggering requirements in the opposite direction, mandating that all citizen complaints must be considered requests for federal inspections. The Biden rule also removed a requirement that a citizen must state the basis for his or her allegation of a possible violation.

Now, OSMRE will propose eliminating those Biden-era changes sometime during the week of June 16, replacing them with the 2020 Trump changes.

The proposal will “streamline coordination with states, avoiding duplicative inspections and reviews,” Interior said. State regulators will no longer be deemed persons subject to 10-day notices unless they’re acting as operators, and complaints will again have to include a justification before federal action can begin.

Corrective action plans will be allowed as an appropriate action in response to 10-day notices under the pending OSMRE proposal, and “arbitrary deadlines that delay solutions would be eliminated.”

“This is common sense,” Adam Suess, acting assistant secretary for land and minerals management, said in a statement. “We’re cutting red tape, restoring clarity and respecting states’ right to lead. Federal oversight doesn’t mean federal interference.”

Environmentalists have said Trump’s efforts to rework the 10-day notice rule makes it easier for mining companies to avoid having to fix violations.

OSMRE said its pending rule proposal supports Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s February order that calls on the department to get rid of outdated, duplicative, or burdensome regulations.

Once the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register, the public will have 30 days to submit comments.

Indiana led a group of conservative-led states suing the Biden administration’s Interior Department over the rule. The Trump administration in April moved to pause the case while it assessed the litigation and the rule. The states pushed to proceed arguing they didn’t want to be subject to the rule.

That case will still move forward after Judge Reggie B. Walton of the US District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday denied the administration’s request to stay, as well as the parties’ motions for summary judgment.

Martin Heinrich of N.M. on trying to save clean energy incentives - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/martin-heinrich-clean-energy-incentives,"Sen. Martin Heinrich: Well, I think, under a historical perspective, that’s not what would have happened.
Heinrich: Meanwhile, if you’re in the oil and gas industry, you’re probably thinking, ​“Stop helping!” Oil is $65 a barrel.
Heinrich: That’s what pays for our public schools in New Mexico.
Heinrich: That’s 100% my take.
Heinrich: It’s a choice to tell that story.","David Roberts: Sen. Heinrich, thank you for coming. Welcome. I appreciate it. I thought I’d start with, obviously, everybody’s thinking about the Big Beautiful Bill — sorry, I’ve been training to say that with a straight face all week. Conventional wisdom going into this process was the Inflation Reduction Act is dumping a bunch of money into red districts, a bunch of money into red House districts. Mike Johnson has a one-vote majority. Things are very tight. That means every Republican representative has the power to sink the thing, basically. So, I think the conventional wisdom was, ​“He’s going to have to make some big compromises to get this thing through. It’s going to be a really delicate process.”

No, it was not a scalpel. It was a sledgehammer — wiped the whole thing out. And they all voted for it. Did you expect that, and how do you account for it?

Sen. Martin Heinrich: Well, I think, under a historical perspective, that’s not what would have happened. With a different Republican president, that’s not what would have happened. So, what none of us could quite account for when we were putting the Inflation Reduction Act together, is a second Trump presidency where literally the party becomes sort of cultish. You know, the fealty to this president is just like nothing I’ve ever seen. Right. So, that’s hard to plan for. The second thing is, House Republicans just folded. They did not use their power. And we did see what happens when some House Republicans did use their power.

You look at what Ryan Zinke and a few other Republican House members did on the public lands provisions where they were trying to sell off our public lands to pay for portions of the bill. They said, ​“We’re not going to vote for the bill until you take that out.” Well, you know what they did? They took it out. So we had all those folks sign a letter, and none of them meant it. I mean, that’s the reality. They weren’t willing to use their political power to say, ​“I’m not going to vote for the bill until you fix this, this, and this.”

Roberts: Yeah, well, speaking of selling off public lands, Sen. Mike Lee has said publicly that he wants to bring that back in. Is that plausible? Like, I no longer have any baseline sense of what’s plausible or not anymore. You know what I mean? So, like, is that a thing that could happen?

Heinrich: So, I’ve spent my entire — I started out as an outfitter guide working on public land. So, this has been part of my life for all of my adult life. And I really cut my teeth fighting back on a previous effort to sell off our public lands. Would Mike Lee very much like to do that? Sure. The question is going to be, and it’s going to be interesting to see what happens here, is we saw what happened in the House: You’re inserting risk into an already wobbly kind of legislative effort. You never know when the wheels are going to come off on one of these things.

So, the question is, what do the other Republican senators think about that effort? And given the unpopularity of that kind of approach in a lot of the Intermountain West, where we have Republican senators in places like Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and other places that understand how unpopular this is and how much risk it’s going to create, I don’t know if they do it or not.

Roberts: Can you give us a sense of, like, how many senators is the margin here? Like, how many would have to really make the jump to kill this thing or at least force changes in it?

Heinrich: To force changes, like, if you can put a group of three together, you can probably force changes. Because no one’s banking on Ron Johnson being a yes. Like, he seems to have carved out a pretty solid position for himself. You know, Rand Paul, you never quite know where he’s going to land. So, you want to build a very solid whip count. And so, I honestly don’t think it takes a lot of Republicans to force some changes. And for the sake of this overall industry and all the jobs that we’ve created and the hundreds of billions of dollars of factory investments, I hope they will use the power that they have because there are a handful of folks that could solve the timeline problems that could clean up the foreign entity of concern and make it functional instead of a mountain of red tape.

There are a lot of things that — setting aside the bigger issues of taking health care away from well over 10 million people — we could fix a lot of the IRA issues and preserve a lot of jobs, and mitigate rising electricity prices if they would use that power.

Roberts: Well, you said that maybe selling off public lands outright would be a step too far. Another thing in the House bill is an extensive amount of fossil fuel leasing, leasing of public lands. And they sort of go beyond. You know, it’s always just like they look around at whatever’s around. They’re like, ​“How can we get more extreme than that?” So now they’re mandating that we lease public land to fossil fuels, plus opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge up, etc., etc. Public lands in general just become sort of open season. What’s the valence of that issue, do you think?

Heinrich: Meanwhile, if you’re in the oil and gas industry, you’re probably thinking, ​“Stop helping!” Oil is $65 a barrel. Production, Saudis are increasing production. This cuts both ways for them. It’s like, ​“Yeah, sure, thanks. You’re reducing royalties. But by the way, the market is being flooded right now.” So, it’s kind of a mixed bag for that entire sector right now. And because they made a deal with Trump during the election, they’re kind of biting their tongue.

Roberts: Yeah, I saw someone make a similar point that the tariff on steel is going to jack up fossil fuel drilling.

Heinrich: It is very hard to produce a barrel of oil below $65. You can do that in the Permian Basin. But there are a lot of places where they start shutting off rigs when you get to that price point.

Roberts: So, the purported drive behind all this is to find revenue. That’s, I guess, what surprised me is it turned out that finding revenue to pay for tax cuts for rich people turned out to be No. 1 through No. 5 on the priority list. And everything else got bumped, except they want to reduce royalty rates for the leasing of public land. That revenue — you know, Medicaid, one thing — but that revenue they can sacrifice.

Heinrich: That’s what pays for our public schools in New Mexico. So, that change alone in my state is likely to cost the state of New Mexico close to $2 billion over the course of the next 10 years. And that will come at the cost of our school kids.

Roberts: Yikes. So, I was going to say your committee, the Energy Committee, would be the committee where leasing of public lands is discussed and hashed over. But something you mentioned a few minutes ago backstage that hadn’t even really occurred to me is that they might not do the committee process.

Heinrich: They might go directly to the floor with a substitute for the House bill.

Roberts: And this would just be like calling the bluff of all the senators saying, ​“This or nothing.” ​“Jump or you’re dead,” or ​“Jump or Trump will …”

Heinrich: ​“We all jump together.”

Roberts: What do you think are the chances of that?

Heinrich: I try not to handicap — like, I’m not in that mindset. So, I’m not a good person to predict how they will handle the procedural issues.

Roberts: And if they did, I mean, this is, of course, everybody’s just guessing about this. But if they did today, right now, with the bill as is, do you think it gets to 51? Do you think that your colleagues, your Republican colleagues, will use the power in the way that the House Republicans didn’t?

Heinrich: I think that’s an open question. I think there are a number of Republican senators who recognize that there are big equities here that could be really problematic. I mean, when you have, you take just one example, West Virginia, you’ve got major factories, companies like Form Energy and others that set up shop there to take advantage of those incentives and to plan for the next 10 years of the future of our economy in storage and clean steel and other things. Are the two senators from West Virginia going to stomach those? You know, they went to those groundbreakings and ribbon cuttings and, you know, it’s up to them.

They could force this change. Will they? I haven’t seen a lot of profiles in courage, but if they decide to do it, they have the power to change this bill. There’s no question about that.

Roberts: Well, another thing that your committee would deal with, if your committee dealt with something, would be the rescission of all these DOE — I think this is one of the things that really hurts this crowd, all these grants, all this money that was going out the door, some of it they’re just pulling back. Some of it they’re trying to yank that’s already out the door. So, like, what’s the — is that legal? What is the legal status?

Heinrich: No. First off, just to clarify, it’s not legal, but this is an administration that is willing to break the law and then pay the consequences later if they’re held to account by a court. So, they’re going to test the bounds of all of this. I have a great deal of sadness around all of this because we are the country that we are because we invested so methodically, over time, in science. And whether you care about NIH or, in my case, NNSA and DOE, we are where we are because of those investments that we’ve made.

And we are chasing the smartest scientists out of this country right now. The Chinese are recruiting them, the Europeans are recruiting them, and a lot of the people that DOGE got rid of — I’m all for, like, if you can make something more effective or more efficient, we should do that. You don’t take the people who just got promoted because they don’t have some sort of tenure yet. You fire the highest performing people in the agencies. That’s nuts. And that is not how you run a good private sector operation. So it saddens me to see the impact there because I literally moved to New Mexico right out of college because I love the fact that it had two national labs and an active private sector and things like semiconductors.

And I thought, this is a place where a science person can go and have a future.

Roberts: Yeah, and the funny thing is that the current Republican coalition has this sort of odd split between the MAGA types and these tech guys who have joined more recently with a much more like, ​“Let’s go to Mars, humans will overcome” — that sort of attitude. And they’re just standing by watching silently as the American scientific establishment is razed to the ground. They’re not making a peep.

Heinrich: And it’s unilateral disarmament with respect to the real competition with China because, like, you look at the stuff that they’re yanking, the money that is designed to make our manufacturing sector make the same kind of changes that our energy sector has already made. That’s a competitive issue. There’s so much dissonance, cognitive dissonance in all of this. Like, if you don’t like China controlling the battery supply chain, maybe you should build batteries in the United States. So, don’t get rid of the incentives to build batteries in the United States.

Roberts: You can’t build them here, but you also can’t buy the ones that China’s making. What’s the remainder there? Let’s talk a little bit about permitting on two scores. One is there was a lot of discussion of permitting last session. There’s a lot of dispute about who exactly is responsible for that not making it over the line. But it was a relatively sophisticated agreement of people with different perspectives. What the Republicans have done left on their own devices is come up with, ​“Hey, what if people can just pay to bypass environmental review?” Which like, is that as ridiculous as it looks on the surface? Is that a plausible kind of reform?

Will that do good? Is that on your list of good permitting reforms?

Heinrich: No, it’s not. You shouldn’t do permitting reform and budget reconciliation. You’re not supposed to take something that is policy and masquerade it as a budget item so that you can include it in budget reconciliation. The biggest reason for that is we need long-term certainty in the permitting process. So personally, I believe that the Democratic Party needs to be the party that says, ​“The United States of America can build big things again.” So how do you create the certainty where you can do that and do it on a timeframe that actually makes sense? I spent 17 years shepherding one transmission project through the federal, you know, morass.

Roberts: Did it ever happen?

Heinrich: Two NEPAs. Yeah, SunZia, it’s being built right now. Three and a half gigawatts of clean power coming onto the grid right now. But 17 years is not a reasonable timeframe. So, I am very proud of the permitting reform that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee did last Congress. I was deeply involved in those negotiations, and we got most of the committee. Yeah, we lost Josh Hawley and we lost Bernie Sanders, but the people in between voted for this. We should pick that up, dust it off, and pass it because we have a coalition, and that’s a bird in the hand that would actually make a meaningful difference instead of throwing for the sort of dogmatic end zone and saying, ​“We’re going to destroy NEPA completely” or ​“We’re going to let people do ​‘pay to play’ as part of the permitting process.”

Roberts: Yeah, do you anticipate that happening? Like, when this bill is done and off the plate, do you think permitting reform is going to be on the agenda?

Heinrich: I think it will largely be determined as part of the process where we scrub the bill with the parliamentarian. So, the question is, does it survive what people on the Hill call the ​“Byrd bath,” after late Sen. Byrd? And this is clearly, in my view, this looks an awful lot like policy masquerading as budget. So, if it comes out, that’s the most likely place where it comes out.

Roberts: Well, I want to get back to permitting reform, but they have defied the Senate parliamentarian once now. So, is that just a thing now? Like, I think Thom Tillis has said, he or Thune said he wouldn’t overrule the parliamentarian. But, like, I don’t know how seriously to take that.

Heinrich: Well, I mean, one data point does not give you a trend. We’re going to find out if that was an anomaly or a trend, and if it’s a trend — I mean, I try to impress upon my colleagues on the Republican side who get very exercised about certain members in my party. I’m like, ​“Think through all of this stuff and think through, like, when AOC is in the White House, what’s she gonna do?” Like, when you start ignoring the Congress and saying, ​“You can just take the money from this project and put it in this project instead,” even though that’s not what our laws say, how are those Air Force bases in Texas going to fare under a president you don’t like?

So, we’ve got to get some guardrails back on all of this, where Congress is doing its job and there are real delineations of power between the administration and Congress.

Roberts: I think this is part of what freaks a lot of people out. It doesn’t seem like giving the president dictatorial powers is the kind of thing you do if you anticipate the other party ever being in that chair again. You know what I mean? But back to permitting reform, never mind democracy, back to permitting reform. I think the sort of conventional wisdom is that the Republicans — this was in the last round — want it to be easier for oil and gas. The Democrats want it to be easier basically for transmission, mainly, and clean energy.

Republicans don’t like the transmission part. A lot of Democrats don’t like the oil and gas part. We’re going to do them together. But now, they have the votes, theoretically, to just bully their way through with their own permitting bill. Do you think there is enough support for the transmission side of things on the Republican side?

Heinrich: There is, and look, the transmission pieces of that largely lived in that Energy and Natural Resources effort. They don’t live in the Environment Public Works Committee. That’s where a lot of the NEPA stuff would happen. But in terms of having a balanced product, we came up with something that satisfied both sides. John Barrasso is from Wyoming, a conservative Republican, cares about oil and gas production, and he championed that effort. And I, on the other side, have spent my life trying to make transmission work. We came up with something that both sides could agree creates a lot more certainty in the process and a faster path to either yes or no.

I mean, there are lots of times when the answer needs to be no, but you need to get there in a year or two, not in 12. So, I think this is actually doable. And if you want to make some changes to NEPA, you have a chair and ranking member in EPW, in the Environment Public Works Committee, that work well together too. So, take a crack at that as well. If you put it in reconciliation, it’s really a roll of the dice. And how long will it last? And in permitting, we want the solutions to be in law, and we want them to be durable.

Roberts: The people on the clean energy side who were advocating in favor of this previous permitting reform effort, there’s a lot of division on the left, I’m sure you’re aware, but the people who are for it, their basic point was, ​“If you make everything easier, clean energy wins.”

Is that your take? Is that your take?

Heinrich: That’s 100% my take.

Roberts: Is that the Republicans’ take, like do they know that?

Heinrich: I think they’re selective about their datasets. So, I’m not sure that they have quite realized that. Because if you ask them about energy storage, they’re like, ​“Well, it doesn’t even work yet.” I’m like, ​“Well, in New Mexico, 15% of our generation mix is storage. Like, what do you mean it doesn’t work?” But you never get everything you want in a legislative vehicle. But you can get what you need. And we will continue to make progress. When 95% of what’s in line to go on the grid is clean, we’re winning. We just need to win faster.

Roberts: Win faster. You know, the process, as you say, it’s not clear what the process is going to be. There’s usually sort of a vote-a-rama towards the end of things where people throw out amendments. I’m just curious if there are particular — I mean, maybe you don’t want to show your hand exactly what sort of amendments you have in your back pocket, but are there areas… You know, as you said backstage, like, mostly this is just about accountability. It’s just about making people vote against things in public so they’re on record for it.

Like what, what sort of things would you like to bring up and force your Republican colleagues to vote against?

Heinrich: Well, as you said, there’s an awful lot of benefits in specific red states and districts. So, you know, highlighting where people are on those things, if you’ve got a battery factory, like those are the kind of places where I think we really need to press that accountability. There’s no doubt that some of that is going to be determined by what comes out in the parliamentarian’s process and then what’s left. And then you have to focus on what’s left.

Roberts: Can you just talk briefly for people who have not been following this debate? Obviously, there’s little to no prospect of restoring the tax credits fully, the wind and solar tax credits, or restoring the tech-neutral tax credit. But there are perhaps opportunities to undo a little bit of the damage that was done to them. Can you just go through a few of the sort of specifics?

Heinrich: Yeah, I think the two areas where, if Republican senators choose to lean in, they can see substantial improvements to the predictability of the next few years is one, that the language is all over the map about how to wind up the IRA tax credits. And you never, like, you never want to deal with a situation where you’re making a decision about whether you get the credit or don’t get it based on when the project goes into service. You need to be able to plan based on when you start building the project.

Roberts: For the obvious reason that you can’t control when your project goes into service, it’s dependent on a bunch of factors beyond your control.

Heinrich: Exactly. So, bankability is a problem. They could choose to fix those issues, and that would make a giant difference. I also think the foreign entities of concern language that the House put in is just a big red tape mess, and no one can figure out how to comply with it. So, come up with something that actually says, ​“Okay, there’s a real issue here, and we’re going to respect that, but we’re going to have language that the rules of the road are clear to actual project developers.”

Roberts: Yeah, and as you say, it’s a little odd to go so overboard to prohibit anything coming in from China, but then also to kill the domestic manufacturing credit. Like, where do they, where else are they going to come from? Where do they think they’re going to come from?

Heinrich: Intellectual consistency is not a strong suit right now in the …

Roberts: Yeah, well. So, I don’t know if they like what’s been said privately, but, like, Capito’s on the record wanting hydrogen hubs back. Hoeven wants the geothermal thing restored. I think Tillis has been on about the messy FEOC language. So, like, people are taking stands. And I would think intuitively you wouldn’t stick your head out and do that if you weren’t going to follow it on, because otherwise you’ll look like a jerk. But then a bunch of House Republicans just did that. So maybe they will do that. But are you hearing other people more quietly behind the scenes?

Heinrich: There’s a constellation of roughly seven or eight senators who are worried about a number of these provisions. All they need to do is get together and agree we’re going to support one another and demand some changes, and changes will be made. So, if it doesn’t happen, it will be a choice by their choice not to exercise the leverage that they have.

Roberts: Before we turn to some audience questions, I want to ask a little bit broader political question. So, the political theory of the case with the Inflation Reduction Act, and I think this is also true of the Infrastructure Act and CHIPS, too, is if we flood red districts and states with new investment, new factories, new jobs, new opportunities, we will make this irreversible. Basically. Like, this will give it political resiliency. This was sort of like the premise of the Biden administration. And like this, the House vote really seems to cast that whole theory of the case into question.

But if tangible benefits to your district don’t sway you, what’s left? Like, what does? What world are we living in? What are the political physics of this new world? What sways people anymore?

Heinrich: I mean, I think we’ll learn what the political physics are when we see what the impact of these actions is in the next election, which I think will be substantial. I think the problem here is the timeline was too short. And then you have the sort of cultish issue around Donald Trump where he’s able to change people’s minds in a way that previous presidents were not. And so those things combined in a way that really broke down. I think if we had five years of factories, you know, being ingrained in those communities, it would sway a lot more House members.

Roberts: Yeah, and I guess sort of the other half of that is, it’s a little disturbing that it didn’t move more Republicans, but it’s also a little disturbing — and this I’ve heard from people in the Biden administration — they are disturbed that in their view, they didn’t get much credit from the left for it either. In their view, they didn’t get credit from anybody for anything. It seems like the space whereby a Democratic administration can be successful is just shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. The passage is getting narrower and narrower. You have enemies on all sides. You have no friends. Am I overdoing this?

Heinrich: It’s a choice to tell that story. And I don’t think we told that story effectively. Now, I mean, I will tell you that my closing ad was built all around the ability to build big clean energy projects, and it was full of IBEW workers and laborers. And, you know, the reality is that I performed very well in my state, higher than, you know, there was a delta between the Senate race and the presidential race. And it was partly because a lot of center-right, skilled tradespeople could see themselves as part of the team in those ads.

And that was not the story that got told by either the Biden or Harris campaigns effectively. I mean, those got caught up in other issues. And so, we didn’t tell that story. And if we had told that story on a national scale, I think people would recognize just how much the world has changed as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Roberts: Okay, final question before audience questions. This is a question that I’ve asked every public official I’ve spoken to since the election. Out in Democrat land, I think there’s a sentiment that Trump came in and just started steamrolling and has met weirdly little resistance. There was weirdly little — where are the heroes? Where are the people standing up? Where is everybody? You know what I mean? Like, everybody’s looking around like, ​“I thought you were going to stand up to this.” So, I think people on the left are like, ​“Where’s the fight?”

So, do you think that’s a fair critique, A? And B, where is the fight?

Heinrich: I understand the need for that because this is an administration that is behaving in ways that we have not seen in modern American history. I also recognize that you have to look at the tools and the math that you have, and right now, we don’t have the math. If you want to constrain this administration, get busy. The biggest opportunity we have to do that is going to be the midterm elections. We will slow things down, and we will filibuster, and we will do lots of things in the meantime. But right now, you have a situation where they have effective control of both houses of Congress.

They have the White House, and more often than not, they have a friendly Supreme Court and a friendly court electorate, except for the very extreme, clearly outside the box, extralegal things that they have done. And in those cases, the courts have been constraining them, and the system is working. But I think it is not going to be any magic person in the House or the Senate. It’s going to take all of us, and it’s going to be the most powerful thing that is changing our ability to slow them down or change outcomes is actually the things that are going on in red states, in red districts where people who normally would be seen as absolutely friendly are questioning what these Republicans are doing.

So, when you start laying off veterans by the thousands at the VA, and then you go home and you hear about it, that’s the stuff that is actually creating the space for us to begin to govern again and begin to limit the impact of this excessive administration.

Roberts: All right, well, let’s take some questions. Do we have a roving mic? Hands up if you have questions.

Audience Question 1: Hi. First of all, thank you guys so much for this talk. It’s been really amazing and very informational. I want to push you on the last question. You know, we have a lot of industry, we have NGOs, a lot of maybe former DOE employees in the crowd. And I want to ask what we can do to make your job easier. I mean, is it money? Is it media? Is it new reports or new research? What can we do to help get legislation passed while not being in government?

Heinrich: I think one, it’s really helpful when groups are pragmatic and support what is never going to be perfect. Like, this is not a game of the perfect. It requires compromise to get real, durable things done in Congress, no matter who’s in charge. And so, being the adult in the room who’s willing to take some arrows because things are never going to be perfect, that’s an important dynamic. I think in the midst of this current situation, where we have the Trump administration really running roughshod over many of our norms and our democratic institutions, I think the most powerful thing that people can do is tell their own stories.

So, when somebody gets online and says, ​“You know, I spent this many years in the Marine Corps and then I went to work for the Veterans Administration, and I got let go after my promotion because I didn’t have a year’s worth of service,” that resonates with people. And it tends to find its way in front of my colleagues who have sort of stopped listening to the phone calls, the letters, and the emails. It gets in their feed because it’s algorithmically based. And the same is true of people’s jobs. Like when you attack somebody’s job, what they did with Empire Wind, I thought that was absolutely unacceptable.

You take a project that was fully permitted, and you try to do something outside the law to then threaten 2,000 union jobs. Like when those folks get online and say, ​“This is what they did to me, and this is what it meant for my kids and my family,” that stuff resonates. And I think we need to urge people, if you’ve been impacted by some of these extreme abuses of power, tell your story. When I go to the floor, I don’t talk about what I think. I oftentimes read from the letters. I tell people’s story from my state.

Audience Question 2: I just want to say thank you so much for your plain speak. You started off talking about a brain drain, and I just want to know if you see a road back from that, because that is real, and I don’t know how long those consequences will last. So, I’d love you to talk about that.

Heinrich: It is real, and it will take time. The sooner we can start, the better. I mean, we need to change the discourse in this country to one again where we can argue about our opinions, but facts should be facts. And the way we’ve allowed the social and other media to be so fractured that people are able to consume the narrative of what’s going on in this country through a soda straw instead of having some common understanding of what we are as a nation is really caustic to our ability to lead and to compete with our near-peer competitors.

So, we need different leadership. Elections matter. And then, we are going to have to, like, day by day, show that we value those things. We value how we compensate you, how we talk about you. We have to stop with this dumbing-down approach to the world. It is not in the interest of a great nation to do that.

Roberts: Yeah, and I’ll just add something. I saw on social media a couple of days ago, a letter from a guy who’d been let go from the NIH and had tweeted about it and then followed up saying, ​“Less than two hours after my tweet, I got a letter from the Chinese authorities with an offer to move my lab to the city of my choice with full funding for 20 years.”

Heinrich: And if you don’t think that the science that we do has value, I think they understand the true economic value of our scientists and our engineers.

Audience Question 3: Thanks so much for a great conversation. I have a question that’s related to a very public departure from the administration last Friday. Elon Musk is no longer leading the DOGE effort.

Roberts: Let me just clarify. Unclear, maybe.

Audience Question 3: Well, whether he is or isn’t, he made some pretty controversial statements about OB3. And my question to you is, are his comments helpful to the Senate, or are they a head-fake?

Heinrich: I have no idea at this point. I mean, we’ve all been through this with Elon where like, ​“Oh, he’s an interesting guy. He’s pro-science, he’s into electric cars. Well, we kind of like him.” And then he swings and becomes the person we’ve seen for the last couple of years, and now he’s swinging back. So, I try not to obsess about anything that he tweets. I try to pay attention to, you know, what he does. I don’t know how it’s going to play out. It probably pushes the two factions of Republicans a little further from each other, which is not a terrible dynamic to be able to slow things down and dig deeper into this thing and make people understand that 13 million people are going to lose their health care, and kids in a lot of states are not going to have money for their schools and the actual implications of this stuff.

But it could change tomorrow too, as we’ve seen happen again and again.

Roberts: And just a quick follow-up, because I meant to ask you about this earlier, and we forgot to talk about it. But one thing Elon tweeted about is AI. So maybe just say a quick word about what your colleagues are missing about AI in this bill, just real quickly.

Heinrich: This bill is a direct pathway to much more expensive electricity costs, higher electricity bills, and the inability for us to compete effectively with our competitors on artificial intelligence. The short version of this is simply that the energy they want to build, whether you want to build small modular reactors, or stick a combined-cycle natural-gas generator on the grid, or old-school AP last-generation nuclear reactor, all that stuff, great, that takes time. And so all this stuff that is fast and cheap and that we can do immediately is the stuff they’re killing in this bill. Ninety-five percent of the stuff in the queue, over 90% of it is renewables and around 95% of it is clean, if you throw nuclear into that bucket. But the stuff that we can build, we’ve already built on the nuclear side.

It’s going to be a few years before the next reactor comes along. If you order a combined-cycle natural-gas turbine yesterday, you’re going to get it in 2030. So, are we going to starve the entire grid at the time of the largest increase in demand since the air conditioner became commonplace? That’s what this bill is going to do. And the impact of that, you know, I’ve warned my colleagues, the impact is going to be prices are going to go up for electricity everywhere, and we’re going to make darn sure people understand why that happened.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/DC-image1.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=1a4e608f621614225673b1cc5074cd42,N,,2025-06-13 08:01:09.629508

The ​“Big Beautiful Bill” passed in May by House Republicans and now being considered by the Senate would rapidly phase out key clean-energy tax credits, casting uncertainty over more than 600 gigawatts’ worth of solar, battery, and wind projects slated to come online in 2028 or later, according to new analysis from research firm Cleanview.

To be fair, the 600-GW figure is based on what’s currently in the interconnection queue, and a good number of those projects won’t get built regardless of the fate of the tax credits. (Projects often drop out of the queue for all kinds of reasons.) But if the bill kneecaps even a fraction of what’s anticipated, it will have serious consequences for the U.S. energy system. For context, the entirety of the U.S. had a generating capacity of around 1,200 gigawatts at the end of 2023.

The current version of the legislation would rapidly phase out federal tax credits that encourage clean energy development. As it stands, developers would be eligible for the tax credit only if their projects begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage and if they come online before the end of 2028.

That puts the 318 GW worth of projects planned to be completed in 2029 and later at explicit risk of losing their tax-credit eligibility. It also jeopardizes 2028 projects that either can’t break ground with just two months’ notice or which might hit snags that push their completion into 2029.

That doesn’t necessarily mean those projects would be cancelled, but it would scramble their economics, which were calculated under an entirely different set of policy assumptions. It’s near certain that some would fall through. Many more would be delayed as developers hash out new financial terms — read: higher power prices that will be passed onto consumers.

A slowdown in clean energy construction is the exact opposite of what the moment demands.

These days, when a new energy project is built in the U.S., more than nine times out of 10 it is a solar, battery, or wind installation. That’s not an exaggeration. In 2024, solar, batteries, and wind made up 93% of new energy resources. The year before that, it was 94%. Meanwhile, construction of new large-scale fossil-gas power plants is constrained by turbine shortages that are unlikely to ease in the near term.

At the same time, electricity demand is surging and expected to climb even higher in coming years as the development of AI sets off a race to construct power-hungry data centers.

Shortly after Thursday’s ceremony concluded, Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown and California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a joint lawsuit with nine other states challenging the elimination of California’s waiver.
Washington state officials have taken steps in recent days to prepare for the new federal law.
In a June 6 memo, the Washington State Department of Ecology notified vehicle manufacturers that it would temporarily pause compliance requirements for some vehicle categories.
“Washington state does not have the infrastructure in place to properly institute such a sweeping mandate like this, and the technology has not advanced enough yet to support the trucking industry’s rapid transition to clean energy.","WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Thursday signed legislation into law that blocks Washington and other states from following California’s lead in phasing out gas-powered vehicles.

Rep. Michael Baumgartner of Spokane was among dozens of Republican lawmakers invited to the White House for the occasion, which the president used to riff on a variety of topics in addition to the bill. Between calling Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell “a numbskull” and highlighting his own popularity on TikTok, Trump celebrated the revocation of Biden-era waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency that let California impose stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government.

After the Biden administration allowed California to ban the sale of gas-powered cars starting in 2035, Washington followed suit in 2022, requiring that all new cars sold in the state be either fully electric or plug-in hybrids. A total of 17 states has adopted similar rules that the newly signed law revokes.

“The automakers didn’t know what to do, because they’re really building cars for two countries,” Trump said. “When you have 17 states, you’re building cars for two countries.”

In an interview before the bill-signing ceremony, Baumgartner said the California regulation and its progeny would have been devastating to the U.S. economy.

“There does not exist the ability to magically create electric semi-trucks that move nearly 70% of the goods that Americans consume, so it would have been crippling to our economy if this rule was left in place,” he said. “You can’t run semi-trucks across America on unicorn laughter and aspirational dreams of environmental extremists.”

To revoke the waivers, the EPA issued under a previous administration, lawmakers invoked the Congressional Review Act, which allowed them to skirt the 60-vote supermajority required to pass most bills in the Senate. They did so despite the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s neutral adviser on rules, both informing senators that the EPA waivers didn’t count as the executive-branch rules for which the act applies.

Despite near-unanimous opposition from Democratic senators, the bill revoking California’s waivers received significant bipartisan support in the House, plus a single Democratic senator, Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin.

Trump was surprised on Thursday when a GOP lawmaker in the room told him 35 House Democrats had voted in favor. One of them was Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of southwest Washington, who runs an auto repair shop with her husband and has been a frequent critic of her party’s push to speed a transition to electric vehicles.

Shortly after Thursday’s ceremony concluded, Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown and California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a joint lawsuit with nine other states challenging the elimination of California’s waiver. The suit alleges that the resolution violates the separation of powers, the Take Care Clause and multiple federal statutes, including the Congressional Review Act and Administrative Procedure Act.

In the lawsuit, the plaintiff states allege that the Congressional Review Act has “never before been used in any context that resembles this one. It has certainly never been used, as it was here, to negate particular state laws.”

The lawsuit seeks to have the resolution declared unlawful and to require the federal government to implement the Clean Air Act consistent with the granted waivers.

“Transportation is the single greatest contributor to greenhouse gas pollution in Washington, and our residents understand the transition to zero-emission vehicles is critical in the fight against climate change,” Brown said in a statement Thursday. “This is the Trump administration’s latest unlawful attempt to derail Washington’s and the nation’s transition to a clean future.”

At the White House, Trump railed against Democrats’ efforts to use state and federal laws to phase out gas-powered vehicles – the country’s biggest single source of greenhouse gas emissions – and speed the adoption of wind, solar and other low-carbon energy sources.

“They’re making you buy stuff that doesn’t work,” the president said. “You should be given the option to buy the electric car, by a gasoline-powered car, buy a hybrid. Probably not hydrogen, because hydrogen has the tendency that when it blows up, you’re gonzo. It’s over.”

After the room broke out in laughter at that line, Trump turned to Rep. Steve Scalise and said, “It’ll make your accident look like peanuts,” apparently referring to the 2017 shooting that left the Louisiana Republican in critical condition.

Washington state officials have taken steps in recent days to prepare for the new federal law. In a June 6 memo, the Washington State Department of Ecology notified vehicle manufacturers that it would temporarily pause compliance requirements for some vehicle categories.

“This recent federal action introduces new uncertainty for states, manufacturers, and consumers at a time when both businesses and consumers are making real progress in reducing the transportation sector’s greenhouse gas emissions,” Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said in a statement June 6. “It undermines states’ rights, negatively impacts public health, and puts U.S. automakers at a competitive disadvantage in a global market that is rapidly transitioning to zero-emission vehicle technology.”

Sixkiller added that the agency would work with legislators, industry partners, local governments and other states to “stay on track and ensure continued progress toward our climate and public health goals.”

After the federal bill cleared the Senate in late May, Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement that the action was “brazenly out of step with the law, science, and public will.”

“For more than 50 years, states have possessed the ability to adopt stronger vehicle emissions standards to protect public health. Washington has exercised that right, along with 17 other states, resulting in cleaner air and healthier communities,” Ferguson said. “Despite this retreat from public health by the federal government, I’m committed to ensuring Washington moves forward on building a healthier, cleaner future.”

Thursday’s bill signing drew praise of the Washington Trucking Association, which said it remains committed to working with Washington lawmakers and the Department of Ecology on a “workable path to electrification.”

“California’s EV trucking mandates have been a disaster for states like Washington, and have caused real harm to the trucking industry, a key link in our trade-dependent state’s supply chain network,” the association’s president and CEO, Sheri Call, said in a statement. “Washington state does not have the infrastructure in place to properly institute such a sweeping mandate like this, and the technology has not advanced enough yet to support the trucking industry’s rapid transition to clean energy. Our neighbors in Oregon recently opted out of these mandates for these same reasons.”

Vicki Giles Fabré, vice president of the Washington State Auto Dealers Association, said that Washington’s franchised new car and truck dealers have “made substantial investments in electrification and remain committed to selling electric and hybrid vehicles.”

“The Washington State Auto Dealers Association intends to work with state policymakers to find solutions that incentivize increased adoption of these vehicles, while also supporting the needs of franchised dealers, their employees, and the customers they serve,” Fabré said in a statement Wednesday.

According to Sixkiller, one in five new vehicles sold today runs on zero-emission technology.

“We’re not going to slow down that progress. Washingtonians already experience the impacts of climate change every year, from drought and wildfire to flooding and sea-level rise,” Sixkiller said in a statement following the Attorney General’s lawsuit. “As our Attorney General’s Office fights to protect our state’s rights, we’ll continue working with the Legislature, industry partners, local governments, and other states to continue our progress on clean transportation. At a time of great uncertainty, that’s a promise we can keep.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/BGWNVD6FXmvao3VnsRkON3eCLuI=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/06/12/684b59317bf85.hires.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 06:04:28.560791

(AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.
The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov.
“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said.
“North Carolina was first in flight.
The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.","GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.

The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro’s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.

JetZero has said it’s already raised about $300 million toward investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina’s robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.

“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.”

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project discussed earlier Thursday by a state committee that awards economic incentives.

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.35 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers’ paychecks. The incentives also include up to $785 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and up to $450 million from the General Assembly in part to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.

A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

“We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O’Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It’s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The 5-year-old company says the plane’s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.

“It’s going to deliver a better passenger experience than you’ve ever had before on any other plane,” O’Leary said.

Stein said the state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.

The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.

LFP batteries are well-positioned to dominate the mass-market segment, enabling affordable, safe, and durable electric mobility solutions.","As India accelerates its shift toward electric mobility, battery technology has become a defining force in shaping the country’s clean transport future. Within this landscape, Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries are emerging as a front-runner, driven by their affordability, safety, and long operational life. These qualities make them especially well-suited for Indian conditions, from extreme temperatures to congested urban roads, and ideal for use in two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and light commercial vehicles.

What was once considered a compromise on energy density is now being recognised as a practical and reliable choice for powering the next phase of India’s EV journey.

The growing importance of LFP batteries in India’s EV market

With electric vehicles gaining steady ground across segments, India’s focus is shifting from adoption to optimisation, where the right battery technology can make or break long-term viability. Projections indicate that annual EV sales could approach 10 million units by 2030, positioning India as a significant player in the global EV landscape. As automakers and policymakers focus on scaling EV adoption, battery selection becomes a key factor influencing the total cost of ownership, vehicle range, safety, and lifecycle sustainability.

LFP batteries have found favour in this environment due to several critical factors:

Affordability: LFP chemistry uses iron and phosphate, which are abundantly available and cheaper than cobalt or nickel used in traditional lithium-ion batteries. This helps reduce the upfront cost of EVs, making them more accessible to the mass market.

Safety: LFP batteries are known for superior thermal and chemical stability, significantly reducing risks of overheating and fire incidents—a crucial factor in the hot and varied climates across India.

Longevity: With cycle lives often exceeding 4,000 full charges, LFP batteries offer longer operational life compared to many alternatives, reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Sustainability: LFP batteries do not rely on cobalt, a material associated with ethical and supply chain concerns. The use of iron and phosphate supports a more sustainable, environmentally friendly battery supply chain.

From lab to market: The evolution of LFP technology

The development of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO₄) as a viable cathode material dates back to 1996, when Professor John B. Goodenough and his team at the University of Texas identified its potential for use in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Their research introduced a cathode material that offered an appealing combination of cost-effectiveness, wide material availability, and enhanced thermal and chemical stability—qualities that continue to underpin its growing relevance today.

The unique chemistry of LFP batteries involves the use of iron, a naturally abundant and stable element, and phosphate groups, which form a robust crystal lattice. This structure allows lithium ions to move efficiently during charging and discharging cycles, contributing to the battery’s remarkable cycle life, often exceeding 4,000 charge cycles. In contrast, traditional lithium-ion batteries with cobalt-based cathodes typically offer around 1,000–2,000 cycles.

Despite initial challenges related to lower energy density, advancements in electrode design and manufacturing have significantly improved the performance of LFP batteries. Today, these batteries are increasingly recognised as a practical and sustainable choice for India’s diverse EV market, offering a combination of safety, affordability, and longevity.

Technical advances driving LFP adoption

While LFP batteries initially lagged in energy density—meaning vehicles powered by them had shorter ranges—the gap has narrowed significantly. Improvements in electrode materials, cell design, and manufacturing techniques have enhanced energy density and overall battery efficiency.

Leading EV manufacturers and battery suppliers in India are increasingly adopting LFP battery technology for entry-level and mid-range EVs. This is due to a balance of cost, safety, and durability that fits the Indian market’s practical needs.

LFP cathodes now command 40% of the global EV battery market in GWh terms, up from 32% in 2023, signalling strong global confidence in this chemistry. As India expands its local battery manufacturing under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, LFP batteries stand to benefit from domestic supply chains and cost reductions.

Challenges and considerations

Despite the many advantages, LFP batteries do have limitations:

Lower energy density: Although improved, LFP batteries still typically provide less driving range per charge compared to Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) batteries, which remain preferred for high-performance EVs.

Size and weight: LFP battery packs tend to be slightly larger and heavier for the same capacity, which can impact vehicle design and efficiency.

However, for many Indian consumers—especially in urban and short-range usage scenarios—these trade-offs are outweighed by the affordability, safety, and longevity benefits.

The road ahead for LFP in India

India’s EV ecosystem is expected to become increasingly diversified in battery chemistry to meet different vehicle needs and price points. LFP batteries are well-positioned to dominate the mass-market segment, enabling affordable, safe, and durable electric mobility solutions.

With government policies incentivising battery manufacturing and EV adoption, alongside growing consumer demand, LFP batteries will play a pivotal role in shaping India’s sustainable transport future. For companies like Neuron Energy, focusing on reliable and cost-effective battery technology like LFP is critical to supporting this electrification journey.",https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2022/03/Image-Pratik-Kamdar-Co-Founder-Neuron-Energy-1200x961.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 04:59:25.679292

Not only will power plants be able to release more greenhouse gases, but another regulatory rollback will allow them to pollute the air with highly toxic chemicals like mercury.
Public health and environmental groups have said the rollbacks are dangerous and have promised to challenge them in court.
However, even partially dismantling the rules would lead to more pollutants like smog, lead and mercury, in addition to greenhouse gases and increased global heating.
Greenhouse gas emissions from gas- and coal-fired power plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,’’ the EPA said.","The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday announced a plan to repeal a landmark pollution rule that aims to eliminate most greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in the next decade.

Not only will power plants be able to release more greenhouse gases, but another regulatory rollback will allow them to pollute the air with highly toxic chemicals like mercury.

“By gutting these clean air standards, the EPA is giving a free pass to the nation’s dirtiest power plants and most toxic polluters,” said Democratic Senator from Rhode Island Sheldon Whitehouse in a statement responding to the announcement, as The Washington Post reported. “Pollutants like mercury and greenhouse gases are harmful, a settled scientific fact for decades, and the evidence has only gotten stronger.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said repealing the pollution rules would help “unleash” American energy by removing billions in industry costs, reported The Associated Press.

If the rollbacks are approved and made final, they would reverse efforts made by the Biden administration to improve environmental conditions in communities that are mostly low-income, majority Black or Hispanic and are heavily burdened with industrial pollution.

Public health and environmental groups have said the rollbacks are dangerous and have promised to challenge them in court.

“Ignoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,’’ said Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court.”

The regulations are among roughly 30 environmental rules targeted by Zeldin in March, on what he referred to as the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

Dr. Lisa Patel, executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, said it was “unconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.”

The rules could prevent approximately 30,000 deaths annually while saving $275 billion, an Associated Press assessment of the rollbacks showed.

The EPA-targeted regulations will not necessarily be eliminated in their entirety, as they must go through the federal rulemaking process, which can take years; a public comment period; and scientific justification.

However, even partially dismantling the rules would lead to more pollutants like smog, lead and mercury, in addition to greenhouse gases and increased global heating.

The country’s power sector is second only to transportation as its biggest contributor to climate change.

Trump’s EPA has argued that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide produced by power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution,” so do not meet the Clean Air Act threshold for regulatory action.

Greenhouse gas emissions from gas- and coal-fired power plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,’’ the EPA said. “This Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator during the Obama administration, said Zeldin’s “dismantling of our nation’s protections from power plant pollution is absolutely illogical and indefensible. It’s a purely political play that goes against decades of science and policy review,” as The Guardian reported.

“By giving a green light to more pollution, his legacy will forever be someone who does the bidding of the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our health,” McCarthy added. “Everyone will be affected by his actions, but the most vulnerable among us, our kids and grandkids, will suffer the most.”",https://www.ecowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/coal-plant-child-school-bus.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:01:34.503866

""California is moving faster than ever before to build the clean energy we need - now with the world's largest solar and battery project,"" said Governor Gavin Newsom.
In 2024, Governor Newsom initiated a state-level collaborative to continue to innovate and strengthen safety standards for battery storage systems through cross-agency collaboration.
For more information about the Darden project, view the fact sheet - PDF and watch the YouTube Shorts video.","The California Energy Commission (CEC) on Wednesday approved the Darden Clean Energy Project (DCEP), the first to be permitted under the state's Opt-In Certification program.

Once built, DCEP will be the largest battery energy storage system in the world, highlighting California's leadership in clean energy innovation and infrastructure.

Authorized under Assembly Bill 205, the Opt-In Certification program provides a consolidated state permitting option for eligible clean energy projects, supporting California's transition to 100 percent zero-carbon retail electric sales by 2045, as required by Senate Bill 100. Under statute, the environmental review for a project must be completed within 270 days from the point the project application is deemed complete, unless significant project changes arise that require more time to review.

""California is moving faster than ever before to build the clean energy we need - now with the world's largest solar and battery project,"" said Governor Gavin Newsom. ""With a record amount of clean energy capacity added last year, we're creating jobs and supporting local communities - all while building a cleaner, more reliable power grid.""

DCEP will be built on 9,500 acres of land in western Fresno County that is no longer able to support agricultural production. The project includes a 1,150-megawatt (MW) solar facility with approximately 3.1 million panels and up to 1,150 MW (4,600 megawatt-hours) of battery storage - enough to power 850,000 homes for four hours. The project owner is IP Darden I, LLC, a subsidiary of Intersect Power.

Projects seeking approval through the Opt-In Certification program are required to provide community and economic benefits. The DCEP includes:

$2 million in community investments over the next decade starting with a $320,000 commitment to Centro La Familia Advocacy Services, a nonprofit supporting crime victims, family wellness, and civic engagement in rural communities.

More than 2,000 prevailing-wage construction jobs to support the local workforce throughout the construction period, which will last from 1.5 to 3 years.

An estimated $169 million in economic benefits to the local area over the project's lifetime, estimated at 35 years.

""Today's clean energy projects must do more than just deliver megawatts. They should create value in the communities where they're built,"" said CEC Commissioner Noemí Gallardo. ""This project exemplifies a community-focused approach that advances the state's energy goals while creating benefits for local workers and residents.""

Battery storage systems are important for California's clean energy future because they store excess energy produced during peak production periods and discharge it when demand is high or generation drops, like in the evening.

""The transition to 100 percent clean electricity by 2045 requires bold, utility-scale projects like Darden,"" said CEC Chair David Hochschild. ""This project is significant not only for its size but its cutting-edge design and safety measures.""

As California rapidly scales up battery storage, safety remains a top priority. In 2024, Governor Newsom initiated a state-level collaborative to continue to innovate and strengthen safety standards for battery storage systems through cross-agency collaboration. Key efforts include an update to the California Fire Code to include specific fire safety requirements for stationary lithium-ion battery storage systems, and the California Public Utilities Commission's approval of new safety standards and enhanced oversight of emergency plans for grid-scale battery energy storage systems.

California leads the U.S. and trails only China globally in battery storage capacity, with more than 200 utility-scale systems and over 250,000 commercial and residential installations, totaling more than 15,700 megawatts statewide.

The Darden project builds on a series of clean energy records recently set in California. On three out of every five days last year, California's main grid hit 100 percent clean energy for some portion of the day. That momentum continues in 2025. So far this year, the main grid has reached 100 percent clean energy on 138 out of 151 days, or 91 percent of days through May. In 2024, the state added 7,000 megawatts of clean energy capacity to the grid - the largest single-year increase in state history - and added 25,000 megawatts of capacity over the past five years.

WASHINGTON — Delivering on President Donald J. Trump’s bold agenda to restore American energy and mineral independence, the Department of the Interior today announced the publication of a Request for Information and Interest to explore the potential for seabed mineral leasing offshore American Samoa. The Request for Information, scheduled for publication in the Federal Register in the coming days, will launch a 30-day public comment period and mark the first formal step toward what could be the first mineral lease sale in federal waters in over 30 years.

This strategic move builds on the Department’s May 2025 action to evaluate new opportunities for critical mineral development as directed by President Trump’s Executive Order on Unleashing America’s Offshore Critical Minerals and Resources.

“This is what American leadership looks like,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “While other nations are racing to dominate critical mineral production, President Trump is making sure the United States leads from the front. We’re taking action to put America first, unlock our vast offshore mineral resources, and end our dangerous dependence on foreign supply chains.”

Interior oversees 3.2 billion acres of the Outer Continental Shelf—larger than the entire U.S. landmass. The Trump administration is prioritizing commonsense reforms that unleash these resources while respecting communities, strengthening national security and creating high-paying American jobs.

The RFI, issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, seeks input from a wide range of voices—American Samoa’s Indigenous community, ocean users, industry, government agencies and the public. Feedback will inform BOEM’s analysis of mineral potential, industry interest, environmental safeguards, cultural heritage considerations and current ocean uses such as navigation and fishing.

“President Trump is rebuilding American strength at home and abroad—and this RFI is part of that mission,” said BOEM Principal Deputy Director Matt Giacona. “We are fully committed to an open process that ensures the people of American Samoa are heard and respected as we explore this opportunity for growth and strategic advantage.”

The comment period ends July 16, 2025. The RFI and submission details are available at www.boem.gov/American-Samoa.

Any future lease sale will be subject to robust environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act and will comply with all applicable laws, including the Endangered Species Act and National Historic Preservation Act.

How would a repeal of the 12% federal excise tax on new trucks

Jason Cannon:

Impact the trucking industry? You're watching CCJs 10 44, a weekly web episode that brings you the latest trucking industry news and updates from the editors of CCJ. Don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell for notifications, so you'll never miss an installment of 10 44. Hey everybody, welcome back. I'm Jason Cannon, and my co-host is Matt Cole. While attempts have been made in Congress in recent years to repeal the federal excise tax that adds 12% to the cost of all new heavy trucks and trailers, none have come to fruition yet, despite the trucking industry's calls for repeal.

Matt Cole:

In its latest research, the American Transportation Research Institute dove into the origins of the FET and how a hypothetical repeal of the tax would benefit not only the trucking industry, but the environment and highway safety as well.

Jeff Short:

The trucking industry uniquely on its new equipment, pays a federal excise tax that is 12%, and that's on new trucks, new trucking equipment like trailers. Generally, it has to be a Class eight vehicle. It has to be above that weight and can't be used for anything else. So there are a couple loopholes. The law itself isn't terribly straightforward, but that's the general idea. On the largest trucks out there at the first retail sale, you are going to have to pay a 12% excise tax. This tax was first introduced actually in 1917, so it's been a couple years. It started in World War I and the tax was placed on a number of different items. It wasn't just trucks, it was just about anything you can think of from pianos to hunting equipment, they taxed certain types of clothes. When you looked through the list, there are some very strange items in there that were taxed, but all of these taxes have disappeared since World War I, of course, but this one has persisted.

It was at first 3% and then it went up to 8% in the 1950s, and then the 1980s it went up to 12%. Obviously, this is a lot of money. Our analysis on the truck, FET came out of our research advisory committee last year because the industry has been paying the highest taxes into it ever. This is for a number of reasons. Truck prices have gone up, so since this is a percent of the sale, the tax itself has gone up. The amount we pay into it has gone up all the way to about, I'm sorry, 6 billion in revenue per year.

Jason Cannon:

So at today's truck and trailer prices, how much does 12% actually add to the sticker price?

Jeff Short:

So that all depends on obviously what truck you're buying, but for the most part, you're going to be paying at least $20,000 for a new Class eight truck. This may go up all the way to 25,000, maybe even more depending on the cost of the truck, depending on what you have on the truck, on the trailer side, refrigerated trailers, they're going to be quite a bit more than just your standard 53 foot trailer. So those are going to obviously be a little more, that range is probably 5,000 all the way up to over $10,000. So it's quite a bit of money, and this is one thing that caught our research advisory committee's eye. Of course, you've got electric vehicles costing somewhere in the neighborhood of four to $450,000 at 12%, you're getting up towards $50,000, not $25,000, not $20,000. You're getting much, much higher to comply with some of the rules that were coming out in California that no longer apply of course. But if you want to get into these newer vehicles that are so much more expensive, you're still paying that tax.

Matt Cole:

The revenue from the FET goes into the Federal Highway Trust Fund for transportation projects. If it were repealed, how big of a hit would the fund take?

Jeff Short:

The Highway Trust fund, of course, is the mechanism the federal government uses to pay for transportation. We're actually kind of a unique industry in that we pay a lot of money into these roadways that we use, and in some sense that's a good thing. We are able to say, all right, we need money for these critical pieces of freight infrastructure. Obviously, the interstate systems very important. A lot of this money goes towards that. So overall, at $6 billion, which was collected in 2023, this is a drop in the bucket for the federal government for the overall budget, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of $4 trillion that they bring in. This is way less than a fraction of a percent, but for the Highway Trust Fund, this represents about 14%. The tax on gas and diesel make up the vast majority of highway trust fund income, of course, but this is sizable and it would likely have to be replaced in some form or fashion.

Jason Cannon:

While an FET repeal might actually hurt the Highway Trust fund, A TR, I found that getting rid of the tax could benefit the environment as well as highway safety.

Jeff Short:

So we feel an FET repeal would have great benefits to both safety and the environment. Ultimately, our analysis lies on the fact that the truck, FET at 12% discourages the purchase of new vehicles. This 12% tax is not unused vehicles, so it gives a discount to the alternative to new vehicles, which is used vehicles. If it were repealed, our belief is that more new trucks would be sold, and thus with those newer trucks out there, the age of the overall fleet would decrease, and that decrease would be accelerated on an annual basis, thus creating environmental and safety benefits. So at the highest level, what we had to do, it was very complex, but we had to look at the entire truck fleet estimate what its age was and how many miles per year each truck drove. And that's a really complicated thing to do. But at the end of the day, the newer trucks were driving about 80,000 miles a year on average, and the older ones were driving much less.

So their impact isn't as much. We were looking at pre 2000 trucks, they're probably going 5,000 miles a year on average because they just can't do that type of job that the new class eights do. So to be fair, we had to look at it that way and model it out. Ultimately, that gave us unique insight into the influence older trucks have on industry-wide safety environmental metrics. So then we went into the stage of the research where we looked at acceleration. What does acceleration mean? Accelerated sales with more new truck sales through a trickle down effect where the oldest vehicles were accelerated out of the population, the age overall decreased. And then what we did was say, all right, how much cleaner or how much safer is a new truck compared to some of the used trucks that are out there? From an environmental perspective, we found that as a truck, FET repeal increases demand for new vehicles.

Industry CO2 will of course decrease at an accelerated rate. That's because newer engines are cleaner. They have to meet certain standards. So our finding was each year the industry adds these newer, cleaner diesel vehicles that they wouldn't have otherwise. A truck repeal a truck, FET repeal would increase the annual emissions reduction by 16%. So what does that mean? Our calculation came out to a cumulative savings of nearly 66 million metric tons of CO2 across 10 years, which is a tremendous amount of CO2. It's a great way to help the environment simply by removing attacks and encouraging folks to buy the latest and greatest trucks that are out there. On the safety side, the accelerated replacement of all trucks added more a DAS, advanced driver assistance systems for collision warning. That's sort of equipment. It added more of that to the industry annually because these items are coming more and more often on new trucks, and you go back 15 years and they're pretty scarce. So what did this come down to in numbers? It prevented nearly 750 crashes per year, and the savings was 13.5 billion in crash costs across 10 years. So this is certainly a good way adding those devices out there to really increase and improve safety with some real numbers. There

Matt Cole:

Are also some operational benefits to an FET repeal for Fleet that actually found,

Jeff Short:

We worked with a company called Decisive to see how much cheaper maintenance would be per mile for newer trucks versus older trucks just to show that benefit as well. And for the older trucks you see closer to a dollar per mile for repair and maintenance, and in the newer trucks it was closer to 15 cents a mile. So that piece of the benefit certainly is going to benefit. It's good for carriers to have a look at that and see how much less you would have to spend on maintenance and repair.

Jason Cannon:

As Jeff mentioned earlier, the highway trust fund would take a pretty big revenue hit if the FET is repealed, but there are some ways the government could recoup that loss.

Jeff Short:

So that could be offset with an increase in the diesel tax. We calculated that the gap could be filled with an increase in the diesel tax of 11.20 cents per gallon. That would bring it up somewhere in the mid 30 range. But if you look at the diesel tax itself, it's been stuck at 24.40 cents per gallon since 1994. If you adjust that for inflation, if they had increased it with inflation, it really should be somewhere in the 50 cent range to begin with. It's likely time for that tax to kind of catch up with where it should be. Certainly, there's been a lot of inflation since, and since this one's a per gallon tax, it has nothing to do with price or cost of the stuff. It's being used to build like roadways. It really does need an adjustment, so this would be a good place for it to have that adjustment and a good reason why to make that adjustment.",https://img.ccjdigital.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/06/maxresdefault.jGGHJUzV1u.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-06-13 04:59:33.736701

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.","WASHINGTON — Small business owners and community leaders from rural regions in Western states including Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah pressed lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week to preserve clean energy tax credits on the chopping block in the Republicans’ “one big beautiful” mega-bill, now in the Senate.

The suite of investment, production and residential tax credits enacted and expanded under the Democrats’ own big budget reconciliation bill in 2022, titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change.

The credits have spurred hundreds of billions in investment dollars in advanced manufacturing and production since 2022, and contributed to job creation, largely in states that elected President Donald Trump to a second term.

Small business operators and community leaders from rural and mountainous areas of the United States that have benefited from the boom in alternative energy sources say the campaign to end the tax credits will also cause job losses and cut options for consumers.

Solar projects in Alaska

Chase Christie, director of development for Alaska Solar LLC, said his company installs four to five large-scale solar projects per year in remote Alaskan villages and also fits and services smaller residential solar installations.

“They take a lot of planning, a lot of logistics,” Christie told States Newsroom in an interview Wednesday.

“For going into a remote village where there’s tundra, we might need to go there in the dead of winter so we can work on frozen ground,” he added. “Other places we won’t go until summer. So we have these large gaps in between these larger projects, and a company like ours absolutely relies on the residential installations to keep our workforce going.”

Christie, who met Tuesday with staffers for Alaska’s Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said in January he let a handful of workers go and paused most new hiring.

“Our workforce is roughly half of what it usually is just because we’re not sure which direction things are going to go,” he said.

Christie was among a dozen small energy business owners, municipal government officials and nonprofit employees focused on energy options for low-income households who States Newsroom spoke to Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement: “Senator Sullivan supports energy projects that lower costs for Alaska. The Senator and his team have been meeting with a number of Alaskans about energy tax credits. As we wait for text from the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator is working with his colleagues to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between promoting stable and predictable tax policy, advancing projects that benefit Alaska, and addressing the need to reduce the federal deficit.”

Murkowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elimination of tax credits

Senators are hashing out language for the massive Republican agenda bill that will extend and expand the 2017 tax law, costing roughly $3.8 trillion, and cut spending in other areas to offset the price tag.

A contingent of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam,” won on accelerating the expiration of the energy tax credits and tightening restrictions on eligibility as a way to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts that Trump campaigned on.

The language in a section of the House bill, passed 215-214 on May 22, titled “Working Families Over Elites,” terminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, worth up to $3,200 for homeowners who make energy upgrades to their property.

Among the slate of other affected IRA tax credits, the House bill also speeds up the expiration of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a credit dating back decades that was updated in 2022.

The credit is available to taxpayers who invest in “energy property,” including solar installations to provide electricity and heat, fuel cells, small wind turbines, geothermal pumps, and other electricity-producing technologies.

House Republicans wrote provisions to eliminate the credit for facilities placed into service after 2028 and end eligibility for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

The credit is worth up to 30% of the cost of the project, plus two bonus credits up to 10% each if the project includes mostly domestically produced material and if it’s located in an “energy community,” meaning a place where a coal plant has closed or where unemployment reaches a certain threshold.

The bill also repeals a taxpayer’s ability to transfer the tax credits as a way to finance a project, and introduces restrictions on foreign-made components that industry professionals say essentially makes the credit unworkable.

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, as of June 4, the elimination of the clean energy investment and production tax credits will save roughly $249 billion over the next decade.

Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a right-of-center think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Thursday in a new analysis that “The final House bill makes impressive cuts to the IRA green energy tax credits, but it does so in part by introducing more complexity.”

The group is advocating for senators to reduce the tax credit rates and make clearer complicated language, like the provision around “foreign entities of concern.”

Keeping on the heat during a Montana winter

But Logan Smith, weatherization program manager for the Human Resource Development Council in central Montana, argues the credits have been a lifeline for lower-income rural residents.

“If I can get solar panels on each of the clients’ homes, that means that their power is going to stay on in the middle of winter,” Smith said. “Because every winter we plan for losing power for about a week, that’s just something we grew up with. … But if we have solar panels, the power stays on, the heat stays on.”

Ralph Waters, owner of SBS Solar in Missoula, Montana, became emotional when talking about how an early termination of the tax credits could slow his business and result in having to lay off half his workforce.

He criticized the politicization of the tax incentives.

“Montana is deeply red, but it’s also a very practical place. And so green energy renewables becomes a taboo phrase somehow,” Waters said. “The practical energy needs are undeniable, and so if we can get past our disagreements about the phraseology and realize that it’s electrons, watts, and amps. And it’s cheaper.”

A 2025 report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) indicated that the clean energy industry nowadays sustains a considerable portion of the U.S. economy — about $18 billion in gross domestic product contributions and 122,000 employment opportunities, to be more precise.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States' energy sector contributed around 24% of the country's planet-warming pollution in the year 2022. As more and more electric technologies power our daily lives, demand for electricity rises, and the power industry often struggles to supply it.

Fortunately, renewable alternatives to fuel-burning are only growing, both in diversity and in yield. With over 800 clean-energy manufacturing plants across the country, per the latest report, we don't have to place strain on our planet to energize our modern lifestyle.

""We have seen a tremendous amount of momentum over just even the past couple of years in clean energy manufacturing growth,"" the ACP's MJ Shiao remarked.

Clean energy's rising viability holds promise for both everyday individuals and the industry as a whole, earning its workforce salaries far above the American average while leaving room for nationwide economic growth. Current estimates project that renewable energy will generate around 575,000 jobs and $86 billion in GDP contributions by the end of the decade.

Even a small reduction in combustion-based power can mean cutting down on millions of metric tons of carbon pollution, now that clean energy is on the rise. Since carbon pollution is the leading source of our planet's climate crises — from intensified extreme weather events to food and water shortages caused by global overheating — any and all sustainable initiatives can go a long way.

For your part, you can make the most of cutting-edge clean energy innovations by leveling up your home energy systems. Upgrading your HVAC and installing home solar panels can be a strong eco-conscious start, and platforms such as EnergySage can guide you to the best local services while saving you thousands of dollars in installation costs.

If you can't afford the upfront costs associated with solar panels, check out solar leasing programs. Palmetto's LightReach program installs panels for no money down and helps you lock in low energy rates.

""We think we've got a winning message, one that is bringing positivity, and of course, economic growth to the country,"" John Hensley of the ACP reported.

He said an additional 12% global decline in 2023 made solar the fastest-growing and most affordable clean energy source today.","New Delhi: The Sixth Meeting of the ISA Regional Committee for Europe and the Others Region was held in Brussels with participation from 20 countries and partners to review solar energy progress and advance global collaborations under the International Solar Alliance (ISA).

The meeting was chaired by Germany, the regional Vice President, and convened to align strategic priorities and assess implementation status across member nations.

ISA Director General Ashish Khanna said, “Your presence here today reflects our shared commitment to advancing the global transition to solar energy. Our focus must now turn to ensuring these advancements translate into jobs, equity, and climate resilience.” He added that $2 trillion was invested in clean energy last fiscal, with solar photovoltaics leading, but only 15% of it reached low- and middle-income countries and less than 2% was directed to Africa.

Highlighting energy access challenges, Khanna said 600 million people in Africa remain without electricity access. “ISA is mobilising $200 million to leverage more than 30 times the private investment in Distributed Renewable Energy in Africa,” he added.

Tobias Rinke, Deputy Head of Division, Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Germany, said the alliance’s membership has grown to 123 countries with doubling of active engagements since 2022. He referenced COP28 commitments, where nearly 200 countries agreed to triple renewable capacity and transition from fossil fuels. “Solar energy plays a central role in achieving these goals,” he said.

In a session with ISA Director General, IEA’s Laura Cozzi said, “AI-related infrastructure could add electricity demand equivalent to a ‘new Japan’ by 2030.” She said AI can optimise grid operations and improve energy access. She also announced the launch of an Energy and AI Observatory by the IEA.

In a separate session, CIFF CEO Kate Hampton said the key financing challenge is the shortage of catalytic equity rather than debt. She said philanthropy can fill this gap and support country platforms with technical assistance, policy engagement, and junior equity. “A major constraint lies in the availability of skilled professionals capable of navigating delivery, policy, and finance,” she added.

European Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jørgensen, in his keynote address, said the cost of solar power has dropped 82% in the EU over the past decade. He said an additional 12% global decline in 2023 made solar the fastest-growing and most affordable clean energy source today.

Upcoming discussions at the meeting include topics on Catalytic Finance in Africa, ISA’s STAR-Cs initiative, AI in the energy sector, and a roundtable on energy storage and green hydrogen.

Clean energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration are under debate in the Senate. House Republicans voted to gut these programs, but not all of their fellow Republicans in the Senate are on board. NPR's Barbara Sprunt has more.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: President Trump has long talked about his frustrations with clean energy provisions signed into law by President Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act. Here he is at an April rally in Michigan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round.

(BOOING)

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

Because the fuel rodlets must be cut open to access the fuel pellets, these types of exams are known as destructive examinations.","Father and son entrepreneurs Mehul and Milan Shah have patented a new nuclear fuel design that could reduce nuclear waste, enhance safety and lower costs for today’s pressurized heavy water reactors.

The Shahs — CEO and chief operating officer, respectively, of Clean Core Thorium Energy, along with chief technology officer Paul Chan — combined thorium with high-assay low enriched uranium, which is enriched to between 5% and 20%. Typically, uranium in pressurized heavy-water reactor fuel is not enriched, meaning the fissionable uranium-235 element makes up less than 0.72% of the total.

“Our eureka moment came when we successfully developed a proliferation-resistant fuel design using thorium and high-assay low enriched uranium without requiring any modifications to the reactor or fuel bundle external geometry,” Mehul Shah said.

Called Advanced Nuclear Energy for Enriched Life (ANEEL), the Shah’s fuel design could operate in pressurized heavy-water reactors worldwide.

But before ANEEL fuel can enter the marketplace, the Shahs must prove its performance and safety to industry and regulators.

Unparalleled capabilities and expertise

After a few years searching for the right research facility, the Shahs connected with researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), one of the few places in the world with the expertise and capabilities to properly qualify their design at an accelerated rate.

INL and other national laboratories make their resources available to private companies to foster innovation in the energy industry. Without national laboratories, private companies could not create these essential capabilities on their own. This is especially true for the nuclear industry, and Clean Core is just one of many companies INL supports in nuclear fuel development.

In particular, the Shahs wanted the high neutron flux and high burnup offered by INL’s Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) and the “crash test” capabilities offered by the Transient Test Reactor.

“Those things aren’t found anywhere else in the world,” Mehul Shah said. “ATR is the Holy Grail for nuclear testing. Qualifying our fuel for testing there is like securing a seat on the only flight to the moon.”

In spring of 2024, ATR engineers placed 216 ANEEL fuel pellets in ATR’s special clover leaf-shaped reactor core. After four months of irradiation time, the first batch of fuel pellets is ready for examination. The remaining pellets will stay in ATR through spring of 2026 so researchers can study how higher burnup affects the fuel.

For the Shahs, this is the moment of truth. The data gathered through the efforts of INL experts will help prove the ANEEL concept for regulators and investors.

A national lab, university and private collaboration

Post-irradiation examination of the ANEEL fuel marks the culmination of a years-long collaboration among INL, Clean Core and Texas A&M University. While most private companies conducting nuclear fuel research receive some kind of government funding to help pay for their projects at INL, Clean Core’s irradiation testing at ATR is all privately funded.

INL sent uranium oxide to Texas A&M researchers, who mixed it with commercially sourced thorium oxide in a proprietary blend and fabricated the fuel pellets under INL’s Quality Assurance program. Unlike conventional fuel pellets, the ANEEL fuel is annular, which means it’s fabricated with a hole in the center of the pellet to better accommodate fission gas release at high burnup. The fuel pellets were then sent back to INL for quality control, assembly into the fuel capsule and insertion into ATR.

“The quality control was an adventure in itself,” said Michael Worrall, an INL researcher and principal investigator for the Clean Core irradiation experiment. “We measured them all, weighed them all, then sent several samples to MFC (INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex) to be dissolved. Thorium oxide doesn’t dissolve the same way uranium oxide does, but at the end of the day, the analytical lab got it done. They did mass spectrometry to make sure Texas A&M blended the pellets correctly. Under the leadership of Dr. Sean McDeavitt, the Texas A&M team nailed it. Everything was in spec. They did really well.”

Researchers divided the 216 fuel pellets that Texas A&M made for the ATR experiments into 12 capsules. They then divided the capsules into three “baskets” for insertion into the ATR core. The 12 capsules have different blends of uranium and thorium, including one capsule with pure uranium oxide as a control.

Each basket undergoes a different level of burnup — the amount of time spent being bombarded with neutrons in the ATR reactor core. The first basket was removed from the core in November 2024, achieving a fuel burnup of up to 25 gigawatt days per ton. After four months in ATR’s cooling pool and shipment from ATR to MFC, the fuel was ready for examination by mid-March 2025.

Post irradiation examination

Like similar fuel irradiation efforts for private companies, Clean Core’s post-irradiation examination starts at the Hot Fuels Examination Facility, the nation’s largest and best-equipped hot cell for processing and examining irradiated nuclear materials and fuels.

After arrival at the facility, one step in the post-irradiation examination process is to perform neutron radiography on the fuel to evaluate the fuel’s physical changes during irradiation.

Figure 1 shows the capsules after irradiation in ATR. These initial images reveal no obvious cracks in the fuel, no collapse of the annular fuel form and no gross deformation of the rodlet.

These early results indicate good structural integrity and irradiation stability for Clean Core’s ANEEL fuel. “The irradiated pellets look exactly like when they were fabricated,” said Chan. “This is important news for the fuel community. This is great.”

Following radiography, the fuel will undergo several more non-destructive exams, including a visual examination; profilometry, which measures the rod’s surface looking for physical dimensional changes; and detailed gamma scanning, which looks for fission-product distribution in the fuel. Finally, the fuel rodlets will be disassembled so the fuel pellets can be inspected. Because the fuel rodlets must be cut open to access the fuel pellets, these types of exams are known as destructive examinations. Destructive examinations will include collecting fission gasses within the fuel pin and using microscopy on individual fuel pellets to examine the effect that irradiation has on the fuel’s microstructure.

“We’ll be looking at the grain growth and the grain structure to see how it behaved,” said INL experiment manager Ethan Oberg, who will lead the post-irradiation examination of the Clean Core fuels. “We will also examine the fuel’s porosity and fission products distribution.”

Establishing U.S. leadership

These collaborations between private companies and INL help industry power the reactors of the future. “One of our major goals is helping create nuclear leadership and, in our case fuel leadership, in America,” Milan Shah said.

INL plays an essential role in meeting these goals. Combined, the lab’s one-of-a-kind manufacturing, irradiation and post-irradiation examination capabilities mean companies can prove their fuels with confidence in the resulting data. “This fuel has really embarked on a journey that would not be possible without the experts and capabilities found at INL,” Mehul Shah said.",https://inl.gov/content/uploads/2025/06/25-50015_ATR_CCTE_collab_sc.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 06:01:57.565218

The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

Trump called California’s regulations “crazy” at a White House ceremony where he was expected to sign the resolutions.

California is expected to challenge Trump's latest move targeting its vehicle standards rules in court.

""Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,"" Newsom said. ""We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.""

The three resolutions Trump signed will block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

RELATED STORY | Electric vehicle sales slow in the US. What's behind the decline?

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal.

The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move follows other moves the Trump administration has made to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

RELATED STORY | What would losing the EV tax credit mean for consumers and carmakers?

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California's rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

In a lavish ceremony in the White House East Room, Mr. Trump blasted the Biden administration for granting California a waiver to impose the stringent emissions standards.

“Under the previous administration, the federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry all over the country, all of the world, actually,” the president said.

“The horrible scheme would abolish the internal combustion engine, which most people prefer,” Mr. Trump said, adding that California’s mandate essentially requires companies to build cars for “two different countries” because they have to meet separate emissions standards based on where the car is sold.

Mr. Trump signed a resolution approved by Congress last month that nixes the most aggressive steps in the country to phase out gas-powered cars and replace them with electric vehicles. The president also put his signature on measures that will overturn California’s authority to impose stricter emissions rules for passenger vehicles and commercial trucks, along with higher standards for heavy-duty diesel engines.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin attended the event along with members of the car industry and House Speaker Mike Johnson, Louisiana Republican.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state Attorney General Rob Bonta sued the Trump administration Thursday to block the move, saying the state has the authority to set its own vehicle emission rules. Nine other Democrat-led states also sued the administration over its action: Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

The lawsuit is the 24th that California has filed against the Trump administration this year.

“Trump’s all-out assault on California continues — and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Mr. Newsom said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a president who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

The measure was approved by Congress, making it more difficult for it to be overturned by a court or through executive order by a Democratic administration in the future.

Mr. Trump’s signing comes as he battles Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, over his deployment of troops to Los Angeles to quell the riots that have erupted there in response to Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s raids targeting migrants.

Mr. Trump has insisted that Los Angeles would have “burned to the ground” without his mobilizing the California National Guard and U.S. Marines, saying Mr. Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass were too “incompetent” to handle the chaos. Mr. Newsom responded by suing the Trump administration, arguing that the president didn’t have the authority to deploy the state National Guard.

Daniel Villasenor, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, said in a statement that Mr. Trump’s rescission of the EV mandates is the latest skirmish between the president and California.

“If it’s a day ending in Y, it’s another day of Trump’s war on California. We’re fighting back,” Mr. Villasenor said.

Under California’s auto mandate, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must have zero emissions. That ramps up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035.

Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards under the 1967 Clean Air Act because of its highly polluted air and large population. However, the EPA must grant the state a waiver for each standard the state adopts.

Abigail Hunter, executive director of SAFE's Center for Critical Minerals Strategy, described the tax credit as the ""only tool currently available to support industry exposed to market manipulation.""","WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill would make it harder for American critical minerals companies to compete with China because it eliminates a tax credit for boosting domestic production of nickel, rare earths and other materials used in advanced electronics and weaponry.

With Trump and Republican lawmakers aiming to cut government support for green energy projects, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a version of his ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" last month that eliminates the so-called 45X credit. The Senate is now debating the bill.

Former President Joe Biden's 2022 climate change law, the Inflation Reduction Act, created the 10% production credit - a reduction in corporate taxes for critical minerals extraction and processing. The tax break also covers solar, battery and wind projects.

The version of the bill that passed the House treats government incentives for wind turbines the same as those for mining projects that many view as crucial for national security. Critical minerals companies now say their projects are collateral damage to the political feud over renewable energy.

The tax credit is already law and part of the current federal budget. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which scores the cost of legislative proposals when asked by Congress, has not studied how much would be saved by removing the credit.

The Republican majority in Congress is seeking savings to fund other priorities such as tax cuts, defense and balancing the budget. This month, the hard-right House Freedom Caucus said it ""will not accept"", attempts to ""water down, strip out, or walk back the hard-fought spending reductions and IRA Green New Scam rollbacks achieved in this legislation.""

Miners, though, say they need the credit to compete with China. Beijing has halted exports of some critical minerals, used its control of rare earths to strike a trade agreement with Washington, and flooded global markets with cheap supply of nickel, cobalt and lithium.

The traditionally conservative mining industry now finds itself in the unusual position of needing Washington's support to grow and, in some cases, survive. The owner of the only U.S. cobalt mine went bankrupt this year after Chinese miners depressed global prices of that metal.

""If we do not have that tax credit, critical minerals producers in the U.S. are at risk of succumbing to closures,"" said KaLeigh Long, founder and CEO of Westwin Elements, which is building the country's only commercial nickel refinery.

Westwin might not be able to service its debt without the tax credit, Long said, noting the company's loans were modeled using the expectation it would be permanent. Last month, Long wrote a letter asking the Senate to keep the credit. It was co-signed by 30 industry executives.

Any changes the Senate makes to the bill must be reconciled with the House version before being sent to Trump. Several House members have admitted they did not read the entire bill before voting for it, including Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green, a Georgia Republican, and Congressman Mike Flood, a Nebraska Republican.

House Democrats unanimously voted against the bill but their criticism has focused on tax cuts they say will widen the deficit while requiring cuts in health care, food assistance, education, scientific research and other programs.

""There's so many issues right now under consideration in Congress and this one isn't breaking through, but it will certainly break through when we have a shortage of minerals in five years,"" said Jeff Green, a critical minerals industry consultant.

Senator John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat who voted for the IRA in 2022, said in a statement to Reuters that cutting the credit would ""kill jobs ... just to fund tax breaks for the ultra-weathy"" and would be a ""bad deal"" for the country.

Trump, who has issued several executive orders aimed at boosting U.S. minerals production, has not commented publicly on the 45x debate. The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

""The tax credit just adds a phenomenal bump to a project's economics and gives us advantages that China already gives its own companies,"" said Alex Grant, CEO of magnesium processing startup Magrathea, who signed the letter. China controls most of the world's production of the metal, used in alloys for steel and aluminum.

Abigail Hunter, executive director of SAFE's Center for Critical Minerals Strategy, described the tax credit as the ""only tool currently available to support industry exposed to market manipulation.""

The House version also removes any remaining IRA funding for the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office (LPO), which under Biden awarded billions of dollars in loans to Nevada lithium projects from ioneer (INR.AX), and Lithium Americas (LAC.TO). Potential for the LPO's closure led miners to rush to finalize loans last year, as Reuters reported in August.

Republican senators this week said they were in discussions about how to extend some green energy tax credits, especially for businesses with large capital investments. No firm commitments have been made.

For Mahesh Konduru, CEO of minerals processing startup Momentum Technologies, the credit is one way for Washington to show industry support.

""We need to have the appropriate tools to build, nurture and grow that supply chain inside the United States,"" he said.

Global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 24% in May compared with the same period a year ago, as strength in China offset slower growth in North America, according to market research firm Rho Motion.

Electric vehicle sales in China surpassed over one million units in a single month for the first time this year, driven by strong domestic demand and targeted export efforts from Chinese manufacturers, notably BYD, tapping into emerging markets.

BYD's exports to Mexico and Southeast Asia, along with Uzbekistan, have significantly boosted sales in these regions, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.

Advt

Fleet incentives in Germany and robust growth in Southern Europe helped lift the European market, while the expiry of Canadian subsidies dragged on North American demand, he added.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Global automakers face a 25% import tariff in the United States, the world's second-largest car market, causing many of them to withdraw their outlooks for 2025.

In Europe, new incentives for fleet buyers in Germany are expected to support electric car sales through the second half of the year.

Tesla's Model Y production in Berlin shields it from tariffs, yet it faces market share pressures as production ramps up globally amidst shifting trade tensions.

President Donald Trump's stance towards emissions standards and uncertainties around tariffs has also hampered EV growth in North America.

In the U.S., tax credits for EVs are still available but will begin phasing out from 2026, contributing to hesitation among buyers.

BY THE NUMBERS

Global sales of battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids rose to 1.6 million units in May, Rho Motion data showed.

Sales in China grew more than 24% from the same month last year to 1.02 million vehicles.

Europe posted a 36.2% increase to 0.33 million units, while North American sales edged up just 7.5% to 0.16 million.

While the Scout vehicles will be 100-percent battery powered, they will incorporate a small gas engine that will function as a generator to charge the battery, known as an “extended-range electric vehicle” (EREV) option.

Detroit-based American Axle is a Tier One automotive supplier that develops and manufactures driveline technologies and systems for electric, hybrid, and internal-combustion engine vehicles. its products include axles, driveshafts, differentials, clutch modules, and disconnecting driveline systems. It also operates an extensive metal-forming business, with forging operations that produce components for engines, transmissions, drivelines, and other parts.

Scout Motors is building a $2-billion manufacturing complex in Blythewood, S.C. The company is backed by Volkswagen Group AG and the vehicles will adopt software and electrical architecture from Rivian Motors, though it is an independent company. The brand and styling are intended to evoke the series of four-wheel-drive vehicles that International Harvester produced from 1961 to 1980. VW acquired Navistar, International Harvester’s successor company, in 2021.

The total installed capacity is enough to power 41.2 million homes. Meanwhile nearly 280,000 jobs have been created by the industry, SEIA said in its “Solar Market Insights Report”.

The added capacity marks a seven percent fall from the same three-month period last year and a 43 percent decline against the prior quarter. Q1 2025, however, is still the fourth-biggest quarter, according to SEIA.

Texas led installations in the quarter at 2.7 GWdc, 92 percent more than second-ranked Florida. Most installations in the two states were utility-scale.

Meanwhile 8.6 GW of module manufacturing capacity were added, increasing the total to 51 GW and making Q1 2025 the third strongest quarter for factory building. Texas, Ohio and Arizona led.

U.S. solar cell production capacity doubled to 2 GW thanks to a new facility in South Carolina.

“Solar and storage continue to dominate America’s energy economy, adding more new capacity to the grid than any technology using increasingly American-made equipment”, said SEIA president and chief executive Abigail Ross Hopper.

However, policy changes, including new tariffs on cells and modules from Southeast Asia, threaten growth, SEIA warned.

“Complex and evolving trade actions will substantially impact solar development over the next five years”, it said. “Recent changes to anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) on cells and modules from Southeast Asia, as well as the introduction of new, non-industry-specific tariffs over the past few months, may lead to supply chain shifts and potential project delays or cancellations, particularly in the utility-scale segment.

“The US solar industry also faces significant challenges due to recent federal actions, including proposed changes to tax credits that would effectively make them unusable for new projects in the near term and a shift in energy priorities towards fossil fuels, creating an uncertain environment for solar growth in the coming years”.

The removal of tax credits could lead to a decline of 173 terawatt-hours in energy production, making the U.S. fall short of meeting demand or lag behind China in the AI race, according to a separate analysis by SEIA.

The analysis warned that the House-passed budget reconciliation bill could reduce energy infrastructure investment by $220 million to $285 million by 2030.

Additionally 330,000 manufacturing jobs would be put at risk. “Provisions targeting residential rooftop solar could cost 62,000 jobs this year and almost 200,000 in 2026”, the analysis said.

Elimination of clean energy tax credits threatens more than $321 billion in announced private investments in energy and manufacturing.
Hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost each year by removing incentives for clean energy investment, the majority in sectors not directly related to clean energy.","In Brief:

Cuts to energy programs in the House ""big beautiful bill"" could slow clean energy innovation and deployment, according to a recent report.

Impacts on state economies could be significant.

Modeling by energy analysts attempts to bring economic consequences into focus. Risks are high in both red and blue states.

Cost cutting was a guiding principle for the “big beautiful bill” that squeaked through the House in May and went to the Senate for review. But modeling by analysts at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation highlights the ways energy provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could prove expensive for states.

As it now stands, the bill would slow energy deployment and manufacturing over the next 10 years, say the analysts in a new report. The bill proposes taking back unobligated clean energy funds from Inflation Reduction Act programs, eliminating tax credits for clean energy development and manufacturing, and imposing new registration fees for owners of electric and hybrid vehicles.

These changes could mean the loss of 330 gigawatts of new electricity generation capacity between now and 2035 — as much energy as would come from 165 new Hoover dams. Wind power would be the most affected (see chart). Red states have been the leaders in making energy from wind, with Texas producing more than twice as much as any other.

This loss of capacity is a problem at a time when artificial intelligence alone is expected to increase data center power demand by as much as 160 percent by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs. Elimination of clean energy tax credits threatens more than $321 billion in announced private investments in energy and manufacturing. The bill expands oil and gas leasing, but new gas power plants aren’t being built at the same rate as solar and wind, says Megan Mahajan, one of the report authors.

“All the major gas turbine manufacturers have delivery backlogs until at least 2029,” she says. “If you’re thinking about being able to meet rising electricity demand with new sources, it’s really important to get wind and solar online.”

Mahajan and her colleagues also modeled the impact of the bill on jobs. Projects announced on the basis of tax credits face uncertainty. Hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost each year by removing incentives for clean energy investment, the majority in sectors not directly related to clean energy.

Job losses would vary by state. “Some states have significant investments planned in clean energy technologies like batteries, which are really hit hard by the loss of manufacturing tax credits,” Mahajan says. Again, red states would be among the most affected, including Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Indiana.

Solar and wind are the cheapest sources of electricity. Greater dependence on fossil fuels for electricity generation and the higher fossil fuel prices resulting from increased demand would cause household energy costs to increase, Mahajan says. Almost all the states among the 20 where families would see the greatest increases in their energy bills are Republican-led.

In combination, factors including rising household costs, cancellation of announced investments and projects, and job losses could have significant consequences for the country’s GDP. Energy Innovation’s modeling is based on an open source policy simulator that takes a wide range of consequences from the present One Big Beautiful Bill Act into account, including termination of a clean vehicle tax credit and rising costs of fueling vehicles with internal combustion engines.

“If you look cumulatively at the impacts on a national level it will cut national GDP by over a trillion dollars,” Mahajan says. The cumulative GDP loss over the next 10 years will amount to tens of billions in many states (see map).

Republicans have long been opposed to former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. No Republican in the House or Senate voted for it. Estimates of its fiscal costs range from $800 million to more than $1 trillion over a decade, a ripe target in a policy climate focused on cutting expenditures. President Donald Trump's budget proposal aims to eliminate funding for a ""Green New Scam,"" referencing ""unreliable renewable energy"" and other costly technologies that ""burden ratepayers and consumers.""

Energy Innovation's modeling likely understates potential impacts, Mahajan says, using conservative estimates for the demand in electricity growth. It doesn’t encompass the full costs of climate impacts, including health effects, investments never made or ceding leadership in clean energy innovation and export to China. China’s exports of advanced energy technology to developing countries, for example, are already 10 times greater than those from the U.S. and grew by more than 100 percent between 2018 and 2023.

“In a world where we see competitors like China going all in on clean energy, we don’t want to lose the momentum we’ve seen on this front,” Mahajan says.

The moderated discussion, which brought together a variety of energy manufacturers, state and local officials, and development organizations, focused on how federal energy tax credits will strengthen Indiana’s all-of-the-above energy dominance and keep America competitive.

Indiana Chamber President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders welcomed the group and highlighted the current landscape in Indiana. “Investments in advanced manufacturing and energy are being made in every corner of our state and are serving to revitalize Indiana. Our strong manufacturing base and highly trained workforce also means that the state is especially poised to take advantage of new investments in the clean economy,” said Sinders.

“Indiana has seen at least $17.3 billion dollars committed to clean manufacturing, which has created 12,715 jobs for Hoosiers. The Indiana Chamber is eager to see and support the continued growth of these industries that are foundational to our economic growth and national competitiveness and security,” she concluded.

Common themes expressed by attendees included the need for long-term, strategic investments in the energy sector to meet escalating demand on the grid and keep the United States competitive with global actors such as China. Drastic and abrupt changes to the federal tax code now would have negative effects on developers of new energy systems as well as advanced manufacturers and those in the automotive, microelectronic and agricultural sectors.

Indiana is the most manufacturing-intensive state in the U.S, with advanced manufacturing accounting for nearly 30% of the state’s GDP. More than 50% of employment in the state has some connection to manufacturing. Congress is currently considering a tax bill that would significantly restrict access to energy tax credits meant to incentivize the buildout of utility-scale battery, auto and solar projects.

Greg Goode thanked all participants on behalf of Sen. Young and acknowledged the need of businesses to plan with certainty and the importance of an “all of the above” strategy to meet both Indiana’s and the country’s strategic energy needs. He pledged to share what he heard with Sen.

Watch Trump’s remarks in the player above.

The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California’s attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump’s signing ceremony ended at the White House.

The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

WATCH: Why the red state of Utah is going green and embracing electric vehicles

Trump called California’s regulations “crazy” at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.

“It’s been a disaster for this country,” he said.

It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state’s Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.

“The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. “They come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.”

The three resolutions Trump signed will block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.

“I like Tesla,” Trump said.

In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed “are killing our country,” the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he’d risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.

“I’ll take electrocution every single day,” the president said.

When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, “If you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.”

“What this does is it gives us freedom,” said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install “infrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn’t give you any return.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump’s action.

“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Newsom said Trump’s action was a continuation of his “all-out assault” on California.

“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Newsom said in a statement. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

Newsom later Thursday doubled down on his state’s assertion of its right to set environmental regulations. He signed an executive order requiring state air regulators to propose new rules further limiting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks if a court ultimately upholds California’s rules that Trump sought to kill.

Trump’s signing of the resolutions comes as he has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

Company last requested a regulatory review of rates in 2022

GREENVILLE, S.C., June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy Progress today asked South Carolina regulators to perform a public review of the company's current rates.

This is the company's first request to review rates since 2022. It comes as the company continues working to increase system diversity and reliability, enhance the customer experience and meet future energy demands.

Duke Energy Progress serves about 177,000 customers primarily in central and northeastern South Carolina.

By the numbers: The company's application in front of the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) requests an overall revenue increase of $74.8 million, which represents a 12.1% increase over current revenues.

If approved, monthly electric bills for typical residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase $21.66 a month – from $144.85 per month to $166.51 – effective Feb. 1, 2026. Commercial customers will see an average increase of 12.8% and industrial customers will see an average increase of around 3.6%. The amount of increase per customer class can vary based upon how much more additional revenue is needed to ensure that the class is covering the cost to serve them.

Why it matters: Duke Energy is committed to meeting customers' increasingly higher expectations around reliability, responsiveness, affordability and value.

This proposal reflects the investments we have made to strengthen the grid, improve storm readiness, maintain and enhance our generating fleet and serve a growing customer base.

It also reflects how the company is doing that work: with discipline, with a focus on operational excellence, and with a thoughtful approach to how and when we seek rate adjustments.

Investments in action: The company's grid investments have positioned it well for storm response.

For example, as Hurricane Helene made its way across the Carolinas, grid improvements were already helping to combat power outages from the storm.

Smart, self-healing technology installed across the Duke Energy Progress service territory helped to automatically restore more than 10,000 customer outages and saved more than 28,000 hours of total outage time, showing the value of the self-healing programs.

Our view:

""We know families and businesses are juggling a lot and we do not take a request to increase rates lightly but being upfront and timely with our request is the right thing to do and in the best interest of our customers."" – Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president

Kimmeridge cements plan to build integrated natural-gas company

Wall Street Journal/Luis Garcia

Kimmeridge Energy Management, backed by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Energy, is advancing its plan to create an integrated U.S. natural gas company, combining upstream production with LNG exports. The strategy involves Kimmeridge Texas Gas (KTG), which produces over 500 MMcfe/d in the Eagle Ford Shale, and Commonwealth LNG, a 9.3 MTPA LNG export facility in Louisiana targeting a final investment decision in Q3 2025 and first production in 2029. Unlike export-focused nations like Qatar, U.S. gas producers have historically avoided integration due to a robust domestic market, but Kimmeridge aims to capitalize on global LNG demand, projected to grow significantly by 2050. Mubadala’s 24.1% stake in SoTex HoldCo, KTG’s parent, marks its U.S. entry, while deals with Glencore for 2 MTPA LNG offtake strengthen the project’s commercial viability. Kimmeridge’s “wellhead-to-water” model emphasizes low-cost, environmentally responsible energy delivery. [MDN: An interesting concept to build a company that does everything from extracting the gas to flowing it to processing it and turning it into LNG and then shipping it. That’s what Kimmeridge is trying to do. Too bad they’re using money from the United Arab Emirates to do it.]

EPA to save more than $1B per year after scrapping Biden-era emissions standards

New York (NY) Post/Josh Christenson

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under Administrator Lee Zeldin, is proposing to repeal Biden administration greenhouse gas regulations targeting coal and natural gas power plants, which were projected to cost the energy industry $1.3 billion annually and increase energy costs by nearly $20 billion over two decades. The move aims to provide cheaper electricity, boost U.S. energy independence, and meet rising demand from manufacturers and AI companies, while reducing reliance on imports. Zeldin criticized the regulations as an attempt to eliminate coal, oil, and gas industries, noting that U.S. coal and gas plants contribute only a fraction of global emissions. The repealed standards included a carbon-capture mandate for coal plants by 2039 and gas plants by 2032, and 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards amendments, which offered minimal emission reductions. The repeal is expected to save the EPA $1.2 billion over a decade, with a 45-day public comment period before finalization. [MDN: A great move by Lee Zeldin. Make electricity cheaper and save the EPA’s own budget in the process. What a breath of fresh air is blowing through the EPA!]

Oil surges as USA orders partial evacuation of Iraqi embassy

Bloomberg/Mia Gindis

Oil prices surged, with West Texas Intermediate futures rising 4.9% to settle above $68 a barrel, driven by heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The U.S. ordered a partial evacuation of its embassy in Iraq and allowed military families to leave due to escalating security risks, while the UK Navy warned of potential shipping disruptions. Iran’s threats to target U.S. military bases further fueled fears of supply disruptions, amplified by the possibility of Israeli military action if negotiations with Iran fail. Despite earlier concerns about a U.S.-China trade war and increased OPEC+ supplies weighing on demand, recent easing of trade tensions and optimism for summer demand supported the price recovery. The U.S. Energy Information Administration highlighted market uncertainties, forecasting a supply surplus but noting limited U.S. crude production growth.

And so, quite naturally, businesses are pulling back,"" Keefe said, noting the biggest states for clean energy projects are red states.
Group of House Republicans also wants changes Senators aren't only hearing from industry leaders, they're also hearing from Republicans in the House.","As Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee prepare to release their portion of the GOP legislative package working its way through Congress, energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration remain a major part of their debate.

At issue are clean energy credits that were enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, known as the IRA, and largely eliminated in the version of the bill that the House passed.

The bill would halt roughly $522 billion in investments approved in the IRA from being spent in communities across the country.

The House bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles, and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment, among other changes.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say they are fielding calls from advocates and energy industry leaders concerned that without significant changes from the Senate, Americans will face higher energy bills and less jobs.

And the credits are already becoming fodder for political attacks. Groups like Protect Our Jobs, a political action committee spending money advocating for clean energy jobs, is funneling money into ads targeting House Republicans who supported the reconciliation bill.

""I'm a Republican, but now I'm seeing Republicans in Washington try to eliminate jobs like mine,"" says an electrician working in solar energy in one ad.

""How [tax credits] go is important"" says GOP senator looking at House bill

A handful of GOP senators are advocating against a slash and burn approach on the energy credits.

GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas cautioned against a ""full-scale repeal of current credits"" in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

""Many American companies have made substantial investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure based on the current energy tax framework,"" they wrote in the letter. ""A wholesale repeal, or termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.""

In an interview with NPR, Sen. Curtis said he is having good conversations with other Senate Republicans who are ""very receptive"" to his concerns about the House bill.

""I think it's really important that Senate Republicans — and I wish House Republicans — look at this not from the standpoint of 'it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad', but rather what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy and make good, thoughtful decisions,"" Curtis said.

He stressed the need to consider how to support business owners who had been making plans under the IRA.

""One of the worst things that we do to businesses is inconsistency and unpredictability. And therefore, I argue for a kind of appropriate off ramp,"" he said. ""If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees of those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.""

Outside analysts say businesses are already feeling the impact. E2, a nonpartisan, pro-environment business group, has been tracking clean energy project announcements and jobs for over two years. The group's executive director, Bob Keefe, told NPR the market began responding before the House legislation was even written.

""Since January alone, we've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects — clean energy, electric vehicle related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects — $14 billion worth of business investment canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill,"" he said.

E2 estimates more than 10,000 announced jobs have been canceled because of concerns over the House bill.

""The House just pulled the rug out from all of those businesses who had been already investing and planning for this by saying that these tax credits were going to get repealed. And so, quite naturally, businesses are pulling back,"" Keefe said, noting the biggest states for clean energy projects are red states. ""If the Senate doesn't fix it, our economy is going to suffer.""

Group of House Republicans also wants changes

Senators aren't only hearing from industry leaders, they're also hearing from Republicans in the House.

""We had some good conversations with a handful of senators and have been having ongoing conversations,"" said Rep. Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa., who wants to see the Senate make adjustments to the House bill he voted for.

""The energy credits are very big for northeastern Pennsylvania,"" he told NPR. ""I'm OK with the phase out, but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from essentially underneath them.""

Bresnahan is one of 13 Republican House members who sent a letter last week to Senate leadership, urging the chamber to ""substantially and strategically improve our clean energy tax credit provisions"" from the House-passed bill.

The group lists concerns about restrictions of transferability of some credits, the 60-day time limit for enacting projects and other issues.

""This approach jeopardizes ongoing development, discourages long-term investment, and could significantly delay or cancel energy infrastructure projects across the country,"" the letter reads. ""Without a clear signal from Congress encouraging continued investments and offering business certainty as these provisions are phased out, project cancellations will continue to snowball.""

Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

""What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator to those who support innovation or are concerned about not jacking up prices and understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is a kind of Republican idea,"" Wyden told NPR.

But changes passed in the Senate would require approval in the House, and any major adjustments could jeopardize the delicate balance of support that allowed GOP leaders to force the bill through last month. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has repeatedly warned senators to tread lightly when it comes to changes in the bill.

Members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus have specifically called out clean energy incentives as a red line for their members.

""We want to be crystal clear: if the Senate attempts to water down, strip out, or walk back the hard-fought spending reductions and IRA Green New Scam rollbacks achieved in this legislation, we will not accept it,"" the group said in a statement.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/5963a7b6d0f8f08ab95c358afc2fb10c?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-06-13 08:00:29.329044

Clean energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration are under debate in the Senate. House Republicans voted to gut these programs, but not all of their fellow Republicans in the Senate are on board. NPR's Barbara Sprunt has more.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: President Trump has long talked about his frustrations with clean energy provisions signed into law by President Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act. Here he is at an April rally in Michigan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round.

(BOOING)

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

Electric vehicle (EV) sales in China surpassed one million units in a single month for the first time in 2025, driven by strong domestic demand and targeted export efforts from Chinese manufacturers, notably BYD, tapping into emerging markets.

BYD’s exports to Mexico and South-east Asia, along with Uzbekistan, have significantly boosted sales in these regions, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.

Global sales of battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids rose to 1.6 million units in May, Rho Motion data showed.

Sales in China grew more than 24 per cent from the same month in 2024 to 1.02 million vehicles.

Europe posted a 36.2 per cent increase to 0.33 million units, while North American sales edged up just 7.5 per cent to 0.16 million.

Sales in the rest of the world rose 38 per cent to 0.15 million vehicles.

“The story this month with global vehicle sales is the continued chasm between Chinese market growth versus the faltering market in North America,” Mr Lester said.

Global automakers face a 25 per cent import tariff in the United States, the world’s second-largest car market, causing many of them to withdraw their outlooks for 2025.

US President Donald Trump’s stance towards emissions standards and uncertainties around tariffs has also hampered EV growth in North America.

In the US, tax credits for EVs are still available but will begin phasing out from 2026, contributing to hesitation among buyers.

Fleet incentives in Germany and robust growth in Southern Europe helped lift the European market, while the expiry of Canadian subsidies dragged on North American demand.

In Europe, new incentives for fleet buyers in Germany are expected to support electric car sales through the second half of the year.

The website will stop publishing new content on July 1.

The site, climate.gov, is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). As of 2021, it received nearly one million visitors every month, and was one of the most trusted sources of climate-related information in the U.S., according to public surveys about the site.

A staff of 10 people wrote content and created maps, charts and explanatory graphics for climate.gov. Those employees have now been terminated, according to Rebecca Lindsey, the former program manager for the website. NOAA did not respond to questions from NPR about changes to the site.

Lindsey had worked on climate.gov for 13 years, and had recently changed roles before she was laid off in February as part of a government-wide purge of what the government calls probationary employees, generally people who were new to their specific jobs.

Two other probationary climate.gov employees were also let go at that time, and the remaining seven staff were let go in recent weeks, according to an official who is familiar with the website's operations, and who requested anonymity because they fear they will be fired for speaking about efforts to hobble the website.

All of those laid off were experienced science communication and data visualization experts who cannot be easily replaced with other NOAA employees, according to the official.

Until recently, the website published multiple items each week that were tailored to what was happening in the U.S. For example, in the last month, the site published up-to-date information about tornado season and wildfire smoke. The site also publishes original maps, charts and other data to explain drought trends, changes to rain and snowfall and seasonal climate outlooks for the U.S., to help people across the country plan for heat waves, floods and other extreme weather.

Lindsey says it's clear to her that the administration is trying to get rid of public conversation about climate change and its profound impacts on people in the U.S. ""They think that climate change isn't real, and they don't want anybody talking about it,"" she says.

The White House did not respond to questions about why the climate.gov website has been hobbled, or what might happen to the site in the future. The site has not been fully shuttered — all the content that has been published in the past is still available as of now, although much of it will rapidly become obsolete if it is not updated.

The Trump administration has gutted other climate-related programs across the federal government. Earlier this year, all of the staff in charge of the National Climate Assessment were laid off. Like climate.gov, the assessment is designed to provide accurate, useful climate information to the public and to local officials who rely on it to make decisions about roads, housing and infrastructure for electricity, drinking water and sewers.

Infrastructure to support offshore drilling brings onshore pollution, industrialization of coastal areas, and heightened risk of oil spills.","In today’s blog, we are pleased to share a recent op-ed published in the Coastal Review

It’s a story Carolinians already know: The Trump administration is once again pushing to expand offshore drilling along America’s coasts. It claims to have a mandate, insisting that “America spoke” in last November’s election and that those results endorse the administration’s energy agenda and “national energy emergency” claims. When America last had a real chance to weigh in on offshore drilling during the first Trump term, it spoke loudly and clearly in opposition. Nowhere was this more evident than in the Carolinas, where communities, local leaders and even Republican lawmakers stood up and firmly said, “No.”

In 2018, the first Trump administration proposed opening up vast stretches of the Atlantic Coast to offshore drilling, including waters off North and South Carolina. That plan ran headfirst into a wall of resistance built by residents from coastal towns and inland cities who came together to protect their way of life. Environmental groups, fishermen, small business owners and tourism industry leaders formed unlikely alliances to stop the drilling. More than a hundred coastal communities passed formal resolutions against Atlantic oil drilling. Those unlikely alliances bloomed into rallies, marches and protests for months on end. Their message was simple: Environmentally and economically, the risks were too high.

That opposition was echoed by elected officials, regardless of their side of the aisle. Republican governors and lawmakers broke ranks with the administration to defend their states’ coastlines. Former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and South Carolina’s Henry McMaster both called for their states to be excluded from the drilling plan. Coastal communities passed resolutions opposing drilling off their shores. It was a rare display of bipartisan unity, driven by the urgent need to protect local economies, natural heritage and public safety.

The high stakes haven’t changed. The Atlantic Ocean is home to fragile marine ecosystems including species like endangered North Atlantic right whales, sea turtles and countless fish species. Those species and ecosystems are under constant pressure from overfishing, climate change, as well as plastic, chemical and noise pollution. Habitat destruction from coastal development, bottom trawling and dredging further disrupts vital ecosystems. The oil industry could very well be the tipping point for our Atlantic species.

The damage doesn’t stop at the drill site. Seismic testing — the method used to locate oil beneath the ocean floor — blasts powerful sound waves through the water, disorienting and sometimes killing marine animals. Infrastructure to support offshore drilling brings onshore pollution, industrialization of coastal areas, and heightened risk of oil spills. And the closer the drilling moves to shore, the greater the danger to beaches, estuaries, as well as the tourism and fishing industries that rely on clean water and healthy ecosystems. Additionally, due to the proximity of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic, spilled oil could rapidly travel thousands of miles, creating widespread ecological damage that would be incredibly difficult to mitigate. That’s thousands of miles of chances for oil to get on and inside the bodies of wildlife, leading to everything from hypothermia to ulcers and a gruesome death.",https://defendersofwildlife-360365372.imgix.net/sites/default/files/2025-06/Blog%20Headers%20%2838%29.png?fit=max&ixlib=php-4.1.0&w=2000,N,,2025-06-13 06:03:23.862255

A group of 13 House Republicans sent a letter to their Senate counterparts Friday asking the Senate to make further alterations to changes made to the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, as the chamber takes up its portion of the budget reconciliation process.

The Republicans were led by Virginia Rep. Jen Kiggans, who said in a June 6 press release that though she supported the House-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” as it stands, “there remains significant room for improvement in preserving the clean energy tax credits.”

The requested changes largely mirror those requested by Kiggans and her colleagues prior to the House’s passage of the bill. The group’s letter cites more than $14 billion in clean energy projects that have been canceled this year, with signatories stating that “project cancellations will continue to snowball” if Congress does not provide “business certainty as these provisions are phased out.”

Dive Insight:

Kiggans and a nearly identical group of House Republicans wrote to their House colleagues last month seeking positive changes to the clean energy tax credit phaseout plan that came out of committee work on the reconciliation bill. Instead, the House-passed version of the bill imposes a faster phaseout timeline, including a repeal of tax credits for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

The Republican lawmakers in support of IRA’s clean energy credits asked that the Senate alter that provision — along with a foreign entity of concern provision that was again called “overly prescriptive” — and maintain tax credit transferability throughout the credits’ lifetime. The group said that though they were “proud to have worked to ensure that the bill did not include a full repeal of the clean energy tax credits,” they remain “deeply concerned about those provisions.”

The tax credit phaseout schedule included in the House-passed bill, “would cause significant disruption to projects under development and stop investments needed to win the global energy race,” the letter said. The lawmakers said the overall approach to the tax credit changes “jeopardizes ongoing development, discourages long-term investment, and could significantly delay or cancel energy infrastructure projects across the country.”

The group recommended the 60-day timeline and the bill’s “placed in service” standard should be replaced with a “commence construction” requirement. The group said that due to permitting delays and other issues outside of project developers’ control, it is hard for the businesses to be sure when their projects will be “placed in service.” Swapping that language with a “commence construction” provision would give companies more flexibility to understand if they are eligible for certain credits and give “the investment clarity and lead time required for energy projects to succeed,” according to the Republican lawmakers.

“Our position has always been that the energy tax code should be modernized in a way that promotes fiscal responsibility and business certainty,” the letter said. “Fully realizing that balance requires improvements to the House-passed version of … the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Kiggins was joined on the letter by Reps. Andrew Garbarino, Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota of New York; Mark Amodei of Nevada; Don Bacon of Nebraska; Brian Fitzpatrick and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania; Juan Ciscomani of Arizona; Gabe Evans of Colorado; Young Kim and David Valadao of California; and Thomas Kean Jr. of New Jersey.

Restarting a retired nuclear reactor is a major undertaking that requires extensive engagement with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state and federal utility regulators.

Meta’s 20-year nuclear power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy could mark the start of a trend as profitable technology companies seek clean, firm electricity to power their AI ambitions, experts say. On Wednesday, Amazon Web Services and Talen Energy followed Meta’s June 3 announcement with news of a similar deal of their own.

Investment bank Jefferies estimated the Meta-Constellation deal’s value around $70/MWh, or a roughly $20/MWh premium to Illinois’ energy-plus-capacity market compensation from 2028 and as much as $15/MWh higher than regional wind power purchase agreements. Constellation did not disclose the price.

Nuclear plants in Illinois and other states with “pay to stay” subsidies are ripe for similar deals in the near future, energy consultancy ClearView Energy partners said Monday. Constellation’s 1,870-MW Quad Cities Clean Energy Center is one to watch as its reactors come up for relicensing in 2029 and 2031, ClearView said.

Dive Insight:

Meta will purchase the clean energy attributes of Constellation’s 1,092-MW Clinton Clean Energy Center in central Illinois beginning in June 2027, as its home state’s 10-year, ratepayer-funded Zero Emissions Credit program winds down. The ZEC program saved Clinton from premature closure in 2017 “after years of financial losses,” Constellation said on June 3.

The virtual power purchase agreement will support a 30-MW power uprate and a 20-year operating license extension, which will allow the plant to operate until at least 2047. Meta’s power purchases will support its “clean energy goals and operations in the region,” rather than power data centers directly, Constellation said.

Constellation called the deal “a market-based solution” that will replace the ZEC subsidy and ensure long-term plant operation without ratepayer support.

“[Meta] figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy,” Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez said in a statement last week.

Electric market experts quibbled with the notion that Clinton owes its continued operation to Meta, given strong demand for electrons of any variety and for clean, firm power in particular.

“‘Saved’ might have been a strong word,” said Charles Hua, founder and executive director of utility advocacy nonprofit PowerLines.

“My feeling, given [that Clinton] is a merchant power plant, is that a deal would have been struck with someone, somewhere,” added Tremaine Phillips, president of Third Coast Strategies and former member of the Michigan Public Service Commission. Phillips and Hua spoke to Utility Dive in a joint interview last week.

The virtual PPA structure and the parties framing it as a save suggest Meta and Constellation want to avoid the popular and regulatory backlash that could follow a colocation agreement, ClearView said.

Federal regulators and state officials have pushed back on agreements like Talen Energy and AWS’ previous proposal to colocate as much as 960 MW of data center capacity at Talen’s 2,228-MW stake in the Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Under that arrangement, Talen would have redirected significant amounts of the plant’s output to AWS operations nearby.

On Wednesday, Talen and AWS instead announced a front-of-the-meter agreement that would see AWS purchase up to 1,920 MW of Susquehanna’s output for at least 16 years to serve present and future data centers in the PJM Interconnection. The deal would take effect next spring and replace the companies’ colocation proposal, they said.

In part because Meta’s VPPA does not involve any redirection of power supply, it will not require state or federal regulatory approvals, Constellation spokesperson Paul Adams said in an email. The Talen-AWS deal would require the local utility, PPL, to upgrade its transmission network but doesn’t require Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval, Talen said.

Regulators’ limited role in the Meta and possibly AWS deals contrasts with the much more involved process for Constellation’s first announced nuclear VPPA, its 20-year agreement with Microsoft for the entire output of the undamaged, prematurely retired 835-MW reactor at the power plant formerly known as Three Mile Island. Restarting a retired nuclear reactor is a major undertaking that requires extensive engagement with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state and federal utility regulators.

Last year, Morgan Stanley analysts estimated the value of the Microsoft VPPA at $98/MWh. Jefferies said at the time that the value could be as high as $115/MWh. Either way, the Meta VPPA’s value is likely significantly lower, between $70/MWh and the $80/MWh to $88/MWh range Constellation gave last quarter for future front-of-the-meter offtake agreements, Jefferies said.

That discount is likely due not only to the lighter engineering and regulatory workload involved in the 30-MW power uprate, but also because Meta is not physically taking power from Clinton, Jefferies and ClearView said.

Constellation will first modify the plant’s high-pressure steam turbine to increase efficiency and generator capacity, then it will improve reactor power measurement to allow the plant to operate closer to full capacity, Adams said. Constellation aims to finish the generator uprate in 2027 and the measurement uncertainty recapture project in 2029, he said, boosting total plant output to 1,121 MW.

Constellation previously announced a slate of power uprate projects through the end of the decade that could add as much as 1 GW of incremental capacity without building a new reactor, Adams said.

The planned uprates include 158 MW of additional capacity between its Byron and Braidwood plants in Illinois, which ClearView flagged as potential PPA candidates. The roughly 1,110-MW reactor at DTE Energy’s Enrico Fermi plant in Michigan could also attract offtake interest, Phillips said.

DTE Energy is considering a 150-MW power uprate at Fermi; a company executive indicated earlier this year that DTE would be open to state support for a long-deferred second reactor there.

But industry chatter suggests fellow independent power producer Vistra could be the next to announce a bilateral offtake agreement, possibly for output from the 2,425-MW Comanche Peak plant in Texas as soon as this month, Jefferies said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/TPehPRs8AWvOZJWpiR6PZZfFa7-leXXYlInZNZu3Lb4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DbGludG9uX0NsZWFuX0VuZXJneV9DZW50ZXJfY291cnRlc3R5X0NvbnN0ZWxsYXRpb24uanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-13 06:01:11.179319

In part, opponents of the EPA’s GHG rule argued that it relied on carbon capture and sequestration technology that isn’t commercially available.
Power plants account for about a quarter of U.S. carbon emissions, making them the second largest source of GHG emissions behind the transportation sector, according to the EPA.
Under the Biden administration, the EPA estimated the carbon limits would produce up to $370 billion in climate and public health benefits.","The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed eliminating greenhouse gas emissions limits for power plants as well as repealing a toughening of the mercury and air toxics standard for coal- and oil-fired generators.

“These Biden-era regulations have imposed massive costs on coal-, oil-, and gas-fired power plants, raising the cost of living for American families, imperiling the reliability of our electric grid, and limiting American energy prosperity,” the EPA said in a press release.

The EPA estimates that its proposal to repeal Obama and Biden era GHG rules would save the power sector $19 billion over 20 years and reverting to the 2012 MATS rule would save $1.2 billion over a decade.

Cooperative utilities, independent power producers, the National Mining Association and others praised the EPA’s decision.

“Besides being illegal, this Biden-era [GHG] rule would have shut down the nation’s fleet of coal power plants despite warnings from experts and officials that more than half of the U.S. is at risk of electricity shortages,” said Michelle Bloodworth, CEO of America’s Power, a trade group for coal-fired power plant owners.

In part, opponents of the EPA’s GHG rule argued that it relied on carbon capture and sequestration technology that isn’t commercially available.

“EEI appreciates EPA’s acknowledgement that carbon capture and storage technologies are not yet viable for widespread deployment,” said Alex Bond, executive director of legal and clean energy policy at the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned utilities. “Electric companies need standards for natural gas facilities that are attainable to plan and permit new facilities, along with flexible regulatory approaches that help maintain dispatchable generation.”

EEI continues to support the EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, according to Bond.

Power plants account for about a quarter of U.S. carbon emissions, making them the second largest source of GHG emissions behind the transportation sector, according to the EPA. If the U.S. power sector were a country, it would have been the sixth largest source of emissions worldwide in 2022, according to a paper released on May 30 by the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law.

However, in its proposed rule, the EPA said carbon emissions from power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the Clean Air Act, partly because “this Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

The Institute for Policy Integrity contends that EPA’s proposal relies on “haphazard analysis.” In its cost-benefit analysis for the draft rule, EPA reverses long-running agency practice by not valuing the carbon emissions the rule will cause, the organization said.

Under the Biden administration, the EPA estimated the carbon limits would produce up to $370 billion in climate and public health benefits.

“Greenhouse gas emissions cause extensive economic harm, and their proper valuation is certainly not zero as this proposal essentially suggests,” said Richard Revesz, faculty director at the institute and a professor at New York University School of Law. “Courts have previously rejected agency analyses that undervalue or fail to value the significant and well-established damages from greenhouse gases.”

On the proposed MATS rule, coal-fired power plants are the largest domestic source of many toxic metals, including mercury, according to Earthjustice, which noted that most power plants have installed the technology to meet the standards.

“The critical protections that EPA now seeks to undo exist because science and the law demand that EPA act,” Jill Tauber, Earthjustice vice president of climate and energy, said in a statement.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/tGm4N-8CZhXDEIH3353UdyJtg0gSpEnCNkgB7ki73B8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTgwMDcyODgxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-13 06:02:24.547301

PRINCETON, Ind. (June 12, 2025) – Hailing from the heartland of the U.S., Toyota Indiana celebrates a significant milestone as the 1-millionth hybrid vehicle rolled off the line at the Princeton plant. With the flash of its lights, and honk of its horn, a cool Wind Chill Pearl 2025 Toyota Sienna Platinum rolled off the line.

Sienna has been assembled at Toyota Indiana since 2003, with the all-hybrid model being the latest iteration of the family-favorite built by the plant’s 7,650 team members. With up to an EPA-estimated 36 combined mpg rating, the Sienna is ready to take families and friends alike on adventures with ease – with less stops along the way.

Crafted for comfort and modern style, Sienna’s refreshed interior makes every errand and road trip a drive to enjoy. It is no surprise the Toyota Sienna was recently honored in the 2025 J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study – earning the top spot in the minivan segment.

“It’s a significant achievement to reach this milestone and something our team members should be proud of,” said Jason Puckett, president of Toyota Indiana. “The all-hybrid Sienna demonstrates our commitment to electrification and remains a top-selling vehicle in Toyota’s lineup.”

Sienna is part of Toyota’s robust lineup of electrified powertrain options. In May, Sienna sales were up more than 95 percent year-over-year while sales of electrified vehicles accounted for nearly half of Toyota’s sales volume for the month. This diverse portfolio of electrified vehicles will help propel Toyota toward its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.

Toyota Indiana represents an $8 billion total investment and has donated more than $54 million to local organizations since breaking ground in 1996.

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.","WASHINGTON — Small business owners and community leaders from rural regions in Western states including Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah pressed lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week to preserve clean energy tax credits on the chopping block in the Republicans’ “one big beautiful” mega-bill, now in the Senate.

The suite of investment, production and residential tax credits enacted and expanded under the Democrats’ own big budget reconciliation bill in 2022, titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change.

The credits have spurred hundreds of billions in investment dollars in advanced manufacturing and production since 2022, and contributed to job creation, largely in states that elected President Donald Trump to a second term.

Small business operators and community leaders from rural and mountainous areas of the United States that have benefited from the boom in alternative energy sources say the campaign to end the tax credits will also cause job losses and cut options for consumers.

Solar projects in Alaska

Chase Christie, director of development for Alaska Solar LLC, said his company installs four to five large-scale solar projects per year in remote Alaskan villages and also fits and services smaller residential solar installations.

“They take a lot of planning, a lot of logistics,” Christie told States Newsroom in an interview Wednesday.

“For going into a remote village where there's tundra, we might need to go there in the dead of winter so we can work on frozen ground,” he added. “Other places we won't go until summer. So we have these large gaps in between these larger projects, and a company like ours absolutely relies on the residential installations to keep our workforce going.”

Christie, who met Tuesday with staffers for Alaska’s Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said in January he let a handful of workers go and paused most new hiring.

“Our workforce is roughly half of what it usually is just because we're not sure which direction things are going to go,” he said.

Christie was among a dozen small energy business owners, municipal government officials and nonprofit employees focused on energy options for low-income households who States Newsroom spoke to Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement: “Senator Sullivan supports energy projects that lower costs for Alaska. The Senator and his team have been meeting with a number of Alaskans about energy tax credits. As we wait for text from the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator is working with his colleagues to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between promoting stable and predictable tax policy, advancing projects that benefit Alaska, and addressing the need to reduce the federal deficit.”

Murkowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elimination of tax credits

Senators are hashing out language for the massive Republican agenda bill that will extend and expand the 2017 tax law, costing roughly $3.8 trillion, and cut spending in other areas to offset the price tag.

A contingent of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam,” won on accelerating the expiration of the energy tax credits and tightening restrictions on eligibility as a way to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts that Trump campaigned on.

The language in a section of the House bill, passed 215-214 on May 22, titled “Working Families Over Elites,” terminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, worth up to $3,200 for homeowners who make energy upgrades to their property.

Among the slate of other affected IRA tax credits, the House bill also speeds up the expiration of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a credit dating back decades that was updated in 2022.

The credit is available to taxpayers who invest in “energy property,” including solar installations to provide electricity and heat, fuel cells, small wind turbines, geothermal pumps, and other electricity-producing technologies.

House Republicans wrote provisions to eliminate the credit for facilities placed into service after 2028 and end eligibility for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

The credit is worth up to 30% of the cost of the project, plus two bonus credits up to 10% each if the project includes mostly domestically produced material and if it’s located in an “energy community,” meaning a place where a coal plant has closed or where unemployment reaches a certain threshold.

The bill also repeals a taxpayer’s ability to transfer the tax credits as a way to finance a project, and introduces restrictions on foreign-made components that industry professionals say essentially makes the credit unworkable.

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, as of June 4, the elimination of the clean energy investment and production tax credits will save roughly $249 billion over the next decade.

Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a right-of-center think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Thursday in a new analysis that “The final House bill makes impressive cuts to the IRA green energy tax credits, but it does so in part by introducing more complexity.”

The group is advocating for senators to reduce the tax credit rates and make clearer complicated language, like the provision around “foreign entities of concern.”

Keeping on the heat during a Montana winter

But Logan Smith, weatherization program manager for the Human Resource Development Council in central Montana, argues the credits have been a lifeline for lower-income rural residents.

“If I can get solar panels on each of the clients’ homes, that means that their power is going to stay on in the middle of winter,” Smith said. “Because every winter we plan for losing power for about a week, that's just something we grew up with. … But if we have solar panels, the power stays on, the heat stays on.”

Ralph Waters, owner of SBS Solar in Missoula, Montana, became emotional when talking about how an early termination of the tax credits could slow his business and result in having to lay off half his workforce.

He criticized the politicization of the tax incentives.

“Montana is deeply red, but it's also a very practical place. And so green energy renewables becomes a taboo phrase somehow,” Waters said. “The practical energy needs are undeniable, and so if we can get past our disagreements about the phraseology and realize that it's electrons, watts, and amps. And it’s cheaper.”

President Donald Trump and Republicans in the House and Senate on Thursday finally ended California’s outsized authority to dictate national emissions standards for new cars, trucks, RVs and engines.

This win is another step toward rebuilding American manufacturing strength.

The EPA, under President Joe Biden, granted California exemption waivers to the Clean Air Act, handing California the keys to set their own extreme emissions regulations – including the requirement that nearly all vehicles sold in the state must be electric by 2035.

Knowing that the people’s representatives in Congress would reject their most extreme policies, the Biden administration had to rely on these workarounds to push their Green New Scam agenda.

CALIFORNIA'S GREEN NEW SCAM COULD COST YOU $20,000

Biden’s Clean Air Act waiver allowed other states to follow California’s lead, creating a patchwork of misguided rules. More than a dozen states and D.C. follow California’s standards, drastically changing the dynamics of America’s critical auto and RV manufacturing industry without Congress having a say.

In practice, this means California effectively set the standards for the automotive industry, and most Americans have been forced to live under a regulatory framework that none of our representatives ever voted on.

This ends now. Rep. Yakym, R-Ind., along with House Republicans, took action to end this power grab, passing three disapproval resolutions under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal the EPA waivers. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., shepherded these three measures through the Senate, which today earned President Trump’s signature.

Republicans across the country knew there was no time to waste. Beginning this year, California’s Advanced Clean Trucks regulations would have started requiring new heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks and RVs, to be zero-emission. This regulation threatened the RV supply chain by limiting the availability of chassis for motor homes.

THE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME OF CALIFORNIA’S GREEN ENERGY POLICIES HAS ARRIVED AND IT'S A DISASTER

Eleven states and D.C. adopted this mandate, which impacts 25% of the heavy-duty vehicle market in the United States, essentially making it the new national standard.

The stakes couldn’t be higher for the Hoosier State, especially Indiana’s Second District, home to Rep. Yakym and the RV Capital of the World, where nearly 90% of America’s RVs are built. This industry directly supports more than 60,000 Hoosier jobs, pays over $4.3 billion in wages, and generates a total economic output of $22 billion across the state.

RV production is also critical to many other states which is why 13 Democrats joined Republicans in the bipartisan, commonsense vote against the Biden EPA’s RV waiver.

Reversing California’s emissions power grab is essential to RV, automotive and engine manufacturing industries in the state of Indiana and across America.

The Clean Air Act was never intended to effectively give one state the power to dictate emissions standards for entire industries across the country. Congress prohibited states from establishing separate vehicle and engine regulations except under ""compelling and extraordinary conditions"" that apply specifically to that state.

We’ve seen this before. As a U.S. senator, Gov. Braun used the Congressional Review Act to stop Biden’s vaccine mandate for private businesses, a fight that ended with the Supreme Court striking it down. The CRA exists for moments like this, an expedited option to rein in the executive branch, reverse unnecessary red tape and prohibit substantially similar EPA actions in the future.

Hardworking Hoosiers shouldn’t have to bear the weight of federal overreach. National rules should be set by the people’s elected representatives, not by unelected regulators or one state’s agenda.

Energy cost-saving upgrades used to feel out of reach for many. Now, thanks to the clean energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, they’re more attainable than ever.

Across the country, these tax credits have opened doors for schools, nonprofits, churches, and small businesses to lower energy costs, invest in local jobs, and build more resilient communities. Programs like direct pay, the Energy Communities Bonus, and the Low-Income Communities Bonus are especially helpful in places that have long been left out of clean energy conversations. This spring, Appalachian Voices released a report, titled Clean Energy Tax Credits: Working for Appalachia, on how these programs have specifically impacted the Appalachian region.

Highlighting these success stories is more important now than ever, as Congress is debating cutting these vital tax credits in order to pay for tax cuts to billionaires and polluters. The House passed a reconciliation bill in May that will drastically roll back the tax credits, and now it’s being considered in the Senate. If the massive reconciliation bill passes without changes, then many clean energy programs will be eliminated this year. The Senate wants to vote on the bill by the end of June.

In recent months, we’ve spoken with folks across Appalachia who have put these tools to work. Here are some standout examples from West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky.

West Virginia: Savings, skills and community impact

In a state known for its coal heritage, West Virginia is beginning a new chapter, and solar energy is playing a surprising role. Solar installations grew by more than 2,000% in 2024, fueled by expanded federal incentives.

Calhoun County Public Schools became the first district in the state to install solar through a no-upfront-cost agreement. Their solar arrays are expected to save $2.1 million over 35 years — money that will stay in the classroom. The project also launched a new solar workforce program to help students develop hands-on job skills.

At Howell’s Mill Christian Assembly, a summer camp for kids and teens, solar panels have eased the burden of rising utility bills. Federal tax credits and grants covered half of the system’s cost. After saving $5,000 in the first year, they’re already planning to expand the project.

In Beckley, Just For Kids Child Advocacy Center used IRA credits and community support to install a system that will supply nearly all their energy needs. The money they save on electricity can now go toward supporting vulnerable children and families.

And in Wheeling, the congregation at Lawrencefield Parish Church embraced solar after seeing the financial benefits. Their system is projected to save more than $77,000, savings that are already being reinvested into local outreach programs.

These projects show how clean energy can meet real community needs, especially when the right support is in place. Read more about these cases and more in this report.

Ohio: Training the workforce of tomorrow

In Appalachian Ohio, the shift to clean energy is bringing new opportunities to both nonprofits and schools.

The Corporation for Appalachian Ohio Development, a regional nonprofit, is using solar to cut costs and support essential services across its 17-member agency network. With help from the IRA credits and guidance from the Appalachian Solar Finance Fund, COAD is making solar more accessible while creating job training programs that prepare residents for work in the growing solar industry.

At the Tri-County Career Center in Nelsonville, students are learning about clean energy by living it. The school installed a 148-kilowatt rooftop system that will save an estimated $400,000 in electricity costs. At the same time, it provides students in the electrical trades program with real-world experience in solar installation and maintenance. It’s a smart investment in both education and the region’s workforce. Learn more about their stories here.

Kentucky: Smart investments in local institutions

In Eastern Kentucky, local organizations are also putting IRA tax credits to work in powerful ways.

In Perry County, Buckhorn Children and Family Services Center was able to complete a solar project that had been stalled for years. With help from the federal tax credits and direct pay options, the organization installed a 27-kilowatt system expected to save nearly $189,000 over its lifetime. Those savings will be reinvested into mental health and addiction recovery programs for children and families.

In Bell County, the city of Middlesboro installed a 63-kilowatt solar array at its community center, the first solar installation in the city. The panels are projected to cut pool energy costs by 80%, saving about $8,500 a year. Additional funding from The Nature Conservancy and the Appalachian Solar Finance Fund helped make the project possible with minimal upfront cost.

The Leslie County Animal Shelter took a forward-looking step by installing a 35-kilowatt solar-plus-storage system. The project is expected to save the shelter at least $5,000 annually and will help reduce peak energy costs through battery backup. It’s a small project with a big impact, helping a vital community service stay resilient and reduce expenses.

These are just a few of the many projects that have taken root across the region. With continued support for clean energy tax credits, more communities in Appalachia can follow their lead to create jobs, cut energy costs and build a future that works for everyone.

Keeping these incentives in place means keeping opportunity within reach. But Congress is considering drastically cutting these in its massive spending and tax bill. As passed by the House in May, H.R. 1 would eliminate many clean energy programs this year, and make it harder for tax-exempt entities to partner with solar developers to do projects.

Whether these policy mandates were well-intentioned or the result of foreign influence operations designed to undermine US energy security, most states are meeting their targets.
The most comprehensive grid security legislation in Texas filed so far has been championed for more than ten years by Senator Bob Hall — and it may soon become law, giving the state its own independent “Grid Security Commission” to address “all hazards” to the Texas grid.
About the Authors: Tommy Waller and Douglas Ellsworth Lt. Col. Tommy Waller is the President & CEO of the nonprofit Center for Security Policy.
In addition to running the Center for Security Policy, he also manages the nationwide bipartisan Secure the Grid Coalition.","Our nation’s aggressive pursuit of “green energy” goals is putting both electric grid reliability and security at risk — necessitating state action and better preparedness.

Over the past decade, many state governments have set aggressive renewable energy mandates regarding the adoption of grid-scale wind and solar power generation systems and the shuttering of fossil fuel generators. Whether these policy mandates were well-intentioned or the result of foreign influence operations designed to undermine US energy security, most states are meeting their targets.

The closing of baseload power generators, like coal plants, and the simultaneous deep penetration of wind and solar power generation systems have introduced risks to electric grid reliability. These risks were seen first-hand in the 2025 Iberian Peninsula blackout, which caused widespread outages in Spain and Portugal and which was triggered by sub-synchronous oscillations and subsequent sub-synchronous resonance from an over-reliance on inverter-based renewable systems.

Recently, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) — the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO), which is designated by Congress to manage America’s bulk power system (BPS) — released its “2025 Summer Reliability Assessment” with the statement that “Operators in many parts of the BPS face challenges in meeting higher demand this summer with a resource mix that, in general, has less flexibility and more variability.”

That’s a very polite way of warning that the “resource mix” — i.e., too much wind and solar and not enough baseload power generation — is a problem.

The report pointed out elevated risk areas (found in the following document), which is where there is a “potential for insufficient operating reserves in above-normal conditions.”

What the report did not cover are the supply chain and security risks associated with the tremendous adoption of these wind and solar systems.

Supply Chain Concerns

America’s huge push to adopt grid-scale wind and solar systems has also led us to import massive amounts of this infrastructure from a hostile nation that has been hacking our infrastructure for many years — China.

The International Energy Agency reports that China dominates eighty to ninety-five percent of global solar photovoltaic (PV) supply chains and controls the production of the critical inverters often bundled with solar and wind systems. According to the Washington Post, the United States imports approximately eighty percent of its solar components and seventy percent of its grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) from China or Chinese-affiliated suppliers.

A December 2021 report by retired US Army Command Sergeant Major Michael Mabee for the Secure-the-Grid Coalition revealed that the United States imported 171,288,538 Chinese inverters from 2002 to October 2021, and the numbers are only rising.

A 2024 report by the Department of Energy (DOE) projects a 47.6% annual rise in inverter-based power generation through 2035, potentially leading to a forty-nine-fold increase in Chinese inverters embedded in the US grid if current wind and solar energy investments are not reversed.

Security Concerns

National security experts have repeatedly warned federal regulators about the cybersecurity risks associated with importing hardware from adversarial nations like China. Internationally renowned control system cybersecurity expert Joseph Weiss has emphasized that Chinese-made BESSs, integral to storing energy from wind and solar power, are highly susceptible to cyberattacks, with many capable of communicating directly with servers in China. This vulnerability creates a pathway for adversaries to disrupt the grid, potentially inducing blackouts or worse.

The first Trump Administration took security warnings seriously after discovering a Chinese-manufactured transformer with a “hardware backdoor” — declaring a “grid security emergency” on May 1, 2020, and issuing Executive Order 13920: “Securing the United States Bulk-Power System.” Hoping that federal regulators would align grid protection standards with this order, the Secure the Grid Coalition filed a formal, docketed complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), only to have it denied less than six months later. Three months after that, President Biden suspended Executive Order 13920 on his first day in office.

According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Chinese-manufactured transformers imported into the U.S. rose from 300 in 2020 to 554 in February 2025.

While Executive Order 13920 has yet to be reinstated by the current Trump administration, it has been making major policy shifts away from incentivizing wind and solar generation for the bulk power system. Even so, little historical evidence exists that either FERC or NERC will aggressively address the security issues associated with these systems, despite recent warnings about “kill switches” found hidden in Chinese-manufactured solar equipment. To be fair, the scope of the problem is so large — and so many states have provided financial incentives for grid-scale wind and solar systems — that this threat will need to be addressed at the state and local level as well.

The States Must Act

Given the reliability and security risks, states should rapidly reevaluate their policies and the “green energy” mandates that demand and incentivize grid-scale wind and solar systems. Similarly, since electrons don’t care about state boundaries, they must evaluate how they are connected to other states with such mandates. Electrons also don’t care about political parties — and so the effort to enhance the reliability and security of the grid must be a bipartisan effort.

So far, some states have already begun the process of prioritizing reliability and security through various types of legislation. Some, such as Virginia, Indiana, and Louisiana, have expanded the definition of “clean energy” to go beyond just wind and solar systems to consider other generation sources such as nuclear power, which can be defined as “renewable” if we harness the energy of slightly used nuclear fuel. Other states, such as Kentucky, Missouri, and Utah, have taken legislative steps to increase electric reliability by more strongly regulating the retirement of dispatchable electric generation facilities (such as nuclear, coal, and natural gas) in an effort to keep these systems going.

On the security front, Texas took a major step in 2021 with the passage of the Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act, which seeks to address concerns associated with adversarial nations being able to access critical systems through the supply chain. The bill’s sponsor, Senator Tan Parker, also authored legislation launching a state-level Cyber Command to bolster cyber defenses.

Still, concerns among Texan citizens and lawmakers about the risks associated with BESSs — ranging from fire safety and environmental protection to cybersecurity and landowner rights — led to nineteen separate bills being filed on these matters in 2025. The most comprehensive grid security legislation in Texas filed so far has been championed for more than ten years by Senator Bob Hall — and it may soon become law, giving the state its own independent “Grid Security Commission” to address “all hazards” to the Texas grid. Other states would be wise to follow Texas’ lead, though it will be a more complicated process since no other state possesses its own independent electrical grid.

Our People Must Prepare

No matter how fast the federal and state governments try to move to address the reliability and the security risks associated with America’s ambitious adoption of Chinese-made wind and solar components, it may not be fast enough. Citizens will likely become more and more accustomed to receiving requests from their utilities to decrease power usage and to receiving “load shedding” alerts alongside local power outages. “Load shedding” is the term utilities use when they intentionally black out certain portions of the grid to maintain power for others, ensuring overall grid stability and causing what are known as “rolling blackouts.”

Worse yet, the Chinese Communist Party may decide one day in the future that it’s time to exploit the many supply chain and cyber vulnerabilities that they baked into the equipment they sold us. If this happens, the blackouts won’t be “rolling” but rather major and persistent. This is where domestically sourced, small-scale wind and solar power generators would be a helpful asset, alongside other forms of local energy, enabling the operator to function independently of the bulk power grid. Prudent state- and county-level emergency managers can play a major role in public education and promote enhanced personal, family, and community preparedness, following the example of Waldo County, Maine.

Ultimately, it’ll be up to the American people writ large to recognize that our aggressive push to adopt grid-scale wind and solar energy has placed us in a precarious position from which we must course correct. The more people are willing to speak the truth about the associated reliability, supply chain, and security concerns, the faster that’ll happen.

What’s less certain is whether government efforts to reduce its size will falter as the Trump administration scales back agencies involved in the process.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the dead zone will be around 5,500 square miles this summer. Some estimates suggest it will be a little smaller, including those from LSU research scientists Nancy Rabalais and R. Eugene Turner. Their study predicts the hypoxic zone to be around 4,800 square miles, taking into account how warmer water temperatures have altered the Gulf’s complex food web, helping reduce the dead zone.

The different models share one key element: their predicted size is about three times bigger than experts would like to see it.

A basin-wide problem

When nitrogen and phosphorus from farming fertilizers upriver washes down to the Gulf, the excess nutrients can cause algae to bloom near the surface of the water. When the algae dies and decomposes, it sinks into the water and depletes the oxygen fish and other aquatic life need to survive.

The hypoxic conditions affect commercial and recreational fishing as well as cause ecological harm.

Efforts to reduce nutrient runoff into the Gulf are largely outlined in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Hypoxia Task Force Action Plan. Long-term, its goal is to reduce the dead zone to about 1,900 square miles by 2035. Its short-term objective is to drop the amount nitrogen and phosphorus emptying into the Gulf by 20%.

Data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an integral agency in predicting the annual size of the dead zone, found the river’s phosphorus load was up 31% but its nitrate levels were about 24% below average in May.

That’s just a snapshot from a single month, said Doug Daigle, an LSU coastal research scientist and coordinator for the Louisiana Hypoxia Working Group, a state-based organization working to address the Gulf’s dead zone. He emphasized that multi-year data will give the most accurate picture into whether the U.S. is on target to meet its goals.

“Obviously, you don’t like it to be bigger in the years when it’s bigger, but then we also need to keep it in perspective in years when it’s smaller. It’s the trend over time that we’re looking at,” he said. “And we’re not at square one.”

Uncertainty ahead

Whether key federal agencies such as the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will have sufficient funding and manpower to gauge if reduction goals are even being met is uncertain, Daigle said.

“There’s a lot of question marks about what’s happening to the federal agencies and their capacity … between the mass firings and all the other things that are happening,” he said.

Large sections of NOAA staff have been reduced, and USGS research and data collection funding faces millions of dollars in cutbacks.

Daigle added there’s supposed to be a meeting of the EPA’s Hypoxia Task Force later this year, but with all of the federal changes, its members might not have the bandwidth to assess whether reduction goals are being met.

“That’s all tentative at this point,” he said.

An EPA spokesperson said in an email that the agency “takes this initiative very seriously” and will continue its progress. They did not respond to specific questions over staffing capacity and funding resources.

NOAA’s communications staff declined to comment on staffing capacity, saying it “remains dedicated to providing timely information, research and resources.”

Several federal task force positions remain vacant as of June 12, with only “TBD” listed on the EPA’s website for spots reserved for its own representatives, the Geological Survey, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies.

NOAA predicts the size of the dead zone at the beginning of the summer using an aggregate of models from various partner universities, including LSU and the University of Michigan. The agency will monitor and survey the dead zone throughout the summer and review its estimates against the size of the actual dead zone in August.

“It’s about human behavior. There’s both a watershed issue and a global climate change issue here,” Turner said.

Turner and Rabalais agreed the problem isn’t with the EPA’s plan but a need for greater efforts to reduce nitrogen runoff upstream. Solutions such as cover crops and crop rotation strategies help farmers keep fertilizer in their soil for better plant growth and reduce hypoxia-causing runoff.

“Every place is going to be a little different, but there are ways to reduce this,” Turner said.

Whether funding will continue to support these programs is unknown. Aside from some Inflation Reduction Act money and funds from previous federal farm bills, financial support for nutrient reduction has been “modest,” Daigle said.

“There’s a lot of questions about what’s going to happen,” he added.

This upstream uncertainty affects industries that depend on the Gulf, such as commercial seafood harvesting, according to Daigle.

“They’re under a lot of stress” from hurricanes and the influx of cheap, foreign shrimp saturating the market, he said. Reducing the hypoxic zone before it becomes the final nail in the coffin for shrimping in the Gulf is part of the Task Force’s plan, and now is the time to drive home these reduction strategies, Daigle said

“The idea was that you wouldn’t wait for that to happen. You start reducing the loading, you reverse the trend,” he said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-plaquemines-flyover-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:57:46.487810

Clean energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration are under debate in the Senate. House Republicans voted to gut these programs, but not all of their fellow Republicans in the Senate are on board. NPR's Barbara Sprunt has more.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: President Trump has long talked about his frustrations with clean energy provisions signed into law by President Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act. Here he is at an April rally in Michigan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round.

(BOOING)

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

This announcement comes as a concrete response to the increased focus on adding new nuclear generation to U.S. energy resources.

As part of our ongoing series of articles regarding nuclear energy developments, the following provides a brief overview of the TVA application and recent federal and state law surrounding nuclear energy.

1. TVA Application

The TVA views its application as having broader implications beyond receipt of this individual permit. According to Don Moul, TVA President and CEO, “[t]his is a significant milestone for TVA, our region and our nation because we are accelerating the development of new nuclear technology, its supply chain and delivery model to unleash American energy…creating a path for other utilities who choose to build the same technology.”

The NRC previously approved an early site permit for the construction of SMRs at the Clinch River site in 2019, which included a certification that the site was usable for the construction of a nuclear plant from a safety, environmental and emergency planning perspective, but without identifying a specific technology. With this CPA, the TVA seeks specific approval for the construction of a GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy BWRX-300 reactor at the Clinch River site. The TVA has a targeted goal of generating nuclear energy by the 2030s. While this is the first application for approval of the BWRX-300 reactor in the U.S., GE Vernova recently announced that the BWRX-300 reactor has been approved for construction in Ontario.

Although it would not be generating energy for public consumption, chemical firm Dow, in partnership with engineering firm X-Energy, has also announced submission of a CPA to the NRC in Spring 2025, which has been accepted for review. According to the Office of Nuclear Energy’s announcement of the acceptance, the SMR would be used to power the Dow manufacturing facility in Seadrift, Texas as part of a demonstration project supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”).

The TVA is similarly seeking strong financial support for its projects through the DOE’s Generation III+ Small Modular Reactor Program with a coalition of over a dozen other energy industry partners. This coalition is applying for the $800 million grant available through the DOE program.

2. Federal Developments

At the federal level, support for and removal of barriers to new nuclear generation has been a focal point of recent legislation and executive orders. The below provides a brief overview of key developments, which will be evaluated on an ongoing basis, including assessments of industry implications.

Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (“NEIMA”): Signed by President Trump in 2019, the NEIMA was intended to promote advances in nuclear power plant designs, signaling an early focus on nuclear generation. The NEIMA required the NRC to establish a staged licensing process for advanced nuclear reactors and to create a technology-inclusive regulatory framework for licensing of commercial advanced reactors. The NRC was also given two years to develop and implement strategies within the existing regulatory framework for licensing research and test reactors. In connection with each of the above, the NRC was further required to provide intermittent progress reports.

Advance Act: Signed by President Biden in 2024, the Advance Act focuses on incentivizing competition through DOE-awarded prizes (including the grant under the Generation III+ Small Modular Reactor Program that the TVA coalition is applying for) and reducing licensing application fees, promoting microreactors through new NRC guidance and reducing cost for pre-application activities, encouraging placement of nuclear plants at retired coal plant sites, and focusing on U.S. production of high-assay low-enriched uranium.

Executive Orders: The second Trump Administration has continued to emphasize nuclear generation through ongoing executive orders. On May 23, 2025, the Trump Administration issued four executive orders, targeting different elements of the U.S. energy sector. Our recent article discusses the implications of these executive orders.

3. State Developments

At the state level, lawmakers are using a variety of approaches to allow for and incentivize nuclear generation.

Indiana’s Senate Enrolled Act No. 424 establishes a cost recover and filing structure for SMRs. Through Colorado’s HB25-1040, nuclear power is added to the State’s definition of “clean energy resources”, which would allow nuclear projects to contribute to the State’s clean energy goals and receive local funding. This spring, the governor of Massachusetts recently announced the Energy Affordability, Independence and Innovation Act, which, among other actions, would repeal the State’s requirement for new nuclear facilities to be approved by a ballot initiative. The Wisconsin State Senate recently passed SB 125 (currently sitting with the Assembly), which would require the establishment of a nuclear sting study to identify opportunities and sites for nuclear development.

Certain states like Minnesota have outright moratoriums on the construction of new nuclear plants but their lawmakers have begun reassessing those limitations. While they did not pass, two bills were proposed this spring that would either entirely remove Minnesota’s moratorium or specifically authorize the construction of SMRs.

4. More to Come

The TVA’s application signals renewed industry interest in nuclear energy generation, and combined with legislative and executive pressures, we anticipate many more developments in this area.

Clean energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration are under debate in the Senate. House Republicans voted to gut these programs, but not all of their fellow Republicans in the Senate are on board. NPR's Barbara Sprunt has more.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: President Trump has long talked about his frustrations with clean energy provisions signed into law by President Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act. Here he is at an April rally in Michigan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round.

(BOOING)

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

(Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)

WASHINGTON — Small business owners and community leaders from rural regions in Western states including Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah pressed lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week to preserve clean energy tax credits on the chopping block in the Republicans’ “one big beautiful” mega-bill, now in the Senate.

The suite of investment, production and residential tax credits enacted and expanded under the Democrats’ own big budget reconciliation bill in 2022, titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change.

The credits have spurred hundreds of billions in investment dollars in advanced manufacturing and production since 2022, and contributed to job creation, largely in states that elected President Donald Trump to a second term.

Small business operators and community leaders from rural and mountainous areas of the United States that have benefited from the boom in alternative energy sources say the campaign to end the tax credits will also cause job losses and cut options for consumers.

Solar projects in Alaska

Chase Christie, director of development for Alaska Solar LLC, said his company installs four to five large-scale solar projects per year in remote Alaskan villages and also fits and services smaller residential solar installations.

“They take a lot of planning, a lot of logistics,” Christie told States Newsroom in an interview Wednesday.

“For going into a remote village where there’s tundra, we might need to go there in the dead of winter so we can work on frozen ground,” he added. “Other places we won’t go until summer. So we have these large gaps in between these larger projects, and a company like ours absolutely relies on the residential installations to keep our workforce going.”

Christie, who met Tuesday with staffers for Alaska’s Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said in January he let a handful of workers go and paused most new hiring.

“Our workforce is roughly half of what it usually is just because we’re not sure which direction things are going to go,” he said.

Christie was among a dozen small energy business owners, municipal government officials and nonprofit employees focused on energy options for low-income households who States Newsroom spoke to Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement: “Senator Sullivan supports energy projects that lower costs for Alaska. The Senator and his team have been meeting with a number of Alaskans about energy tax credits. As we wait for text from the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator is working with his colleagues to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between promoting stable and predictable tax policy, advancing projects that benefit Alaska, and addressing the need to reduce the federal deficit.”

Murkowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elimination of tax credits

Senators are hashing out language for the massive Republican agenda bill that will extend and expand the 2017 tax law, costing roughly $3.8 trillion, and cut spending in other areas to offset the price tag.

A contingent of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam,” won on accelerating the expiration of the energy tax credits and tightening restrictions on eligibility as a way to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts that Trump campaigned on.

The language in a section of the House bill, passed 215-214 on May 22, titled “Working Families Over Elites,” terminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, worth up to $3,200 for homeowners who make energy upgrades to their property.

Among the slate of other affected IRA tax credits, the House bill also speeds up the expiration of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a credit dating back decades that was updated in 2022.

The credit is available to taxpayers who invest in “energy property,” including solar installations to provide electricity and heat, fuel cells, small wind turbines, geothermal pumps, and other electricity-producing technologies.

House Republicans wrote provisions to eliminate the credit for facilities placed into service after 2028 and end eligibility for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

The credit is worth up to 30% of the cost of the project, plus two bonus credits up to 10% each if the project includes mostly domestically produced material and if it’s located in an “energy community,” meaning a place where a coal plant has closed or where unemployment reaches a certain threshold.

The bill also repeals a taxpayer’s ability to transfer the tax credits as a way to finance a project, and introduces restrictions on foreign-made components that industry professionals say essentially makes the credit unworkable.

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, as of June 4, the elimination of the clean energy investment and production tax credits will save roughly $249 billion over the next decade.

Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a right-of-center think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Thursday in a new analysis that “The final House bill makes impressive cuts to the IRA green energy tax credits, but it does so in part by introducing more complexity.”

The group is advocating for senators to reduce the tax credit rates and make clearer complicated language, like the provision around “foreign entities of concern.”

Keeping on the heat during a Montana winter

But Logan Smith, weatherization program manager for the Human Resource Development Council in central Montana, argues the credits have been a lifeline for lower-income rural residents.

“If I can get solar panels on each of the clients’ homes, that means that their power is going to stay on in the middle of winter,” Smith said. “Because every winter we plan for losing power for about a week, that’s just something we grew up with. … But if we have solar panels, the power stays on, the heat stays on.”

Ralph Waters, owner of SBS Solar in Missoula, Montana, became emotional when talking about how an early termination of the tax credits could slow his business and result in having to lay off half his workforce.

He criticized the politicization of the tax incentives.

“Montana is deeply red, but it’s also a very practical place. And so green energy renewables becomes a taboo phrase somehow,” Waters said. “The practical energy needs are undeniable, and so if we can get past our disagreements about the phraseology and realize that it’s electrons, watts, and amps. And it’s cheaper.”

Josh Stein said in a statement.

JetZero anticipates the facility will create more than 14,500 jobs and offer competitive salaries. The Journal reported the plant will create both direct manufacturing and engineering jobs and indirect jobs with suppliers. Construction is slated to begin in the first half of 2026, putting JetZero on track for its goal to offer its aircraft for commercial use by 2032, the Journal reported.

JetZero is working on a next-generation aircraft with a sleek new design that essentially blends the body and wing of the aircraft together (hence the term blended wing body), as opposed to the popular tube and wing configuration in use today. JetZero’s Z4 aircraft is expected to contain as many as 250 seats, but be about one third the weight of aircraft with similar capacity.

The lighter weight and more aerodynamic design are expected to allow the aircraft to fly higher, meaning less atmospheric drag. JetZero anticipates these efficiencies will improve fuel burn and cut emissions by up to 50 percent.

The company has major backing or buy-in from numerous airlines, including 14 that have been advising it through JetZero’s Airline Working Group. Alaska Airlines and United have invested in JetZero, with United conditionally agreeing in April to purchase up to 200 aircraft. Delta in March announced a partnership with JetZero in which it will lend its operational expertise to develop a full-scale demonstrator aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, targeted for testing in 2027.

JetZero also joined Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab innovation accelerator, which will offer the startup resources and expertise to commercialize its aircraft—Delta even agreed to design the aircraft’s interior.

North Carolina is among the states that have benefited most from climate tech and clean energy-related investments since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), according to business and advocacy group E2. Although IRA incentives mostly intersect with the aerospace sector by way of sustainable aviation fuel, JetZero was among the companies to win a Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grant through the IRA.

Even so, JetZero’s investment in the Greensboro area comes as many companies are cancelling or delaying previously announced climate tech projects and related jobs in the U.S. amid the uncertainties introduced by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and policies.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/vip/2025/06/jetzero-north-carolina-inc.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 23:45:48.485719

The decision, announced Wednesday by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, threw a lifeline to the proposed Twin Metals Minnesota mine near Ely.
Democratic administrations have tried to kill the project because of what they called the threat of acid mine drainage into Boundary Waters, the country’s most-visited federally designated wilderness area.
“The announcement by Secretaries Burgum and Rollins is shocking,” Ingrid Lyons, executive director of Save the Boundary Waters, said in a statement.
The Boundary Waters are too precious,” Smith said.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s administration is moving to lift restrictions on copper-nickel mining that the Biden administration imposed near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota.

The decision, announced Wednesday by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, threw a lifeline to the proposed Twin Metals Minnesota mine near Ely.

Democratic administrations have tried to kill the project because of what they called the threat of acid mine drainage into Boundary Waters, the country’s most-visited federally designated wilderness area.

Twin Metals is owned by Chilean mining giant Antofagasta. President Barack Obama’s administration declined to renew the company’s mineral rights leases in the area in 2016. The first Trump administration reinstated those leases in 2019.

President Joe Biden’s administration canceled the leases again in 2022 and imposed a 20-year moratorium on mining known as a “mineral withdrawal” in a 350-square-mile (900-square-kilometer) area of the Superior National Forest upstream from the wilderness that includes the proposed underground mine site.

Trump has singled out copper as a focus of his domestic minerals policy and promised during a campaign stop in St. Cloud, Minnesota, last year that he would quickly reverse the moratorium.

The Boundary Waters is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, which is part of the Agriculture Department, putting it under Rollins’ purview, and the leases are controlled by Burgum’s Interior Department.

“After careful review, including extensive public input, the US Forest Service has enough information to know the withdrawal was never needed,” Rollins posted on X. “We look forward to working with Sec. Burgum to pursue American Energy Dominance and reverse the costly and disastrous policies of the Biden Administration.”

Twin Metals spokesperson Kathy Graul praised the Trump administration for beginning the process of reversing the Biden administration’s decision, which she said was “based on a deeply flawed assessment” that failed to consider environmental safeguards the company built into its project design.

The company argues that its mine design will prevent acid discharges, and that the best way to determine whether it’s safe is by allowing it to undergo a formal environmental review process, which the state canceled in 2022.

“Overturning the mineral withdrawal will allow Minnesota the opportunity to become a global leader in the much-needed domestic production of minerals under some of the most rigorous environment and labor standards in the world,” Graul said in a statement.

But critics disputed her claim about public input, pointing out that the Trump administration has not conducted a formal public comment process on the policy reversal.

“The announcement by Secretaries Burgum and Rollins is shocking,” Ingrid Lyons, executive director of Save the Boundary Waters, said in a statement. “They claim to have consulted with the people of Minnesota about the Boundary Waters when they clearly have not.”

Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota scoffed at the secretary’s claim about a “careful review,” saying on X that the administration is “using pseudoscience to justify bad actions” and predicting that the decision will be challenged in court.

“Not this mine. Not this place. The Boundary Waters are too precious,” Smith said.

Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber, who represents northeastern Minnesota and has championed the region’s iron and copper-nickel mining industries, said the Biden-era decision was a “massive wrong” that only “further cemented our reliance on Communist China” for critical minerals.

“As the demand for critical minerals continues to skyrocket, I look forward to seeing Minnesota’s skilled miners safely deliver our vast mineral wealth to the nation using the best labor and environmental standards in the world,” Stauber said in a statement.

Twin Metals is separate from two other proposed copper-nickel mines in Minnesota, the NewRange project formerly known as PolyMet, near Hoyt Lakes, which remains stalled by regulatory and court setbacks, and Talon Metals, near McGregor, which the Biden administration supported.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/preview-1032.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:49:48.383123

The NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) today joined with the Trust for Public Land (TPL), staff, students, and others to celebrate the opening of the newly renovated Green Infrastructure playground at the campus of South Bronx Academy for Applied Media/Academy of Public Relations/Jill Chaifetz Transfer High School/P17X@298 in the Bronx. By replacing the formerly asphalt playground with new green infrastructure, the new schoolyard will absorb 1.3 million gallons of stormwater annually, helping to combat flooding in the area and reduce pollution in the East River and New York Harbor.

“DEP is proud to be a partner in this important program to rethink and rebuild school playgrounds as a way to strengthen the city’s infrastructure and improve our waterways,” said New York City Chief Climate Officer and Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit T. Aggarwala. “As we face ongoing threats of more extreme weather and intense rainstorms that can overwhelm our sewers, Green Infrastructure playgrounds like this one in Morrisania play a crucial role in combatting flooding and reducing pollution. I’d like to thank The Trust for Public Land for their hard work in transforming this space and all the students who helped design this wonderful new playground.”

DEP provided $698,000 in funding for the new playground, which was designed by students and staff. It features a synthetic turf field and running track, volleyball courts, play equipment, a colorful safety surface, a green roof gazebo, and green infrastructure that will capture 1.3 million gallons of stormwater annually. This will ease pressure on the area’s sewer system, reduce flooding, and help improve the health of the East River and New York Harbor.

The schoolyard also includes picnic tables, an outdoor classroom, newly planted trees to provide much-needed shade, and a drinking fountain. All of these amenities are aimed at making this space a welcoming site for not just students but for local residents as well.

Since 1996, TPL’s NYC Playgrounds Program has helped design and build 234 school and community playgrounds across the five boroughs. With urgency, TPL is leading the movement to transform asphalt school grounds into vital green infrastructure through advocacy, policy change, research, resource sharing and by creating and evaluating important projects like the Forest Avenue Campus schoolyard in the Bronx.

DEP’s nation-leading green infrastructure program has constructed nearly 16,000 green infrastructure installations including curbside rain gardens, green roofs, subsurface detention, permeable pavers and green medians. All of these green installations intercept stormwater before it can drain into the sewer system, thereby creating additional capacity in the sewers, which helps to reduce flooding and any overflows into local waterways.

Cross Trails will provide energy and ancillary services in what Energy Vault says is a ‘highly attractive’ node in the ERCOT region.
Additionally, the BESS signifies Energy Vault’s first deployment of its second-generation B-Vault AC solution, which is equipped with the company’s energy management system (EMS) VaultOS.

The BESS was completed ahead of schedule and has a 10-year offtake agreement with optimiser Gridmatic.

The agreement is backed by Gridmatic’s Energy Storage Fund, a US$50 million fund created in 2023 to manage up to 500MW of battery capacity in ERCOT and CAISO.

The model mitigates investment risks for the owner by assuring a fixed income, while enabling Gridmatic to benefit more from the battery’s performance potential. This differs from a revenue-sharing model, in which revenues from a project are divided between the optimiser and the project owner.

Gridmatic will also provide qualified scheduling entity (QSE) services.

Cross Trails will provide energy and ancillary services in what Energy Vault says is a ‘highly attractive’ node in the ERCOT region.

The company also claims the project was completed ahead of schedule, at least in part due to its B-Vault AC storage solution.

Additionally, the BESS signifies Energy Vault’s first deployment of its second-generation B-Vault AC solution, which is equipped with the company’s energy management system (EMS) VaultOS.

Recently, Energy Vault signed an agreement with developer Jupiter Power to supply an additional 100MW/200MWh BESS at a Jupiter site in ERCOT.

That project will utilise the company’s B-Vault solution and VaultOS EMS.

Notably, Energy Vault also highlighted its sale of investment tax credits (ITCs) for Cross Trails. In a recent analysis of the US budget reconciliation, ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill,’ BloombergNEF said that if tax credits are cut, US energy markets could see a “last-minute rush” followed by plummeting installation numbers.

Marco Terruzzin, chief revenue officer of Energy Vault said of Cross Trails:

“Completing Cross Trails ahead of schedule and achieving ERCOT certification early is a testament to our team’s expertise and the commitment of the entire leadership team to delivering long-term, sustainable shareholder value under the ‘Own & Operate’ growth strategy announced in 2024.”

Agilitas Energy commissions 9.9MW/22.4MWh Houston BESS

Elsewhere in Texas, developer Agilitas Energy commissioned its 9.9MW/22.4MWh BESS in the city of Houston.

The project marks the first distributed generation BESS interconnected to utility CenterPoint Energy’s distribution system and participating in ERCOT’s wholesale delivery market.

Agilitas is known for developing distributed and smaller utility-scale solar PV and BESS projects in the Northeastern US. However, in 2023, the company entered the ERCOT market by acquiring a portfolio of standalone energy projects from Gulf States Renewable Energy for around US$75 million.

That deal saw the company taking on six in development assets totalling 60MW near Houston.

Each BESS used batteries supplied by BYD Energy, and as a whole, the deal marked a turn for Agilitas not just in terms of project size but also in terms of location, with the company previously focusing on the Northeastern US.

Agilitas says its newly commissioned BESS will strengthen grid resiliency during peak events and lower electric system costs by participating in the ERCOT energy and ancillary services markets.

The company is also on track to commission another 9.96MW/22.4MWh BESS later this year in the state.

Barrett Bilotta, president, CEO and co-founder of Agilitas said of the company’s newly commissioned BESS:

“This project underscores our confidence that ERCOT—long recognised as one of the premier energy markets in the U.S.—will increasingly value the unique benefits that only energy storage can provide.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DJI_20250416201021_0604_D.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 06:02:38.113417

Many of these communities are rural and secluded, a contrast to the region’s population center of Asheville, where I live. Although beautiful and unique, the geography of the region made it especially difficult to coordinate a regional response after the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene on September 27, 2024.

Helene brought unprecedented rainfall and strong winds to the area. Water settled in the many low-points, causing creeks and rivers to rise quickly. The resulting flood devasted Asheville and neighboring communities — many homes and businesses were under water and over 396,000 people in the state, mostly those in the Western region, lost power. Thousands were still without power over two weeks after the storm.

When Hurricane Helene moved inland, the town of Hot Springs, like the rest of the region, lost power. However, unlike Asheville, Hot Springs is equipped with a microgrid. On the Monday after the storm, the Dept. of Transportation allowed Duke Energy to cross the French Broad River bridge to get into Hot Springs, and Duke worked to address some minor microgrid issues including depleted batteries. While the microgrid was able to support load on Tuesday, October 1, damage assessments were still being performed in the town, and the microgrid returned power to the town’s critical facilities on October 2 after flood areas were deemed safe to re-energize.

This effort took just a few days — a rapid turnaround in comparison to many communities in the Carolinas and Georgia that faced weeks-long outages. The microgrid continued to power Hot Springs for nearly a week before a mobile substation — a portable, self-contained electrical distribution system — was brought in to reconnect the town to the larger utility grid.

Other relief efforts were cropping up across Western North Carolina. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, after clearing a path through downed trees out of his East Asheville home, Jamie Trowbridge scrawled a handwritten note on the door of Sundance Power Systems, a solar installation company in Weaverville, relaying the need for backup power to help residents gathering at the Barnardsville fire station and community center. Barnardsville, a rural community located 20 miles north of Asheville, was isolated, leaving many residents unable to access critical services.

Trowbridge worked to gather supplies stored in local garages and basements of his solar industry friends, and he started spreading the word about the need for donated batteries and solar gear. Coordinating this effort was challenging due to the lack of cell service across the region. Trowbridge had to drive to the top of a large hill in West Asheville just to get reception. I did the same in the aftermath of Helene, biking to higher elevation so I could call family and let them know I was safe.

Word of Trowbridge’s efforts soon spread to Footprint Project, a nonprofit organization that provides emergency support through resilient power technologies to communities in the wake of natural disasters. Footprint arrived in Barnardsville with two mobile solar and battery storage trailers, which powered essential community facilities and provided a Starlink internet connection.

Once grid power was restored to Barnardsville, Footprint Project staff began identifying other communities in need of support. They established their base of operations and accumulated a large supply of solar and battery storage equipment. These donations became the foundation of Asheville-based Free Store, which provides long-term, no-cost rentals of solar and storage equipment to businesses, organizations and individuals who are still in need of reliable power even many months after the storm. Firestorm Books, a West Asheville bookstore that became an impromptu neighborhood relief hub in the days after the storm, was powered through Free Store equipment. My friends and I met there daily to attend community meetings and share food, resources and plans.

Disaster relief efforts are still ongoing in Western North Carolina and there is still significant need for equipment as well as for future resilience planning. Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association (NCSEA), emphasized that in the immediate aftermath of a disaster there is often an outpouring of support, but in the months that follow, impacted areas often see a significant slow-down in this support.

“There is a real opportunity in this moment to ensure we are elevating the value that this equipment has already brought to the region, and how it can help the region better prepare for future storms,” Abele said.

Local organizations are working to maintain this momentum while also still recovering from the disaster. Electrify Asheville-Buncombe is advocating for solar and battery storage to power wells for drinking water in rural areas. NCSEA, Greentech Renewables and Land of Sky Regional Council are engaged in an ongoing fundraising campaign to support fully mobile equipment (with a particular emphasis on serving vulnerable populations, such as those with electricity-dependent medical needs), semi-permanent installations and permanent community resilience hub infrastructure located in population-dense areas where people can aggregate after disasters.

NCSEA also advocates for more state grant funding for microgrids serving critical facilities such as telecommunications and water infrastructure. Fundraising efforts benefitting more mobile solar + storage equipment, facilitated through Footprint Project, also continue in the region. Using the Hot Springs microgrid as a case study, Duke Energy is planning to expand microgrid deployment in the region, specifically aimed at bolstering electricity resilience in rural areas with a history of prolonged outages.

The organizations, communities and utilities operating in Western North Carolina continue to work tirelessly to repair the damage and rebuild what was lost. This is evidenced by the slow cleanup progress I see every time I drive along the French Broad River or hear news of roads and bridges being re-opened. These ongoing efforts go beyond simple restoration; they represent a critical opportunity to reimagine and reinforce the region’s infrastructure, economy and support systems. By integrating more sustainable practices, enhancing emergency preparedness and fostering stronger community networks, these initiatives not only address the immediate aftermath but also are laying the groundwork for a more resilient and adaptive region that is better equipped to withstand future challenges. Solar and battery storage needs to be a critical piece of that plan.

Today, the Arizona Commerce Authority released new numbers highlighting the jobs and business investment at risk due to cuts from the Congressional Reconciliation Bill. In total, the reckless legislation would put 69,000 jobs and $58 billion in investments in Arizona at risk.

“The Arizona Promise is built on creating opportunities for working-class Arizonans and growing our economy,” said Governor Katie Hobbs. “Over the last three years, Arizona’s economy has boomed, and business investment and job creation have accelerated by leveraging federal tax credits created in the IRA. Since its passage, Arizona’s economy has attracted 134 existing, potential, and announced projects that would be affected by the repeal of federal tax credits. These projects together represent more than 69,000 existing and potential new jobs, and $58 billion in capital investment to grow the state’s advanced manufacturing, energy, technology, and infrastructure industries. The federal government should be working with us in furthering Arizona’s economic success, not undermining our growth.

“Many Arizona communities are benefiting directly from these programs and businesses are choosing to build, invest, hire, and expand with these incentives. A repeal of the tax credits will jeopardize Arizona’s economic momentum and the jobs of Arizona workers. Making matters worse, rolling back these tax credits would drive up energy costs at a time when Arizona families are already struggling to make ends meet. By 2029, Arizona households would see an 11.4% increase in electricity costs, and commercial and industrial users would experience a 15.9% increase. Politicians in Washington, D.C., are already creating uncertainty with unnecessary tariffs and an escalating trade war. Ending these tax credits early would slow down job growth, drive up costs, and hurt the progress Arizona has made. As Arizona’s population grows and our economy thrives, now is the time to protect these federal investments and Arizona’s economic future.”

Arizona elected and business leaders join Governor Hobbs’ call for Congress to protect the federal tax credit program that is driving job and economic growth around the state.

“Arizona has worked to make sure we’re a great place to do business—with the help of both Democrats and Republicans over the years. Because of this we’ve benefitted more than other states from the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable energy tax credits. We see it in the big solar and battery storage projects bringing low-cost, reliable power to the grid and in the dozens of companies who have invested to bring manufacturing here, creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Republicans’ plan to cut these programs will put thousands of Arizonans out of work and make energy prices go up. I’m working with Governor Hobbs and others to stop the bad Republican plan and protect Arizona’s economy,” said Senator Mark Kelly.

“Trump and House Republicans promised to make life affordable. Instead, they’re actively cutting jobs. This isn’t just a tax plan—it’s a direct assault on Arizonans who simply want to get ahead and provide for their families. Slashing clean energy tax credit jeopardizes billions in investments by stalling our state’s economic momentum,” said Senator Ruben Gallego.

“If clean energy tax credits are repealed, Arizona loses out on tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and families’ energy bills go up,” said Congressman Greg Stanton. “I want the industries of the future here in Arizona, not overseas.”

“Arizona’s competitive edge in advanced manufacturing is no accident—it’s the result of smart policy, strategic investment, and strong partnerships,” said Danny Seiden, President and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry. “Targeted tax credits supporting domestic production and clean energy innovation have helped accelerate private-sector growth across the state. Preserving them is critical to sustaining Arizona’s manufacturing momentum and keeping us at the forefront of next-generation industries.”

“We are investing billions of dollars in Queen Creek and look forward to creating high quality jobs in Arizona, as we bring our advanced manufacturing expertise and experience to the United States. We hope Congress will endorse the current tax credit that will help secure a strategic U.S. supply chain and to manufacture leading-edge batteries in Arizona,” said Richard Ra, President of LG Energy Solution Arizona.

“Continuation of 45X and other clean energy policies give businesses like Lucid certainty to deepen our investments in U.S. production and the communities where we operate. These pro-manufacturing, pro-clean energy, pro-worker policies support our commitment to Arizona and the U.S. as we create good-paying jobs, expand American high-tech manufacturing, develop domestic supply chains, and export more automobiles to foreign markets,” said Jessica Nigro, VP of External Affairs of Lucid Motors.

“With our highly skilled workforce, reliable energy, and attractive business environment, Arizona has been a big winner for advanced manufacturing projects receiving investments under the Inflation Reduction Act,” said Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “Phasing out or eliminating these financial programs could seriously jeopardize projects in our pipeline as well as those that have already selected Arizona.”

“Arizona leads the nation in building a clean energy economy that attracts investments, creates jobs, lowers costs, improves air quality, and saves water. A repeal of these tax credits will hurt Arizona workers, communities, and businesses,” said Maren Mahoney, Director of the Arizona Governor’s Office of Resiliency. “Without these federal investments in clean energy technology, Arizona families stand to lose out on good-paying jobs in manufacturing and construction, and risk even higher energy bills.”

“Arizona is leading the way in building a globally competitive high‑tech economy, from semiconductors to clean energy,” said Steven G. Zylstra, president and CEO of the Arizona Technology Council and SciTech Institute. “Phasing out these critical energy tax credits prematurely will pull the rug out from under companies that are actively investing, hiring and innovating in our state. Arizona so far has attracted billions of dollars in investment and tens of thousands of jobs. Pulling back these incentives now would undercut the very tools fueling our economic momentum. This is not the time to weaken what’s powering Arizona’s ecosystem of innovation.”

ARIZONA INVESTMENTS AT RISK

These tax incentives have created historic investments in economic and workforce development around Arizona. Through growth in energy, advanced manufacturing, and other improvements in supply chains and innovation, these federal investments are growing and maintaining the energy and tech economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump and executives from the tech and energy sectors will appear at an artificial intelligence and energy summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 15, the office of the state's U.S. Senator Dave McCormick said on Thursday.

McCormick's inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit will be held at Carnegie Mellon University, his office said in a statement.

Axios reported that tech executives like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai were on the summit's guest list. Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods, Shell CEO Wael Sawan and Chevron CEO Mike Wirth were also on that list, according to Axios.

White House AI czar David Sacks, who is also expected to attend the summit, expressed concern earlier this week that regulating U.S. AI too tightly could stifle growth and cede the critical market to China.

The comments indicated the Republican president's approach to AI could be centered on expanding markets abroad for U.S. AI chips and models. Democratic former President Joe Biden had emphasized policies that countered risks the chips could be diverted to China and used to bolster Beijing's military.

A group of 40 state attorneys general, including Republicans from Ohio, Tennessee, Arkansas, Utah and Virginia and other states, have pushed back against Republican attempts to block states from regulating AI, saying states should develop and enforce common-sense regulation to protect consumers.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management it has reopened consideration of the national Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas leasing program for offshore oil and gas drilling, including restricted areas, such as the Atlantic OCS.

“Launching the process to develop the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Program marks a decisive step toward securing American Energy Dominance,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.

But it’s garnering mixed reviews in the Palmetto State.

Belvin Olasov, who was born and raised on the Isle of Palms, is no stranger to the South Carolina coast.

I grew up going to the beach often,” he said. “I think it's one of the most sacred things we have in the Lowcountry.”

A reconsideration of offshore drilling along the southern Atlantic Coast would reverse a .

BACKGROUND |

Kenzie Poole, a staff attorney with the South Carolina Environmental Law Project, called it a “huge change in any status quo.”

Poole said the shift would bring oil drilling to an area that hasn’t seen it since 1983. Her group also claims it’s illegal and violates 2021 case law.

“Once a president permanently withdraws ocean areas from oil and gas leasing, those protections cannot simply be reversed by the wave of a pen,” Poole said. “That is what is still in place when it comes to the moratorium and case law on the permanent ban.”

On top of the legality, Poole said the impacts of offshore drilling would be felt closer to home than the name suggests.

“There would be a huge presence of infrastructure that would be coming in to support any kind of offshore drilling. So, it wouldn't be just offshore, it would also be on land,” she explained.

In the past, drilling and seismic testing threatens South Carolina’s nearly $24 billion tourism industry.

Many argue it also puts marine life at risk.

I know people here care about seafood, care about the fisheries, that's another big part of Charleston life,” Olasov said, “and those webs of life can really be disrupted.”

While this is just a first step from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to receive information, Olasov, founder of the Charleston Climate Coalition, feels South Carolinians’ voices are being ignored.

“I think that's not right. I think that the people of South Carolina have spoken really clearly that they don't want offshore drilling, and so imposing it on us feels really unfair,” he said.

Health risks of PFAS exposure PFAS are toxic at extremely low levels.","WASHINGTON – New data(link is external) released by the Environmental Protection Agency shows an additional 6.5 million Americans have drinking water contaminated by the toxic “forever chemicals” known as PFAS. It brings the total number of people at risk of drinking this contaminated tap water to about 165 million across the U.S.

That’s a 4% increase in the number of Americans with verified PFAS-polluted water in just the last few months. Exposure to PFAS is linked to cancer, reproductive harm, immune system damage and other serious health problems,(link is external) even at low levels.

“It is impossible to ignore the growing public health crisis of PFAS exposure. It’s detectable in nearly everyone and it's found nearly everywhere, including the drinking water for a huge segment of the population,” said David Andrews, Ph.D., acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group.

“The documented extent of PFAS contamination of the country’s water supply highlights the enormous scale of contamination,” he added.

The EPA’s new findings come from tests of the nation’s drinking water supply conducted as part of the Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule(link is external), or UCMR 5, which requires U.S. water utilities to test drinking water for 29 individual PFAS compounds.

Protections under threat

In 2024, the EPA finalized first-time limits on six PFAS in drinking water, which help tackle forever chemicals contamination – but these standards are now at risk.

The EPA has said it will roll back limits on four PFAS in drinking water, leaving those chemicals unregulated. It plans to only retain standards for the two most notorious chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. These maximum contaminant levels(link is external) or MCLs, set enforceable standards for the amount of contaminants allowed in drinking water.

Even with keeping the PFOA and PFOS MCLs in place, rolling back the four other limits will make it harder to hold polluters responsible and ensure clean drinking water.

In addition, the EPA’s plan to reverse the four science-based MCLs likely contradicts an anti-backsliding provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act. That law requires(link is external) any revision to a federal drinking water standard “maintain, or provide for greater, protection of the health of persons.”

“It’s worrying to see the EPA renege on its commitments to making America cleaner and safer, especially as it ignores its own guidelines to do so,” said Melanie Benesh, EWG’s vice president for government affairs.

Widespread PFAS pollution

The Trump administration’s PFAS standards rollback could grant polluters unchecked freedom to release toxic forever chemicals into U.S. waterways, endangering millions of Americans.

EWG estimates nearly 30,000 industrial polluters could be discharging PFAS into the environment, including into sources of drinking water. Restrictions on industrial discharges would lower the amount of PFAS ending up in drinking water sources.

“Addressing the problem means going to the source. For PFAS, that’s industrial sites, chemical plants and the unnecessary use of these chemicals in consumer products,” said Andrews.

Health risks of PFAS exposure

PFAS are toxic at extremely low levels. They are known as forever chemicals because once released into the environment, they do not break down and can build up in the body. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has detected PFAS in the blood(link is external) of 99 percent of Americans, including newborn babies.

Very low doses of PFAS have been linked to suppression of the immune system(link is external). Studies show exposure to PFAS can also increase the risk of cancer, harm fetal development and reduce vaccine effectiveness.

For over 30 years, EWG has been dedicated to safeguarding families from harmful environmental exposures, holding polluters accountable and advocating for clean, safe water.

“Clean water should be the baseline,” Andrews said, “The burden shouldn’t fall on consumers to make their water PFAS-free. While there are water filters that can help, making water safer begins with ending the unnecessary use of PFAS and holding polluters accountable for cleanup.”

For people who know of or suspect the presence of PFAS in their tap water, a home filtration system is the most efficient way to reduce exposure. Reverse osmosis and activated carbon water filters can be extremely effective at removing PFAS.

EWG researchers tested the performance of 10 popular water filters to evaluate how well each reduced PFAS levels detected in home tap water.

New deduction for business-development company investors: The bill allows investors in business-development companies to take advantage of a unique 23% tax deduction.
What the Reconciliation Bill Means for Investors If passed, this bill will affect investors in a variety of ways.
Where Does the Reconciliation Bill Go From Here?","As Congress moves forward with a new budget reconciliation package, known colloquially as the “Big Beautiful Bill,” corporations across the country are bracing for a wave of regulatory and tax policy changes that could significantly reshape their operations and profitability.

Reconciliation is a legislative process that allows certain budget-related bills to bypass the Senate filibuster and pass with a simple majority. Since this makes congressional approval more attainable, this process has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing fiscal policy priorities.

Historically, the reconciliation process has been used to advance sweeping tax and spending policy priorities. This bill is no exception as it includes several provisions that will likely have profound implications for banks, investment firms, insurance companies, and other financial services providers.

The bill passed the House on May 22, 2025, and is now being considered by the Senate. Here’s what investors should know about what’s in it and its potential impact on their portfolios.

What’s in the Reconciliation Bill?

The most closely watched elements of the House-passed version of the legislation cover:

Deregulation: The bill includes several measures that would loosen regulatory oversight over corporations across a variety of industries. For example, this proposal includes reforms that would accelerate and expand permitting for fossil fuel projects, pipelines, and mining operations. It also includes reduced capital and liquidity requirements for banks, and would roll back investor protections by weakening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s enforcement authority over digital finance products.

Corporate tax rate: The House-passed version of the reconciliation bill includes an increased tax deduction for qualified business income under Section 199A. Specifically, the deduction is increased to 23% from 20%, ultimately lowering the effective tax rate on qualified business income to 28.49% from 29.6%.

Elimination of clean energy credits: The bill calls for an accelerated phaseout of clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act. It would end tax credits for wind, solar, and battery storage projects by 2028 and mandate that eligible projects commence construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

New deduction for business-development company investors: The bill allows investors in business-development companies to take advantage of a unique 23% tax deduction. Under this provision, investors in qualified business-development companies now receive a 23% tax deduction on certain dividend payments.

Research and development incentives: The bill reinstates immediate expensing for research and development costs, reversing changes made in previous tax legislation. This provision is expected to significantly benefit technology companies, pharmaceutical firms, and other innovation-driven sectors by improving their cash flow and encouraging continued investment in R&D activities.

What the Reconciliation Bill Means for Investors

If passed, this bill will affect investors in a variety of ways.

On the positive side, the corporate tax cuts will increase aftertax profits for many companies, which will likely boost stock valuations in capital-intensive and domestic sectors (for example, industrials, manufacturing, and energy). The bill also proposes wholesale changes to the environmental permitting process that will make permit acquisition easier for critical energy and mineral projects, ultimately providing a boost to these sectors.

Moreover, loosening liquidity requirements on banks will create more capital flexibility that could drive increased merger and acquisition activity, boosting valuations in the financials sector. The capital gains indexation could also spark increased trading activity as investors feel more comfortable realizing gains, potentially boosting market liquidity and transaction volumes.

Additionally, the new 23% deduction on business-development company dividends will boost aftertax returns for existing investors while making these income-generating funds more attractive to new capital.

That said, several notable provisions present significant risks for investors.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a key source of data and analysis of the consumer markets, and the proposed cuts to the CFPB would considerably reduce the quantity and quality of financial information that investors can access.

The elimination of clean energy credits will also significantly impact businesses relying on these credits. In turn, this change will affect investors, particularly those with portfolios focused on climate, sustainable infrastructure, and energy transition.

Moreover, institutional investors will likely reallocate away from environmental, social, and governance strategies as they become even more politically vulnerable, which will have a cascading effect for investors involved in ESG funds.

Where Does the Reconciliation Bill Go From Here?

With slim margins in the Senate and competing priorities within the Democratic caucus, the reconciliation bill’s final contours remain uncertain. However, investors and the financial-services industry writ large are preparing for a range of scenarios, from modest tax adjustments to sweeping regulatory mandates.

Legislative experts suggest that the bill’s timeline could extend into late summer, with potential amendments and modifications expected as it moves through the Senate. Key swing votes in both chambers will likely demand additional provisions or modifications, potentially altering the bill’s final impact on various sectors and investment strategies.

The research group Energy Innovation has modeled the House reconciliation bill’s impact on the economy and the energy industry.
In the near term, there’s likely not much policymakers can do about electricity prices, and therefore utility bills going up.","A proposed rule published in the Federal Register on Wednesday argues that U.S. fossil fuel-fired power plants make up “a small and decreasing part of global emissions” and therefore are not significant, and do not require regulation under the law. The rule would repeal all greenhouse gas emission standards for new and existing power plants — both the standards the Biden administration finalized last year, which have been tied up in court, as well as the standards that preceded them, which were enacted by Obama in 2015.

In a separate proposal, the EPA also took steps to repeal limits on mercury and hazardous air pollutants from coal plants that were enacted last year, reverting the standard back to one set in 2012.

The argument that U.S. power plants make up a small sliver of global emissions and thus aren’t worth addressing is like having “a five-alarm fire that could be put out if you send out all the trucks, and you don’t send any of the trucks because no one truck could put the fire out by itself,” David Doniger, a senior attorney and strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. “We just think that is a wacky reversal and a wacky interpretation of the Clean Air Act.”

When you add up every plug, power button, and light switch across the country, electricity usage produces 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions each year. Over the past 30 years, American power plants have contributed about 5% of the total climate pollution spewed into the atmosphere worldwide.

In the global context, that may sound small. But in a recent report titled “The Scale of Significance,"" New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity estimated that if U.S. power plants were a country, it would be the sixth biggest emitter in the world, behind China, the European Union, India, Russia, and the remainder of U.S. emissions. The report also notes that U.S. actions on emissions make other countries more likely to follow, due to technological spillovers that reduce the cost of decarbonization globally.

The Technical Argument

In addition to the significance finding, the EPA gave two other reasons for repealing the power plant rules. It argued that “cost-effective control measures are not reasonably available,” meaning there’s no economic way to reduce emissions at the source. It also said the new administration’s priority “is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

The first argument is an attempt to say that Biden’s standards flouted the law. In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA could not simply tell states to reduce emissions from the power sector, which is what the Obama administration had initially tried to do. Instead, the agency would have to develop standards that could be applied on a plant-by-plant basis — so long as those rules were “cost-reasonable” and “adequately demonstrated.”

To comply with that ruling, Biden’s EPA based its standards on the potential to install carbon capture technology that can reduce flue gas emissions by 90%. The regulations would have required existing coal plants to install carbon capture by 2039, or else shut down. (To the chagrin of many energy system observers, the administration chose not to apply limits to existing gas-fired power plants.) But while fossil fuel companies and utilities had, in the past, asserted that carbon capture was viable, they deemed the standards impossible to meet.

Trump’s EPA is now agreeing. “In 2024,” Zeldin said on Wednesday, “rules were enacted seeking to suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment, to make all sorts of industries including coal and more disappear, regulate them out of existence.”

The Long Game

When Trump moved to overturn Obama’s power plant regulations during his first term, his EPA did not contest the significance of the sector’s emissions, and simply enacted a weaker standard. A week before he left office, the agency also finalized a rule that set the threshold for “significance” at 3% of U.S. emissions — which exempted major polluters like refineries, but still applied to power plants.

This time, Trump has a new apparent game plan: Strip the Clean Air Act of its jurisdiction over greenhouse gases altogether. Today’s action was the first step; EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said the agency will similarly “reconsider” emissions rules for cars and oil and gas drilling. But the cornerstone of the plan is to reverse what’s known as the “endangerment finding” — the 2009 conclusion that greenhouse gases present a threat to public health and welfare, and therefore are one of the pollutants EPA must address under the Clean Air Act.

“The Trump administration is trying to say, don’t worry about the Clean Air Act. It will never apply, so you can go back to your old ways,” said Doniger. But if the argument that power plant emissions are insignificant is a stretch, appraising greenhouse gas emissions as benign is inconceivable, he said. “The endangerment finding was based, in 2009, on a Denali-sized mountain of evidence. Since then, it’s grown to Everest-size, so there’s no way that they would be able to put together a rational record saying the science is wrong.”

The Chevron Trap

These highly technical questions of whether emissions are “significant” or whether carbon capture is “adequately demonstrated” could soon be determined by a group of people who lack both the expertise to answer them and the inclination to wade through thousands of pages of atmospheric science and chemical engineering documents: judges.

Last year, the Supreme Court overturned a long-held precedent known as Chevron deference. That ruling means that the courts are no longer required to defer to an agency’s interpretation of statute — judges must make their own determinations of whether agencies are following the intent of the law.

When environmental groups begin challenging the EPA’s repeals in court, judges are “going to be bombarded with the need to make these highly technical, nuanced decisions,” Michael Wara, a lawyer and scholar focused on climate and energy policy at Stanford University, told me. He said the reason Chevron deference was established in the first place is that judges didn’t want to be making engineering decisions about power plants. “They felt extremely uncomfortable having to make these calls.”

The conservative Supreme Court overturned the precedent because of a sense that political decisions were being dressed up in scientific reasoning. But Wara doesn’t think the courts are going to like being put back into the role of weighing technical minutia and making engineering decisions.

“It’s a past that the courts didn’t like and they tried to engineer a way out of via the Chevron doctrine,” he said. “I would expect that we’re going to see a drift back toward a doctrine that looks a little bit more Chevron-like, maybe less deference to agencies. But it’s hard to predict in the current environment what’s going to happen.”

This has led to scrambling by state governments, with New Jersey announcing hundreds of millions of dollars of relief to alleviate rate increases as high as 20%. Maryland convinced one utility to spread out the increase over a few months.

While the dysfunctions of PJM are distinct and well known — new capacity additions have not matched fossil fuel retirements, leading to skyrocketing payments for those generators that can promise to be on in time of need — the overall supply and demand dynamics of the electricity industry could lead to a broader price squeeze.

“Trump and JD Vance can get off tweets about how there’s no inflation, but I don’t think they’ll feel that way in a week or two,” Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, told me.

And while the consumer price index is made up of, well, almost everything people buy, electricity price increases can have a broad effect on prices in general. “Everyone relies on energy,” Amarnath said. “Businesses that have higher costs can’t just eat it.” That means higher electricity prices may be translated into higher costs throughout the economy, a phenomenon known as “cost-push inflation.”

Aside from the particular dynamics of any one electricity market, there’s likely to be pressure on electricity prices across the country from the increased demand for energy from computing and factories. “There’s a big supply adjustment that’s going to have to happen, the data center demand dynamic is coming to roost,” Amarnath said.

Jefferies Chief U.S. Economist Thomas Simons said as much in a note to clients Wednesday. “Increased stress on the electrical grid from AI data centers, electric vehicle charging, and obligations to fund infrastructure and greenification projects have forced utilities to increase prices,” he wrote.

Of course, there’s also great uncertainty about the future path of electricity policy — namely, what happens to the Inflation Reduction Act — and what that means for prices.

The research group Energy Innovation has modeled the House reconciliation bill’s impact on the economy and the energy industry. The report finds that the bill “would dramatically slow deployment of new electricity generating capacity at a time of rapidly growing electricity demand.” That would result in higher electricity and energy prices across the board, with increases in household energy spending of around $150 per year in 2030, and more than $260 per year in 2035, due in part to a 6% increase in electricity prices by 2035.

In the near term, there’s likely not much policymakers can do about electricity prices, and therefore utility bills going up. Renewables are almost certainly the fastest way to get new electrons on the grid, but the completion of even existing projects could be thrown into doubt by the House bill’s strict “foreign entity of concern” rules, which try to extricate the renewables industry from its relationship with China.

“We’re running into a set of cost-push dynamics. It’s a hairy problem that no one is really wrapping their heads around,” Amarnath said. “It’s not really mainstream yet. It’s going to be.”

In some relief to American consumers, if not the planet, while it may be more expensive for them to cool their homes, it will be less expensive to get out of them: Gasoline prices fell 2.5% in May, according to the BLS, and are down 12% on the year.

However, I have learned that the wind industry’s worst fears are indeed coming to pass. The Fish and Wildlife Service, which is responsible for approving any activity impacting endangered birds, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, tasked with greenlighting construction in federal wetlands, have simply stopped processing wind project permit applications after Trump’s orders – and the freeze appears immovable, unless something changes.

According to filings submitted to federal court Monday under penalty of perjury by Alliance for Clean Energy New York, at least three wind projects in the Empire State – Terra-Gen’s Prattsburgh Wind, Invenergy’s Canisteo Wind, and Apex’s Heritage Wind – have been unable to get the Army Corps or Fish and Wildlife Service to continue processing their permitting applications. In the filings, ACE NY states that land-based wind projects “cannot simply be put on a shelf for a few years until such time as the federal government may choose to resume permit review and issuance,” because “land leases expire, local permits and agreements expire, and as a result, the project must be terminated.”

While ACE NY’s filings discuss only these projects in New York, they describe the impacts as indicative of the national industry’s experience, and ACE NY’s executive director Marguerite Wells told me it is her understanding “that this is happening nationwide.”

“I can confirm that developers have conveyed to me that [the] Army Corps has stopped processing their applications specifically citing the wind ban,” Wells wrote in an email. “As I have understood it, the initial freeze covered both wind and solar projects, but the freeze was lifted for solar projects and not for wind projects.”

Lots of attention has been paid to Trump’s attacks on offshore wind, because those projects are sited entirely in federal waters. But while wind projects sited on private lands can hypothetically escape a federal review and keep sailing on through to operation, wind turbines are just so large in size that it’s hard to imagine that bird protection laws can’t apply to most of them. And that doesn’t account for wetlands, which seem to be now bedeviling multiple wind developers.

This means there’s an enormous economic risk in a six-month permitting pause, beyond impacts to future energy generation. The ACE NY filings state the impacts to New York alone represent more than $2 billion in capital investments, just in the land-based wind project pipeline, and there’s significant reason to believe other states are also experiencing similar risks. In a legal filing submitted by Democratic states challenging the executive order targeting wind, attorneys general listed at least three wind projects in Arizona – RWE’s Forged Ethic, AES’s West Camp, and Repsol’s Lava Run – as examples that may require approval from the federal government under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. As I’ve previously written, this is the same law that bird conservation advocates in Wyoming want Trump to use to reject wind proposals in their state, too.

The Fish and Wildlife Service and Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment after this story’s publication due to litigation on the matter. I also reached out to the developers involved in these projects to inquire about their commitments to these projects in light of the permitting pause. We’ll let you know if we hear back from them.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTg2MTI1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MDA5NDI5MH0.QKEQVpFhKz3ec12g71fN7OW88qvSnENz63BUPb0H_II/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-12 23:57:49.825611

Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year.
Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.
The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.
“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help “unleash” American energy.

The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.

The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump’s repeated pledge to “unleash American energy” and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.

If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.

The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administration’s “war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.”

“The American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,” he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. “They wanted to make sure that … no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living … create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.”

Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.

Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals “yet another in a series of attacks” by the Trump administration on the nation’s “health, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.”

She called it “unconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.”

“Ignoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,” added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court.”

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated — they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.

The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.

In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,” the EPA said, adding: “this Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.

If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA’s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don’t either and therefore shouldn’t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice.

The EPA proposal “has the potential to have much, much broader implications,” she said.

Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to “suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,” with the intent to regulate the coal industry “out of existence” and make it “disappear.”

National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove “deliberately unattainable standards” for clean air while “leveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.”

But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.

“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said. “These are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.”

A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.

“Carbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,” said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in “significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dims.apnews-1-1.webp,N,,2025-06-12 23:32:49.941006

Tariffs and potential repeals of federal funding are creating roadblocks to the further buildout of energy projects.

Wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects have helped revitalize rural communities by creating jobs, generating new tax revenues, and providing lease payments to landowners.

However, energy projects rely on globally sourced components due to the U.S. supply chain’s inability to meet rising demand. To avoid tariffs, solar developers are stockpiling panels, but the impact is only delayed. Battery storage is critical for grid reliability and faces tariffs of up to 65%.

The rising costs are forcing companies to delay or cancel plans.

For example, the Plum Creek Wind Project in Minnesota was cleared for construction this fall, but the project developer, National Grid Renewables, has pressed pause due to escalating costs tied to tariffs.

The slowdown threatens rural economies by halting the local jobs and long-term positions in operations and maintenance that new construction brings. Tax revenues from energy projects fund vital infrastructure and critical public services like schools, emergency services, and roads. In Iowa’s Howard County, 147 wind turbines account for 14.5% of the county’s total annual tax revenue.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about 85% of U.S. farm households earned the majority of their income from off-farm sources. Hosting wind turbines or solar panels offers a stable source of income through lease payments, but the additional income is at risk if renewable energy development declines.

Rural economies have grown thanks to renewable energy development, but without continued investment, many communities will not be able to unlock those economic benefits.

Contact your congressional representatives. Tell them to support federal funding for renewable energy development and oppose tariffs that will affect future development in rural communities.

The plan calls for downsizing NOAA’s research division, which oversees the federal research laboratories headquartered in Boulder.","Since 1967, the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Mesa Laboratory has stood on a hilltop above Boulder, offering an iconic reminder of the scientific quest to better understand Earth’s climate and weather systems.

The federally funded lab has built supercomputers and developed radar tools to help improve weather predictions. It’s also a leading example of a Colorado-based institution swept up in the Trump administration's efforts to shrink federal funding for climate science and related fields.

After initial fights over grant freezes and job cuts, the White House has released funding plans for the next fiscal year beginning in October. NCAR is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, which published its latest budget proposal on May 30. The plan calls for a 40 percent funding cut for the center that employs hundreds of researchers in Boulder.

“A funding reduction of 40 percent would likely mean far-reaching cuts to our programs and labs,” said David Hosansky, an NCAR spokesperson. “It's too soon to say which specific research programs and positions would be affected if Congress were to approve such a budget reduction.”

Other Colorado climate research hubs could face significant cuts under a detailed White House budget request released in early May. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—the federal agency in charge of weather, climate and ocean predictions—operates four scientific labs at the David Skaggs Research Center in Boulder. Their work includes monitoring global greenhouse gas concentrations, operating flights to track ground-level ozone pollution, a state-of-the-art model to predict wildfire smoke and a project to study the climate impact of melting permafrost.

The Trump administration’s latest detailed budget proposal eliminates $608 million in funding for NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which oversees the Boulder labs. That aligns with a budget request leaked in April showing the White House hopes to shutter the division and shift some pieces to other parts of the organization.

Congress must consider and approve a final federal budget. If it greenlights the president's plan, John Tayer, the executive director of the Boulder Chamber, said the cuts would devastate critical research and a local economy built around federal labs.

“ It would be a terrible mistake for our country to backtrack on its investments in innovation and research,” Tayer said. “ We will be actively engaged in all of our lobbying efforts to make sure that the activities in Boulder, specifically, and across the country, are supported.”

Federal labs driving the local economy

The federal government never had an overarching plan to concentrate research facilities in Colorado.

Starting in the 1950s, different agencies and academic panels independently decided to build laboratories in the state, said Dan Powers, the executive director of CO-LABS, a nonprofit group advocating for federal research in Colorado.

Today, Powers said the state now boasts the country’s second-highest concentration of federally funded research entities. While that’s a boon to the local economy, it also means Colorado is vulnerable if Congress proceeds with President Trump’s proposed budget.

“You’re not only possibly losing the employees and the revenue that they might spend on restaurants, clothing or car repairs,” Powers said. “You’re also losing their impact on the communities in the ways they volunteer their expertise and participate in other types of civic projects.”

Federal funding supports more than 2,000 jobs related to earth science research in northern Colorado. An NCAR spokesperson confirmed the center employs more than 1,300 people in Boulder and Broomfield.

In addition, Colorado is the only state with two NOAA cooperative institutes—academic and non-profit partnerships built to support the agency’s research efforts. The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) works through Colorado State University, and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) operates at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Steven Miller, the director of CIRA in Fort Collins, said the institute employs roughly 130 people in Boulder and Fort Collins. Waleed Abdalati, the current executive director of CIRES and the former NASA chief scientist, said the institute employs more than 700 people in Boulder. Many work alongside an additional 350 direct federal employees at NOAA’s Colorado labs.

It’s unclear if the White House plans to ax NOAA’s cooperative institutes. A draft White House budget leaked in April suggested the Trump administration would end federal funding for the partnerships. Abdalati, however, said the more recent budget documents don't explicitly address the issue, and he’s hopeful Congress will intervene to save the research alliances.

Meanwhile, some former federal employees are still reeling from earlier cuts enacted through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

In February, the Trump administration terminated more than 800 NOAA employees as part of a larger attempt to trim wasteful spending, focusing on newer “probationary” workers with a lower level of job protection. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the agency’s David Skaggs Research Center to protest the layoffs in the weeks afterward.

The federal government briefly reinstated the employees after a federal court blocked the job cuts, then re-fired them when a higher court lifted the decision in April.

Susan Cobb, a NOAA communications specialist who lost her position, said the legal wrangling has left her and other impacted workers in a kind of employment purgatory. She hasn’t received an official termination letter and doesn’t know if the government plans to pay her unused vacation.

“We have no power, we have no documentation, we have no rights. We’re kind of just fighting the system,” Cobb said.

A battle outlined in Project 2025

If the White House enacts its proposed budget, the cuts to federal climate research would carry out a vision laid out in Project 2025, the conservative 900-page policy outline written by the Heritage Foundation, a D.C.-based think tank.

The plan calls for downsizing NOAA’s research division, which oversees the federal research laboratories headquartered in Boulder. The policy document says the office is the source of “climate alarmism” and the majority of its climate-change research should be “disbanded.”

Abdalati rejected any suggestions that climate scientists want to alarm the public. He said their mission remains focused on informing policymakers and helping the public plan for an increasingly volatile climate.

“It's very hard to believe that, in an environment that is changing, we wouldn't wanna do our best to understand those changes,” Abdalati said. “That's directly what is being targeted in some of these budgetary numbers.”

The U.S. The House and Senate are now working on their own proposed budgets for the fiscal year. After the release of the president’s proposal, Congressman Joe Neguse, a Democrat representing Boulder, called the federal laboratories the “crown jewels” of the country’s climate research system.

“Gutting NOAA and its research would be gravely irresponsible and would put our communities at great risk,” Neguse said in a written statement. “Make no mistake, we’re going to continue to push back against the Trump Administration’s disastrous proposals to strip this agency of its funding.”",https://www.cpr.org/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:34:07.529554

But the Clean Air Act also allows California to adopt more stringent emission requirements than EPA, because California was the only state that had its own vehicle emissions standards before the passage of the Federal Clean Air Act.
Once EPA grants California a waiver, Massachusetts may adopt California’s standards and does not need a waiver of its own.
As Congress intended, those waivers have allowed California, and the states that adopted California’s standards, to improve on their vehicle emissions programs.
The complaint asks the court to declare the CRA resolutions to be unlawful and to require the Administration to implement the Clean Air Act consistent with the granted waivers.","BOSTON — Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell today joined a coalition of 10 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit against the Trump Administration, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), challenging the illegal and unprecedented use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to disapprove California’s waivers for its Advanced Clean Cars II (ACCII), Omnibus, and Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) standards, which Massachusetts subsequently adopted. The Administration’s actions deny the filing states the right to enforce vehicle emissions standards needed to achieve each state’s goals and protect their residents from harmful pollution.

“The Congressional Review Act was not designed to undermine a state’s right to set and enforce its own public health standards simply because the President opposes them,” said AG Campbell. “I will continue to fight against illegal policies that harm our residents and thwart our climate goals.”

The Clean Air Act requires EPA to set federal emission standards for air pollutants from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines that cause or contribute to air pollution that endangers public health or welfare. But the Clean Air Act also allows California to adopt more stringent emission requirements than EPA, because California was the only state that had its own vehicle emissions standards before the passage of the Federal Clean Air Act. California can enforce its standards if EPA grants California a preemption waiver. The Act requires EPA to approve waivers for California’s rules absent certain, limited circumstances not present here. Once EPA grants California a waiver, Massachusetts may adopt California’s standards and does not need a waiver of its own. Since 2023, EPA has granted California three waivers, allowing it to enforce the ACCII, Omnibus, and ACT programs, and Massachusetts has adopted each of those programs as its own. Historically, EPA, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, has granted California more than 75 preemption waivers for updates to its new motor vehicle emissions control program. As Congress intended, those waivers have allowed California, and the states that adopted California’s standards, to improve on their vehicle emissions programs.

Motor vehicle emissions contribute to the formation of smog, as well as fine particle pollution and toxic air pollution, all of which are linked to premature death, respiratory illness, cardiovascular problems, and cancer, among other serious health impacts. Transportation is also the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country, and cars and trucks account for 80% of those transportation emissions.

Massachusetts has a strong interest in curbing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, which are being felt in every corner of the Commonwealth, especially in already overburdened communities. Electric vehicles result in approximately 79% less carbon dioxide emissions statewide than their gasoline powered counterparts. Those programs are a critical component of the Commonwealth’s efforts to protect its residents and meet its statutorily mandated greenhouse gas emission-reduction goals.

Under ACCII, which Massachusetts adopted in 2022, and enforcement discretion issued by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), automakers must continue to sell an increasing number of zero-emission vehicles in Model Year 2028 and beyond. By model year 2035, manufactures must be able to show that 100% of the passenger vehicles sold in Massachusetts are zero-emission. They may meet this requirement in a variety of ways, including selling up to 20% plug-in hybrids and accruing credits through several options detailed in the regulations.

The Advanced Clean Trucks regulations, which Massachusetts adopted in 2021, aim to accelerate the widespread adoption of zero emission vehicles in the medium and heavy-duty truck sector, are similarly critical for Massachusetts’ efforts to meet air quality standards and protect public health. And the Omnibus regulation, which Massachusetts also adopted in 2021 and which becomes effective for Model Year 2026, requires internal combustion heavy-duty trucks sold in Massachusetts to meet strict standards for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions, which are major contributors to smog formation.

Under the direction of President Trump, EPA transmitted the three California waivers to Congress as “rules” subject to CRA procedures, even though the three waivers state EPA’s consistent and longstanding position under both Republican and Democratic administrations that waiver decisions are not “rules.” The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate illegally used the CRA to target California’s Clean Air Act waivers even though the CRA does not apply to such waiver decisions.

According to the attorneys general, waivers have never been subject to the CRA nor have any other agency orders for permission, such as oil and gas leases or mining permits. The Administration’s actions undermine states’ authority to set specific standards and limitations on decarbonization through motor vehicle emissions to protect the health and safety of their residents.

The complaint filed today alleges that the attempt to invalidate California’s waivers violated constitutional principles of federalism, the Take Care Clause, and multiple federal statutes including the Congressional Review Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. The complaint asks the court to declare the CRA resolutions to be unlawful and to require the Administration to implement the Clean Air Act consistent with the granted waivers.

Joining AG Campbell in filing the lawsuit are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Delaware, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

Electric vehicle sales in China surpassed over one million units in a single month for the first time this year, driven by strong domestic demand and targeted export efforts from Chinese manufacturers, notably BYD, tapping into emerging markets.

BYD’s exports to Mexico and South-east Asia, along with Uzbekistan, have significantly boosted sales in these regions, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.

Fleet incentives in Germany and robust growth in Southern Europe helped lift the European market, while the expiry of Canadian subsidies dragged on North American demand, he added.

US tariff

Global automakers face a 25 per cent import tariff in the United States, the world’s second-largest car market, causing many of them to withdraw their outlooks for 2025.

In Europe, new incentives for fleet buyers in Germany are expected to support electric car sales through the second half of the year.

Tesla’s Model Y production in Berlin shields it from tariffs, yet it faces market share pressures as production ramps up globally amidst shifting trade tensions.

President Donald Trump’s stance towards emissions standards and uncertainties around tariffs has also hampered EV growth in North America.

In the US, tax credits for EVs are still available but will begin phasing out from 2026, contributing to hesitation among buyers.

Clean energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration are under debate in the Senate. House Republicans voted to gut these programs, but not all of their fellow Republicans in the Senate are on board. NPR's Barbara Sprunt has more.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: President Trump has long talked about his frustrations with clean energy provisions signed into law by President Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act. Here he is at an April rally in Michigan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round.

(BOOING)

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

The 11-state coalition filed the case against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the federal district court covering northern California. The legal action comes the same day President Trump signed multiple resolutions seeking to end federal waivers allowing California to set its own vehicle emissions standards.

“Today, we’re saving California, and we’re saving our entire country from a disaster. Your cars are going to be thousands of dollars less,"" President Trump said at a White House signing ceremony.

In a press release, Colorado Attorney General Phil Wiser called the move a “breathtaking” attack on clean air, adding that the litigation is necessary to save the state’s plans to improve air quality, cut ozone pollution and give carbuyers more choices.

In the last few years, Colorado and California have emerged as the nation’s leading electric vehicle markets, with plug-in vehicles accounting for roughly a quarter of new vehicle sales. Tax credits and rebate programs helped drive the trend, but the state’s looming sales mandates pushed carmakers to develop more attractive models, said Travis Madsen, the transportation program director for the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, a Boulder-based environmental advocacy group.

“I think it worked. One of the reasons there’s so many EVs available is Colorado and the other clean car states pushing manufacturers to make the cars Coloradans want,” Madsen said.

Federal law has historically permitted the state to adopt stricter rules due to its severe air pollution challenges. Other states can in turn decide whether to adopt those standards.

California has exercised its power to require a rapid shift to electric vehicles. Under rules approved in 2022, 35 percent of 2026 car models sold within the state cannot release emissions. The regulation then bans all sales of gas- and diesel-powered cars by 2035. A separate rule requires manufacturers to sell a rising percentage of zero-emissions trucks starting next year.

Colorado adopted its own version of both clean vehicle rules in 2023. While air quality officials opted against California’s requirement for a 100 percent EV market by 2035, the rules still require that 82 percent of all vehicles sold in the state are electric by 2032.

A similar clean truck sales mandate requires manufacturers to offer more zero-emissions trucks over the next few years. A separate rule cribbed from California requires gas- and diesel-powered truck engines to limit nitrogen oxide emissions, a key ingredient behind ground-level ozone pollution known to smother the Front Range every summer.

At issue is the legal mechanism behind the push to end the EV rules. The resolutions signed by Trump seek to revoke California’s waivers through the Congressional Review Act, a law allowing the U.S. House and Senate to overturn regulations issued by federal agencies.

In the past, however, the EPA has concluded the law doesn’t apply to California’s waivers since the special allowance counted as a “decision” rather than a “rule.” The Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan staffer who interprets Senate rules, agreed the law didn’t apply to the waivers.",https://www.cpr.org/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:29:39.233538

My work isn’t just a job, it’s a great career. This industry pays well, jobs like mine can’t be offshored and many are in rural communities. It feels good to work on something my community needs: The projects I’ve worked on power hundreds of thousands of homes with clean, reliable electricity. But without continued support from Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, many similar projects across Iowa could stall, leaving both workers and communities without the economic and environmental benefits they provide.

And thanks to historic investments from the IRA, we've seen wind energy ramp up, with more than $25 billion in new investments in Iowa. From farmers making the most of their land with solar and wind projects to workers in new manufacturing facilities to technicians like me out in the field — thanks to tax credits for wind, we are all building an economy that is lowering energy bills for families, cleaning up the air we breathe, and creating job opportunities for our kids and grandkids.

Even as Iowa workers, families and communities reap the benefits of clean energy, we've seen members of the U.S. House of Representatives just this month curtail these incredible opportunities by passing a federal budget bill severely weakening or cutting clean energy tax credits.

That's why I'm strongly urging Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst to stand with workers in our industry and Iowan families across the state and ensure that these tax credits remain a powerful source of support for Iowa’s economy.

Grassley has the opportunity right now to secure his wind energy legacy. Ernst, who expressed her enthusiasm for wind energy when I met her on Capitol Hill in March, can also help ensure Iowa continues to reap the benefits of a reliable, affordable, and green source of energy.

Workers, families, and communities in Iowa want to see these strategic investments and policies continue so our jobs remain intact and we can build a future that's better for our economy, our people and our environment.

By strengthening, rather than weakening, the Inflation Reduction Act, Senators can ensure that the momentum of our wind energy industry persists and we can keep energy bills low and job creation high. With continued support, we can build a prosperous, resilient, and healthier future for all.

SOURCE Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina","The aircraft OEM will produce its all-wing Z4 airplane at the site, which is 50% more fuel efficient than today's commercial jet.

RALEIGH, N.C., June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, JetZero has announced a $4.7 billion investment for a production facility at the Piedmont Triad International Airport (PTI) in Greensboro, North Carolina – with plans to create more than 14,500 jobs. The factory will be located on PTI property, and will house production for the company's commercial all-wing design airplane, the Z4. The company's headquarters will officially move from Long Beach, CA to Greensboro once the site is operational. The company plans to break ground on the facility in the first half of 2026.

Notably, this news stands as the largest job announcement in the history of North Carolina.

""I am thrilled to welcome JetZero and its 14,000 good-paying jobs and unprecedented innovation to Guilford County,"" said Governor Josh Stein. ""From first in flight to now the future of flight, North Carolina and our skilled workforce is soaring.""

The facility, designed to be a ""factory of the future,"" will be fully digital and AI-driven to outpace legacy original equipment manufacturers by ramping up faster, cutting unit costs, boosting quality, and hardening supply chain. The company's Z4 planes are equipped with seating for 250 passengers, at up to 50% better fuel efficiency than today's commercial tube & wing jets. The company plans to have its first commercial airplanes delivered by the early 2030s.

""North Carolina offers the ideal combination of talent, infrastructure, and forward-thinking leadership to support our mission to reshape aviation,"" said Tom O'Leary, CEO and co-Founder of JetZero. ""This facility is a critical milestone in bringing our all-wing Z4 to market. I applaud the leadership of Governor Josh Stein and his team as well as the leadership of the North Carolina General Assembly, and whole host of local leaders and organizations for working with us to bring JetZero to North Carolina, the birthplace of aviation.""

North Carolina is uniquely positioned to support Jet Zero's growth, with a plentiful and skilled labor force of 5.5 million, and over 49,00 engineers. Additionally, the state is the nation's leading manufacturing workforce in the Southeast, and with more than 30,000 STEM degrees are awarded annually — the state provides a strong, sustainable talent pipeline for years to come.

Additionally, North Carolina provides an attractive business climate for companies like JetZero. Ranked a top 3 state for business for five consecutive years by CNBC, the state has the lowest corporate tax rate, and falling, at 2.25%, and a cost of living 5% below the national average. Well aligned with JetZero's commitment to sustainability, North Carolina also offers low cost of energy and has a bi-partisan approach to renewable energy leadership and sustainability.

""This announcement is a testament to North Carolina's growing reputation as a magnet for aerospace innovation and top-tier STEM talent,"" said Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. ""With our rapidly growing population and dynamic workforce, we're attracting industry leaders to create quality jobs that will strengthen our local economy and communities across the state.""

JetZero has secured investments and conditional purchase agreements from Alaska Airlines and United Airlines. Approximately 14 airlines have joined JetZero's Airline Working Group to provide input on their needs, including the requirement for the Z4 to readily fit into today's airport infrastructure.

Additionally, Jet Zero is partnering with Siemens and their Smart Infrastructure, Electrification, and Automation divisions, headquartered in North Carolina, to design the greenfield factory to leverage the latest digital and industrial AI tools to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective production and operating model. Siemens also supports JetZero's design/build/test model for the Demonstrator aircraft, a full-scale prototype slated for first flight in 2027. Siemens tools enable accelerated design, adaptable manufacturing, and digital test, shaving years of development time while upholding the highest quality and safety standards.

The facility will create thousands of direct advanced manufacturing and engineering jobs, and indirect and induced jobs via suppliers and services providers. Jobs offered at the facility will have average wages above $89,000 per year. Additionally, becoming the next aerospace hub in the U.S. will bring significant opportunities for North Carolina students from high school graduates to community colleges to the State's higher education system.

The company and the state will work closely together to create customized workforce development and training programs. The North Carolina Community College System, home to 58 community colleges, is on board to develop a customized training program estimated to value more than $22 million, which will help deliver the large-scale workforce the company is planning to hire.

Avangrid begins operations at first solar project in California In California, Avangrid has achieved commercial operations at its 57MW Camino Solar project in Kern County, its seventh project to enter commercial operation in the state, and the first solar facility.
The news also follows the company’s start of commercial operations at a 202MW solar project in Ohio earlier this year.
The project is one of a portfolio of six Michigan solar projects that DTE expects to reach commercial operation in the coming years, which began with the commissioning of the 150MW Sauk Solar project last year.
“This continues to be the most active period of renewable energy development in DTE’s history.”","These are the first projects to being operation since Geronimo announced a rebrand, from its old name of National Grid Renewables, last week, although the company’s focus on building new renewable power capacity in the US remains the same.

Alongside the Ross and Fayette projects, Geronimo’s Ohio portfolio includes the 274MW Yellowbud project, at which operations started in 2023, and the Dodson Creek and Sycamore Creek projects, at which construction is currently underway.

Both projects have a capacity of 117MW, and once completed, Geronimo will have a total operating capacity in Ohio of more than 675MW. Geronimo has said that it has over 2GW of power generation capacity yin operation, with a development portfolio of a further 20GW.

“The addition of Ross and Fayette to our Ohio operating portfolio brings our collective projected economic impact to more than US$160 million across the Buckeye state,” said Blake Nixon, president and CEO of Geronimo.

Avangrid begins operations at first solar project in California

In California, Avangrid has achieved commercial operations at its 57MW Camino Solar project in Kern County, its seventh project to enter commercial operation in the state, and the first solar facility. The project is built next to the company’s 189MW Manzana wind farm, and the start of operations has pushed the company’s total operating renewable power capacity in the state to around 600MW.

While Avangrid’s work in the Californian energy sector has historically focused on wind, the state remains a leader in the US solar industry. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), solar accounted for 16% of the state’s total net electricity generation in 2023, the last year for which the EIA has published figures, almost three times the contribution of the state’s wind sector.

However, solar has also been curtailed during periods of low prices to a far greater extent than any other energy source. According to the EIA, in 2024, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) curtailed 3.4TWh of utility-scale wind and solar output, a 29% year-on-year increase, with solar accounting for 93% of all energy curtailed on the California grid last year. Uncertainty regarding the future of solar curtailment in the state could have encouraged Avangrid to invest in a diverse range of renewable energy technologies.

The news also follows the company’s start of commercial operations at a 202MW solar project in Ohio earlier this year.

DTE completes construction at latest Michigan project

DTE has completed cosntruction at its 100MW Polaris Solar Park in the state of Michigan.

The company expects to commission the project, in the Washington and North Star townships in Michigan’s Gratiot County, this summer, and will be DTE’s third solar project to connect to a local grid this year. The project is one of a portfolio of six Michigan solar projects that DTE expects to reach commercial operation in the coming years, which began with the commissioning of the 150MW Sauk Solar project last year.

While Michigan has not been a historic leader in the US solar sector – the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that the state had the 25th-most operating capacity among the US states as of the first quarter of this year – the state could be primed for considerable growth. SEIA expects developers to add 5.6GW of new solar capacity in the next five years, the 12th-most among US states, and Michigan added over 500MW of new capacity in both 2023 and 2024.

“DTE is committed to growing our portfolio of clean, Michigan-made renewable energy as part of our broader generation mix to support the evolving energy needs of our customers,” said Matt Paul, president and chief operating officer, DTE Electric. “This continues to be the most active period of renewable energy development in DTE’s history.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/avangrid.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:01:38.931156

U.S. Oil Growth Has a One-Basin Problem Putin Extends Russian Oil Export Ban to Price Cap Countries Through 2025 Egypt Locks In Landmark LNG Import Deals With Aramco, Shell, and Trafigura","President Trump’s U.S. energy dominance agenda could be derailed by one provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the tax and spending bill championed by the President and currently under review by the U.S. Senate.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains Section 899, officially named ‘Enforcement of remedies against unfair foreign taxes.’

This section proposes to increase the tax rates on foreign companies operating in the United States from countries that have what the Bill describes as “unfair foreign taxes.”

It is widely believed that “unfair foreign taxes” relate to the EU and UK tax regimes, which the Trump Administration considers as discriminatory in taxing U.S. firms, especially America’s technology giants.

If the Big Beautiful Bill passes as-is, increased tax rates would hurt Europe-based energy companies with large operations in the United States. These include the UK’s Shell and BP, France’s TotalEnergies, and Spain’s Repsol, Reuters columnist Ron Bousso notes.

Higher taxes on major foreign oil and gas operators in the U.S. would reduce company profits and potentially undermine further investment by them in expanding U.S. oil and gas supply.

This is the opposite of President Trump’s ‘drill, baby, drill’ slogan from the campaign trail and the executive orders and legislation along the same lines passed in the first months in office of the new administration.

As a result of Section 899, Shell could lose up to $800 million of free cash flow per year from its Gulf of Mexico operations alone. The hit to BP could be as much as $300 million off its free cash flow a year, according to estimates by Reuters’ Bousso.

Section 899 of the Big Beautiful Bill would hurt overall investment in the U.S. from abroad and would cost America jobs, trade groups and fund managers warn.

The Investment Company Institute (ICI), representing fund managers in the U.S., said that Section 899 “is currently written in a manner that could limit foreign investment to the US—a key driver of growth in American capital markets that ultimately benefits American families saving for their futures.”

The Global Business Alliance, a trade group for international companies in the United States, warned that Section 899 could eliminate 700,000 U.S. jobs and reduce U.S. GDP by $100 billion annually, citing an independent third-party analysis by the EY Quantitative Economics and Statistics (QUEST) practice.

Senate Republicans also want to dial back some of President Donald Trump’s tax priorities in order to reduce the overall cost.","We don’t know exactly what the Senate’s reconciliation bill will look like.

But what we do know is that Senate Republicans are looking to rewrite two of the hardest-fought provisions in the House’s bill.

Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) told GOP senators Wednesday that he plans to scale back the House’s SALT cap deal and rework repeals of clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act.

The changes could put Speaker Mike Johnson in a perilous position in his quest to get the reconciliation bill done by July 4. Here’s why:

1) Two New York Republicans have said they won’t vote for a dollar less than the House’s $40,000 cap on deducting state-and-local taxes. There are a handful of other SALT Caucus Republicans who’ve warned the Senate against changes and view the negotiations as settled.

The SALT backers are expecting Johnson to sell the cap to the Senate and make sure it sticks. If it doesn’t, expect some furious blue-state lawmakers.

Aware of the potential pitfalls in changing SALT, Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) said he’s been talking with blue-state House Republicans about it “almost every day.” Mullin, who often acts as a liaison with the House, said it’s his “number one issue” right now.

2) Crapo told senators that Finance’s plan for IRA credits involves accelerating some repeals and allowing gentler phase-outs for others based on energy type. The IRA cuts could get close to the more than $500 billion that the House included, but may tally somewhat lower.

The House Freedom Caucus has been pressing senators to hold the line on the House version. The details of the Senate’s plan will matter a lot. Remember: House Republicans like Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) want nothing short of gutting the IRA to its core.

Over a dozen House GOP moderates are tracking the IRA changes closely, too. The House had to walk a tightrope on the IRA cuts, and now the Senate is as well.

Senate strategy: Senate Majority Leader John Thune is trying to be cautious of the House’s needs, but he can only do so much.

The Senate’s vote-counting math is simply different than the House’s. GOP senators are totally dug-in against the House bill’s SALT cap. They see it as a small minority of lawmakers in one chamber forcing them to accept a policy they dislike — and that costs more than $350 billion compared to extending the current cap.

Thune is juggling different IRA demands, including at least four senators who want a less aggressive approach to repeals.

There’s also the money factor. The Senate Finance Committee is planning to make key business tax breaks for R&D spending, interest expenses and buying machinery and equipment permanent in their rewrite of the House-passed package. This is a top priority for many Finance Committee Republicans.

Permanence balloons the tax bill’s cost, so GOP senators have to find savings elsewhere, such as with SALT. Senate Republicans also want to dial back some of President Donald Trump’s tax priorities in order to reduce the overall cost.",https://punchbowl.news/wp-content/uploads/MikeCrapo_12012020-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:41:11.965065

At the same time, the top Senate Democrat is pulling out the stops to salvage what he can from the landmark climate law.

At a closed-door Senate meeting, Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) told senators he wanted to “extend the runway” for certain tax credits that House Republicans all but scrapped in their budget reconciliation package — though details were sparse.

Senators said Crapo talked about amending the language for when a project must “start construction” and preserving a provision that lets a project sponsor transfer tax credits to a third party.

The House-passed bill would also drastically phase out renewable incentives and enact strict new supply chain requirements that industry deemed unworkable.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said he thought Crapo was “very much” open to extending the lifespan of incentives for “certain types of energy and then other types of energy are going to expire quicker, … and he talked pretty specifically of nuclear of course, to which I said, ‘Amen and amen.’”

The Finance Committee is expected to release more details Monday night, Cramer added. He said Wednesday’s meeting “was just more conceptual.”

But others noted the ethos of the bill is not expected to change much.

“We’re trying to keep the intent of the House intact, for the most part,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a Finance member, though he’s been pushing for some specific changes to soften strict requirements.

Schumer a ‘perpetual motion machine’

As Republicans continue to inch forward on their megabill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has been working to sway them against wholesale repeals of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Indeed, after President Donald Trump and Republicans swept the elections last year, Schumer said he knew he had to gear up to protect the IRA.

He reached out to clean energy executives and environmental leaders months ago, he said, but no one was prepared for how aggressive the House legislation that passed just before Memorial Day would be.

“No one expected it to be as bad as it was,” he said. “At the last minute, overnight, they dramatically reduced or eliminated the clean energy provisions. Most of the Republican congressmen didn’t know of it, but I called up everyone that weekend, and I said, ‘DEFCON 1,'” referring to the highest alert level for nuclear war.

In recent weeks, he’s been enlisting finance people; clean energy advocates; tech executives; governors with major renewables investments; “friendly” Trump administration officials; Duke Energy and Southern Co. executives; and Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trade Union, to call their senators.

“Chuck is spending so much time and energy on this,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said at a press conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. “He’s become like a perpetual motion machine.”

Specifically, Schumer and his allies are targeting 16 Senate Republicans who he thinks show “some discomfort” with undoing the IRA.

“I have a list of the one hundred biggest clean energy projects in America,” Schumer said. “Eighty percent are in red states, it turns out. One of the companies that runs those projects is saying, ‘People, call your senator,’ and say, ‘This will shut me down.’ And they are doing it.”

Energy price spike?

Beside trying to woo Republicans, Schumer and other Democrats have been saying the GOP megabill threatens to raise energy prices.

A new analysis from the Democratic-aligned Center for American Progress set to be released Thursday found that slashing the IRA could cut 13 gigawatts of clean power on the grid per year over the next decade. In 2024, the U.S. added 49 gigawatts of new capacity to the grid, with 95 percent from new solar, batteries, nuclear and wind power.

“As much as 72 percent of all clean energy capacity that would have been built over the next decade would disappear,” the report says.

Asked if he worried Democrats might be able to run on rising electricity costs in the midterm elections, Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), who’s running for Senate and has backed a Hyundai vehicle and battery plant in his district, shrugged off the question.

“That remains to be seen,” he said. “I’m not sure energy costs are going to go up. In fact, I would submit that as we concentrate more on available energy such as natural gas, it might go down. And that’s certainly something we’re trying to do.”

He added: “So I think that’s risky on their part — to say the least.”

Intense lobbying

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Wednesday met with some House Republicans who sent a letter to Senate GOP leaders last week urging them to make big changes to the legislation they had nonetheless voted for.

“I think that that was important,” Murkowski said of last week’s letter. “I think they’re raising the same kinds of concerns that we are raising on the Senate side. It’s much of the same in terms of — how can you allow for a longer phase out for some of these credits, the issue of transferability. I don’t think that there’s anything new, but I think it is important that it’s being reinforced on both sides.”

Groups representing a host of interests have been ratcheting up lobbying.

Advanced Energy United and Republican-led Built for America are among those running ads. Built for America has been trying to reach the president and his allies on Fox News and Truth Social, POLITICO reported.

The Solar Energy Industries Association is planning a rally on Capitol Hill with workers next week.

The trucking industry and allied trade associations sent a letter to Senate leaders asking to preserve the 30C tax credit, which applies to alternative fueling equipment installed at homes or businesses. It can include electric charging for cars and heavy-duty trucks. The House version of the bill would phase out the credits at the end of 2025.

“This short runway threatens to strand investments that have already been made in good faith based on the credit’s availability, especially for projects that have begun construction but will not be completed by year-end,” the letter said.

The GOP is up against a self-imposed Independence Day deadline to send legislation to Trump’s desk. Many continue to say publicly that timeline is achievable, though Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) said Tuesday “a lot of us would be surprised if it passed by July Fourth.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/99/2c/cdebfe964ae197e6a1e4b0b7c79b/congress-tax-cuts-40899.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:41:15.699171

(June 12, 2025) – JetZero has announced a $4.7 billion investment for a production facility at Piedmont Triad International Airport (PTI) in Greensboro, North Carolina, with plans to create more than 14,500 jobs.

This news stands as the largest job announcement in North Carolina’s history.

The company and the state will work closely together to create customized workforce development and training programs, including through North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University and its College of Engineering (COE), which is the nation’s No. 1 producer of African American graduates in engineering and whose Department of Mechanical Engineering offers an aerospace option for undergraduate students.

This fall, N.C. A&T also will enroll its first B.S. in AI students. The only degree of its kind in North Carolina, it offers two concentrations: Advanced AI Systems, offered through the COE, and Applied AI in the College of Science and Technology.

“Today’s announcement from JetZero is an enormous win for everybody in the Piedmont Triad Region. It’s strong validation of the fact that we have become gravitational as a region for the aviation industry, for advanced manufacturing and for new partnerships,” said Chancellor James R. Martin II, who was on hand for the announcement. “We worked together as a region and state to attract JetZero, and its major new presence here will have significant impact, as well as help attract other new businesses for the Triad.”

“In a joint effort with Guilford Technical Community College and other colleges in the region, we’re excited to move forward into implementing a customized program that will set Jet Zero up for workforce onboarding success here in North Carolina,” said John Loyack, vice president of economic development for the North Carolina Community College System.

The JetZero factory will be located on PTI property, and will house production for the company’s commercial all-wing design airplane, the Z4. The facility, designed to be a “factory of the future,” will be fully digital and artificial intelligence-driven to outpace legacy original equipment manufacturers by ramping up faster, cutting unit costs, boosting quality and hardening supply chain.

JetZero’s headquarters will officially move from Long Beach, California, to Greensboro once the site is operational. The company plans to break ground on the facility in the first half of 2026.

The company’s Z4 planes are equipped with seating for 250 passengers, at up to 50% better fuel efficiency than today’s commercial tube and wing jets. The company plans to have its first commercial airplanes delivered by the early 2030s.

“I am thrilled to welcome JetZero and its 14,000 good-paying jobs and unprecedented innovation to Guilford County,” said Gov. Josh Stein. “From first in flight to now the future of flight, North Carolina and our skilled workforce are soaring.”

North Carolina is uniquely positioned to support Jet Zero’s growth, with a plentiful and skilled labor force of 5.5 million, and more than 49,000 engineers. Additionally, the state is the nation's leading manufacturing workforce in the Southeast, and with more than 30,000 STEM degrees awarded annually — the state provides a strong, sustainable talent pipeline for years to come.

“North Carolina offers the ideal combination of talent, infrastructure, and forward-thinking leadership to support our mission to reshape aviation,” said Tom O’Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero. “This facility is a critical milestone in bringing our all-wing Z4 to market. I applaud the leadership of Gov. Josh Stein and his team as well as the leadership of the North Carolina General Assembly, and a whole host of local leaders and organizations for working with us to bring JetZero to North Carolina, the birthplace of aviation.”

Additionally, North Carolina provides an attractive business climate for companies like JetZero. Ranked by CNBC as a top three state for business for five consecutive years,, the state has the lowest corporate tax rate at 2.25% and falling%, and a cost of living 5% below the national average. Well aligned with JetZero's commitment to sustainability, North Carolina also offers low cost of energy and has a bipartisan approach to renewable energy leadership and sustainability.

“North Carolina is one of the top eight states in the nation in research funding and expenditures, but we rank considerably lower in converting research into local gross domestic product,” said Martin. “Through partnerships with key companies like JetZero and clustering around industries like aviation, we will significantly accelerate impact in converting research into GDP and keeping innovation in North Carolina rather than seeing it move to other states.”

“This announcement is a testament to North Carolina’s growing reputation as a magnet for aerospace innovation and top-tier STEM talent,” said Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. “With our rapidly growing population and dynamic workforce, we're attracting industry leaders to create quality jobs that will strengthen our local economy and communities across the state.”

The JetZero facility will create thousands of direct advanced manufacturing and engineering jobs, and indirect and induced jobs via suppliers and services providers. Jobs offered at the facility will have average wages above $89,000 per year. Additionally, becoming the next aerospace hub in the U.S. will create significant opportunities for North Carolina students, from high school and community college graduates to degree holders from the state’s higher education system.

“This is a pivotal point for our region,” said Alfredo Romero, Ph.D., Department of Economics chair at A&T’s Willie A. Deese College of Business and Economics. “It’s going to make the Triad a major player in advanced manufacturing, a major player in clean technology, and it will boost our economy for decades to come.”

The nation’s largest historically Black university for 11 consecutive years, A&T prepares students to advance the human condition and facilitate economic growth in North Carolina and beyond. As part of this mission, the university has played a critical role in attracting global manufacturing companies such as Boom Supersonic, Honda, Corning, Merck, Toyota and Apple to the region and state.

“North Carolina A&T is at the epicenter of these efforts in the Piedmont Triad. Like JetZero, we are future focused and driven by innovation. JetZero is changing air travel, A&T is changing higher education,” said Martin. “We are leading in the development of a lucrative technology ecosystem in the Triad that will benefit JetZero as well as other advanced manufacturing, aviation and space technology businesses.

“I look forward to the outstanding opportunities that our graduates, our faculty researchers and our community will have with JetZero and to continuing to build a collaborative relationship with our new neighbors as we welcome them to Greensboro.”",https://www.ncat.edu/news/2025/06/jetzero-aircraft-in-hangar.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:46:50.206391

Hydrogen UK’s head of policy and analysis, Brett Ryan, said: We welcome today’s announcement on hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure.
Hydrogen networks are essential for a secure and resilient hydrogen sector, whilst ensuring sufficient energy storage capacity will be critical to energy security and affordability during the energy transition.
Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, said: This announcement is a key piece of the puzzle and represents very welcome government support to galvanise the UK’s regional hydrogen hubs.
It’s a vital step forward on the UK’s journey to becoming a clean energy superpower.","Thousands of clean energy jobs will be created in Britain’s industrial heartlands as the government confirms over £500 million for hydrogen infrastructure today, as part of the Plan for Change to invest in Britain’s future as a clean energy superpower.

The government has confirmed that the spending review allocated landmark new funding to create the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, connecting hydrogen producers with vital end users, including power stations and industry for the first time.

This major infrastructure boost will help deliver clean energy while creating thousands of skilled jobs in industrial regions such as Merseyside, Teesside and the Humber, as well as in the supply chain. This will ensure communities across the country feel the benefits of Britain’s renewal while reducing reliance on volatile international fossil fuel markets.

Today’s announcement also follows confirmation in the Spending Review that the government is creating thousands of clean energy jobs across the country, with 10,000 jobs to be created at Sizewell C in Suffolk, a new fusion reactor to be built on the site of an old power station in Nottinghamshire, up to 3,000 jobs created through the small modular reactor programme, and funding to kickstart the Acorn project in Scotland and the Viking project in the Humber.

This investment builds on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

This will support manufacturing sectors likely to require hydrogen like iron, steel, glass, chemicals and ceramics – and forms part of government’s long-term plan to invest in and secure the country’s industrial future, with more detail expected in the upcoming Infrastructure Strategy.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

We are investing over half a billion pounds in our industrial heartlands to deliver jobs and energy security for Britain. By building hydrogen networks, we are securing homegrown energy that will power British industry for generations to come.

This will bring in the investment needed across the country to deliver our Plan for Change by unlocking clean energy and growth in our local economies.

The funding will unlock hydrogen’s unique role in Britain’s energy system, where it can decarbonise industrial sectors including refineries and heavy transport, while providing long-term energy storage that can be deployed during peak demand periods.

The funding also enables progress on supporting low carbon hydrogen production through continued Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), building on the success of the First Hydrogen Allocation Round which saw 11 projects being allocated over £2 billion in government funding.

Hydrogen UK’s head of policy and analysis, Brett Ryan, said:

We welcome today’s announcement on hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure. Hydrogen networks are essential for a secure and resilient hydrogen sector, whilst ensuring sufficient energy storage capacity will be critical to energy security and affordability during the energy transition. We look forward to working with the government as we continue to deliver hydrogen’s role in reaching net zero and ensuring our energy security.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, said:

This announcement is a key piece of the puzzle and represents very welcome government support to galvanise the UK’s regional hydrogen hubs. By investing in transport and storage infrastructure, the government is rightly joining the dots, connecting already supported hydrogen production with end users across power and industry.

This strategic thinking builds on the strength of our established industrial regions and supported clusters, unlocking clean energy potential while creating skilled jobs in places such as Merseyside, Teesside and the Humber. It’s a vital step forward on the UK’s journey to becoming a clean energy superpower.

Hydrogen has already attracted £400 million of private sector investment in towns and cities such as Milford Haven in Wales and High Marnham in Nottinghamshire, and government support will help create thousands of jobs in the sector, including roles for apprentices, graduates and technically trained professionals, such as engineers, welders, skilled construction workers, pipefitters and operations specialists.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/684afd9c31f1fc7d0801aba9/s960_GFX2506-039-hydrogen_funding-govuk.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:31:19.180243

Clean energy is one of the S2J2 plan’s flagship industry clusters, alongside circular manufacturing and sustainable agriculture, and is projected to generate over 70,000 new jobs and $10 billion in clean energy investment by 2045.
North Valley THRIVE, here in the northernmost part of the Valley, is helping design our own clean energy future.
Kern County has long leveraged energy infrastructure investments into the community and is embracing clean energy as an integral part of future economic development.
The benefits of clean energy, along with the energy itself, should be delivered to the communities that host the energy infrastructure.","California’s clean energy policies are among the most ambitious in the world. Under SB 100, the state must achieve 100% zero-carbon electricity sales by 2045—requiring a massive buildout of new energy generation, supporting infrastructure, and clean fuel technologies. To meet these goals, California will need to more than quadruple its clean electricity supply, modernize its electric grid, and repurpose land and industrial assets at an unprecedented scale.

The San Joaquin Valley (SJV) is central to California’s clean energy transition, with abundant solar and biomass resources, an existing industrial base, skilled labor, academic institutions, major transportation corridors, and transmission infrastructure. These advantages position the region to lead on multiple clean energy fronts—from power generation to fuels and manufacturing—and a new opportunity to address longstanding disparities in air quality, investment, and economic mobility.

But the speed and scale of the energy buildout will depend not only on technical readiness or increased transmission capacity, but on something more fundamental: public confidence that these investments will deliver real, lasting value to local communities. As evidenced by CATF’s recent work in New England, social acceptance is emerging as a make-or-break factor for energy development across the county. A recent study found that, according to project developers, community opposition and restrictive local ordinances as a leading cause of project delays and cancellations. California is seeing these dynamics, with six counties—including several in the Valley—adopting restrictions on wind or solar development.

Energizing the transition in the San Joaquin Valley

The SJV is uniquely positioned to benefit from state policies driving the clean energy transition, and statewide analyses have underscored the SJV’s potential to host significant solar, wind, and transmission infrastructure crucial for meeting California’s climate goals.

Yet, the region also grapples with substantial challenges, including strained water resources, transitioning agricultural lands, a commodity-based economy that delivers few, quality jobs for its residents, and concentrated air and water pollution that have disproportionately impacted its communities. As agriculture and oil—two of its historic economic pillars—undergo transformative shifts, clean energy investments present an opportunity to drive economic growth, create high-quality jobs, and address long-standing inequities if the right level of strategic investments are made in the region.

Over the course of 2023 and 2024, CATF and our project team engaged local governments, community leaders, subject matter experts, and state agencies to explore what a clean energy future might look like in the SJV. The goal was to support the region in proactively shaping this transition—identifying preferred technologies, economic development strategies, and community benefit models that reflect both local priorities and statewide goals. This work aimed to strengthen the foundation for long-term success by supporting communities to see themselves as partners and drivers of the clean energy economy, rather than just hosts. CATF convened multiple knowledge-sharing sessions, supported by detailed quantitative modeling from RAND Corporation, with facilitated discussion on the tradeoffs and opportunities of various clean energy pathways. Discussions were grounded in a set of community-defined clean energy objectives that emphasized equity, high road jobs, wealth creation, public health, and building on existing assets.

We believe that a collaborative, integrated approach to planning for a clean energy future can guide clean energy and economic development investments that result in meaningful and transformative change for the region. This work tested that approach – and now, a year after we wrapped our facilitated engagement, we have more evidence to support that theory holds true.

Here, we highlight the progress and momentum local community leaders have spearheaded over the last year, and a look at what comes next.

Building the foundation for California jobs first

The economic development strategies, technology pathways, and community benefit models identified through CATF’s engagement in the SJV directly informed three major regional economic plans under California Jobs First (formerly the Community Economic Resilience Fund). California Jobs First is a $450 million state initiative aimed at empowering regions across the state to develop their own investment plans for building inclusive, climate-resilient economies. Much like the CATF-led effort, the California Jobs First process emphasized proactive planning, scenario modeling, and community-defined priorities—including high-road job creation, equitable investment, and coordinated permitting.

The S2J2 plan —representing Fresno, Madera, Tulare, and Kings counties—placed clean energy and fuels as a core part of its economic recovery strategy. The plan identifies energy as a foundational driver for regional revitalization, recognizing that the Valley is not just a site for deployment, but a place where clean energy innovation, development, and business activity across the clean energy value chain can be anchored. Clean energy is one of the S2J2 plan’s flagship industry clusters, alongside circular manufacturing and sustainable agriculture, and is projected to generate over 70,000 new jobs and $10 billion in clean energy investment by 2045.

Our region is poised to add 29 GW of clean energy electricity capacity by 2045, and the S2J2 Plan outlines strategies for how to include our local economy and communities as participants and benefactors of that economic growth.

Ashley Swearengin, President & CEO, CVCF

The North Valley Thrive Plan – representing San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Merced counties – focuses on developing a high-road economy with four priority sectors: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, carbon management, and the circular bioeconomy. An organized approach to community benefits became a priority for the region, informed by the guiding principles established in the Valley wide effort.

Many of us in the Central Valley are taking on big opportunities, buoyed by the California Jobs First initiative. North Valley THRIVE, here in the northernmost part of the Valley, is helping design our own clean energy future. The timing of our collaboration with CATF was perfect – it informed our strategic planning and continues to shape our ambitious vision for clean energy. Beyond the thought partnership, we connected with a community of like-minded colleagues that were also reconciling resident voice and the needs of business and the agriculture community with the once-in-a-generation opportunity of this work.

Eric Serrato, Director North Valley Thrive & Executive Director, Merced County Workforce Development Board

Kern County’s Regional Plan focuses on three industries to leverage for economic development: clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and agriculture. Kern County has long leveraged energy infrastructure investments into the community and is embracing clean energy as an integral part of future economic development.

Advocating for community-determined community benefits

Clean energy infrastructure and investment can bring a range of positive local impacts – cleaner air, a more reliable grid, tax revenue, and jobs. Community benefits, formalized through signed agreements or other programs, can further boost these positive impacts, particularly for the host communities who may not always directly or tangibly feel the broader benefits. Additionally, well organized community benefits and trusted relationships between project developers and host communities can provide something incredibly valuable in an evolving project landscape – certainty. As an incentive to developers and clean energy proponents, projects with community partnerships and local acceptance stand the greatest chance of success.

During CATF’s engagement, SJV leaders identified lasting community benefits as a cornerstone to the clean energy transition and developed a set of guiding principles for projects. For too long in the Valley, the benefits of agricultural and fossil fuel industries have not been distributed equitably, and have left behind a legacy of environmental degradation, public health concerns, and insufficient local economic development. SJV leaders envision a different reality for clean energy, one where community benefits are a pre-requisite for all proposed projects, are equally experienced by all communities, and are determined by communities. Implementing this vision requires 1) intensive on-the-ground community engagement by trusted local organizers, and 2) close coordination among local governments. Momentum is already building.

In Western Fresno County, the non-profit Rural Communities Rising (RCR) formed in 2024 in response to the energy deployment potential identified by CATF and in anticipation of 200,000 acres of idle or fallowed agricultural lands that will be transitioned to utility-scale solar, battery storage, and green hydrogen facilities. RCR is a non-profit dedicated to connecting the area’s rural, historically underserved communities to collaboratively navigate the opportunities and significant changes brought by clean energy development. RCR is putting forward a new model aimed at developing robust community benefit agreements directly with impacted communities and streamlining and providing support for desirable clean energy projects.

Among others on our Fresno County team, I participated in the San Joaquin Valley engagement process sponsored by CATF in 2023-2024. This process not only produced a very valuable report we continue to use and share. It generated knowledge and conviction we needed to establish and grow Rural Communities Rising as an authentic self-determined community voice, organized to support the timely and efficient development of clean energy projects with community benefit agreements based on impacted community needs and project partnerships.

Felipe Perez, Board President, Rural Communities Rising

The Central Valley Community Foundation (CVCF) is another leader on community benefits in the Valley, as evidenced by a robust community benefits framework established in the S2J2 plan. The framework laid out by the S2J2 coalition recognizes that the typical approaches to community benefits have not been sufficient to “break cycles of economic extraction and improve the region’s socioeconomic, health, and wellbeing.” Their envisioned framework builds off the guiding principles for community benefits developed by CATF and local leaders. Their framework emphasizes capturing benefits through a consistent approach across the valley, with clear and specific requirements for developers, and distributing those benefits in an equitable and inclusive manner.

Delivering the promise – what comes next?

The most significant barrier to expanding clean energy capacity – and realizing the associated economic and community benefits – is the transmission infrastructure needed to move generated power to users across the grid. Not only does California have an aging grid that needs to be upgraded or replaced, but entirely new transmission infrastructure is urgently needed to meet growing electricity demand and connect new resources to the grid.

Yet that new infrastructure comes with a hefty price tag that directly impacts ratepayers, with no guarantee of local benefits or reduced energy rates for the communities hosting the energy. CAISO’s 2024 20-Year Outlook identified $46 to $63 billion of new high-voltage transmission to achieve the state’s SB 100 goal. Despite being one of the most productive regions for energy in the country, the SJV, along with the rest of the state, have some of the highest electricity rates in the country, with rates increasing quickly in recent years. Innovative models are needed to finance and build infrastructure while both protecting ratepayers and delivering local benefits to where the energy is both generated and connected into the grid.

In 2024, CATF and Net Zero California (NZC) commissioned research to evaluate whether alternative transmission financing tools such as bonds, loans, and public-private partnerships can lower costs, mitigate ratepayer impacts, and accelerate grid modernization. Our research suggests that adopting a public-private partnership approach could deliver considerable savings, potentially reducing costs by up to $3 billion annually, or around $123 billion over 40 years. Such an idea is gaining traction with recent legislation at the state level developed out of CATF’s findings, including in AB 825 (Petrie-Norris). Other models include establishing a Clean Energy Infrastructure Authority as envisioned in SB 254 (Becker) as part of the recent CA Senate’s energy affordability package, and SB 330 (Padilla) which would authorize the Governor to establish one or more transmission infrastructure pilot projects that would achieve ratepayer savings.

Other innovative approaches to financing that bring the benefits back to host communities are in the works. In March of 2024, PG&E announced efforts to raise $1 billion in funding for transmission infrastructure investments across northern and central California by leasing segments of its line to Citizens Energy – a non-profit that has played a role in energy ventures since 1979. Under the model, Citizens Energy provides money to lease a segment of the line, guaranteeing them a rate of return similar to the utility. However, as a non-profit they reinvest 50% of the profits back into the impacted communities with programs and projects specifically targeted at expanding clean energy access to low-income communities. Citizens Energy has previously taken stake in two major transmission lines in California, the Sunrise Powerlink and Sycamore-Peñasquitos line, both developed by SDG&E. Profits from those programs went to building a community solar facility and expanding access to electric vehicle infrastructure in impacted communities.

The benefits of clean energy, along with the energy itself, should be delivered to the communities that host the energy infrastructure. These projects can be integrated explicitly into some of the region’s biggest projects, as well as municipal and community scale projects.

Modeled on success

The progress over the last year was ignited by a proactive and coordinated effort to bring the region together around shared challenges and opportunities. It is a theory of change we believe will continue to prove successful, but only because it was built on a foundation of visionary local leadership and communities who are open to embracing change when tied to real, local benefits. Still, this is only the beginning.

While the SJV has its own unique circumstances, the lessons learned here hold value far beyond. This model offers a replicable blueprint for regions and states across the country who are facing a similar inflection point. Those who engage early, leveraging the clean energy development in alignment with long term community goals, will be the best positioned to lead and benefit from the transition ahead.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24180907/san-joaquin-valley-stanislaus-ca-web.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:31:24.315541

Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation.

Res. 87, “Joint Resolution providing congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ‘California State Motor Vehicle and Engine Pollution Control Standards; Heavy-Duty Vehicle and Engine Emission Warranty and Maintenance Provisions; Advanced Clean Trucks; Zero Emission Airport Shuttle; Zero-Emission Power Train Certification; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision’”; (2) H.J.

These bipartisan measures prevent California’s attempt to impose a nationwide electric vehicle mandate and to regulate national fuel economy by regulating carbon emissions. Because of the joint resolutions I signed today, California’s Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Omnibus Low NOX programs are fully and expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act and cannot be implemented.

Preemption of these programs is essential to preserving the Constitution’s allocation of power both among the States and between the States and the Federal Government. It is the Federal Government, not States, that should establish vehicle emissions standards given the inherently interstate nature of air quality; a patchwork of State vehicle regulations on this subject is unworkable. Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation.

As the Congress’s joint resolutions make clear, California’s attempts to impose an electric vehicle mandate, regulate national fuel economy, and regulate greenhouse gas emissions are not eligible for waivers of preemption under section 209 of the Clean Air Act. This provision of the Clean Air Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to grant waivers to California to address only compelling and extraordinary localized issues. It can never again be misused to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which inherently do not have localized effects, much less compelling and extraordinary local effects, or vehicle emissions across the Nation.

Under the Congressional Review Act, the EPA cannot approve any future waivers that are “substantially the same” as those disapproved in the joint resolutions. The core of the waivers at issue are their authorization of California to regulate greenhouse gas and NOX emissions from internal combustion engines and to impose what amounts to an electric vehicle mandate across the Nation. Accordingly, the joint resolutions prohibit the EPA from approving future waivers for California that would impose California’s policy goals across the entire country and violate fundamental constitutional principles of federalism, ending the electric vehicle mandate for good.",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:35:11.823987

NASA and the European Copernicus Climate Change Service also rated May 2025 as the second-warmest May on record, behind only 2024. Data from the Japan Meteorological Agency and Berkeley Earth were not available at the time of this writing. May 2025 was only the second month in the last 23 months for which the global-average surface air temperature was not more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service. Prior to the past 23 months, only five months (January-March 2016 and January-February 2020) had previously been above that level.

Global land areas had their second-warmest May on record in 2025, and global oceans also had their second-warmest May, according to NOAA. Asia and South America had their third-warmest May on record; North America its sixth-warmest; Africa, its seventh-warmest; Europe, Oceania, and the Antarctic region had a warmer-than-average May, but their May temperature did not rank among the 10 warmest Mays on record. Northern Hemisphere snow cover during May 2025 was the 14th-lowest since 1967.

According to NOAA, the year-to-date-period (Jan-May) has been the second-warmest on record for the globe, behind only 2024. NOAA gave a >99.9% chance that 2025 would wind up as a top-five warmest year on record; a 23% chance of it being the second-warmest year on record; and a less than 1% chance of being the warmest year on record.

Second warmest spring on record globally and in the contiguous U.S.

During meteorological spring (March-May) in the Northern Hemisphere in 2025, the globe had its second-warmest such period on record. The global land-only surface temperature during March-May was the highest on record

The springtime contiguous U.S. average temperature was 3.2°F (1.8°C) above average, making it the second-warmest spring in the 131-year record. North Carolina recorded its second-warmest spring, while Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and Virginia each matched or exceeded their third-warmest spring on record.

During May, the average temperature in the contiguous U.S. ranked in the warmest third of historical Mays extending back to 1895. Alabama had its wettest May on record, while Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont each recorded their second wettest.

U.S. tornadoes in May numbered 333, with 16 being EF2 or stronger. The preliminary total of 1,113 U.S. tornadoes observed from January 1 to June 9 ranks as the third-highest year-to-date total since 2010, behind 2011 (1,736) and 2024 (1,175). May had 27 tornado deaths in the U.S., bringing the tornado death toll for the year so far to 62.

Neutral conditions (neither La Niña nor El Niño) prevail

The weak La Niña conditions in the Eastern Pacific that began in December ended in March, and neutral conditions are now present, NOAA reported in its June monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. ENSO is a recurring ocean-and-atmosphere pattern that warms and cools the eastern tropical Pacific through El Niño and La Niña events that last from one to three years. According to NOAA’s June forecast, ENSO-neutral conditions are likely (82% chance) through August 2025, but we may flip into a La Niña event during the coming Northern Hemisphere winter, with a 41% chance of La Niña and a 48% chance of ENSO-neutral conditions prevailing during the December-February period. For the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season (August-September-October), the May 19 forecast from the Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate and Society called for a 31% chance of La Niña, a 54% chance of ENSO-neutral, and a 15% chance of El Niño. El Niño conditions tend to suppress Atlantic hurricane activity through an increase in wind shear, but La Niña conditions tend to have the opposite effect.

While El Niño events often last only one year (usually from northern fall to northern spring, as in 2023-24), La Niña events often restrengthen or recur across two or even three years in a row, as was the case from mid-2020 to early 2023. Over the last two decades (2005-2024), the peak three months of hurricane season have included five El Niño periods, seven La Niña periods, and eight neutral periods.

Arctic sea ice: 7th-lowest May extent on record

Arctic sea ice in May 2025 had the seventh-lowest extent in the 47-year satellite record, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, or NSIDC. The Arctic had its fourth-warmest May on record in 2025. A record heat wave in Greenland during May caused unprecedented melting of the island’s ice sheet (see skeet above). According to Friederike Otto of the World Weather Attribution group, without human-caused climate change, such an event would have been “basically impossible”.

Antarctic sea ice extent in May was the fifth-lowest in the 47-year satellite record. The Antarctic had above-average temperatures in May that did not rank in the top ten warmest Mays.

The person said the White House directive was communicated largely to agencies over the phone to avoid creating a paper trail.
The White House strategy is to delay or block funds now, then craft an additional rescissions package later in the year that would make such cuts permanent.
That means the deferrals package strategy is likely the start of a significant and questionable push to expand executive power, said Carlile, the former OMB associate director.","The architect of the freeze directive, OMB Director Russ Vought, has long lamented the limits placed on the president’s ability to direct federal spending. His latest gambit — first reported by E&E News — appears designed to test those boundaries.

The agencies targeted by the newest freeze include the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation and the departments of Interior and Health and Human Services. E&E News granted anonymity to the two people familiar with the strategy so they could speak freely without fear of reprisal from the Trump administration.

OMB’s targets include NSF research and education programs that operate using funding leftover from 2024. Also on the list are tens of millions of dollars for national park operations as well as more than $100 million in science spending at NASA, which includes climate research.

While the president has some measure of control over how federal agencies spend their money, the power of the purse lies primarily with Congress under the U.S. Constitution. Put another way: Lawmakers set the budget.

Vought is trying to turn that principle on its head.

The order to freeze some funding at more than a dozen agencies comes in advance of a budget spending “deferrals” package that the White House plans to send Congress. Spending deferrals allow the executive branch to temporarily prevent authorized dollars from going out the door — but only if lawmakers sign off on the move.

Freezing the spending before making that request seems to fly in the face of Congress’ constitutional power and the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, said Joseph Carlile, former associate director at OMB in the Biden administration.

“There is a right, a legal way, for the administration to rescind things and I guess they’re pursuing this because they don’t have their stuff together or don’t care about the law,” said Carlile, who also worked previously on budgetary oversight on the House Appropriations Committee for 13 years.

“This is consistent with an administration that believes that they have broader powers around budget and spending than any other administration has ever been able to find,” Carlile added.

White House officials did not deny the new strategy when asked about it. Rather, they described it as a way to lock in spending cuts prescribed by the Department of Government Efficiency, a cost-cutting outfit championed by Trump donor and entrepreneur Elon Musk.

Yet the White House has worked to keep the effort quiet, said one person in the administration with direct knowledge of the strategy. The person said the White House directive was communicated largely to agencies over the phone to avoid creating a paper trail.

Vought has said repeatedly he disagrees with the impoundment act, a Nixon-era law that limits the president’s ability to block spending for political reasons. Democrats and legal scholars have said Trump already has violated the law.

“We’re not in love with the law,” Vought told CNN in an interview on June 1.

The separate $9.4 billion rescissions package that the House approved Thursday would permanently cut funding for NPR and PBS as well as foreign aid. Vought has said he expects to send more rescissions packages to Congress.

Vought’s multipronged strategy also is likely to include a “pocket rescissions” strategy, by which the White House intentionally runs out the clock near the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year. If the president introduces a recissions package then, Congress has a limited time to act — and if it does not do so, the funds slated for elimination are automatically canceled.

The White House may use the pocket rescissions strategy if the $9.4 billion rescissions package does not pass both chambers of Congress, the administration person said. And it could pursue another pocket rescissions strategy centered on Labor Department spending.

The deferrals package is a third strategy — and it comes ahead of an expected congressional fight on lifting the debt ceiling before the end of the summer. It would essentially pause or significantly slow funding intentionally, until it can be crafted into a separate pocket rescissions package that can run down the clock and be made permanent.

Under the impoundment law, the White House can ask Congress to defer some of its budget spending authority “to provide for contingencies” or “to achieve savings” through efficiency gains. The White House is planning to argue that hitting the debt ceiling — a borrowing limit imposed and periodically raised by Congress — is such a contingency.

The nation is expected to reach the debt ceiling by the end of August.

The White House strategy is to delay or block funds now, then craft an additional rescissions package later in the year that would make such cuts permanent.

“OMB is hard at work making the DOGE cuts permanent using a wide range of tools we have at our disposal under the ICA [Impoundment Control Act] and within the President’s authority— just like the first rescissions package that was sent up to the Hill this week,” OMB spokesperson Rachel Cauley said in a statement Monday. “As a part of that process, we are constantly checking in with agencies to assess their unobligated balances.”

Fight could land at Supreme Court

The latest effort may be more comprehensive than other blocks on federal funding that Vought has enacted, according to the person with direct knowledge of the move.

It could also be a “trial balloon” to see whether the White House can unilaterally block future spending if Trump administration officials object, said another person at an agency that would be affected.

The move appears to be a significant escalation of Vought’s efforts to test the boundaries of the Impoundment Control Act.

Vought’s strategy is to rely on Section 1013 of the act, which grants the president the authority to freeze spending if the administration explains its actions to lawmakers. The act originally allowed one chamber of Congress to reject presidential deferrals, a power that courts rejected. As a result, the law was amended in 1987 to limit how long presidents could delay spending and under what conditions.

“It does not appear that any measures to disapprove a deferral have been considered since these amendments were made,” the Congressional Research Service said in a February report on the impoundment law.

Vought has long argued that impounding some congressionally appropriated funding is constitutional, and he has said he wants the Supreme Court to validate what would be a significant weakening of congressional oversight of the federal budget.

The deferrals package the White House plans to send Congress would temporarily stop agencies from spending unobligated funds that remain at the end of the government’s fiscal year on Sept. 30.

The broad-based deferrals package is highly unusual and could be part of his strategy to take his fight for greater executive power to the Supreme Court, said Philip Joyce, a professor at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy and author of the book “The Congressional Budget Office: Honest Numbers, Power, and Policymaking.”

“It is a novel approach, but I think in the end, they really want this to go to the Supreme Court,” Joyce said. “They think they know how the Supreme Court is going to rule and once the Supreme Court opens the door, you know, it’s kind of high noon for the separation of powers, which is what they want.”

Last week, OMB officials reached out to federal agencies to tell them to enact the spending freeze. Some agency officials were “shocked” at the move, according to the administration official with direct knowledge of the plan.

The head of the National Science Foundation’s budget office didn’t know what to make of the directive, according to an email obtained by E&E News.

OMB is targeting the agency’s research and education “accounts for a deferral package,” NSF Budget Director Caitlyn Fife wrote last Friday in a note to top officials.

“I imagine you will all have questions, as do we,” she said. “However we are immediately focused on pulling the funds back to ensure there are no further commitments or obligations.”

An NSF official briefed on the spending freeze said offices relying on previous-year funding could see their “programs gutted.” The official also predicted that if OMB’s ploy succeeds, it will use deferrals to impound any congressionally directed spending the administration opposes.

That means the deferrals package strategy is likely the start of a significant and questionable push to expand executive power, said Carlile, the former OMB associate director.

He said the White House is essentially seeking to subvert the Constitution, which grants Congress spending authority, in such an extreme way that it threatens the nation’s democratic structure.

“I think it upends a fundamental check and balance contemplated in our Constitution, and I don’t understand how you subordinate Congress’ power of the purse,” Carlile said.

Federal spending decisions are “a deal between the executive and the legislative branch as institutions,” he added. “And this all starts to unravel real quick if our budgetary framework really actually meant nothing.”",https://static.politico.com/a7/74/e1ee339245af81d2d0854de52756/house-budget-32899.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:35:14.381364

Thanks to President Trump and Congress’s restoration of the rule of law, the road is now clear to achieving a more competitive auto industry, happier consumers, and a freer society.","President Trump today signed three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval to overturn Biden administration Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waivers greenlighting California’s plans to ban sales of gas- and diesel-powered cars and trucks. This is wonderful news for motor vehicle consumers, the US auto industry, and all liberty-loving Americans.

Aided and abetted by the Obama and Biden administrations, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) was on its way to becoming the nation’s de facto Industrial Policy Czar for Climate and Cars. Moreover, California and its blue state allies were poised to exert cartel-like market power over the auto industry, increasing vehicle prices and decreasing consumer choices beyond their borders. By signing the CRA resolutions into law, President Trump ends an era of unlawful motor vehicle regulation, clearing the decks for a sea change in national policy.

Section 32919(a) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) preempts state laws and regulations “related to” fuel economy standards. As the first Trump administration’s One National Program (SAFE 1) Rule explained in painstaking detail, California’s tailpipe carbon dioxide (CO2) emission standards are “directly” (mathematically and physically) related to fuel economy standards, and the state’s zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates are “substantially” related. Consequently, EPCA 32919(a) expressly prohibits both policies.

Moreover, EPCA impliedly preempts California’s tailpipe CO2 standards because Congress authorized the Department of Transportation, not CARB, to regulate fuel economy. More pertinently, EPCA impliedly preempts California’s ZEV mandates because the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program by design protects automakers’ freedom to sell combustion engine vehicles.

Preemption statutes derive their authority from the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause (Maryland v. Louisiana, 1981). Such statutes also operate ab initio, voiding the prohibited or conflicting state policy from the moment it is adopted or enacted (Cabazon Band of Mission Indians v. Indio, 1982). EPCA turned California’s gas-car ban into a legal phantom, without force or effect, years before the Biden EPA agreed to grant a waiver for it under Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).

Biden EPA’s claim that it has no authority under the CAA to consider potential conflicts between California’s vehicle emissions program and EPCA is false. California requests EPA waivers precisely so that it and other states may incorporate CARB’s vehicle emission standards into their implementation plans (SIPs) for complying with national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). CAA Section 110(e) requires each SIP to “provide assurances” that nothing in it is “prohibited by any provision of Federal or State law.”

EPA is responsible for reviewing SIPs and approving or rejecting SIP elements. Therefore, when reviewing a waiver request under CAA 209(b), EPA may not lawfully ignore potential conflicts between CARB vehicle emission standards and other federal statutes. To repeat, EPCA expressly and impliedly prohibits California’s tailpipe CO2 standards and ZEV mandates.

President Trump’s signing of the CRA resolutions terminates a long-running bureaucratic power grab that has threatened to price millions of Americans out of the market for new cars, undermine US automakers’ competitiveness by forcing them to discontinue many of their top-selling models, and rob Americans of their freedom to purchase the types of vehicles that best meet their needs.

This investment aims to supercharge Britain’s leadership in fields such as artificial intelligence, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, and clean energy, while empowering local regions to drive innovation tailored to their strengths.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves will unveil this transformative funding in next week’s Spending Review, announcing a commitment to £22.5 billion annually by 2029/30. The funding will support breakthroughs ranging from next-generation medicines and long-lasting batteries to cutting-edge AI technologies, expected to create thousands of high-skilled jobs and deliver billions in economic returns.

“Britain is the home of science and technology. Through the Plan for Change, we are investing in Britain’s renewal to create jobs, protect our security against foreign threats and make working families better off,” said Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves.

A key feature of the plan is up to £500 million for local innovation across the UK. Through a new Local Innovation Partnerships Fund, regions will have the power to shape how R&D investment is spent based on local expertise and economic needs.

“Incredible and ambitious research goes on in every corner of our country… empowering regions to harness local expertise and skills for all of our benefit is at the heart of this new funding,” said Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle.

This means that cities and towns will now be in the driver’s seat when it comes to economic renewal, Liverpool will expand its life sciences sector to accelerate drug discovery, Northern Ireland will focus on defence technologies to strengthen national security and South Wales will invest in semiconductor design to power devices from smartphones to electric vehicles.

The new funding builds on the momentum from the Innovation Accelerator pilot, which saw regional partnerships drive real-world benefits. For example, Greater Manchester’s diagnostic accelerator developed faster, cheaper tests for heart, liver, and lung diseases, while Moonbility in the West Midlands applied AI to predict rail disruptions in real time.

Research and development is already a powerful economic engine in the UK, underpinning 3 million jobs. According to the government, every £1 invested in R&D returns up to £7 in economic benefit, and businesses receiving their first R&D grants see over 20 percent increases in jobs and revenue.

Alongside this, nearly £5 million will fund a new partnership between Manchester and Cambridge, linking two innovation hubs to attract business investment and share best practices globally.

Regional leaders are welcoming the funding as a game changer

“This is exactly how we turn our potential into progress. This investment backs regions to lead the way in the industries that will define the future,” “It will drive innovation that not only grows the economy but creates jobs, builds opportunity, improves health and changes lives.” said Richard Parker, Mayor of the West Midlands.

North East Mayor Kim McGuinness added

“This announcement boosts my mission to create new growth, new jobs and new opportunities… from the car industry and green energy to kitchen table innovations and our fast-emerging trailblazers in the space industry and AI.”

The BlueGreen Alliance’s brief concludes that the provisions in the House bill would put at risk nearly 300,000 direct manufacturing jobs in facilities supported by clean manufacturing tax credits, over one million indirect jobs down the supply chain, and nearly 643,000 induced jobs created as a result of the economic stimulus of the direct and indirect jobs.
Additionally, the brief finds that in several states the manufacturing sector is at the precipice of massive growth under the tax credits.
With the tax credits in place, New Mexico, Nevada, and Georgia could all see manufacturing employment grow more than 10%.
We hope the Senate will see reason and reverse these damaging provisions.” Justin Jackson BlueGreen Alliance (951) 214-9108 jjackson@bluegreenalliance.org","WASHINGTON, D.C., June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new research brief released today by the BlueGreen Alliance reveals that more than two million jobs across the manufacturing employment footprint are at risk if the budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives becomes law. The House bill introduces provisions that would effectively kill tax credits for clean and advanced manufacturing by making them unusable and sunsetting them early.

The BlueGreen Alliance’s brief concludes that the provisions in the House bill would put at risk nearly 300,000 direct manufacturing jobs in facilities supported by clean manufacturing tax credits, over one million indirect jobs down the supply chain, and nearly 643,000 induced jobs created as a result of the economic stimulus of the direct and indirect jobs.

“These numbers make it even more clear, if this bill becomes law, workers are the ones who will pay the price,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “As this administration blusters about its support for American manufacturing, this bill tells an extremely different story, openly selling out workers to pay for a billionaire tax break.”

Seven states—California, Georgia, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee, Arizona, and South Carolina—have more than 100,000 jobs at risk if the clean manufacturing tax credits are repealed. Notably, President Trump won five of those seven states with the greatest number of jobs at stake in the 2024 election.

Additionally, the brief finds that in several states the manufacturing sector is at the precipice of massive growth under the tax credits. With the tax credits in place, New Mexico, Nevada, and Georgia could all see manufacturing employment grow more than 10%. Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia could all see at least a 5% boost. Without the credits, that future is uncertain.

“The job-creating track record of the clean manufacturing tax credits is undeniable and the changes to them included in the House bill threatens all of that progress,” said BlueGreen Alliance Vice President of Manufacturing and Industrial Policy Ted Fertik. “Every bit of data shows clearly that repealing these credits will hurt working Americans. We hope the Senate will see reason and reverse these damaging provisions.”

As this year was Intersolar’s first regional show in the Midwest, Letizia said there were two things she learned that make Midwest Expo different from her experience in other markets.
Championed by environmental justice advocates, the package evolved from the two past omnibus energy bills that helped catapult Illinois to the successful solar market it is today.
“I know a lot of people are probably wondering why it didn’t pass,” Kavi Chintham, Vote Solar’s Illinois campaigns manager, said during the Illinois session, which outlined what the omnibus would have achieved.","Midwest Solar Expo held its first conference in Chicago June 9 to June 11 since it was acquired by Intersolar and Energy Storage North America last year, marking Intersolar’s expansion into the Midwest.

This year’s event included 67 exhibitors, a slight bump from the reported number in previous years, and an estimated 900 people were expected to attend the event.

Beckie Kier, Intersolar and Energy Storage North American event director, told pv magazine USA their goal for year one is to support the regional market. “As that evolves,” she said, “we will evolve the conference program and then in supporting the strong exhibit hall to provide the solutions that the attendees need.”

The Midwest Solar Expo sheds light on the innovation occurring in the Midwest, but Candace Letizia, marketing director for Intersolar and Energy Storage North America, noted the “innovation extends beyond the technology that the industry is driving forward and also into the innovation that’s occurring within the workforce,” she said, and noted that the year’s Host Sponsor was labor group Powering Chicago, a partnership group between the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 134 and the Electrical Contractors’ Association (ECA) of Chicago and Cook County.

As this year was Intersolar’s first regional show in the Midwest, Letizia said there were two things she learned that make Midwest Expo different from her experience in other markets.

“The first,” she noted, “is that this ‘Midwestern hospitality’ is so true. What a great spirit this show has had,” Letizia said. “The atmosphere here has just been very collaborative and very approachable, which I find very refreshing as a northeasterner.”

Letizia said the other notable difference with the Midwest Expo is the demographic and range of professionals among its participants. The involvement from labor and union groups, she noted, is something she hasn’t seen as much of at other Intersolar shows.

Attendees extended from beyond Midwestern states, with people traveling from states such as Georgia, California, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. Frank Crandall, account representative for the Midwest and Canada at Enphase, told pv magazine USA that many of the sales reps attended the show because Midwestern states are in their sales territory.

The sessions included state policy recaps from this year’s legislative session. A theme emerged across these sessions when panelists discussed bills that were and were not successful, with panelists often discussing the involvement of groups outside solar and environmental groups as either something they had for successful legislation, or something they wish they had had for those that did not pass.

For example, Illinois recently failed to pass a powerful omnibus energy package that would have created a Storage for All program, a Solar Bill of Rights, virtual power plant programs and more. Championed by environmental justice advocates, the package evolved from the two past omnibus energy bills that helped catapult Illinois to the successful solar market it is today.

“I know a lot of people are probably wondering why it didn’t pass,” Kavi Chintham, Vote Solar’s Illinois campaigns manager, said during the Illinois session, which outlined what the omnibus would have achieved. “We need everyone to really be out there pushing for this omnibus package in the next session. Whatever session this comes up in again, whether it be the veto session or the spring — whenever — it can’t just be advocates.”

“It can’t just be industry, it can’t just be agencies,” Chintham said. “It really has to be everyone coming together and pushing for this because we understand the impacts on ratepayers and on companies that the that the RTO tightening has, that things like data centers coming into the state, those kind of impacts have. We understand that innately because we’re working on that every day, but legislators don’t necessarily understand that.”

“Sometimes they need to hear from a variety of people with different backgrounds in order to really understand the urgency of that,” she said.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/PXL_20250610_1933031912_polarr-1200x894.jpeg,N,,2025-06-12 23:50:36.152529

And the report says more job losses are likely under Republicans’ proposed spending bill.

Climate Power reports more than 90,000 clean energy jobs nationwide have been lost or stalled as a result of Trump administration policies and funding cuts. In Arizona, for example, battery company Kore Power in February scrapped plans for a $1.2 billion plant that would have brought 3,000 jobs to Buckeye. The company faced uncertainty over whether it would receive a federal loan it had been counting on to fund construction.

Now, Congress is considering a spending bill that proposes to end federal tax credits for clean energy projects that had been implemented under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Doing away with those incentives would further threaten clean energy jobs, the Climate Power report says.

“Arizona would see enormous and immediate impacts — projects being canceled or not commencing construction at all,” said Kristina Costa, a former Biden administration energy adviser.

Costa said the Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits helped create a solar and battery power boom in Arizona, with dozens of new projects announced over the last few years. If planned projects end up getting canceled, job losses would be just one concern, Costa said.

“You would also see rates for consumers rise as well because you have a basic supply and demand problem,” Costa said. “Arizona will continue to see increased load growth, but without new generation to meet that load, customers are going to end up paying more for electricity.”

Representatives for the Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the states’ lawsuit.","President Donald Trump on Thursday blocked a series of policies across the country promoting electric vehicles, and Washington state joined in a lawsuit attempting to thwart the moves.

Trump signed joint resolutions of Congress revoking a series of waivers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that allowed California to promote increased sales of EVs and the phasing out of gas-powered vehicles in the coming years.

In recent years, Washington and 15 other states, alongside the District of Columbia, crafted their own electric vehicle policies on the foundation of those waivers. So when Trump blocked California’s policy promoting electric vehicles, he also blocked similar policies for all these other states.

Minutes later, California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California asking for Trump’s actions to be declared unconstitutional. Trump is exerting undue pressure over states’ abilities to craft their own policies, Bonta said in his 42-page complaint.

“The Federal Government ran roughshod over federalism and separation of powers principles” in the way it has revoked these waivers, Bonta said.

Washington, Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont all signed onto the lawsuit as fellow plaintiffs against Trump, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin and the federal government.

How the waivers work

In 1967, Congress granted California the ability to set stronger clean air regulations than the federal government. But to enforce each of these rules, the state needs a waiver from the EPA. Other states have followed suit with California and adopted stricter standards of their own.

California used this system to set targets for increasing sales of EVs, with the goal of phasing out sales of new gas-powered cars entirely by 2035, and Washington set similar standards alongside other states. Commercial vans and trucks must also move toward electric and hybrid options, but Washington’s regulations don’t call for a full ban of gas vehicle sales in those categories.

What did Congress do?

Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate (alongside a few Democrats like Washington’s Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez) used the Congressional Review Act. This allows incoming presidential administrations to revoke regulations enacted by the previous one.

However, officials with the U.S. Government Accountability Office said this spring that these types of waivers aren’t covered by the Congressional Review Act.

Never before had Congress revoked one of California’s waivers.

What happens next?

California’s lawsuit fixates on the Congressional Review Act, arguing that the federal government may not use the law to revoke the waivers. At the same time, Bonta accuses Trump and the other defendants of violating the constitutional separation of powers, echoing a centuries-old warning from a famous French judge and philosopher Montesquieu:

“There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same body, or person of magistrates.”

Bonta continued: “Put simply, the Federal Government carried out an illegal playbook designed to evade lawful procedures that might prevent the ‘take down’ of disfavored California laws.”

The attorney general asked for the federal judge to declare the congressional resolutions void and reinstate the waivers.

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson issued a statement Thursday criticizing Trump’s latest push as shortsighted.

“The federal government’s attack on the state’s clean air authority is not only unlawful — it’s a direct threat to public health. Washington will work with our partner states to defend our right to set air quality and emissions standards,” Ferguson said.

Attorney General Nick Brown echoed the sentiment.

“Transportation is the single greatest contributor to greenhouse gas pollution in Washington, and our residents understand the transition to zero-emission vehicles is critical in this fight against climate change,” Brown said in a statement.

While the court considers this lawsuit, one of many against the Trump administration now mired in the legal process, Washington still has several options to encourage the transition away from gas-powered vehicles.

Lawmakers have said they can try to offer more rebates, expand charging infrastructure or grow access to public transportation.

JERA signed a sale and purchase agreement (SPA) for about two MMtpa from NextDecade Corp.’s Rio Grande LNG in Brownsville, Texas. The agreement is for train 5; NextDecade has yet to make an FID (final investment decision) on the fourth and fifth trains. The three-train first phase of the project is under construction. Rio Grande LNG holds a permit to export to FTA and non-FTA countries.

Another SPA involves around one MMtpa from Kimmeridge’s proposed Commonwealth LNG in Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana. In February the Department of Energy (DOE) granted the project a conditional permit to export to countries with no free trade agreement (FTA) with the U.S. Kimmeridge expects to make an FID in the third quarter of 2025 and start production 2029.

JERA also signed an SPA with Venture Global Inc.’s CP2 LNG in Cameron Paris, Louisiana, for approximately one MMtpa. The project recently started site work after completing clearance from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In March the DOE granted a conditional permit for CP2 LNG to export to non-FTA countries. The project has already secured authorization for its export volume when it received FTA approval April 2022.

Meanwhile Sempra’s Port Arthur LNG phase 2 in Jefferson County, Texas secured heads of agreement with JERA for about 1.5 MMtpa. Late last month the DOE granted Port Arthur LNG Phase a non-FTA permit, marking the resumption of the issuance of final orders for LNG export following the previous administration’s pause.

JERA also penned heads of agreement with Cheniere Energy Inc.’s Corpus Christi LNG and Sabine Pass LNG. Train 3 of Corpus Christi was recently commissioned. Sabine Pass LNG, in production since 2016, is planned for expansion; the expansion project has yet to reach an FID.

“The Agreements broaden JERA group's LNG portfolio and allow JERA Global Markets - the exclusive LNG optimizer and market access provider to JERA - to use its proven capability to better match supply-demand fluctuations, enhance cost competitiveness, and strengthen LNG supply stability across Asia in support of broader energy transition efforts”, JERA said in a press release.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who jointly announced the agreements with the companies in Washington, said in an online statement, “Today’s announcement of investments in American energy that will unlock nearly a quarter trillion dollars in U.S. GDP is a massive milestone and a bold demonstration of President Trump’s leadership”.

JERA said, “Through long-term offtake commitments, the Agreements are expected to support economic activity that could contribute approximately $200 billion to U.S. GDP and sustain 50,000 jobs annually, according to S&P Global analysis. The total value of these transactions also surpasses JERA’s cumulative equity investment in the United States, which currently stands at $6 billion”.

JERA Global chief executive and chair Yukio Kani commented, “After more than 15 months of strategic evaluation and commercial engagement, we are pleased to finalize the Agreements with U.S. suppliers, which offer unique flexibility and reliability - essential elements in our diversification strategy”.

“These agreements strengthen Japan’s energy security, reaffirm the U.S.’s leading role in the global LNG market, and support long-term sustainable economic development for both countries”, Kani added.

The resolutions wiped out EPA waivers granted to California and copycat states to require far more clean car sales than minimums set at the federal level.
“The Trump administration’s attack on clean air is breathtaking,” Weiser said in a statement Thursday.
The lawsuit is also trying to protect California and copycat laws requiring sharp cuts to nitrogen oxide pollution and clean sales targets for heavy-duty trucks.
We anticipate growing demand for EVs in Colorado regardless of what happens with federal attempts to remove state authority to enforce clean car rules.”","Colorado on Thursday joined California and other states in suing the EPA and President Donald Trump to preserve electric vehicle sales mandates meant to clean the air and cut greenhouse gases, after Trump signed Congressional resolutions that effectively canceled the programs.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and other attorneys general sued in federal district court for northern California, calling the Congressional resolutions an illegal abuse of national powers and an attack on the well-established Clean Air Act.

The resolutions wiped out EPA waivers granted to California and copycat states to require far more clean car sales than minimums set at the federal level. Colorado’s mandate says 82% of new cars offered for sale here must have zero emissions by model year 2032.

Trump signed the resolutions in a televised ceremony Thursday morning, saying, “We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate, once and for all.” Colorado and more than a dozen other states following California’s lead had adopted clean car minimums — as well as subsequent clean heavy truck minimums.

California has received dozens of EPA waivers over the years to more effectively attack smog in Los Angeles and other cities. The state has the largest new car market in the country, and with so many other well-populated states following California’s lead, their clean air policies dominate car industry economics.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and leaders from other states had already vowed to fight back.

“The Trump administration’s attack on clean air is breathtaking,” Weiser said in a statement Thursday. “Rolling back the federal Clean Air Act waivers through the illegal use of the Congressional Review Act is an assault on the authority of states, like Colorado, to adopt stronger tailpipe pollution limits than those set by the federal government. We’re in court to defend Colorado’s cost-effective clean car program, which was implemented to improve air quality, reduce harmful ozone pollution, and increase choices that Coloradans have when purchasing an electric vehicle.”

The Colorado Energy Office, which is overseeing many of the state’s greenhouse gas limits and electrification efforts, said the California waivers would need to be back in place if Colorado wanted to enforce its copycat targets. California’s target went slightly farther, extending the rising minimums through 2035 and saying all sales must be electric by then.

The states’ lawsuit claims the Congressional Review Act only allows Congress to overturn rules made by federal agencies, not state laws like the California and Colorado laws on electric vehicles. The lawsuit is also trying to protect California and copycat laws requiring sharp cuts to nitrogen oxide pollution and clean sales targets for heavy-duty trucks.

The EPA has in the past said congressional review does not apply to the waivers, Weiser and the attorneys general said.

“The federal government ran roughshod over federalism and separation of powers principles,” the lawsuit says. “In fact, the Congressional Review Act has never before been used in any context that resembles this one. It has certainly never been used, as it was here, to negate particular state laws.”

State leaders and environmental advocates want to cut both greenhouse gas emissions and the transportation pollution that contributes to toxic ozone, and they fear the rollbacks and a threatened erasure of federal EV tax credits will reverse years of clean air progress.

But conservatives who want more oil and gas drilling, and thought Democrats were interfering too much in the automobile markets, lauded Trump putting the finishing touches toward one of their longtime goals.

“One state’s overreach should never dictate how all Americans live, work, or drive,” said Congressional Western Caucus Vice Chair Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-California. “This bill sends a strong message that national standards should be set only in Washington, not in Sacramento.”

The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group said Trump “just delivered a major win for the American people by overturning California’s gas car ban and the state’s attempt to tell consumers what they can and can’t drive.”

Colorado drivers should look at where the praise is coming from, countered Travis Madsen, transportation analyst for the nonprofit clean energy group Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. “The petroleum industry will lose sales because of electrification, so they are interested in blocking or slowing down alternatives,” he said.

Colorado has a target of nearly 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030, and growth of EV sales has been on pace to reach that, supporters of the mandates say. Clean vehicle sales made up 26% of Colorado’s new light-duty car market in the first three months of 2025.

Most analysts are unsure if the major auto manufacturers have gone too far down the road toward EV fleets to scrap their changeover plans.

For Colorado, Madsen said, “Fortunately, we’ve built up significant momentum. Governor Polis and state leaders have done a great job making Colorado an attractive place to drive an electric vehicle. Colorado can and should continue to drive progress — although it would be a lot easier without these new obstacles the federal government is putting in our way.”

The state energy office said the Trump administration’s actions will not stop EV momentum, but could hurt consumer choices if some manufacturers pull back.

“Colorado drivers are clear: electric vehicles are here to stay, and demand will continue to grow,” CEO director Will Toor said in a statement. “Coloradans are purchasing EVs at a rate three to four times greater than that required by rules. We anticipate growing demand for EVs in Colorado regardless of what happens with federal attempts to remove state authority to enforce clean car rules.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP24331826974585.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:29:50.025618

While the clean energy industry scrambles to lobby for the credits to be included in the Senate’s version of the bill, Bloomberg BNEF analyzed how the cancellation of the credits would affect clean energy production in the US.
Without the tax credits, solar projects would decrease 5% and energy storage projects would dip 7% in the next 10 years.
And the potential cut of the tax credits would affect more than just clean energy capacity: Bloomberg BNEF’s analysis also warned of “negative effects on the US power system,” especially as energy demand grows due to data centers.
“The stakes are high, but with growing energy demand and investor pressure, there’s still time for Congress to course-correct and support bringing more electrons to the grid.”","Clean energy tax credits have bolstered widespread investment in renewable energy since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022. But President Trump has taken aim at them in his “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which passed the House of Representatives last month with cuts to key tax credits that apply to residential clean tech and clean energy production and investment.

While the clean energy industry scrambles to lobby for the credits to be included in the Senate’s version of the bill, Bloomberg BNEF analyzed how the cancellation of the credits would affect clean energy production in the US.

As stipulated in the version of the bill passed by the House, projects built more than 60 days after the bill is signed into law and that don’t start operating before 2029 would be ineligible for tax credits. According to Bloomberg BNEF’s analysis, these stipulations would create a “three-year rush to build new wind, solar, and storage projects followed by a major hangover in 2029” that would result in a 10% decrease in clean energy projects built by 2035.

Solar, wind, and storage technologies will each be impacted differently—the tax credit changes don’t apply to nuclear projects. Without the tax credits, solar projects would decrease 5% and energy storage projects would dip 7% in the next 10 years. General demand for those technologies would still exist, though at a lower level than it is today. Wind capacity, however, would be cut by a whopping 35%, “with no offshore wind additions post 2028,” Bloomberg NEF noted. Such a blow to wind technologies would be kicking them while they’re down: A considerable amount of offshore wind project production has stalled as a result of Trump’s executive orders.

And the potential cut of the tax credits would affect more than just clean energy capacity: Bloomberg BNEF’s analysis also warned of “negative effects on the US power system,” especially as energy demand grows due to data centers.

“Rapid load growth driven by data center demand will require either new generation, which this bill makes it harder to add,” Bloomberg BNEF’s analysis stated, “or higher capacity factors from existing power plants, which tend to be both more expensive and higher in greenhouse gas emissions.”

US energy demand is also being stressed by clean energy stakeholders who are currently meeting with Republican senators, urging them to protect the tax credits. Jon Powers, president of clean energy investment firm CleanCapital, told Tech Brew that in a meeting he attended with a senator on Capitol Hill, “someone...wanted to bring an AI data center to the state,” but told the senator “it wouldn’t be possible because there was not enough energy in their area to fulfill the data center’s demand.”

“Congress is now one chamber away from passing a law that would dramatically increase clean energy project risk, states would lose out on millions in investment, and ultimately cause previously announced projects and manufacturing plants to be canceled—making it more difficult to bring AI-critical data centers to fruition and jeopardizing our current infrastructure,” Powers said in an email. “The stakes are high, but with growing energy demand and investor pressure, there’s still time for Congress to course-correct and support bringing more electrons to the grid.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/2766c0ff01c0b343011d69b515ac2292ed67fa59-5719x3813.jpg?rect=0,405,5719,3002&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-06-12 23:33:06.375662

California was ready.

“We made a promise that if the president attempted to illegally interfere with our clean air standards, we’d hold him accountable in court,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a press briefing the same day. “Today, we are making good on that promise.”

Bonta filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California along with attorneys general from 10 states that follow California’s pioneering emissions standards. The complaint asks the court to declare that the resolutions “have no effect on the status or enforceability of state emissions control programs.”

The resolutions Trump signed repeal California’s landmark rule to ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035, along with two other rules passed as a result of clean air waivers granted by the Biden administration. The Republican-led Congress passed the resolutions using a tool called the Congressional Review Act—illegally, experts say—to block the state’s authority to ask the Environmental Protection Agency to grant waivers to enforce stricter standards.

“They said it couldn’t be done,” Trump said. “But boy, it’s had us tied up in knots for years.”

California’s authority to set stricter air pollution standards than the federal government dates back to the 1960s.

By the time the first national air-pollution regulations were enacted in 1967, California had already passed first-in-the-nation tailpipe standards to deal with the abundance of cars and people in Los Angeles that, combined with pollution-trapping mountains, perpetually shrouded the city in hazardous smog. Congress recognized the state’s “compelling and extraordinary circumstances,” both in having unique pollution challenges and expertise in controlling them, and directed the EPA to waive provisions barring states from passing stricter standards than those set by the federal government.

The EPA has granted California waivers in various forms more than 100 times since 1967.

When asked why the administration believes it has the right to repeal authority repeatedly granted to California under the Clean Air Act, EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said, “it’s Civics 101.”

Both chambers of Congress pass legislation and the president signs it into law, Vaseliou said. “This is nothing more than California throwing a temper tantrum because the American people don’t want the state’s terrible policies. The complaint lacks merit, and we look forward to a swift dismissal.”

No Legal Authority

The complaint charges the federal government with illegally using the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to attack California’s clean vehicles program. The Biden administration granted California three waivers to enforce that program, which includes the EV mandate to phase out sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035, as well as rules to move toward zero-emission trucks and heavy-duty vehicles.

Both the Republican-led House and Senate treated the waivers as rules so they could pass “resolutions of disapproval” and revoke the waivers, even though the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office had determined that the waivers are not rules and so are not subject to the CRA. The Senate parliamentarian, also a nonpartisan referee, later came to the same conclusion: Waivers are not rules.

“These waivers have never under any administration, Democrat or Republican, been considered rules that are subject to disapproval under the CRA,” Bonta said. “What we’re seeing is a thinly veiled attempt by the President to retaliate against California for choosing progress over regression.”

Just a few hours after Bonta spoke, Democratic California Sen. Alex Padilla, who fought Republicans’ attempts to block his state’s right to enforce the nation’s toughest clean air rules, was forcibly removed from a news conference Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem held on immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.

Padilla, a native of Los Angeles, where the Trump administration deployed the National Guard over Gov. Gavin Newsom’s objections, was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed, even though he told the agents who he was.

The day before, Padilla vowed to block all EPA nominations “until Republicans allow California to protect the health of its residents” by reinstating the waivers.

When the Senate voted last month to rescind the waivers, Democratic senators charged their Republican colleagues with using parliamentary tricks to unlawfully invoke the CRA. The CRA allows Congress to quickly rescind rules passed by federal agencies within a limited time frame with a simple majority vote rather than the 60 votes needed under the filibuster rule.

“Under both Republican and Democratic administrations, California was consistently granted waivers under the Clean Air Act to implement stronger standards to help ensure cleaner air for our families,” said California Sen. Adam Schiff in a statement after Trump signed the resolutions. “By eliminating the filibuster and passing these polluter resolutions, President Donald Trump, EPA Administrator Zeldin and Republicans in Congress are undermining our state’s ability to protect the health of millions of Americans.”

California’s emissions standards are critical to reducing harmful pollution and protecting public health, which is “good for our people and good for our planet,” Bonta said.

Tens of millions of Californians, or nearly 9 in 10 residents, breathe some of the most polluted air in the country, reports from the American Lung Association show. Research shows that air pollution contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, cancer and a million premature deaths globally each year.

California’s clean-vehicle regulations were created to address these issues, Bonta said.

“The bottom line is simple,” Bonta said. “The president doesn’t have the legal authority to weaponize the CRA against California, and we won’t let him use the CRA for his political gain, not when we’re facing worsening air pollution and a climate crisis that’s already endangering our communities.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2217801189-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:34:17.900575

Notably, this includes the EPA power plant rule, which would require the longest-running existing coal-fired units and most heavily utilized new gas turbines to implement carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) by various compliance dates in the 2030s.
Under that requirement, coal plants which plan to stay open beyond 2039 would have to reduce or capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032.
The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic (MATS) pollutants.
Opponents of the EPA power plant rule have argued that its implementation would jeopardize grid reliability and that the emission reduction technologies proposed by the Biden EPA aren’t ready for prime time.","The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the action would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help unleash American energy.

Notably, this includes the EPA power plant rule, which would require the longest-running existing coal-fired units and most heavily utilized new gas turbines to implement carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) by various compliance dates in the 2030s.

Under that requirement, coal plants which plan to stay open beyond 2039 would have to reduce or capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032. Coal plants that are scheduled to close by 2039 would have to cut their emissions 16% by 2030, while those that are set to retire by 2032 would be exempted from the new rule.

New natural gas-fired plants that run more than 40% of the time, considered “baseload” by the agency, would also have to eliminate 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions using CCS by 2032.

The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic (MATS) pollutants. The Trump administration has already granted exceptions to 47 companies from MATS standards. Southern Company owns the most exempted coal-fired units (14 units at five facilities), followed by NRG and TVA (each with four coal-fired facilities).

The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administrations’ “war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.”

EPA is also proposing to repeal the 2015 emissions standards for new fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Obama-Biden Administration. The first Clean Power Plan was never fully implemented and was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022.

Opponents of the EPA power plant rule have argued that its implementation would jeopardize grid reliability and that the emission reduction technologies proposed by the Biden EPA aren’t ready for prime time. They praised the Trump Administration’s announcement Wednesday.

“We were on a collision course: pushing carbon reductions aggressively while dispatchable sources were being retired faster than replacements could come online,” said David Naylor, president and CEO of Rayburn Electric Cooperative in Texas. “Rules should support both transition and resilience, not force a trade-off. This policy shift helps us reset the conversation, allowing for a more practical path to emissions reduction without compromising reliability.”

Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court. The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press analysis that included the agency’s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.

The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.

In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,” the EPA said, adding: “This Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

“It means even if some of the states are getting gains from the fossil fuel industry, it’s being offset by the losses in clean energy benefits.” The study came out as the Senate was crafting its version of Trump’s main legislative initiative—the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” that will extend and expand tax cuts while slashing government spending, including on incentives for clean energy.
“The level of state ambition does play a role here, and it can help counteract some of the impacts of these federal clean energy policy rollbacks,” Zhao said.
Overall, the study estimates ending the Biden-era clean energy policies will result in 22,800 premature deaths of Americans and $160 billion in lost income cumulatively over the next decade.
Average home energy costs in 2035 would be $206 higher than they would have been under climate-friendly policy, the Maryland analysts estimated.","In a week when the Trump administration moved forward on multiple fronts to repeal U.S. climate policies, a new analysis quantified the potential costs for public health, households and the economy—including a stunning $1.1 trillion reduction in U.S. gross domestic product by 2035.

The study by the University of Maryland’s Center for Global Sustainability found that any economic benefits to the policy retreat—which Environmental Protection Agency Lee Zeldin placed at $1.2 billion a year from the power plant regulatory rollback alone—would be overwhelmed by the negative effects of greater air pollution and contraction in new manufacturing and jobs associated with an energy transition.

“Overall, there are more GDP losses if we roll back clean energy policies,” said Alicia Zhao, research manager at the center and lead author of the report. “It means even if some of the states are getting gains from the fossil fuel industry, it’s being offset by the losses in clean energy benefits.”

The study came out as the Senate was crafting its version of Trump’s main legislative initiative—the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” that will extend and expand tax cuts while slashing government spending, including on incentives for clean energy. Although a group of Republican senators is pushing to keep some of the tax breaks for wind, solar, electric vehicles and battery technology, which overwhelmingly have benefited red states, the depth of their commitment is not clear—especially amid pressure from the president to pass the overall package before July 4.

Meanwhile, in what Zeldin described as “a historic day at the EPA” on Wednesday, he formally proposed two regulatory repeals that he promised weeks ago: the end of greenhouse gas rules and mercury and air toxics regulations for power plants. In doing so, he stressed alleged economic benefits: $19 billion over the next 20 years in reduced costs to the power plant industry related to the carbon rules, and another $1 billion from jettisoning the mercury and air toxic standard.

But even the EPA’s own figures show a cost-benefit analysis that tips dramatically against the repeals if $130 billion in increased public health costs are considered. These include premature death, heart and lung disease, asthma attacks and increased hospitalizations due to air pollutants like fine particulate matter and ozone.

When asked at a press conference how he could justify the regulatory repeals given the lopsided cost-benefit equation, Zeldin fired back: “How do you justify not doing this action?”

Not addressing the health cost issue, Zeldin asserted repeatedly that President Joe Biden administration’s intended to kill the coal and oil industries with the greenhouse gas rules “to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry.”

Zeldin expressed skepticism of past analyses that showed health benefits of power plant regulations outweighing the costs. He pointed out that when President Barack Obama’s administration originally put mercury and air toxics rules into place in 2012, it estimated the cost to industry would be $9.6 billion. But utilities estimated that they invested $18 billion to bring power plants in compliance with those standards, which the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately struck down.

“Just because they might be throwing out their numbers to justify their rules doesn’t make their numbers accurate,” Zeldin said.

Members of Congress from fossil fuel producing states like West Virginia, North Dakota and Ohio joined Zeldin to praise his repeal of the greenhouse gas and mercury rules. But according to the new University of Maryland study, those states will face some of the worst economic and public health consequences if the Trump administration succeeds in repealing climate regulations at the same time that Congress takes back the clean energy incentives that were passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

By 2035, air pollution and associated health damages would be 14 percent higher in West Virginia and 13 percent higher in North Dakota compared to what they would be under current policy, according to the center’s analysis.

Conversely, the center’s results show states that have strong policies in place to limit air pollution and to promote clean energy will be more insulated from the costs of the federal policy repeal. “The level of state ambition does play a role here, and it can help counteract some of the impacts of these federal clean energy policy rollbacks,” Zhao said. The health and economic costs for California, Washington and Oregon are low compared to those in the rest of the country. But Zhao said the team, which hopes to publish its work in a peer-reviewed journal later this year, will have to update the analysis to include recent Congressional action to wipe California’s clean car standards off the books.

Overall, the study estimates ending the Biden-era clean energy policies will result in 22,800 premature deaths of Americans and $160 billion in lost income cumulatively over the next decade. Average home energy costs in 2035 would be $206 higher than they would have been under climate-friendly policy, the Maryland analysts estimated.

The EPA analysis supporting the power plant regulatory repeal has different numbers, although they are not much better for consumers. In 2035, it estimates that retail electricity prices will be 1 percent lower than they are today. Coal production for power sector use would increase 21 percent by 2035, EPA projected. And coal production would soar 84 percent by 2045—a year when scientists say carbon emissions need to be near net zero to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

The EPA did not estimate the costs of those climate impacts.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2203456428-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:31:56.138959

James Bikales reports for POLITICO.

In short:

The House-passed GOP megabill aims to repeal clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, but industry executives and former Republican officials argue the move could deter investment and delay projects critical to meeting rising electricity demand.

Energy executives, including NextEra CEO John Ketchum, warned that taking wind and solar “off the table” would risk economic growth and U.S. competitiveness in the AI sector, since natural gas and nuclear plants won’t come online fast enough.

With nearly $80 billion in investment expected to flow into the sector in the coming years, carbon capture is becoming a central part of global climate strategies. Reports say global CCS capacity might grow four times by 2030. This shows big advances in technology, funding, and teamwork across countries.

Why Is CCS Gaining So Much Attention?

Carbon capture and storage is a process that captures carbon dioxide (CO₂) from industrial and energy-related sources before it reaches the atmosphere. It then stores the carbon underground in geological formations.

CCS works well in sectors like cement, steel, and fossil fuel plants. These areas are tough to decarbonize with just renewable energy.

According to DNV’s 2025 Energy Transition Outlook: CCS to 2050 report, cumulative global investment in CCS could reach $80 billion over the next five years, or by 2030. This represents 270 million tons of carbon dioxide captured (MtCO2) each year.

A notable example is a $500 million agreement between Occidental Petroleum and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). They will build a big direct air capture (DAC) facility in Texas.

The deal shows the growing global interest in CCS. It’s not just about cutting emissions; it’s also about creating carbon removal solutions that support other climate efforts.

Experts agree that CCS isn’t a complete solution. However, it plays a key role by tackling emissions that other technologies can’t remove. It is also one of the few methods available today for carbon dioxide removal, a crucial component for meeting long-term climate targets.

How Fast Is CCS Capacity Growing?

The global CCS capacity is expected to grow fourfold by 2030, according to the DNV report. From around 50 million tonnes of CO₂ captured annually today, capacity could rise to more than 550 million tonnes per year by the end of the decade. This would represent around 6% of today’s energy-related global emissions.

This growth requires major investment in infrastructure, including new carbon pipelines, storage hubs, and large-scale capture facilities. North America and Europe are expected to lead the expansion. They could make up more than 80% of the expected CCS capacity by 2030. This is due to helpful climate policies, funding incentives, and established infrastructure.

In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act drives CCS growth. It offers tax credits up to $85 for each metric ton of CO₂ captured and stored permanently. Similarly, the European Union supports CCS through its Innovation Fund, with countries like Norway and the Netherlands building cross-border carbon storage networks in the North Sea.

Emerging markets are also entering the CCS space. In Asia, Japan and South Korea have begun planning domestic CCS facilities and exploring regional carbon storage partnerships.

Smart Tech, Lower Costs: CCS Innovation Takes Off

Technology is central to making CCS more effective and affordable. Current advancements include improved solvents for carbon capture, modular DAC units, and more efficient CO₂ transport and storage systems. These innovations help lower energy use and cut costs.

A 2023 report from the Energy Futures Initiative (EFI) says CCS costs might drop by 40% by 2050. This could happen because of better technology and larger production. New digital tools, like AI monitoring systems, are being tested. They track carbon storage performance in real time and help ensure long-term safety.

Data centers in the U.S. are beginning to integrate CCS into their sustainability efforts. For example, Microsoft is partnering with firms like Heirloom and CarbonCapture to buy permanent carbon removal credits backed by CCS. These partnerships show how CCS is moving beyond industrial use and into corporate sustainability strategies.

Hybrid projects, combining renewable energy with CCS, are also on the rise. These include bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), where biomass is used for power generation and the CO₂ is captured. This type of system can result in net-negative emissions—removing more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits.

How Do Policy and Carbon Markets Influence CCS Growth?

Strong policy support is driving CCS development. In the U.S., the Section 45Q tax credit offers financial incentives for both point-source carbon capture and DAC projects. The Department of Energy also provides funding for demonstration and early-stage CCS projects.

Globally, carbon markets are beginning to recognize the role of CCS. The voluntary carbon market (VCM) and compliance markets in California and the EU Emissions Trading System are considering or already using CCS-based credits.

In 2024, the global carbon market was valued at around $1.4 billion according to MSCI, with voluntary carbon credit transaction volumes declining but demand remaining steady. Projections suggest it could grow significantly, reaching between $7 billion and $35 billion by 2030.

Longer-term forecasts estimate the market could expand to as much as $250 billion by 2050. This is driven by increasing corporate climate commitments and demand for high-quality carbon removal credits.

High-quality carbon credits from CCS projects could play a major role in this growth. Projects that use strict measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) protocols can attract higher prices. This applies in both voluntary and regulatory markets.

Wood Mackenzie estimates the U.S. CCUS (carbon capture, utilization, and storage) sector could offer a $196 billion investment opportunity over the next 10 years. This is especially true for the oil, gas, chemical, and power industries.

Meanwhile, countries like Canada, Australia, and the UK are developing shared CCS “hub” models—regional centers that link multiple emission sources to centralized storage facilities. These hubs lower costs and speed up development by pooling resources and infrastructure.

A Critical Piece of the Climate Puzzle

By 2030, global CCS projects could capture between 430 and 550 million tonnes of CO₂ each year. This is a big step forward, but it’s not enough. Experts say we need 1.3 billion tonnes per year by mid-century to meet the Paris Agreement goals.

Still, CCS plays a unique and necessary role in cutting emissions where alternatives are limited. The technology’s capture capacity will grow to 1,300 MtCO2/yr. It also supports the production of low-carbon hydrogen, decarbonized fuels, and sustainable building materials.

However, some environmental groups caution that CCS must be applied carefully. Using captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) can hurt climate efforts. This happens if it isn’t combined with limits on fossil fuel use.

Clear governance, independent checks, and science-based standards are key to making sure CCS projects truly help climate goals. While it is not a silver bullet, CCS can buy time and cut emissions in sectors that are difficult to decarbonize with renewables alone.

As global capacity grows and costs drop, CCS will likely be key to climate strategies. This includes energy efficiency, clean fuels, and electrification. Continued collaboration among stakeholders, significant investment, and communities’ support will be key to making carbon capture and storage both scalable and sustainable.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/flux_80B-Surge-in-Carbon-Capture-Investments-by-2030.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:41:58.260037

Clean energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration are under debate in the Senate. House Republicans voted to gut these programs, but not all of their fellow Republicans in the Senate are on board. NPR's Barbara Sprunt has more.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: President Trump has long talked about his frustrations with clean energy provisions signed into law by President Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act. Here he is at an April rally in Michigan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round.

(BOOING)

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

The ‘Climate Cartel’ It’s unclear whether these MAGA groups – and the Trump administration – will ease up on the EU if the CSDDD is ditched entirely.","“The CSDDD is the greatest threat to America’s sovereignty since the fall of the Soviet Union,” the Heartland Institute, a pro-Trump U.S. think tank, tweeted on 31 March.

The Heartland Institute is one of the world’s leading climate science denial groups. It has helped to draft Donald Trump’s anti-climate policies, which have seen the president pledge to “drill baby drill” for more fossil fuels and once again pull the U.S. out of the flagship 2015 Paris Agreement.

Over recent months – along with a host of other Trump allies – the Heartland Institute has set its sights on a new target: the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).

This vague acronym belies the potentially transformative impact of the new law. In its original form, the CSDDD sought to require large companies – and those in “high risk” sectors – trading in the EU to address human rights and environmental issues in their own operations and in their supply chains. High turnover companies would also have been forced to adopt a plan to align with the Paris Agreement, including setting emissions reduction targets.

The Heartland Institute and its anti-climate, anti-regulation peers are vocal opponents of the law – and launched an aggressive campaign to water it down, or even to see it scrapped entirely.

These groups, which are all part of the ‘Make America Great Again’ (MAGA) ecosystem, view the CSDDD as symbolic of the way in which “woke” governments are attempting to force citizens and global corporations to conform to a pro-diversity, pro-environment agenda.

Following Trump’s election in November, these MAGA groups wasted no time in formulating their plans to oppose this perceived agenda.

They focused in particular on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which attempt to create workplaces free from bias – and environmental, social and governance (ESG) schemes, which try to ensure that organisations are guided by responsible and sustainable practices, not just profit.

In December, barely a month after Trump’s victory, the Heritage Foundation – the group that wrote the key ‘Project 2025’ blueprint for the president’s second term – published a report entitled: “ESG, DEI, and What to Do About Them”.

In the report, the Heritage Foundation described ESG and DEI as “pernicious”, and called the CSDDD “a serious problem”.

Two months later, the State Financial Officers Foundation – an influential network of Republican finance officials – wrote an open letter calling on the new administration to “investigate” the CSDDD, claiming that the EU’s directives are based on “unscientific assumptions about the nature of climate change impacts” and “will force companies to incriminate themselves”.

This quickly filtered through to Trump’s Cabinet. On 12 February, Howard Lutnick, the president’s pick for commerce secretary, told a Senate committee that the CSDDD threatened to place “significant burdens” on U.S. companies, and that the Trump administration was exploring the use of “commercial tools” to mount a counter-attack against the EU’s environmental regulations.

Soon this rhetoric made its way to the White House. In March, as part of the worldwide tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, the president called the EU “one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world”.

But the EU hasn’t stood firm in the face of Trump’s war of words.

The EU has already announced that it will be scaling back the CSDDD and delaying its implementation. The number of companies within scope has been reduced by 80 percent. The firms in question will only be required to file due diligence reports every five years, and won’t be required to investigate the ESG operations of their indirect business partners. The implementation of the law has also been postponed until 2028.

But Trump’s MAGA hardliners are still not satisfied. In April, the Heartland Institute released an open letter signed by 31 other groups, calling for Congress and the Trump administration to “take immediate steps to counter the CSDDD’s implementation”, including “if necessary, imposing retaliatory trade policies that punish EU nations for eroding America’s sovereignty, freedoms, and prosperity.”

This backlash is now influencing European leaders. In late May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for the CSDDD to be scrapped entirely. They claim it must be abandoned in order to defend the “competitiveness” of European corporations, with Macron stating that Europe must “synchronise with the U.S. and the rest of the world.”

This judgement signifies the appeasement of anti-climate pressure groups that are ideologically opposed to clean energy and climate science.

The Heartland Institute has denied that humans are driving climate change, which it has called a “delusion”, while the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 document urged Trump to “dismantle the administrative state”, reverse policies on climate action, slash restrictions on fossil fuel extraction, scrap state investment in renewable energy, and gut the Environmental Protection Agency.

If the EU waters down its climate policies in response to Trump’s pressure, it will have helped to send Project 2025 global.

The ‘Climate Cartel’

It’s unclear whether these MAGA groups – and the Trump administration – will ease up on the EU if the CSDDD is ditched entirely. They may simply use it as evidence that European lawmakers will buckle under enough pressure.

Indeed, MAGA’s opposition to the CSDDD is part of a multi-pronged campaign that seeks to dismantle global climate initiatives pioneered by both governments and corporations.

Much of the original groundwork for this campaign was undertaken by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee and its chair Jim Jordan, a leading Trump supporter.

Last year, Jordan’s committee produced reports – and demanded evidence from major corporations – on a supposed “climate cartel” of “left-wing activists and major financial institutions”.

The committee alleged that some of the world’s biggest asset managers – that have questionable climate commitments – are conspiring to force American companies to decarbonise against their wishes.

As part of its “investigation”, the committee demanded information from more than 130 U.S.-based companies, retirement and pension programmes, as well as 60 U.S.-based asset managers.

In November, 11 Republican-led states sued BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street – three of the world’s biggest asset managers – over their ESG policies. In West Virginia and Oklahoma, nearly two dozen banks have been barred from public contracts for trying to divest from fossil fuels.

These actions, along with the anti-climate rhetoric of Donald Trump, have had a chilling effect. In February last year, BlackRock, State Street, and JP Morgan Asset Management withdrew from Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative that works to ensure the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters take action on climate change.

Fast forward a year, and a growing list of major U.S. corporations are either cancelling or delaying their sustainability reports – designed to show how they are meeting their climate commitments.

And a new story from the investigative outlet CORRECTIV today reports that German insurance giants and investment firms are withdrawing from climate agreements, while companies are quietly shelving their sustainability policies, amid the anti-ESG backlash orchestrated by Trump and his acolytes.

As one sustainability expert at a financial firm told CORRECTIV: “We have to be careful not to harm the cause by sticking our necks out and becoming a target in the U.S.”

The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California’s attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump’s signing ceremony ended at the White House.

The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

Trump called California’s regulations “crazy” at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.

“It’s been a disaster for this country,” he said.

It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state’s Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.

“The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. “They come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.”

The three resolutions Trump signed will block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.

“I like Tesla,” Trump said.

In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed “are killing our country,” the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he’d risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.

“I’ll take electrocution every single day,” the president said.

When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, “If you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.”

“What this does is it gives us freedom,” said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install “infrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn’t give you any return.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump’s action.

“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Newsom said Trump’s action was a continuation of his “all-out assault” on California.

“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Newsom said in a statement. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

Newsom later Thursday doubled down on his state’s assertion of its right to set environmental regulations. He signed an executive order requiring state air regulators to propose new rules further limiting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks if a court ultimately upholds California’s rules that Trump sought to kill.

Trump’s signing of the resolutions comes as he has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

Conclusion House Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act would reduce the capacity of America’s power system, threatening cost of living, jobs, competitiveness, and the climate.","The U.S. power system is growing for the first time in decades—almost entirely as a result of new clean electricity sources. In 2024, the United States added 49 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity for the grid, and 95 percent of that came from new solar, batteries, nuclear, and wind power. By the end of 2025, the United States is on track to add almost 60 GW of clean energy to the grid. If the Senate agrees to the House-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would end federal clean energy incentives, the rate of new clean energy additions to the U.S. power grid could be slashed to as little as 13 GW per year over the next decade. By 2035, that would eliminate up to 72 percent of all new clean electricity that would have been built under current law and reduce overall energy additions to the grid by at least 50 percent, according to the latest energy systems modeling from the Rhodium Group.1 Continued federal clean energy investments are crucial for the grid to meet growing energy demand.

In contrast, repealing clean energy investments would cause the following harms:

Electricity bills for households would increase by $110 in 2026 and go up 10 percent for businesses.

Investors could pull back more than $500 billion of unspent investment in U.S. manufacturing.

840,000 jobs for Americans would be at risk from downsized investments and canceled projects across the country.

Grid reliability and energy supply could face new challenges, as data centers are estimated to account for almost half of electricity demand growth by 2030 and new energy supply is lagging.

The future capacity of the U.S. power grid is at stake

ClimateDeck data from the Rhodium Group shows that in the decade before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted, an average of only 15 GW of solar, wind, and batteries were added to the grid each year. By comparison, natural gas added 4 GW per year in the same period, and all other sources of electricity either shrank or remained relatively constant.2

Then, in 2024, powered by the clean energy investment incentives of the IRA, the combined deployment of solar, wind, and batteries tripled, with 45 GW of clean energy added to the grid last year. The explosion in clean energy investment is set to add 58 more GW to the grid this year. In the coming decade, CAP’s analysis found, deployment of these key technologies is projected to surge to an average rate of almost 100 GW per year, or even up to 170 GW per year in 2035.3 This construction boom integrated strong labor standards incentivized by the IRA, and is on track to build a grid that would supply up to 88 percent of its electricity without any fossil fuel costs by 20354—cutting pollution and alleviating electricity prices even as the grid grows to supply the increasing power demands of the modern economy.

Yet the Senate is considering legislation that would hinder this progress. Under the House-passed reconciliation bill, which terminates federal clean energy investment, additions to the electricity grid would crater. Energy Innovation’s recent analysis of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act finds that it would cause new electricity additions to fall to roughly 33 GW per year by 2035, or 330 GW total. Similar ranges in energy capacity loss are reflected in the Rhodium Group’s multi-scenario analysis on clean energy tax credit repeal, which shows that the average annual deployment of solar, wind, and storage would likely fall down to 34 GW or even to as little as 13 GW under certain conditions.5 As much as 72 percent of all clean energy capacity that would have been built over the next decade would disappear.

As much as 72 percent of all clean energy capacity that would have been built over the next decade would disappear. Rhodium Group, ""Ways and Means Brings the Hammer Down on Energy Credits"" (2025).

Nuclear power, which added 1.1 GW of new capacity last year after the decades-long process to build the Vogtle power plant, may, if not affected by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, add another 4 GW of new capacity over the coming decade due to the federal incentives for new emissions-free power.6 This technology-neutral approach to supporting clean energy has also justified private investment in research to develop fusion power, enhanced geothermal, and other innovations. Without the federal incentives, no new nuclear power is projected to be built in the coming decade.

The loss of new clean electricity capacity will not be fully replaced by new gas or other energy sources. Gas developers are facing growing costs and long wait times for projects to come online, with many not slated to deliver power until 2030 or later, as it takes seven years, on average, to build a new natural gas power plant. Time delays in equipment procurement caused the withdrawal of a large gas project in Texas earlier this year. Without federal clean energy incentives, economic projections indicate that annual new baseload natural gas capacity additions could increase by as little as 0.8 GW per year in response to the lost solar, wind, and battery storage—and without federal incentives, little or none of that new natural gas capacity would bother to capture and sequester carbon.7 In the best-case scenario for natural gas, under which data center growth for artificial intelligence is most rapid and clean energy investment is repealed, an average of 10 GW of new baseload natural gas capacity would be added annually.8 In place of the new clean affordable electricity that would have been built, new and existing power plants would be called on to generate more power, unnecessarily consuming expensive and polluting fuel.

Taken together, more than half of all new capacity added to the grid over the next 10 years will be lost if federal clean energy investment is terminated.

The House Republican plan has consequences for the power grid and cost of living

The proposed cuts to the federal clean energy incentives would not only limit new clean energy additions to the grid but would have cascading effects throughout American society.

Increase electricity bills for households by $110 per year

Gutting clean energy investment at the federal level would hand Americans even higher electricity bills, raising prices by 7 percent for households and by 10 percent for businesses next year. If energy tax incentives are repealed, U.S. households would bear an average increase of $110 in electricity costs in 2026. In the next decade, Energy Innovation projects an average $260 increase in Americans’ energy bills every year, but by 2035, some states, such as South Carolina and Kentucky, could see even higher average annual increases of more than $800. The nation’s commercial and industrial sectors would also be hit by repeal and see double-digit percentage increases in electricity prices in nearly half of U.S. states in 2026. With 4 out of every 5 Americans feeling “powerless” about their skyrocketing energy bills, removing federal clean investment would only leave more households in financial distress.

The House Republican Plan To Increase Gas and Electricity Prices

Trevor Higgins

Risk more than $500 billion of unspent investment in the U.S. manufacturing industry

In addition to raising electric rates for manufacturers, House Republicans’ proposed legislation would suddenly pull the rug out from under billions of dollars of transformational investments. As of early May 2025, a more than $500 billion investment in manufacturing and clean energy deployment had been announced but not yet spent; gutting the federal incentives that form the basis of project financing would put these investments at risk. These cuts would forfeit the United States’ competitive edge in the clean energy industry and auto supply chain created by the IRA—leaving ample opportunity for other nations, such as China, to out-produce and out-innovate the United States.

Create difficulties for grid support of data centers

Data centers, driven by purported artificial intelligence services, could account for almost half of the United States’ electricity demand growth by 2030. If power-hungry AI data centers are built and clean energy is not, Americans will bear the costs of higher rates and utility bills. Repealing energy tax credits could cause the nation to struggle with transforming its data centers from grid burdens to grid assets as well as risk the competitiveness of its digital infrastructure.

Cut 840,000 jobs for Americans

Repealing clean energy investments would undercut thousands of clean energy projects and lead to 840,000 lost jobs by the end of the decade and 790,000 lost jobs in 2035. These losses would be largely due to faltering domestic investment in clean energy, shuttered manufacturing facilities, and canceled construction projects, leading to a cumulative $1.1 trillion loss in gross domestic product (GDP) within the reconciliation budget window of 2025 to 2034.

Conclusion

House Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act would reduce the capacity of America’s power system, threatening cost of living, jobs, competitiveness, and the climate.

On Thursday, the president signed joint resolutions of Congress—effectively serving as a federal law to revoke California's policy.

The president also threatened to raise automotive tariffs in the near future as a way to increase domestic auto manufacturing.

On Thursday, President Trump signed joint resolutions of Congress that block California's attempt to ban the sale of purely gas-powered cars in its state. Allowed to stand, the California rule would have required that electric cars make up progressively larger shares of new car sales each year—until 2035, at which point the sale of new internal-combustion cars would be banned—though, under CAFE, plug-in hybrids would continue to be allowed.

By signing the joint resolutions of Congress, which were passed by a Republican majority in May, Trump reversed the Biden administration's previous approval of the California law. According to a report by , Trump, speaking at the signing event, called the plan a ""disaster"" and said it would ""effectively abolish the internal combustion engine, which most people prefer."" The resolutions also revoke two other California clean-air policies—one requiring half of all new trucks sold in the state to be electric by 2035 and the other limiting the amount of nitrogen oxide cars and trucks emit.

In addition to signing the joint resolutions, the president also threatened to increase U.S. automotive tariffs from their current 25 percent. The president said raising auto tariffs from their current level could provide more protection for the domestic auto industry.

""I might go up with that tariff in the not too distant future,"" Trump said. ""The higher you go, the more likely it is they build a plant here."" The latest threat comes roughly a week after the president increased tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel to 50 percent, further increasing pressure on automakers.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/an-electric-vehicle-fast-charger-stands-at-a-rest-stop-news-photo-1749761196.pjpeg?crop=0.755xw:0.566xh;0,0.434xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-06-12 23:34:29.042191

The website will stop publishing new content on July 1.

The site, climate.gov, is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). As of 2021, it received nearly one million visitors every month, and was one of the most trusted sources of climate-related information in the U.S., according to public surveys about the site.

A staff of 10 people wrote content and created maps, charts and explanatory graphics for climate.gov. Those employees have now been terminated, according to Rebecca Lindsey, the former program manager for the website. NOAA did not respond to questions from NPR about changes to the site.

Lindsey had worked on climate.gov for 13 years, and had recently changed roles before she was laid off in February as part of a government-wide purge of what the government calls probationary employees, generally people who were new to their specific jobs.

Two other probationary climate.gov employees were also let go at that time, and the remaining seven staff were let go in recent weeks, according to an official who is familiar with the website's operations, and who requested anonymity because they fear they will be fired for speaking about efforts to hobble the website.

All of those laid off were experienced science communication and data visualization experts who cannot be easily replaced with other NOAA employees, according to the official.

Until recently, the website published multiple items each week that were tailored to what was happening in the U.S. For example, in the last month, the site published up-to-date information about tornado season and wildfire smoke. The site also publishes original maps, charts and other data to explain drought trends, changes to rain and snowfall and seasonal climate outlooks for the U.S., to help people across the country plan for heat waves, floods and other extreme weather.

Lindsey says it's clear to her that the administration is trying to get rid of public conversation about climate change and its profound impacts on people in the U.S. ""They think that climate change isn't real, and they don't want anybody talking about it,"" she says.

The White House did not respond to questions about why the climate.gov website has been hobbled, or what might happen to the site in the future. The site has not been fully shuttered — all the content that has been published in the past is still available as of now, although much of it will rapidly become obsolete if it is not updated.

The Trump administration has gutted other climate-related programs across the federal government. Earlier this year, all of the staff in charge of the National Climate Assessment were laid off. Like climate.gov, the assessment is designed to provide accurate, useful climate information to the public and to local officials who rely on it to make decisions about roads, housing and infrastructure for electricity, drinking water and sewers.

The law, which both chambers of Congress passed last month, applies to 17 states that follow California standards.","President Donald Trump signed a Congressional Review Act resolution Thursday that revokes California’s authority to set tailpipe emissions standards, upending policy in California and 17 other states that tie their standards to that of the Golden State.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Democratic attorneys general in 10 other states immediately sued to block enforcement of the law. Through a process that allows Congress to undo recent executive branch rules, the law repeals a U.S. Environmental Protection Act waiver allowing California to set a schedule for emissions standards for cars and trucks.

Trump signed two other resolutions that repeal the state’s authority to ban sales of new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035 and to regulate emissions on heavy trucks.

At a White House signing ceremony, Trump said the law would allow greater consumer choice and lead to less expensive vehicles.

“Your cars are going to cost you $3,000, $4,000 less and you're going to have what you want,” he said. “Again, you can get any car you want.”

Simple majority vote

The procedure used to pass the law was controversial because of the use of the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, which allows a simple majority vote in the U.S. Senate instead of the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold.

Both the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the EPA waiver was not a rule and that the CRA could not be used. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune used the procedure anyway, and the measure passed 51-46.

The states suing over the law argued that process was illegal, saying that the CRA was “deemed inapplicable by every nonpartisan arbiter and expert who analyzed the question.”

“While all fifty States consented—through their Senators—to these expedited procedures for congressional disapproval of federal rules, no State consented to the CRA as a means for Congress to negate state rules,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote. “Nor would any State have done so.”

The states joining California in the lawsuit are Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Vermont and Washington.

Clean Air Act

The federal Clean Air Act of 1970 generally prohibits states from setting their own air quality standards. But a section of the bedrock environmental law allows California, which had stringent environmental standards at the time the federal law was passed, to set its own standards.

While the other 49 states may not set their own standards, any state can adopt California’s standards as its own.

That means the law Trump signed Thursday has effects far beyond California’s borders, which the president noted.

“The federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry, all over the country, all over the world, actually,” he said.

The law, which both chambers of Congress passed last month, applies to 17 states that follow California standards.

The EPA claims the repeal would save the power sector $1.2 billion annually, improve electric reliability, and promote American energy independence.
The repeal includes undoing the Biden Administration’s 2024 Clean Air Act rule, which aimed to cut carbon emissions by relying on emerging technologies like carbon capture and sequestration.
The NRDC argues that repealing the GHG standards would increase carbon emissions from the nation’s largest industrial polluters — power plants — worsening extreme weather and respiratory illnesses.
“These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run,” Matheson said.","In a move with significant implications for U.S. climate policy and energy infrastructure, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on June 11 proposed repealing two major environmental regulations from the Biden-Harris Administration. These include greenhouse gas (GHG) standards for power plants under the Clean Air Act and certain amendments to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). The EPA claims the repeal would save the power sector $1.2 billion annually, improve electric reliability, and promote American energy independence. But the proposals have triggered strong reactions from both environmental advocates and power sector stakeholders.

The EPA's Case for Repeal

Announced by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin during a press conference with several Republican lawmakers and Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, the proposed rules target what the agency calls “burdensome” regulations that disproportionately affect coal-, oil-, and gas-fired plants.

“Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream,” said Zeldin, criticizing the previous regulations as part of a “narrow-minded climate change zealotry.”

EPA argues that the repealed rules — originally designed to limit carbon and toxic air emissions — would have led to premature plant closures, increased energy prices, and greater dependency on foreign energy sources. The agency is also challenging the legal foundation for regulating GHG emissions from fossil fuel plants, arguing they do not significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution under the Clean Air Act.

The repeal includes undoing the Biden Administration’s 2024 Clean Air Act rule, which aimed to cut carbon emissions by relying on emerging technologies like carbon capture and sequestration. Similarly, the rollback of the 2024 MATS amendments would reinstate the 2012 standards, which the EPA says already led to significant emissions reductions.

NRDC’s Perspective:

Environmental advocates, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), criticized the move. President and CEO of NRDC Manish Bapna warned of severe consequences for public health and the climate.

“The EPA is hoisting the white flag of surrender on the power plant pollution that's poisoning the air we breathe and harming our climate,” Bapna said.

The NRDC argues that repealing the GHG standards would increase carbon emissions from the nation’s largest industrial polluters — power plants — worsening extreme weather and respiratory illnesses. The group also contends that undoing stricter mercury and air toxics standards would expose communities to increased levels of neurotoxic pollutants like mercury and arsenic.

Environmental lawyers are expected to challenge the proposals in court, citing what they view as violations of the EPA’s statutory obligations and recent legal precedents.

NRECA’s View:

In contrast, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), representing utility co-ops across the country, applauded the EPA’s move. CEO Jim Matheson framed the Biden-era regulations as unworkable and legally questionable.

“These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run,” Matheson said. “They are textbook examples of bad energy policy.”

NRECA maintains that many of the technologies mandated by the Biden rules — especially carbon capture — are not yet viable at scale. The group also argues that compliance would drive up electricity costs and reduce reliability, particularly in rural and lower-income regions dependent on legacy coal and gas infrastructure.

By repealing these rules, Matheson says the EPA is “correcting course” and aligning policy with practical, cost-effective approaches to meeting growing energy demand.

Legal and Policy Implications

The proposals revisit long-standing debates over the role of the Clean Air Act in regulating climate change and whether EPA has the authority to set wide-ranging rules that shift the U.S. energy mix.

The Biden Administration's rules had been crafted in part as a response to the 2022 Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v. EPA, which limited the agency’s ability to implement broad carbon regulations without explicit Congressional approval.

Now, by seeking to repeal those efforts, the EPA is not just walking back recent policy — but potentially redefining the agency’s future role in addressing climate change through power sector regulation.

What Comes Next

The EPA has opened a public comment period for both proposals. If finalized, the repeals would begin impacting power plant planning and emissions strategy as early as 2026.","https://img.tdworld.com/files/base/ebm/tdworld/image/2025/06/684b43b4458e5cc249462b17-dreamstime_xxl_33149488.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-12 23:33:19.138537

“That is a projection — we don’t know what’s going to happen next year,” Wright told Bloomberg in an interview. “We have seen weak prices for a few months, and if prices are too low for an economic incentive, you’ll see some drilling reduce on the margin. I think it’s unlikely you’ll see enough reduction to actually see a decline in production next year.”

The Energy Information Administration said earlier this week it expected oil production in the U.S. to decline from 13.5 million barrels daily in the second quarter of this year to 13.3 million barrels daily in 2026 as shale oil peaks. The authority cited weak oil prices as one reason for the expected decline, while some industry executives have pointed to the exhaustion of low-cost shale deposits as a driver of the potential future decline.

Bloomberg noted in its report that shale drillers have been laying off workers and cutting the number of drilling rigs in the patch but Wright said that “This administration is making it lower cost for them to drill wells and therefore a lower threshold at which they would start to pull back activity.”

The most vulnerable players in the shale patch are smaller independents. Supermajors such as Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips are in a business-as-usual mode, yet some of them have already said that the peak in U.S. oil production is being accelerated and could come sooner than previously expected.

“As you know that most of the shale basins now have either plateaued or are starting to decline, except for the Permian,” Occidental’s Vicki Hollub said on the company’s Q1 call.

Conoco’s Ryan Lance, for his part, said that at $60 per barrel, “the folks that don't have the kind of cost of supply sitting in their portfolio are going to find themselves cash-strapped and returns-strapped.”

As of 2021, 79 megawatts of community solar capacity had been installed; as of May, that number is up to 1,008 MW.
“Community solar is incredibly important to Maine,” said Kate Daniel, Northeast regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access, a national trade group.
Community solar operators would be required to rightsize customers’ subscriptions, preventing them from paying for more credits than they can use.
For opponents, however, the community solar fees are an intractable problem that outweighs any other provisions.","A legislative proposal in Maine that would impose new fees on community solar projects is having a chilling effect on solar developers, some of whom say they may stop working in the state, or even already have.

“The problem is that they’re looking to change the rules of the market after the fact,” said Brendan Bell, chief operating officer of Aligned Climate Capital, which owns several community solar projects in the state. ​“We’ve already stopped investing in Maine because of this. Simply the risk of this happening has made us stop.”

The legislation, which was approved in late May by the Energy, Utilities, and Technology Committee, aims to reform Maine’s net energy billing program — often called net metering in other states — which pays the owners of solar panels for the excess energy they share with the grid.

Nationally, net metering programs have been contentious, with states like California, New Hampshire, and North Carolina making big changes to mixed — and sometimes litigious — receptions. Maine’s system has been under scrutiny for years, as many critics say it has created excessive profits for developers while unfairly shifting costs to consumers who don’t even use solar power.

While many renewable energy advocates and developers agree that the program needs some reform, they say the current bill goes too far. The legislation outlines a new system for compensating commercial and industrial customers who own solar panels. Currently, the compensation rate is based on standard utility electricity rates, meaning solar owners make more revenue when power prices rise. The bill would require a new mechanism of gradual, annual rate increases to avoid excessive windfalls for solar owners when energy costs go up.

Of particular concern, however, are other provisions that apply to community solar developments, larger-scale installations that sell power to multiple subscribers.

In 2019, reforms to Maine’s net energy billing program paved the way for community solar to take off in the state. As of 2021, 79 megawatts of community solar capacity had been installed; as of May, that number is up to 1,008 MW.

“Community solar is incredibly important to Maine,” said Kate Daniel, Northeast regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access, a national trade group. ​“It’s been the driver of the new clean energy that’s gone onto the grid in recent years.”

The bipartisan legislation now under consideration would impose a monthly fee, paid by community solar owners to utilities. The money would be intended to cover the cost of delivering the solar power to consumers. Those ​“distribution costs” would otherwise be borne by utility customers.

Projects between 1 MW and 3 MW in size would pay $2.80 per kilowatt of capacity — so $5,600 a month for a 2-MW project, for example. Larger arrays between 3 MW and 5 MW would pay $6 per kilowatt — so, $24,000 per month for a 4-MW installation. These rates would be increased as needed to keep up with the cost of maintaining and expanding the grid. The goal, proponents say, is to continue supporting solar in a way that does not add to residents’ financial hardships.

“It is really important to me that we are fighting climate change in an economically just way,” said Rep. Sophie Warren, a Democrat and one of the bill’s sponsors.

However, renewable energy advocates and solar developers say the monthly fees could scare away new projects as well as put existing operations at risk.

“It basically … will consume all of our free cash flow and put us in a position where we may default on our loans,” said Cliff Chapman, CEO of Syncarpha Capital, a New York-based clean energy investment firm with eight community solar projects operating in Maine.

Opponents question the way these fees came to be included in the bill. They were not in the original draft legislation, but the idea was raised and voted on during committee debate. The language is in the process of being officially added to the bill so that lawmakers can report it out of committee and send it to the House floor. It is concerning that the fees received no public hearing, and many stakeholders and lawmakers are not even aware they are being added in, said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the industry group Maine Renewable Energy Association.

Even if this bill fails to pass, the damage may already be done: Investors in all sorts of clean energy segments are becoming wary of doing business in a state that would even consider retroactively changing the rules for projects that were designed and financed under a different set of expectations, opponents said.

“It’s a retroactive policy proposal that many folks strongly believe would cause significant financial harm to the solar industry in Maine,” said Lindsay Bourgoine, director of policy and government affairs for Maine-based solar company ReVision Energy.

Opponents also worry that the bill sends the inaccurate message that increasing solar adoption makes energy more expensive, when research suggests the reverse is true. In 2024, solar development in Maine yielded about $1.42 in benefits for every dollar of cost, according to a report by state utilities regulators. As of the second half of 2024, net energy billing added about $7 per month to the average residential electric bill in the state.

Warren, however, says reining in even this modest increase could help some of her constituents.

“I know there are people on reverse mortgages, on fixed incomes, who are rationing their medicines,” she said. ​“These [compensation] rates are far too high, and unnecessarily high for what we’re getting from them.”

Bill proponents are also not convinced by claims that the new rules would cause financial problems for developers. The provisions are designed to have less financial impact on smaller companies that are less able to take the hit, said Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn, a supporter of the bill.

The bill also contains important consumer protections that opponents aren’t talking about, Sanborn said. Community solar operators would be required to rightsize customers’ subscriptions, preventing them from paying for more credits than they can use. Should a customer still end up with more credits than they need, the operator would be required to issue a refund. The legislation would also encourage the installation of battery storage in conjunction with solar.

“It is a responsible and balanced solution,” Sanborn said.

For opponents, however, the community solar fees are an intractable problem that outweighs any other provisions.

“What we don’t do in America is change rules retroactively and blow up existing investment,” Chapman said. ​“Being a state that does something like this has huge implications — they’re making themselves a pariah for investors.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1240424915.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ec2c4f9042a2951af6a9d09ecac40dcf,N,,2025-06-12 23:32:08.558235

Tokyo: Japan's largest power generation company said on Thursday it would ramp up imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States, as the government in Tokyo pushes for a trade deal with Washington.

Jera said it had signed supply deals from four US gas projects in Texas and Louisiana under new 20-year contracts.

The agreements ""advance Jera's long-term strategy to build a diversified and resilient LNG procurement portfolio in support of stable, secure energy for Japan and Asia"", it said.

US President Donald Trump wants to expand his country's fuel production and exports, having pledged to ""drill, baby, drill"" for oil and gas during the election campaign.

The deal comes as Japanese officials are locked in discussions with their US counterparts to dial down Trump's ""Liberation Day"" trade tariffs, with fuel and agriculture imports said to be one bargaining chip for Tokyo.

Jera said its new agreements will allow it to procure up to 5.5 million extra tonnes of LNG per year from the United States. It currently imports 3.5-4 million tonnes.

The US Department of the Interior hailed the agreements as ""yet another major milestone for President Trump's commitment to increase investment in the US and unleash American dominance"".

""This commitment... will bring in almost a quarter trillion dollars to our nation's economy and support over 50,000 American jobs for our country's LNG industry,"" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement.

Jera currently produces about 30 percent of Japan's electricity, according to its website.

Resource-poor Japan -- the world's fifth largest single-country emitter of carbon dioxide -- last year imported a total of 65.9 million tonnes of LNG.

As of 2023, LNG imports from Australia accounted for 41.6 percent of all Japanese LNG imports, followed by Malaysia at 15.6 percent, Russia's 9.3 percent, and the United States' 8.4 percent, according to the trade ministry.

Pairing already funded CarbonSAFE sites with data powered by newly built natural gas turbines with carbon capture is one example.","This blog is part of a series that explores the federal policies and actions needed to deploy next-generation geothermal, sources of nuclear energy (both fission and fusion), and carbon capture and storage – technologies the Trump administration indicated as priorities on Earth Day. The policy brief highlighting these technologies can be found here.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies have been successfully demonstrated and commercially deployed in the United States over the last five decades. In recent years, there has been a surge in carbon capture project announcements thanks to bipartisan federal policy enacted in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and enhancements to the 45Q tax credit, all underpinned by 15 years of bipartisan support.

Today, there are more than 270 publicly announced carbon capture projects across the United States, representing a total of $77.5 billion in capital investment. Increasingly, state policymakers, too, are recognizing CCS technologies as an essential solution that supports American global competitiveness, domestic energy production, pollution reduction, and job creation. What’s more, in April this year, the Trump administration also reaffirmed its support for CCS.

Despite this apparent consensus, the U.S. House of Representatives recently passed legislation that poses a risk to U.S. leadership in carbon management technologies which threatens industrial innovation and clean firm power generation. Included in the bill are provisions that would hinder the deployment of CCS technologies by cutting important pathways to project financing. Concerningly, the Department of Energy (DOE) has also recently announced the cancellation of a total of 10 carbon capture and utilization projects from the Carbon Capture Demonstration Projects Program, the Carbon Capture Large-Scale Pilot Program, and the Industrial Demonstration Program. These cuts halt important and innovative projects at gas and coal power plants, cement facilities, and other industrial sites nationwide.

According to DOE, every dollar of federal support for carbon management projects can generate up to four dollars in economic activity through equipment orders, construction, job creation, and regional supply chain growth. Recent DOE cancellations of key demonstration and pilot projects now threaten to halt that momentum. More concerningly, DOE is also proposing over $7 billion in cuts to CCUS pilot and demonstrations in the Presidential Budget Request of 2026, as highlighted in the table below.

Table 1. Unallocated IIJA funds intended as presented in the Presidential Budget Request pf 2026.

To counter this regressive action, drive industrial innovation, and remain a global energy leader, the Senate must both protect and enhance federal carbon management policies. As global markets demand cleaner goods, CCS is a necessity for U.S competitiveness.

Protecting and enhancing 45Q tax credits is essential for U.S. leadership in carbon capture and storage.

Congress must prepare 45Q for next-generation deployment by increasing the incentive to $120/ton. While the current 45Q credit – up to $85/ton for saline sequestration – is competitive for sectors like ethanol and natural gas processing, it falls short for higher-cost applications, particularly due to inflation in recent years. According to the Carbon Capture Coalition’s analysis, cement, steel, refining, and some power projects often face abatement costs well over $100/ton. To drive widespread deployment across hard-to-abate industries, the 45Q credit needs to rise to $120/ton or more. Readjusting the credit value to account for inflation that has occurred so far this decade would also help, as current credit values won’t start adjusting for inflation until 2027. This would help close the cost gap and send a strong market signal to domestic manufacturers and their international customers.

Figure 1: Current 45Q credit levels across most sectors are falling short of covering NOAK costs

Congress must halt the erasure of early-stage demonstration projects during the appropriations process. Congress should ensure that funding for demonstrations and pilots across industrial sectors, including refining, steel, cement, chemicals, and fossil power generation, is made available by this administration. DOE has already pulled the rug out from the U.S. cement industry with its recent cuts to pilot and demonstration projects, which were authorized by the legislative branch with bipartisan support. While DOE cut 10 CCS pilot and demonstrations in May, China announced seven major industrial and power CCUS project just weeks before. However, Congress can act to reverse this. There are still unallocated funds in the programs authorized by the bipartisan IIJA, approximately 1.35 billion for Carbon Capture Demonstrations and a further 728 million for large-scale carbon capture pilots.

DOE justified cancelling several carbon-capture demonstration projects by claiming they were “not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment for taxpayers.” But pilot and demonstration programs exist precisely to support promising technologies that are not yet commercially viable or fully scaled; they aim to de-risk innovation, attract private capital, and drive down costs over time. Applying a strict near-term profitability test to decide which projects survive amounts to DOE picking winners rather than creating a level playing field. The results bear this out: DOE terminated both cement-sector CCUS projects—even though cement capture typically costs less per ton than coal power capture—while allowing one coal-power CCS project to proceed.

If DOE’s real concern is that the canceled projects do not align with the administration’s broader power or policy goals, then Congress should direct the department to issue a new funding opportunity specifically tailored to carbon-capture projects that advance those objectives while still honoring the programs’ original congressional mandate. Maintaining targeted pilot and demonstration funding would stabilize investor expectations in U.S carbon management policy, accelerate first-of-a-kind CCUS deployments at home

while helping American companies secure the first-mover advantage by commercializing —and ultimately exporting—the next generation of CCUS technologies.

Table 2: Canceled carbon capture projects announced May 30, 2025

Congress must protect the transferability provision within the 45Q tax credit to enable project financing. Transferability allows project developers to sell 45Q credits to investors, unlocking upfront capital and enabling participation from startups and smaller firms that do not have sufficient tax liabilities to fully leverage the credits. Removing this provision would add costs to project financing for no public benefit. As shown below in Figure 2, in 2024, the elimination of transferability would increase costs from about 5 cents per dollar to 30 cents by forcing developers to utilize tax equity markets directly. Transferability has proven its value to project developers, large and small, as an efficiency mechanism allowing developers to avoid costly and inefficient tax equity markets. Without the ability to use these transferability provisions, carbon management project development and deployment will slow significantly, leading to many projects, particularly smaller ones, failing to reach a final investment decision.

Figure 3: Average return on 45Q in tax equity markets

The administration must finalize and implement key safety and permitting rules, including updated PHMSA regulations for CO₂ pipeline transport. Regulatory clarity is critical to accelerating infrastructure buildout and overcoming permitting delays. Some states, like California, have introduced moratoria on pipeline development in anticipation of PHMSA’s updated rules. Further delays in implementing updated PHMSA rules will pose serious risks to project development in those states.

Congress must safeguard regulatory frameworks like the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), which the EPA is threatening to eliminate, to ensure robust monitoring, reporting, and verification of captured CO₂, not to mention serving as a critical resource for emissions data across multiple industries. This is essential for maintaining accountability, enabling the use of 45Q tax credits, and protecting public investment. In fact, today, it is impossible to claim the 45Q credit and comply with IRS regulations without reporting under the GHGRP.

Congress must continue to hold hyperscale data center developers accountable for the power infrastructure they require. Leading U.S. technology companies—Microsoft, Google, and Amazon—have made high-profile commitments to decarbonize their electricity consumption. Microsoft has pledged to match 100% of its electricity use with zero-carbon energy by 2030. Google aims to power all data centers with carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by the same year. Amazon claims it already matches 100% of its operations with renewable energy as of 2023 and is targeting net-zero carbon by 2040. However, the details behind these commitments often remain vague. While these companies are rapidly expanding their capacity to meet rising AI-related power demand—an effort increasingly framed as essential to national competitiveness with China—Congress must ensure that the energy infrastructure built to support this growth genuinely advances U.S. energy security goals.

While the Department of Energy cuts demonstration projects, Congress must extend support for critical carbon management infrastructure and leverage what has already been built. Pairing already funded CarbonSAFE sites with data powered by newly built natural gas turbines with carbon capture is one example. Efficient permitting of carbon dioxide pipelines is also key. This could include Congress introducing a federal siting pathway for interstate pipelines to align with the federal authority granted to natural gas pipelines under the Natural Gas Act, or state-level reforms. This would address siting challenges that currently delay projects and help translate federal investments into steel in the ground.

EPA must be equipped to handle primacy and Class VI well applications. Advancing CCS will also require a clear-eyed focus on permitting efficiency. A critical area of progress has been state primacy over Class VI wells, which govern the long-term geologic storage of CO₂. Several states—West Virginia, Texas, and Arizona—have recently advanced their primacy applications. West Virginia received final approval in early 2025 and now has full permitting authority. Texas finalized its Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with EPA in April, and this month, EPA announced its proposal to approve Texas’s application. Arizona’s application is currently under public comment following EPA’s proposed rule in May. Louisiana, which was granted primacy in 2023, recently secured a legal victory in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed a lawsuit challenging EPA’s decision.

Table 3: Status of Class VI Primacy

As more states pursue primacy, Congress must ensure that EPA is properly staffed and resourced to handle both the growing volume of primacy applications and the surge in Class VI well permit applications from states without primacy. The administration is proposing sweeping cuts to the EPA, posing a serious risk to EPA’s institutional capacity. Congress must ensure the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program, which governs the safe permitting and operation of Class VI wells for CO₂ storage, remains intact.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/12150215/OilIndustry_LargeBG_1.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:32:13.971741

The House Freedom Caucus – a group of hardline conservatives – recently wrote Senate Republicans, warning them to retain provisions rolling back investments in green energy, notably tax credits in President Joe Biden’s 2022 “Inflation Reduction Act.”

More moderate House and Senate Republicans have argued for slowing the repeals or preserving the credits entirely.

This poses a political problem for the GOP. The House passed the bill by just one vote. Senate Republicans can only lose three votes (assuming Democrats stay unified).

Into the breach comes Built For America, a campaign to save the tax credits led by a Republican, former West Virginia Lt. Gov. Mitch Carmichael, who also headed economic development for the state.

The group says it plans to spend $2 million to reach Trump and his inner circle – with ads on the president’s Truth Social network, Rumble, Fox News, conservative podcasts, digital trucks buzzing Trump-aligned establishments, etc.

DECISION POINTS:

GOP Ties L.A. to ‘Beautiful’ Trump Bill

Decision Points sat down with Carmichael to kick the tires and check under the hood a little. Our conservation has been edited for length and clarity.

What’s the goal of this campaign?

“The goal is to preserve and to extend the manufacturing tax credits that are really fueling the American reassertion of manufacturing and keeping energy prices lower than they would otherwise be. They're currently igniting what I consider an industrial revolution, and certainly in West Virginia and Appalachia but I think throughout the nation – that's the goal, the ultimate goal.

“The key piece here that I think needs to be emphasized is that these aren't handouts at all. These are absolutely incentives for companies to invest their own money, to hire American citizens and to provide low cost energy products and services that are again fueling the manufacturing revolution.”

Is there a project that stands out in your mind?

“There’s a long-term battery storage system that will provide employment for over 750 people in our state.. Those are families that will be living in our state, and this is in an area that had been devastated by the closing of some steel mills.

“This is about that person who's going to get a job in an innovative industry, with a long-term prospect to provide for their family and create a future in areas that vastly supported President Trump. … This is what President Trump promised to deliver on, and this is such a great tool to do that. And so we're just making sure that there are those out there who are aware of how beneficial these credits are.”

How will you reach Trump and his inner circle?

“Bringing forth the business advantage to these programs. A lot of people want to position things as some climate ideology, or some – as some people would call it – a ‘green new scam.’ That's not what this is about. And somebody like myself who is dedicated to economic development, from a state that still wants to embrace all of our historic industries, like coal, oil, natural gas, steel, making, all those things … can speak to the issue from an economic perspective, not all the other background noise.

“This is purely and simply about establishing manufacturing dominance, reasserting energy dominance, and ensuring that we have the critical and vital resources, mineral resources, rare earth elements and so forth. These tax credits incentivize all that development. They're not a handout, Olivier. They are a reward for investing money and producing and providing service and that product.”

Do you think green energy, writ large, has a political branding problem?

“I think it does in certain areas. You know, my brother in law is a coal miner. We know what it's like to work hard in a fossil fuel industry, but to a person here, we want jobs and opportunity, and so if this clean energy transition occurs, we want it to happen here. And this is a great tool for President Trump to use to deliver on his promise to reassert that American dominance in these areas (energy and manufacturing).”",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/3637de9/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Ffb%2F49%2F55b75bb14d05a4126632f7d9e2db%2Fgettyimages-1417180248.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:32:18.132630

US Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced two EPA proposals to roll back emission limits for power plants on greenhouse gases, mercury, and particulate matter. Under one proposed rule, the EPA would repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for fossil fuel–fired power plants, undoing standards instituted during the administrations of Barack Obama and Joe Biden for new and existing plants. A second proposal would undo Biden-era rules to tighten the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for power plants and return them to 2012 standards. The proposals come almost 3 months after Zeldin said the EPA is reviewing 31 regulatory actions for potential rollback.

“Today is a historic day for the EPA,” Zeldin said during the announcement. “We are proposing to repeal Obama and Biden rules that have been criticized as regulating coal, oil, and gas out of existence.” The proposed changes will ensure that people in the US will have access to plentiful and cheap electricity, he said. “Today, EPA is taking an important step reclaiming sanity and sound policy illustrating that we can both protect the environment and grow the economy.”

The proposed changes could impact the chemical industry and other sectors of the economy by reducing the price of power. “Ensuring affordable and reliable energy supplies drives down the costs of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing while boosting our national security,” the EPA says in a press release.

When are GHG emissions ‘significant’?

Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to regulate industrial sources if they’re a significant contributor to air pollution, says Jeffrey Holmstead, former assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation and now a lawyer at the firm Bracewell. In the GHG proposal, the agency argues that emissions from US fossil fuel–fired power plants don’t qualify as a “significant” source of global GHG emissions, although the proposal doesn’t give the current amount of emissions. The EPA suggests that the definition of a significant emissions should be determined by ""the impacts and effects of statutory policy considerations"" rather than by a quantitative measure of volume of GHG emissions. A recent study by the Institute for Policy Integrity found that the US power sector contributed 5% of global GHG emissions between 1990 and 2002. If it were a country, the sector would have been the sixth-biggest global emitter of GHGs in this time frame.

“It's not terribly surprising that that's the route they're taking for power plants,” Holmstead says. What counts as ‘significant’ isn’t a scientific issue but more of a judgment call, he says. And it’s one that the current EPA is going to make, according to Zeldin. After the proposed rule goes through a public comment period, “we will make a decision on whether or not it is a significant contributor,” Zeldin said during a question-and-answer period with reporters after the announcement. “It is a decision I will have to make at the end of this process, and I look forward to doing so,” he said.

The EPA’s proposal indicates that the changes to GHG emission standards would save the power sector about $1.2 billion a year over the next 20 years.

Mercury to head back to 2012 limits

Zeldin also announced Wednesday that the EPA is proposing to eliminate another restrictions on how much mercury and other toxic compounds power plants can release into the air. In 2024, the Biden administration passed tighter limits under the MATS rule, reducing the amount of filterable particulate matter and Hg that coal-fired electric plants could emit by about one-third each. When promulgating that rule, the EPA said that tighter restrictions on these emissions were especially important to protect children’s developing brains and in communities near power plants who regularly eat fish with high accumulated levels of the pollutants. The agency projected then that this tighter MATS rule would create $300 million in total health benefits and $130 million in climate benefits between 2028 and 2037.

In the proposal for the new rule, the EPA says that the revisions to the MATS rule weren’t necessary, “as they impose large compliance costs or raise potential technical feasibility concerns.” The agency says that repealing the 2024 MATS amendments would save about $120 million a year in regulatory costs over the next 10 years, or a total of about $1.2 billion.

“The Trump EPA’s proposed repeal of these life-saving clean air protections is dangerous to the health, safety and well-being of all Americans,” Vickie Patton, general counsel of the advocacy group the Environmental Defense Fund, says in a statement. “Power plants are already among the largest sources of mercury, toxic and climate-destabilizing pollution in the nation, and these proposals would allow them to pour more of that pollution into our air. These pollutants are associated with deaths, serious illnesses and hospitalizations, and increased medical costs. The Trump EPA is pursuing this irresponsible action even though we have widely available technologies that allow power plants to reduce pollution with proven cost-effective solutions.”

The US Chamber of Commerce supports the proposed changes. “While we are reviewing the full proposal, the voiding of the prior rule would remove a barrier to producing the electricity generation needed to maintain our domestic energy security and our competitive edge in critical fields like artificial intelligence,” Marty Durbin, president of the US Chamber's Global Energy Institute, says in a statement.

The EPA will hold a public hearing about both proposed rules 15 days after they appear in the Federal Register, and the proposals will be open for public comment for 30 days after the publication date.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/EPA-removes-greenhouse-gas-limits-for-power-plants--revokes-Hg-rule---99552?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-06-12 23:35:36.747110

Under the direction of President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress, however, it is facing significant reforms in the name of efficiency that environmental advocates say could erode the act’s effectiveness.

Multiple actions — including Trump’s executive orders around energy, changes to regulations and guidance, the May Supreme Court decision on the Uinta Basin rail project and Republicans’ budget package — could mean big changes for the act.

Since its passage in the 1970s, NEPA has been lauded as the bedrock for environmental policy in the United States.

“Although we have substantive statutes like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, these are all siloed approaches to addressing the environment,” said Jonathan Skinner-Thompson, an associate professor at the University of Colorado Law School, where he specializes in administrative and environmental law. “Only NEPA requires a comprehensive and holistic review of environmental impacts.”

NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of proposed actions such as issuing development permits, adopting federal land management actions, creating new recreation opportunities, building highways and publicly-owned facilities, and more.

Does NEPA need to change or modernize?

The Republican proposals, directives from the Trump administration and recent court decisions suggest that the act has grown beyond its initial intent and requires reforms to increase the efficiency of environmental reviews.

“NEPA today is used to stonewall any project opposition groups want to deny,” said Melissa Simpson, the newly appointed president of the Western Energy Alliance. “It’s not what Congress envisioned 50 years ago. NEPA needs to be reformed and every producer of energy, regardless of form, recognizes that fact.”

The Western Energy Alliance is a trade group representing oil and gas companies in 13 states, including Colorado, and has supported many of the recent directives around NEPA.

Project 2025 — a conservative playbook written ahead of Trump’s election and inauguration — referred to NEPA as a “tree-killing, project-dooming, decade-spanning monstrosity” that has been abused to “advance a radical climate agenda.”

The plan recommended the administration and Congress make “common sense” reforms to the policy and return it to the initial intent, which it argues was “a short, succinct, timely presentation of information regarding major federal action that significantly affects the quality of the human environment so that decision makers can make informed decisions to benefit the American people.”

One of the reforms recommended in Project 2025 is to eliminate judicial review of NEPA actions, which is targeted in the proposed changes to the policy in the reconciliation bill passed by the House. Environmental advocates argue NEPA could also be impacted by the Supreme Court’s Uinta Basin decision.

The recent proposals and changes have led to rising concerns from lawmakers, communities, and environmental advocates that NEPA could lose some of its most important functions, namely public input, and lead to less rigorous and holistic reviews of proposed actions.

“You really see actions being taken that will weaken NEPA to the point where it won’t have any of its desired effects anymore,” said Paul Sanford, director of equitable access policy at The Wilderness Society. Sanford runs the NEPA team at the advocacy organization focused on public land protection.

What’s happening with NEPA would “obliterate both of the purposes” of the act, he said, adding that first, it ensures that a government agency “bases its decisions on sound science and a careful analysis of the potential impacts” of any action, permit, or decision being made. And second, it provides a mechanism for private citizens to have a voice in government processes.

Some changes to NEPA could have an outsized impact on Colorado’s mountain cities and towns, where public land surrounds communities and economies are centered on tourism and recreation.

Jamie Ervin, the senior policy manager at Outdoor Alliance, a coalition of 10 member-based organizations representing outdoor recreation interests, said the act is “core to how the outdoor recreation community interacts with the public lands agencies.”

“Environmental health is important to (the outdoor recreation) community because we love to get outside, and we don’t want to be in polluted landscapes and developed areas,” Ervin said. “The public comment and public input process that NEPA affords us is often the way that we come to understand what agencies are planning to do on public lands that are valuable for outdoor recreation.”

Concerns about the effectiveness and timeliness of NEPA reviews come through on both sides of the argument about these policy changes. However, both sides offer different explanations for the cause.

“Most of the situations in which delays have occurred can be attributed to one of a number of things that really aren’t NEPA’s fault; there is a shortage of staff and staff time to complete analyses,” Sandford said.

To support this, Sanford cited a 2022 research study , which studied over 41,000 NEPA decisions completed by the U.S. Forest Service between 2004 and 2020. The Forest Service conducts more environmental impact statements than any other federal agency. It claimed that these statements represent less than 1% of all NEPA decisions, but that data on other decisions is limited. The study concluded that delays were most often attributed to staff turnover, inadequate budgets, delays in receiving information from applications and more.

Ervin called it a “myth” that projects always take multiple years, noting “a lot of things happen fairly quickly. However, he indicated that recent workforce reductions won’t help.

“The gutting of the federal land management agencies through budget cuts being proposed is going to severely limit their ability to do rigorous NEPA analysis at all,” he added. “We are open to making (NEPA) more efficient while keeping guardrails in place and achieving the environmental part of its mission.”

In the House Natural Resources Committee’s proposal for the budget reconciliation package, it claimed that NEPA’s environmental analyses have added significant time and cost burdens to development projects. The committee’s report claims that “constant litigation” is one of the main factors contributing to excessive bureaucracy, citing a study from Breakthrough Institute. The California think tank reported that NEPA-related litigation, on average, takes 4.2 years to resolve.

“Activist groups are using federal courts to force limitless environmental reviews that go far beyond the scope of a project,” Simpson said.

She claimed that “on average, it takes 4.5 years to complete an environmental impact statement.”

What changes is NEPA facing?

Pulling back the Council on Environmental Quality’s NEPA regulations

The current administration — aligning with recent court decisions that concluded the Council on Environmental Quality does not have the legal authority to issue regulations and bind federal agencies to their interpretation of NEPA — issued a rule earlier this year removing the council regulations for the act. These regulations historically gave federal agencies a baseline set of rules to adopt.

“The rescission is final and CEQ has reportedly directed agencies to consider updating their existing NEPA rules instead of replacing them with nonbinding guidance as CEQ originally instructed,” Skinner-Thompson said, adding that any regulation changes would be subject to public review and still need to comply with NEPA as written.

It’s too early to tell how this could change NEPA processes, but there are some concerns that it could decrease its potency.

“The (CEQ) regulations ensured a relatively consistent application of NEPA across the federal family,” Sanford said. “I think we’re going to see a greater degree of inconsistency, a greater degree of variance in the way that agencies fulfill their NEPA obligations, and we’re going to see less science and less opportunities for public participation.”

Simpson said the Western Energy Alliance is waiting to see how this changes interagency coordination on projects.

“The implications for a small project like a specific well pad are not as significant as with a major infrastructure that involves multiple agencies,” Simpson said.

Supreme Court narrows scope of NEPA

In late May, a Supreme Court ruling on the proposed 88-mile Uinta Basin Railway narrowed the scope of what environmental impacts an agency is required to analyze under NEPA.

“The decision stressed that NEPA is ‘purely procedural’ and that NEPA does not require agencies to consider upstream/downstream impacts from projects that are separate in time or place from the action that is subject to NEPA review,” Skinner-Thompson said.

In the case, the plaintiffs (Eagle County and five environmental groups) argued that the review of the railway failed to study downstream impacts such as how increased rail traffic would impact wildfire risk and impacts on water resources and other biological resources.

Simpson said the ruling affirms that NEPA has “limits that have been far exceeded by opposition groups and numerous judges.”

“The court made clear NEPA must be limited to the scope of the project at hand and not every potential impact that could be possibly imagined,” she said.

The ruling also reaffirms that courts should defer to agencies on things like “the appropriate scope of analysis under NEPA (and where it should reasonably end),” Skinner-Thompson said, adding that this contrasts with the 2024 Supreme Court Loper Bright ruling that said the opposite.

Sanford warned that the ruling could have significant consequences.

“What’s going to happen is agencies are now sort of authorized to look at things in isolation without taking a look at what’s going to happen down the road,” Sanford said. “That’s going to really open the door to a lot of potential environmental effects that will have adverse effects on people and on communities that will go unidentified and unanalyzed.”

Sanford argued that this will also curtail the ability of individuals to challenge NEPA actions in court.

“It will be more difficult to prove that an agency’s NEPA analysis was insufficient and too narrow to adequately evaluate the environmental impacts of an agency decision,” he said. “A right without a remedy is no right at all, and this has the effect of taking away the public’s remedy.”

Trump’s one big bill proposes big changes to NEPA

Legal review is also threatened in the NEPA changes proposed in Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.”

As proposed, project sponsors could pay a fee to fast-track the NEPA process: one year for an environmental impact statement and six months for an environmental assessment. When sponsors pay the fee — set at 125% of the costs to prepare the assessment — it would also shield the review from judicial review.

The changes were included in the bill that was passed by the House in May and mirrored in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee proposal for the reconciliation package as it now makes its way through the chamber.

The House committee Republicans claimed in a memo that the changes would streamline a NEPA process that has become “increasingly complex, resulting in unwieldy NEPA documents and timelines and increased frivolous litigation.”

As proposed, Simpson said it would “prevent abuse by opposition groups who seek endless judicial reviews as a means to halting economic development.”

However, there are concerns that these changes would dismantle the intended purpose of NEPA.

“If the House bill becomes law, it would essentially neuter the NEPA process (by preventing parties from being able to go to court over a NEPA analysis),” Skinner-Thompson said. “If parties can’t go to court, and if they can’t get an injunction, NEPA won’t really mean anything.”

The fee model would “advantage big developers and companies with a lot of money,” Ervin said.

“And it’s just not how the process is intended to work,” he added.

The fight for the heart of NEPA isn’t over, Sanford emphasized.

“We’re going to continue to fight for those principles and try to ensure that the purposes of NEPA are fulfilled, that agencies make sound decisions based on valid science and that the public has the opportunity to play a role in the process of deciding what happens in their communities,” he said.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2025/06/12144829/PineyLake-CDillmann.jpeg,N,,2025-06-12 23:34:40.712046

The most recent waiver allowed the state to effectively end the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks in the state by 2035.","President Trump signed a resolution blocking California's ban on gasoline-powered vehicle sales.

California plans to sue, arguing the resolution's passing violated existing law.

Supporters say the resolution protects consumer choice and the auto industry, while critics argue it harms the environment and public health.

President Donald Trump has signed a congressional resolution reversing a waiver previously granted to California and other states that would have let them ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles.

At a ceremony at the White House on June 12, Trump said the resolution has the force of law and suggested it can't be challenged in court. But California officials and a coalition of officials from other states on the same day did just that, arguing it was passed in the U.S. House and Senate under a process they say violated existing law.

By signing the resolution, Trump continued to deliver on his promise to tear down rules and regulations promoting the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) nationwide which he and other Republicans argue amounted to a mandate on American consumers regarding which cars and trucks they may buy.

The signing also happened as Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom continue to spar over Trump's decision to send thousands of National Guard members and some 700 Marines to that state in support of efforts to respond to protests against immigration enforcement by the Trump administration. No such military intervention has been ordered into a state by the federal government without the state's request since the 1960s.

Trump said the California waiver, which is provided for under the Clean Air Act, ""has been a disaster for this country."" He added that by signing the resolution, he was moving to ""rescue the American auto industry.""

But Trump repeatedly seemed to suggest that the resolution somehow ends the federal government's requirement to consider and approve California's waivers on fuel emissions standards on cars and trucks except for under narrow legal circumstances. The resolution passed by the U.S. House and Senate only dealt with a waiver granted to California — and more than a dozen other states which are allowed to follow California's lead on car and truck emissions standards — about a month before former President Joe Biden left office in January.

The Trump administration, under Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin, asked Congress to overturn the Biden waiver for California's so-called Advanced Clean Cars II program under the Congressional Review Act, which lets Congress reverse certain agency rules within a short time of their implementation. Most importantly, the Congressional Review Act allows the U.S. Senate to adopt those reversals with a simple 52-vote majority, rather than a 60-vote margin needed to shut down debate.

But the review act has never been applied to California's waivers under the Clean Air Act and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), which provides nonpartisan recommendations to Congress and federal public agencies, has formally said that those waivers can't be considered under that law.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta called Trump's actions ""reckless, politically motivated and illegal.""

California's ability to get waivers to set fuel emissions standards has been in place for decades as a way to fight pollution in a state where smog has been a huge problem. The most recent waiver allowed the state to effectively end the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks in the state by 2035.

Trump signed other resolutions reversing a few other California Clean Air Act waivers, as well, on June 12, including a measure sponsored by U.S. Rep. John James, R-Shelby Township, which overturns California's program to require heavy trucks also emit no greenhouse gases. James attended the signing ceremony and was acknowledged by Trump. The resolution overturning the California program affecting a ban on gas-powered cars and light-duty trucks and SUVs was sponsored by U.S. Rep. John Joyce, R-Pennsylvania.

Trump said his move will save consumers thousands on new cars and trucks, though that may not take into account fuel costs that EVs can save their owners over the lives of their vehicles.

The White House put out a statement June 12 from General Motors with the automaker saying, ""We appreciate the actions taken by President Trump to sign (the resolution) into law and help align emissions standards with today’s market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles.”

GM and other automakers have long argued that California and the states that follow it shouldn't be allowed to effectively decide what kind of cars and trucks they have to make for the whole country. But in more recent years — certainly since the Obama administration stepped in to financially rescue GM and what is now Stellantis in 2009 — automakers have been more willing to work to avoid legal fights over fuel standards with California.

As to the most recent California standards, John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group in Washington, said, “Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic"" and, if they remained in place would be, ""harmful to auto affordability, to consumer choice, to industry competitiveness and to economic activity.""

He credited Trump for ""identifying this problem and doing something about it.""

Meanwhile, American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers and American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers President and CEO Chet Thompson issued a statement calling the resolution, along with others reversing some other vehicle mandates earlier provided to California, ""a major win for the American people.""

Environmental groups criticized the resolution, as they had on its passage last month.

“California’s vehicle standards reduce costs for drivers, increase customer choice, boost domestic manufacturing, improve air quality and help address the climate crisis,"" said Simon Mui, managing director for transportation at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The only losers from cleaner vehicles are oil industry billionaires."" Several officials from the oil industry were on hand as the president signed the resolution.

“Ripping away California’s clean air protections is Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy,” added Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. “Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward big oil and big auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets.""

Graham has opportunity to protect jobs, lower energy costs - Post and Courier",Dan Segovia,,,,,https://www.postandcourier.com/opinion/commentary/lindsey-graham-federal-clean-energy-investments-sc/article_02848c2d-ef9b-4f7f-a63b-1e8db8f4ceb5.html,"I strongly support clean energy investments at both the federal level and in the private sector because they are fueling a clean energy economic boom.
South Carolina has become one of the top destinations for new clean energy investments since federal clean energy tax credits passed in 2022.
The Trump administration has threatened three clean energy projects in South Carolina, jeopardizing over $1.76 billion in clean energy investments and 1,520 jobs.
It also repeals home energy tax credits, which would lead directly to higher energy costs, in addition to good-paying jobs.
Repealing clean energy tax credits would gut America’s clean energy production, raising costs for South Carolina families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs nationwide.","As an Ironworkers member in South Carolina representing over 400 workers, I know firsthand how important clean energy is to making our economy work for all of us. Investments in clean energy have enabled our union locals to create good-paying jobs, and drive down energy costs — something at the top of every South Carolinian's mind — all while helping America maintain our global competitiveness.

The House budget reconciliation bill, however, proposes what amounts to a total repeal of clean energy investments, putting our jobs at risk. As the Solar Energy Industries Association, the primary trade organization for the solar industry, put it: “This proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history.” Let’s be clear: This bill is a direct assault on American manufacturing and American-made energy right here in South Carolina.

I have seen the benefits of clean energy investments myself. With clean energy projects happening across the Carolinas I’ve seen firsthand where these investments affect the workforce and their families in a positive way. Bringing these investments to South Carolinians and their families is a must for growth in this great state.

I strongly support clean energy investments at both the federal level and in the private sector because they are fueling a clean energy economic boom. South Carolina has become one of the top destinations for new clean energy investments since federal clean energy tax credits passed in 2022. Over 22,312 jobs have been created with $14.37 billion in investment, and 7 percent of our state’s energy is powered by clean energy like solar. That amounts to 13.5 gigawatts of operating clean energy capacity, enough to power 450,000 homes.

Unfortunately, we have already seen how extreme Republican attempts to repeal clean energy are impacting South Carolina’s energy supply and jobs. The Trump administration has threatened three clean energy projects in South Carolina, jeopardizing over $1.76 billion in clean energy investments and 1,520 jobs.

These projects include the Envision AESC Battery Manufacturing Facility in Florence County, which would supply battery cells for BMW’s plant in Spartanburg — establishing a homegrown supply chain right here in South Carolina. In February 2025, however, AESC walked back a planned expansion of its ""gigafactory"" due to slower expected growth in EV sales, eliminating over 1,000 expected jobs.

U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has represented us since 2003, has celebrated new clean energy investments in the state, including major EV manufacturing investments from Scout Motors and BMW. The House bill would stifle this growth, putting in jeopardy the $32 billion the clean energy sector was projected to add to South Carolina’s economy over the next decade.

He has also praised clean energy as an engine for increased national security, writing in an op-ed with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, “We are a conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat who disagree on a great many things. We write today, however, to highlight an area of strong agreement: a global transition to renewable energy would greatly assist in our nation’s fight against the world’s most corrupt and illicit regimes. If you could wave a magic wand, and transition the world away from fossil fuels, Americans would instantly be safer.”

On April 9, four of Sen. Graham’s Republican colleagues wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune in support of the clean energy tax credits that have brought direct benefits to so many parts of the country.

“As Republicans committed to strengthening America’s energy security and economic growth, we write to emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development. While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” they wrote in their letter.

This is exactly right. Unfortunately, the House bill will implement unreasonable phase-outs, impossible red tape and restrictions, or outright termination of tax credits for clean energy that together make the tax credits completely unworkable, by design. Simply put, this bill is a full-scale repeal. It also repeals home energy tax credits, which would lead directly to higher energy costs, in addition to good-paying jobs.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would gut America’s clean energy production, raising costs for South Carolina families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs nationwide. President Donald Trump and Republicans promised to lower energy costs. Instead, this legislation would undermine America’s fastest-growing, most affordable energy sources.

Thankfully, Sen. Graham has an opportunity to inject some common sense into this bill and protect clean energy and the jobs that come along with it. Repealing clean energy investments would be bad for American businesses and bad for American workers. I urge Sen. Graham to continue being the leader we need and fix this reckless legislation.

Among today’s decisions, the Commission granted a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) authorizing ConnectGen Chautauqua County LLC to build a 270-MW solar array, with a 20-MW battery storage component, located in Chautauqua County, as well as a CPCN for Prattsburgh Wind, a 147-MW wind project in Steuben County.

“Today’s decisions are clear-cut examples of the state's continued commitment to supporting regional economic development and creating jobs while advancing the clean and renewable energy resources that we all need,” said Commission Chair Rory M. Christian. “We remain hard at work regarding the development of renewable energy facilities across the state.”

The issuance of a CPCN is required for certain utilities and public service industries to operate or construct new facilities or expand existing ones. It ensures that new services and capital expenditures are in the public interest. Taken together, these projects will provide clean energy for more than 292,000 average-sized homes and create significant economic benefits for their communities and New York State totaling more than $215 million, along with more than 625 construction jobs.

The projects are as follows:

ConnectGen Solar: Commission granted a CPCN in connection with the 270-MW solar powered major renewable energy facility, with a 20-MW battery storage component, located in the Town of Ripley, Chautauqua County. This project will provide enough clean energy for 40,000 average-sized homes.

The US prioritizes speed and fossil fuels, while Europe preaches cautious growth aligned with climate goals.

The allies confront a common challenge: AI’s ferocious energy appetite. A recent MIT study warns that the AI revolution may outpace the world’s power capacity. US data centers already consume 4.4% of national power, and consumption could triple by 2030.

The allies disagree on how to respond. In Washington, President Trump has set a clear agenda: unleash fossil-fueled energy to win the AI race. New executive orders proliferate. They fast-track permits for data center power plants, many gas-fired, as part of what officials call an “AI Manhattan Project.” Sixteen potential government-owned sites have been identified for AI mega-centers with dedicated energy supplies. AI’s continued growth without exacerbating ecological damage is unrealistic. For President Trump, speed is paramount, and sustainability goals come second – if at all.

Across the Atlantic, Europe is sticking to its green transition playbook. EU data centers already use about 3% of the bloc’s electricity and consumption could more than double by 2030, adding as much as the power needs of Spain.

Europe’s industrial power costs remain nearly twice those in the US, widening a competitiveness gap. The continent has greenlighted tough, binding climate targets: a 55% emission cut by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. To square these pressures, Brussels is imposing strict reporting and energy efficiency rules for data centers, including mandatory green energy sourcing. The EU insists digital expansion cannot undercut climate commitments.

No country illustrates Europe’s dilemma better than Ireland. Once the continent’s digital darling, Ireland now faces grid strain so severe that data centers consume a fifth of national power, with the figure set to rise in coming years. The state grid operator has imposed a moratorium on new data center connections around Dublin through at least 2028. Irish lawmakers back this pause, fearing it would otherwise jeopardize the country’s renewable goals. Industry, meanwhile, warns of losing out.

Although some data center operators are pushing to build their own private gas turbines to circumvent grid restrictions, these plans face local resistance and permitting delays. Ireland’s experience encapsulates the larger European conundrum: how to balance digital growth with grid stability and decarbonization.

The debate highlights a deep ideological split. Washington’s fossil-fueled surge reflects a bet that near-term energy abundance will cement AI and cloud dominance. This approach echoes broader American energy pragmatism, which has led the US to leverage cheap gas and fast-tracked permits to build data capacity at breakneck speed.

In contrast, Europe’s deliberate expansion – slowed by green mandates and high energy costs – risks eroding competitiveness and ceding ground to US providers. Cloud infrastructure is not just an economic issue but a geopolitical one. Europe’s reliance on American cloud giants could deepen if constrained grid access stifles homegrown data expansion.

Despite the deep divergence, flickers of convergence are visible. Major US cloud computing companies are investing in greener solutions. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have signed massive renewable energy deals. In the US, they are even funding small modular nuclear reactor pilots to decarbonize future data center fleets. In Europe, Amazon’s new Dublin facility pledges to run entirely on green power and to feed waste heat into local heating networks. Already, excess heat from a Microsoft data center north of Amsterdam powers a gigantic greenhouse. A Google data center in Finland provides heat to the local municipality free of charge.

Time will tell if these corporate initiatives emerge as a model for sustainable growth. But the efforts suggest that industry sees climate stewardship not as a luxury but as essential for long-term viability.

Even so, the near-term trajectories are clear. The US is moving fast, even if that means higher emissions, while Europe insists on a slower, greener expansion – despite risking competitiveness. Each side is watching closely: Brussels sees US deregulation as climate backsliding; Washington sees EU caution as self-inflicted digital decline.

Ultimately, the data center boom captures the larger question of how to green the digital economy without sacrificing innovation or energy security. The stakes are high: whoever balances these pressures best may define not just the future of the cloud, but the shape of transatlantic digital power in the AI age.

The House bill introduces provisions that would effectively kill tax credits for clean and advanced manufacturing by making them unusable and sunsetting them early.

The BlueGreen Alliance’s brief concludes that the provisions in the House bill would put at risk nearly 300,000 direct manufacturing jobs in facilities supported by clean manufacturing tax credits, over one million indirect jobs down the supply chain, and nearly 643,000 induced jobs created as a result of the economic stimulus of the direct and indirect jobs.

“These numbers make it even more clear, if this bill becomes law, workers are the ones who will pay the price,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “As this administration blusters about its support for American manufacturing, this bill tells an extremely different story, openly selling out workers to pay for a billionaire tax break.”

Seven states—California, Georgia, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee, Arizona, and South Carolina—have more than 100,000 jobs at risk if the clean manufacturing tax credits are repealed. Notably, President Trump won five of those seven states with the greatest number of jobs at stake in the 2024 election.

Additionally, the brief finds that in several states the manufacturing sector is at the precipice of massive growth under the tax credits. With the tax credits in place, New Mexico, Nevada, and Georgia could all see manufacturing employment grow more than 10%. Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia could all see at least a 5% boost. Without the credits, that future is uncertain.

“The job-creating track record of the clean manufacturing tax credits is undeniable and the changes to them included in the House bill threatens all of that progress,” said BlueGreen Alliance Vice President of Manufacturing and Industrial Policy Ted Fertik. “Every bit of data shows clearly that repealing these credits will hurt working Americans.

Notably, President Trump won five of those seven states with the greatest number of jobs at stake in the 2024 election.

Additionally, the brief finds that in several states the manufacturing sector is at the precipice of massive growth under the tax credits. With the tax credits in place, New Mexico, Nevada, and Georgia could all see manufacturing employment grow more than 10%. Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia could all see at least a 5% boost. Without the credits, that future is uncertain.

“The job-creating track record of the clean manufacturing tax credits is undeniable and the changes to them included in the House bill threatens all of that progress,” said BlueGreen Alliance Vice President of Manufacturing and Industrial Policy Ted Fertik. “Every bit of data shows clearly that repealing these credits will hurt working Americans. We hope the Senate will see reason and reverse these damaging provisions.”",https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/a9155917-8e73-4f22-af77-f33b949478b1,N,,2025-06-12 23:32:37.974884

Natural gas-powered electricity generators have been the leading source of electricity in the country since 2016.

Combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs), known for their efficiency and flexibility, continue to play an essential role in maintaining grid stability in the US.

These units can quickly adjust output levels in response to fluctuations in demand and supply, which is increasingly important as renewable energy sources become more prevalent within the power mix.

A CCGT has a lifespan of between 25 and 30 years, which can be extended by upgrading, repairing and maintaining the components.

Despite this, only one new CCGT unit was commissioned in 2024 – an addition at Plaquemines liquefied natural gas export terminal, contributing 98MW.

This slowdown reflects a growing emphasis on renewables such as solar, wind power and battery storage systems, spurred by their decreasing costs and supportive federal policies that incentivise green investments.

Developers have scheduled additions totalling 1.6GW of CCGT with completion in 2025 alone.

This includes projects such as the Intermountain Power Project in Utah and Magnolia Power in Louisiana that will feature hydrogen co-firing capabilities, with a 1.5GW combined capacity.

The 1,100-page bill would slash incentives for green technologies such as solar, wind, batteries, electric cars, and heat pumps while subsidizing existing nuclear power plants and biofuels. That would leave the country and its people burning more fossil fuels despite strong popular and scientific support for a rapid shift to renewable energy.

The bill may still be revised by the Senate before it moves to a final vote. But it is a picture of how President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans want to reshape U.S. energy policy.

As an environmental engineering professor who studies ways to confront climate change, I think it is important to distinguish which technologies could rapidly cut emissions or are on the verge of becoming viable from those that do little to fight climate change. Unfortunately, the House bill favors the latter while nixing support for the former.

Renewable energy

Wind and solar power, often paired with batteries, are providing more than 90% of the new electricity currently being added to the grid nationally and around the world. Geothermal power is undergoing technological breakthroughs. With natural gas turbines in short supply and long lead times to build other resources, renewables and batteries offer the fastest way to satisfy growing demand for power.

However, the House bill rescinds billions of dollars that the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, devoted to boosting domestic manufacturing and deployments of renewable energy and batteries.

It would terminate tax credits for manufacturing for the wind industry in 2028 and for solar and batteries in 2032. That would disrupt the boom in domestic manufacturing projects that was being stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Deployments would be hit even harder. Wind, solar, geothermal, and battery projects would need to commence construction within 60 days of passage of the bill to receive tax credits.

In addition, the bill would deny tax credits to projects that use Chinese-made components. Financial analysts have called those provisions “unworkable,” since some Chinese materials may be necessary even for projects built with as much domestic content as possible.

Analysts warn that the House bill would cut new wind, solar, and battery installations by 20% compared with the growth that had been expected without the bill. That’s why BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, called the bill a “nightmare scenario” for clean energy proponents.

However, one person’s nightmare may be another man’s dream. “We’re constraining the hell out of wind and solar, which is good,” said Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican backed by the oil and gas industry.

Efficiency and electric cars

Cuts fall even harder on Americans who are trying to reduce their carbon footprints and energy costs. The bill repeals aid for home efficiency improvements such as heat pumps, efficient windows, and energy audits. Homeowners would also lose tax credits for installing solar panels and batteries.

For vehicles, the bill would not only repeal tax credits for electric cars, trucks, and chargers, but it also would impose a federal $250 annual fee on vehicles, on top of fees that some states charge electric-car owners. The federal fee is more than the gas taxes paid by other drivers to fund highways and ignores air-quality and climate effects.

Combined, the lost credits and increased fees could cut projected U.S. sales of electric vehicles by 40% in 2030, according to modeling by Jesse Jenkins of Princeton University.

Nuclear power

Meanwhile, the bill partially retains a tax credit for electricity from existing nuclear power plants. Those plants may not need the help: Electricity demand is surging, and companies like Meta are signing long-term deals for nuclear energy to power data centers. Nuclear plants are also paid to manage their radioactive waste, since the country lacks a permanent place to store it.

For new nuclear plants, the bill would move up the deadline to 2028 to begin construction. That deadline is too soon for some new reactor designs and would rush the vetting of others. Nuclear safety regulators are awaiting a study from the National Academies on the weapons proliferation risks of the type of uranium fuel that some developers hope to use in newer designs.

Biofuels

While cutting funding for electric vehicles, the bill would spend $45 billion to extend tax credits for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.

Food-based biofuels do little good for the climate because growing, harvesting, and processing crops requires fertilizers, pesticides, and fuel. The bill would allow forests to be cut to make room for crops because it directs agencies to ignore the impacts of biofuels on land use.

Hydrogen

The bill would end tax credits for hydrogen production. Without that support, companies will be unlikely to invest in the seven so-called hydrogen hubs that were allocated a combined $8 billion under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021. Those hubs aim to attract $40 billion in private investments and create tens of thousands of jobs while developing cleaner ways to make hydrogen.

The repealed tax credits would have subsidized hydrogen made emissions-free by using renewable or nuclear electricity to split water molecules. They also would have subsidized hydrogen made from natural gas with carbon capture, whose benefits are impaired by methane emissions from natural gas systems and incomplete carbon capture.

However it’s made, hydrogen is no panacea. As the world’s smallest molecule, hydrogen is prone to leaking, which can pose safety challenges and indirectly warm the climate. And while hydrogen is essential for making fertilizers and potentially useful for making steel or aviation fuels, vehicles and heating are more efficiently powered by electricity than by hydrogen.

Still, European governments and China are investing heavily in hydrogen production.

Summing it up

The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that the House bill would cut the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits by about half, saving the government $50 billion a year. But with fewer efficiency improvements, fewer electric vehicles, and less clean power on the grid, Princeton’s Jenkins projects American households would pay up to $415 more per year for energy by 2035 than if the bill’s provisions were not enacted. If the bill’s provisions make it into law, the extra fossil fuel burning would leave annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 1 billion tons higher by then.

No one expected former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to escape unscathed with Republicans in the White House and dominating both houses of Congress. Still, the proposed cuts target the technologies Americans count on to protect the climate and save consumers money.

The savings for “Americans” will go entirely to power plant operators who won’t have to cut their pollution, while at the same time climate and health benefits for all Americans that are 20 times larger in dollar terms will be deleted.

The EPA announcement makes good on Trump’s campaign trail promise to “unleash American energy” and open “dozens and dozens” of power plants.","Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claimed on Wednesday that its plan to eviscerate power plant pollution standards will save the US about $1bn a year. In reality, though, this represents a starkly uneven trade-off, experts say.

The savings for “Americans” will go entirely to power plant operators who won’t have to cut their pollution, while at the same time climate and health benefits for all Americans that are 20 times larger in dollar terms will be deleted.

“The massive cost to the public compared to the minuscule benefits is breathtaking,” said Charles Harper, power sector campaigner at green group Evergreen Action. “The costs will be borne by the American people who will breathe dirtier air and those around the world suffering from climate change. The benefits will go to a very small group of donors. Perhaps they should change the name of the agency if they are no longer about protecting the health of Americans.”

The EPA is proposing to entirely ditch all restrictions on planet-heating emissions coming from US power plants, the second largest source of carbon pollution in the country, while also weakening a separate regulation designed to limit the amount of harmful toxins, such as mercury, seeping from these power plants into Americans’ air, water and soils.

These restrictions were imposed by Joe Biden to “advance the climate change cult” and the “green new scam”, according to Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, at an unveiling of the rollbacks on Wednesday that did not mention any benefit to the environment or public health.

“Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence,” said Zeldin, who touted the need for “beautiful clean coal” and for the US to develop artificial intelligence, neither a core EPA responsibility.

In justifying its decision, the EPA has claimed that power plant emissions “do not contribute significantly” to the climate crisis – despite US electricity generation being one of the largest single sources of such pollution in the world – and that the rollbacks will save the country $19bn over two decades, or about $1.2bn a year.

However, this “saving” is entirely for the benefit of power plant operators who won’t have to install technology to reduce hazardous pollution, rather than the broader public. The EPA has said overall electricity costs will go down, too, but did not provide a figure on any estimated savings from this.

By contrast, the existing climate rule for power plants, put in place by Biden last year, was previously estimated by the EPA to save the US $370bn by the 2040s, at about $20bn a year, via climate and public health benefits. The rule is also expected to slash more than 1bn tons in carbon emissions and save thousands of lives from reduced air pollution.

Experts said that the vast 20 to one discrepancy in benefits, and who they flow to, represents a damaging favor given to the fossil fuel interests that have strongly backed Trump, at the expense of the American public.

“The only people who benefit from these rollbacks are the biggest emitters of toxic pollution who don’t want to install cleaner technologies,” said Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, a group composed of former EPA staff. “American families will pay the cost of these rollbacks in higher healthcare bills from emergency room visits, missed work days and missed school days. This proposal is scientifically indefensible and represents a complete abdication of EPA’s responsibilities under the Clean Air Act.”

Under Trump, the EPA has set about dismantling an array of clean air and water protections and adopted the president’s agenda of boosting fossil fuel production. The agency argues that casting off such regulations will bolster the economy and save money for households.

“Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of base load power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the artificial intelligence capital of the world,” said an EPA spokesperson. “Regulatory costs are inherently regressive – placing a heavier burden on those who can least afford it. These costs are ultimately borne by consumers in the form of higher utility bills and rolling blackouts.”

But critics warn that the EPA’s traditional purpose to protect public health and the environment is being rapidly eroded.

“EPA’s proposal to stop regulating emissions of greenhouse gases and mercury from US power plants reflects Trump’s breathtaking willingness to sacrifice public health and progress against climate change in the service of the nation’s worst polluters,” said John Holdren, who served as Barack Obama’s science adviser. “In this and so many other ways, Trump and his enablers are doing their best to drive this country off a cliff.

“American jobs, economic competitiveness, health, environment, national security, and standing in the world are all in peril from Trump’s ignorance and reckless disregard for the public good,” said Holdren, who now co-directs the science, technology and public policy program at Harvard University’s Belfer Center.

The EPA announcement makes good on Trump’s campaign trail promise to “unleash American energy” and open “dozens and dozens” of power plants.

It came as part of Trump’s assault on pollution regulations. Taken together, his administration’s planned environmental rollbacks – including of power plant and tailpipe emission standards and clean energy incentives from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – will result in 22,800 additional pollution-related deaths and a $1.1tn reduction in US GDP by 2035, a University of Maryland study published on Thursday found.

Julie McNamara, an associate director at the science, climate and health-focused advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists, said Zeldin’s Wednesday proposal was “shameful”.

Now, Morrisey said, “this action by Administrator Zeldin restores constitutional order and delivers long-overdue relief to states like West Virginia that have been unfairly targeted for years.” Congressman Riley Moore, R-W.Va., also expressed support for the Trump administration rollback of the environmental standards.
AEP said the prior EPA standards “would have threatened our ability to do so by requiring the use of unproven technology.","Senator Shelley Moore Capito is applauding the Trump administration’s move to roll back a major Biden era climate policy that was aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, especially those fired by coal and natural gas.

“I think the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, 2.0 again, returns us to common sense,” Capito said in a briefing with West Virginia reporters, responding to a question by Charles Young of West Virginia News.

The prior standards rolled out by the Biden Administration’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency would have required utilities to either reduce or capture emissions tied to climate change. One way of complying with the rules could be through the use of carbon capture technology, but that traditionally has been too expensive for viability.

EPA had said its new standards for coal- and gas-powered plants would avoid emissions of up to 617 million metric tons of total carbon dioxide (CO2) through 2042. The proposals would also result in cutting tens of thousands of tons of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide, the agency said at the time.

“This rule that the Biden administration put forward basically has onerous enforcement mechanisms that would basically retire every coal plant, if not before 2035, then by 2035 unless they’re capturing 90% of the carbon emissions, which is not achievable at this point,” Capito said today.

“Also natural gas — same thing. We are looking at a shortage of power in this country. We need more power, not less. And yet this Clean Power Plan would pull some of our base load power off the grid, and I think would really put us in a perilous situation.”

The Trump administration this week announced plans to roll back the policies sometimes referred to as Clean Power Plan 2.0. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the move is necessary because Obama and Biden-era standards were “regulating coal, oil and gas out of existence.”

The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the original 2015 Clean Power Plan in West Virginia v. EPA, holding that the major questions doctrine barred EPA from leveraging the Clean Air Act to manipulate Americans’ energy choices and shift the balance of the nation’s electrical fuel mix.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey, whose office was central to the legal fight against the first Clean Power Plan when he was attorney general, also praised the Trump administration move.

“As Attorney General, I fought back against the Green New Deal and led a national coalition of states in the legal battle to stop the Clean Power Plan, securing a historic and unprecedented stay from the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016,” Morrisey said in a statement.

Now, Morrisey said, “this action by Administrator Zeldin restores constitutional order and delivers long-overdue relief to states like West Virginia that have been unfairly targeted for years.”

Congressman Riley Moore, R-W.Va., also expressed support for the Trump administration rollback of the environmental standards.

“The Biden-Harris war on affordable, reliable American energy ends today. By reversing these job-killing regulations, President Trump and Administrator Zeldin make it clear: the Green New Scam is over and American energy dominance is back,” Moore said in a statement.

“These EPA regulations would have shuttered every coal-fired power plant in America, bankrupted many coal mines, laid off thousands of coal miners, and driven up the cost of electricity for every American.”

American Electric Power described being committed to working with state and federal policymakers to find solutions for delivering affordable, reliable electricity to customers.

AEP said the prior EPA standards “would have threatened our ability to do so by requiring the use of unproven technology. We appreciate that the administration recognized the impact of this regulation and took action.

“We look forward to engaging in the rulemaking process by collaborating with stakeholders to provide robust comments during EPA’s comment period. This effort is critical for ensuring an outcome that will enable us to deliver dependable, affordable power to the communities we serve.”",https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/John_Amos-power-plant-e1665216399357.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:33:48.964997

$2 million in community investments over the next decade starting with a $320,000 commitment to Centro La Familia Advocacy Services, a nonprofit supporting crime victims, family wellness and civic engagement in rural communities.

More than 2,000 prevailing-wage construction jobs to support the local workforce throughout the construction period, which will last from 18 months to three years.

An estimated $169 million in economic benefits to the local area over the project’s lifetime, estimated at 35 years.

“Today’s clean energy projects must do more than just deliver megawatts. They should create value in the communities where they’re built,” said CEC Commissioner Noemí Gallardo. “This project exemplifies a community-focused approach that advances the state’s energy goals while creating benefits for local workers and residents.”

The Darden project builds on a series of clean energy records recently set in California. On three out of every five days last year, California’s main grid hit 100% clean energy for some portion of the day. That momentum continues in 2025. So far this year, the main grid has reached 100% clean energy on 138 of 151 days, or 91% of days through May. In 2024, the state added 7 GW of clean energy capacity to the grid – the largest single-year increase in state history – and added 25 GW of capacity over the past five years.

United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, repesenting the largest auto worker union in the country, is a card-carrying liberal.

He campaigned for former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in her run against Trump and called Trump a scab, a derogatory term for a worker who crosses a picket line during a strike. He also warned that a Trump presidency would be bad for the country.

But since Trump has taken office, Fain's tune has changed.

It turns out that Trump's tariff policy is actually really good for the U.S. auto workers that Fain represents.

""We’re in a triage situation,"" Fain told ABC earlier this year. ""Tariffs are an attempt to stop the bleeding from the hemorrhaging of jobs in America for the last 33 years.""

The U.S. auto industry, including manufacturing and dealerships, employed over 2 million Americans last year. Over 1 million of those jobs were in vehicle and parts manufacturing.

The U.S. auto industry peaked in the 1970s, producing about 10 million vehicles annually.

Despite the population growing by more than 60% since then, car manufacturers produced just 10.6 million vehicles in the U.S. in 2023.

Tariffs incentivize companies to bring production home to avoid import taxes.

One of Detroit's Big 3 automakers just made a $4 billion commitment to do just that.

General Motors spends $4 billion to bring manufacturing to the U.S.

General Motors (GM) said earlier this year that auto tariffs will wipe out between $4 billion and $5 billion in EBITDA this year.

But GM CEO Mary Barra still backed the taxes, saying, “For decades now, it has not been a level playing field for us automakers globally, with either tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers. So I think tariffs is one tool that the administration can use to level the playing field.“

However, only 52% of the 2.7 million vehicles GM sold globally last year were “made in the USA.“

Of the Big 3, GM isn't even ahead of Stellantis (57%), a multinational conglomerate based in Europe, in terms of domestic production.

Ford leads the way, with 77% of the cars it sells originating from the States.

But this week, GM announced a move that could change all of that.

GM says it plans to invest $4 billion to move its Mexico production to three plants in the U.S., including the recently closed Orion Assembly plant in its hometown of Detroit.

“We believe the future of transportation will be driven by American innovation and manufacturing expertise,” Barra said in a statement. “Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the U.S. and to support American jobs. We're focused on giving customers choice and offering a broad range of vehicles they love.”

According to The Detroit News, GM will build full-size SUVs and light-duty pickups at the Orion plant, which closed in 2023.

According to the report, the move is partly due to increased demand for high-margin SUVs and partly due to Trump's tariffs.

Closing plants in Mexico and moving production to the states is a long process, and the shift in production is not expected to take effect until 2027.

Ford also backs Trump tariffs

GM isn't the only company facing a billion-dollar charge from U.S. tariffs.

Ford revealed that the tariffs will shave at least $1.5 billion off the company's EBITDA this year, but CEO Jim Farley also praised Trump's handling of tariffs.

Ford ""supports the administration's goal to strengthen the U.S. economy by growing manufacturing.""

Car dealers are worried, and it could be great news for car buyers

One reason Ford supports the tariffs is that it already has a much stronger domestic production base than its domestic competitors.

""Last year, we assembled over 300,000 more vehicles in the U.S. than our closest competitor. That includes 100% of all our full-size trucks,"" CEO Jim Farley said during the company's last earnings call.

""In this new environment...automakers with the largest U.S. footprint will have a big advantage, and boy, is that true for Ford,"" he added.

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption interest is the lowest it has been since 2019, with the percentage of consumers indicating they would be “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to purchase an EV rising from 51% to 63%, according to an AAA survey.

The biggest barriers against consumers making the transition to fully electric vehicles are high battery repair costs (62%) and purchase price (59%). According to AAA’s 2024 Your Driving Cost analysis, EVs had the second-highest total ownership costs due to depreciation, purchase prices and finance charges. Additionally, consumers have been able to take advantage of tax credits by purchasing EVs, but 12% cited the potential reduction or elimination in tax credits and rebates as a barrier to buying.

Other top concerns identified in this year’s survey were the perceived unsuitability of EVs for long-distance travel (57%), a lack of convenient public charging stations (56%) and fear of running out of charge while driving (55%).

While convenience-store chains continue to add EV chargers to their locations to curb the lack of public charging stations, the pullback on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) federal funding is hurting the number of chains that can do so.

“There's not really a business model there to make a large investment without grant funding because it's a large capital investment, and the business volume is just not there right now,” Tom Healy, vice president of facilities development and maintenance at Nouria told CSP in May. The Worcester, Massachusetts-based convenience-store chain has 183 locations, 13 active EV chargers and 26 additional EV chargers expected to be installed by the end of 2025 that have not been affected by the pause on federal funding.

Public chargers cost approximately $3,500 per connector for Level 2 chargers and $38,000 to $90,000 per connector for direct current (DC) fast chargers, with higher costs depending on power output, according to the according to the Department of Energy. That’s not including installation costs, which average around $2,500 per connector.

Other concerns include safety. Twenty-seven percent reported challenges installing charging stations at their residences.

More than 75 EV model options have been introduced in the past four years, AAA said.

Despite advancements in the EV industry and the growing availability of models, public perception regarding the future of EVs remains uncertain. The percentage of U.S. drivers who believe that most cars will be electric within the next ten years has significantly declined from 40% in 2022 to 23% this year, according to AAA's survey.

On the other hand, 16% of U.S. adults report being “very likely” or “likely” to purchase a fully EV as their next car. More than 75 EV model options have been introduced in the past four years, AAA said. The biggest push toward consumer interest in EVs is high gas prices, and in 2022, when gas prices reached $5, 77% of consumers cited that as their top motivation to purchase.

The national average for a gallon of regular ranges from $3 to $3.50, or even higher in depending on the state, according to AAA, but the primary reasons for buying EVs remain similar this year, with respondents citing gas savings, environmental concerns and an appreciation for the lower maintenance costs associated with EVs.

According to last year’s Your Driving Cost analysis by AAA, EVs had the lowest fuel cost of any vehicle type, based on a national average electricity price of 15.9 cents per kilowatt hour. EVs also had the lowest maintenance costs among all models.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-06/background/sunset-ev.jpg?VersionId=LzjW8aKeS4JnxJ7IKC4jyT8VUp5a.3E4,N,,2025-06-12 23:30:01.191901

BACKGROUND

In the 118th Congress, Rep. Griffith chaired the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations.

In the 119th Congress, Congressman Griffith is serving his first term as chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment.

The Environment Subcommittee’s first two hearings of the year focused on the EPA’s regulation of chemical manufacturing and the administration of the Brownfields Program.

Later, Congressman Griffith welcomed Administrator Zeldin for a subcommittee hearing on EPA’s FY26 budget request.

This week, Congressman Griffith held a hearing that examined the impacts of the Clean Air Act.

While these rules are not finalized, the EPA estimates that repeal of the power plant rules would save $19 billion in regulatory costs over two decades beginning in 2026.

Congressman Griffith’s Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to repeal a last-minute Biden-Harris regulation on tire manufacturers passed Congress this year. In May, President Trump signed the resolution into law.

Based on information from JERA, the HOA’s term is more than 20 years, and it will entail up to 1 mtpa of LNG.
Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility has four fully operational trains with an aggregated nominal production capacity of around 16.5 mtpa of LNG.","Japan’s energy major JERA has finalized multi-year agreements with four U.S. players relating to the purchase of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the country’s export projects in a bid to fortify Asia’s energy security.

The deals include sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) with NextDecade Corporation and Commonwealth LNG, as well as heads of agreement (HoA) with Sempra Infrastructure and Cheniere Marketing.

The Japanese player says the 20-year agreements are in line with its long-term strategy to build a diversified and resilient LNG procurement portfolio in support of stable, secure energy for Japan and Asia.

Under these, the Japanese major will procure up to 5.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG from the United States. The deals’ total value is said to exceed JERA’s cumulative equity investment in the North American country, which amounts to $6 billion.

This is said to be the largest U.S. LNG offtake by a single buyer to date, and Japan’s largest ever from the United States since the country first imported LNG from Alaska in 1969.

All volumes will be delivered on a free on board (FOB) basis with no destination restrictions. JERA believes this will help it optimize shipping routes and respond flexibly to evolving market conditions and LNG demand across the Asia-Pacific region.

The event announcing the deals was held at the U.S. Department of Energy headquarters in Washington, D.C., on June 12. It was attended by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Christopher Wright, and Ambassador of Japan to the United States of America, Shigeo Yamada, among others.

JERA Global CEO and Chair Yukio Kani said: “After more than 15 months of strategic evaluation and commercial engagement, we are pleased to finalize the Agreements with U.S. suppliers, which offer unique flexibility and reliability – essential elements in our diversification strategy.

“These agreements strengthen Japan’s energy security, reaffirm the U.S.’s leading role in the global LNG market, and support long-term sustainable economic development for both countries.”

The SPA with NextDecade, which entails 2 mtpa from Train 5 at the Rio Grande LNG (RGLNG) project, for 20 years, was announced in late May. The deal is subject to a positive final investment decision (FID) being taken on Train 5.

The non-binding HOA with Sempra for 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG is tied to the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project in Jefferson County, Texas.

“We are pleased to collaborate with JERA, Japan’s largest power generation company and one of the world’s largest LNG buyers, as they continue to work with the United States to diversify their sources to help strengthen the resilience and dependability of their energy supply,” said Justin Bird, CEO of Sempra Infrastructure.

The U.S. player is targeting a final investment decision (FID) for Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 this year, once the necessary permits and funding, among other things, are secured.

With a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 mtpa, the Trains 1 and 2 forming part of Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 are expected to come online in 2027 and 2028, respectively. The groundbreaking ceremony for Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was held in March 2024.

As part of Phase 2, Sempra proposes to expand the liquefaction-export project with Trains 3 and 4, which could double the total nameplate capacity of the facility to up to 26 mtpa.

The next deal, an SPA with Commonwealth LNG, encompasses the Japanese player’s purchase of 1 mtpa of LNG for 20 years from the 9.5 mtpa Commonwealth LNG liquefaction and export facility currently under development in Cameron, Louisiana.

“We look forward to our partnership with JERA, a recognized global energy leader who shares our commitment to low-cost energy with the lowest carbon footprint,” said Ben Dell, Managing Partner of Kimmeridge and Chairman of Commonwealth LNG.

The SPA will become fully effective once customary conditions are met, including a positive FID for the project, targeted for Q3 2025. Following this, the first LNG production is expected in 2029. Commonwealth says 4 mtpa from the facility has been booked under long-term agreements.

A 20-year deal with an undisclosed buyer, described as a major Asian energy company, to buy 1 mtpa of LNG for 20 years from the future facility, was announced in early May.

Located on the west bank of the Calcasieu Ship Channel, near Cameron, Louisiana, Commonwealth LNG is set to have five 50,000-cubic-meter (cbm) storage tanks, accommodating vessels up to 216,000 cbm.

The developers expect the facility to unlock approximately $11 billion in total investments in Louisiana and an estimated $3.5 billion in annual export revenue. Furthermore, around 2,000 workers are expected at the peak of construction, providing 275 jobs when the facility begins operations in 2029.

The deal with Cheniere is related to the Corpus Christi LNG facility in Texas and the Sabine Pass LNG facility in Louisiana. Based on information from JERA, the HOA’s term is more than 20 years, and it will entail up to 1 mtpa of LNG.

The six-train Sabine Pass facility, which has been in liquefaction mode since 2016, currently has a 30 mtpa LNG production capacity, processing over 4.7 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas into LNG, which is stored in five tanks.

As part of the Stage 5 expansion project, Cheniere proposes to boost this by adding two large-scale liquefaction trains, each with a nameplate capacity of approximately 7 mtpa and a maximum production capacity of approximately 8.43 mtpa.

Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility has four fully operational trains with an aggregated nominal production capacity of around 16.5 mtpa of LNG.

The U.S. player plans to expand this by adding seven ​midscale trains that will add more than 10 mtpa of production capacity, bringing CCL’s total permitted capacity to more than 25 mtpa. The first LNG from Train 1 as part of Stage 3 was produced in December 2024, with substantial completion reached in March 2025.

Two additional midscale trains as part of this stage are expected to achieve substantial completion in 2025, and the remaining four in 2026.

Additionally, Cheniere is developing two more midscale trains (Train 8 and 9) with an expected total production capacity of approximately 3 mtpa of LNG next to the CCL Stage 3 project. A positive environmental assessment from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was received in 2024, and the U.S. player hopes to get all remaining necessary regulatory approvals for the project this year.",https://cdn.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/04/10174305/Commonwealth-LNG-facility-in-Louisiana-1024x576-1.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1744299785,N,,2025-06-12 23:53:56.921408

At issue are clean energy credits that were enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, known as the IRA, and largely eliminated in the version of the bill that the House passed.

The bill would halt roughly $522 billion in investments approved in the IRA from being spent in communities across the country.

The House bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles, and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment, among other changes.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say they are fielding calls from advocates and energy industry leaders concerned that without significant changes from the Senate, Americans will face higher energy bills and less jobs.

And the credits are already becoming fodder for political attacks. Groups like Protect Our Jobs, a political action committee spending money advocating for clean energy jobs, is funneling money into ads targeting House Republicans who supported the reconciliation bill.

""I'm a Republican, but now I'm seeing Republicans in Washington try to eliminate jobs like mine,"" says an electrician working in solar energy in one ad.

""How [tax credits] go is important"" says GOP senator looking at House bill

A handful of GOP senators are advocating against a slash and burn approach on the energy credits.

GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas cautioned against a ""full-scale repeal of current credits"" in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

""Many American companies have made substantial investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure based on the current energy tax framework,"" they wrote in the letter. ""A wholesale repeal, or termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.""

In an interview with NPR, Sen. Curtis said he is having good conversations with other Senate Republicans who are ""very receptive"" to his concerns about the House bill.

""I think it's really important that Senate Republicans — and I wish House Republicans — look at this not from the standpoint of 'it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad', but rather what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy and make good, thoughtful decisions,"" Curtis said.

He stressed the need to consider how to support business owners who had been making plans under the IRA.

""One of the worst things that we do to businesses is inconsistency and unpredictability. And therefore, I argue for a kind of appropriate off ramp,"" he said. ""If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees of those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.""

Outside analysts say businesses are already feeling the impact. E2, a nonpartisan, pro-environment business group, has been tracking clean energy project announcements and jobs for over two years. The group's executive director, Bob Keefe, told NPR the market began responding before the House legislation was even written.

""Since January alone, we've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects — clean energy, electric vehicle related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects — $14 billion worth of business investment canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill,"" he said.

E2 estimates more than 10,000 announced jobs have been canceled because of concerns over the House bill.

""The House just pulled the rug out from all of those businesses who had been already investing and planning for this by saying that these tax credits were going to get repealed. And so, quite naturally, businesses are pulling back,"" Keefe said, noting the biggest states for clean energy projects are red states. ""If the Senate doesn't fix it, our economy is going to suffer.""

Group of House Republicans also wants changes

Senators aren't only hearing from industry leaders, they're also hearing from Republicans in the House.

""We had some good conversations with a handful of senators and have been having ongoing conversations,"" said Rep. Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa., who wants to see the Senate make adjustments to the House bill he voted for.

""The energy credits are very big for northeastern Pennsylvania,"" he told NPR. ""I'm OK with the phase out, but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from essentially underneath them.""

Bresnahan is one of 13 Republican House members who sent a letter last week to Senate leadership, urging the chamber to ""substantially and strategically improve our clean energy tax credit provisions"" from the House-passed bill.

The group lists concerns about restrictions of transferability of some credits, the 60-day time limit for enacting projects and other issues.

""This approach jeopardizes ongoing development, discourages long-term investment, and could significantly delay or cancel energy infrastructure projects across the country,"" the letter reads. ""Without a clear signal from Congress encouraging continued investments and offering business certainty as these provisions are phased out, project cancellations will continue to snowball.""

Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

""What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator to those who support innovation or are concerned about not jacking up prices and understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is a kind of Republican idea,"" Wyden told NPR.

But changes passed in the Senate would require approval in the House, and any major adjustments could jeopardize the delicate balance of support that allowed GOP leaders to force the bill through last month. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has repeatedly warned senators to tread lightly when it comes to changes in the bill.

Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania are applauding two Trump administration proposals that opponents say would upend Biden-era rules that aim to reduce climate-warming emissions and toxic air pollutants from power plants, harming human health.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday said the proposals aim to bolster President Donald Trump’s goal to “restore American energy dominance.”

Zeldin accused the Biden administration of strangling the power industry and “suffocating” the economy to protect the environment. He argued the EPA’s new rules would save the energy sector more than $1 billion a year, and reduce rate payers’ electricity bills.

“[The Biden administration sought to] make all sorts of industries, including coal and more, disappear — regulate them out of existence,” Zeldin said.

“We will use coal for power generation, to mine for critical minerals, and to export to our allies. Today, we are taking an important step towards putting America back on track.”

The first proposal would repeal a Biden-era rule that aimed to phase out greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel plants. The proposal rejects what is known as the “endangerment finding,” which is the scientific basis for the agency’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The announcement marks the latest move in a continued effort to roll back former President Joe Biden’s efforts to tackle climate change.

The second proposal would amend the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which under the Biden administration became more restrictive.

Known as MATS, the regulation requires plants to reduce emissions of toxic pollutants such as mercury, which is linked to neurological damage among children. Zeldin said the proposal would revert the rules to 2012 standards, which he argues were effective at reducing mercury emissions.

Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser, who represents north central Pennsylvania’s 9th District, said repealing the Biden-era regulations would strengthen energy production in the state.

“Repealing these Biden-era rules will help so many businesses continue to operate, expand, invest, and allow the United States to become truly energy dominant again,” Meuser said.

Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who represents northeast Pennsylvania’s 8th District, called Biden-era rules a “nail in the coffin” for the state’s energy markets. He said the construction of new natural gas plants would be “virtually impossible” under current Biden environmental regulations.

Both Meuser and Bresnahan represent areas with active natural gas production.

Bresnahan, who has invested in more than 20 fossil fuel companies, pointed to the demand for data centers in Pennsylvania as a reason to provide more support to the power industry.

“Between data centers AI and the growing domestic manufacturing base, the simple fact is we need more electrons on the grid to power all of this.”

The proposals, which will go out for public comment before being finalized, are likely to face legal challenges.

An Associated Press investigation found the Trump administration proposals target environmental rules that could save an estimated 30,000 lives.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said the proposals would impact human health and worsen climate change. The environmental organization threatened legal action if the EPA finalized the rollbacks.

“Power plants are the largest industrial source of carbon emissions, spewing more than 1.5 billion tons of greenhouse gases annually,” the NRDC said in a statement. “The EPA claims this pollution is insignificant – but try telling that to the people who will experience more storms, heat waves, hospitalizations and asthma attacks because of this repeal.”",https://www.witf.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/epa-administrator-lee-zeldin-ap-031225-1620x1080.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:37:31.953039

A time traveler visiting from the 1960s might be somewhat disappointed by the state of technological progress in 2025. There are no flying cars, no space hotels, no robot butlers.

But even though they can’t fly, cars are going through a major transformation from loud, jerky, smelly gas guzzlers to sleek electric vehicles (EVs) that quietly hum along roads. Nearly one in five new cars sold in 2023 were electric or plug-in hybrids, according to an International Energy Agency report.

The thing holding back EV adoption right now—besides the relatively high sticker price—is how long it takes to charge the battery, according to industry analyst Sam Adham of the research firm CRU Group.

EVs charge slowly. For some owners, the only practical way to charge is being parked for hours— say, overnight or while they’re at work. That’s very different from the gas and diesel vehicles people are used to, which can be refueled in 5 min or so. The fastest chargers can add enough juice in 15 or 20 min to get someone to their next stop, but that’s not the same as filling up the tank.

For someone living in an apartment building or a dense city neighborhood, without a place they can charge overnight, owning an EV might not be practical if they can’t charge it quickly. Likewise, a delivery company might not be able to justify a fleet of electric vans that have to charge for hours when they could be moving products.

It didn’t used to be this way. “Ten years ago, no one cared about fast charging,” says Venkat Srinivasan, a battery researcher at Argonne National Laboratory. The accepted definition of fast charging has changed in the past decade, he says: 15 min used to be considered fast enough, but car buyers are now demanding 5.

Fast battery charging is also a benefit to the companies that make charging stations. Faster charging means they can sell more energy to more customers in the course of a day. (Many companies also price fast charging higher.)

There’s no ‘perfect’ battery for electric vehicles yet, and honestly, there might never be one single ideal solution.

Chong Yan, battery researcher, Beijing Institute of Technology

Making a battery that charges faster is not simple; it requires understanding the shortcomings of each component down to the molecular level. Nor is it easy to scale up a new battery’s manufacturing to millions of units. Experts agree it’s unlikely that one battery chemistry or technology will emerge to fit every need.

“There’s no ‘perfect’ battery for electric vehicles yet, and honestly, there might never be one single ideal solution,” says Chong Yan, a battery researcher at the Beijing Institute of Technology. “It’s all about trade-offs,” which can include lifespan, safety, environmental impact, and vehicle range and charging time, he says.

In simple terms, a battery consists of two electrodes and a conductive material between them. When a battery is hooked up to a circuit—whether that’s a flashlight bulb or an electric car motor—redox reactions inside the cell move electrons and ions out of one electrode, known as the cathode, and into the other, the anode. In the recharging process, these reactions are reversed.

The cathode hasn’t seen radical changes over the years. Two of the most widely used classes of cathode materials—layered oxides, such as lithium nickel magnesium cobalt oxides (NMC); and polyanion oxides, like lithium iron phosphate oxides (LFP)—are descendants of the ones that John Goodenough, Arumugam Manthiram, and their colleagues developed at the University of Oxford and the University of Texas at Austin decades ago. These cathode materials work relatively quickly.

Getting the lithium ions to dissolve in the electrolyte and cramming them into the anode are significantly slower steps, Srinivasan says.

In addition to those components, rechargeable batteries in EVs require computers. The battery in an EV is not a single pair of electrodes but hundreds or thousands of cells wired together. Usually called a battery management system (BMS), the computer handles the flow of electricity to and from each cell to optimize performance and maintain the safety of the whole battery.

Most of the parts of the battery system are fair game for upgrades, and most of them have been improved since lithium-ion batteries came into production. At the moment, the ubiquitous graphite anode is probably getting the most scrutiny. “Graphite is the bottleneck,” says Ping Liu, a chemical engineer at the University of California San Diego.

Graphite’s layered structure and conductivity, as well as its low cost and toxicity, make it an obvious choice as an electrode material. But its 2D structure limits the paths that lithium ions can travel in and out. Argonne’s Srinivasan likens it to 1,000 people trying to leave a meeting hall through the same set of doors.

One solution could be to add more exits. Researchers at the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory have tried drilling holes in graphite as small as 5 µm wide with lasers. These channels give the anode more surface area for ions to enter and exit. In a patent, the researchers reported that they could charge a battery more than three times as fast when using the drilled-out electrode.

Others are looking for different materials. Silicon is a leading candidate. Like graphite, it’s abundant, inexpensive, and poses little health or safety risk.

Batteries made with silicon can theoretically carry more energy in the same volume. Graphite can hold one lithium ion for every six carbon atoms, because the ions intercalate in the hexagonal pores in its sheets. In silicon anodes, the ratio is closer to 1:4.

One glaring problem with silicon is its lack of durability. A pure silicon anode swells in size by more than 300% when populated with lithium ions. A graphite anode, by comparison, grows by about 10% in volume.

Swelling can lead to cracking—not just of the anode but of the battery’s other components, and especially when the anode swells quickly, as happens in a fast-charging battery. That can damage the battery in the short term, but it can also reduce a battery’s overall lifespan, perhaps by years, Srinivasan says. Researchers don’t yet have good real-world data to say with certainty how long batteries with silicon will last. And EV buyers might not want faster charging if it means replacing their battery pack—or their whole car—sooner.

It might be possible to get the best of both worlds using silicon-doped graphite. OneD Battery Sciences, founded in 2013, has developed a catalytic process that grows silicon nanowires inside the pores of graphite particles. The firm is now trying to license the technology to battery makers.

CEO Vincent Pluvinage explains that in OneD’s anodes, both the graphite and the silicon store lithium ions. The ions move about 4.5 times faster into and out of the silicon than they do with graphite, he says, which is what allows faster charging. At the same time, the strength of graphite ameliorates silicon’s swelling problems. Graphite also effectively moves current in and heat out. Heat can contribute to degrading the battery.

OneD opened a pilot plant to make its anode material in Washington state in 2024 and has announced a partnership with Koch Modular Process Systems to build a larger plant, though they haven’t said where or when. But given how long it takes for manufacturers to incorporate new technology into production vehicles, Pluvinage says, it will likely be at least 2030 before these batteries could make it into EVs.

Silicon isn’t the only option. UCSD’s Liu cofounded California-based Tyfast, which is working on a lithium vanadium oxide anode. The start-up received a grant from a US Department of Energy ARPA-E (Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy) program called EVs4ALL, whose goal is a battery that can charge to 80% capacity in 5 min.

Metal oxide anodes, which several of the program’s grant recipients are exploring, have layers that can open up to let ions in and out more quickly, says EVs4ALL director Halle Cheeseman.

Tyfast’s lithium vanadium oxide batteries have lower energy density than the batteries currently used in EVs—meaning a pack with the same range would weigh more—but they charge very quickly. The company claims that its battery can fully charge in 10 min. Liu’s group attributes the speed to lithium ions rapidly hopping through the anode crystal between tetrahedral LiO4 sites and octahedral LiO6 sites (Nature 2020, DOI: 10.1038/s41586-020-2637-6).

While these bulkier batteries would reduce the range of passenger EVs significantly, Liu says their lower energy density would be less of a drawback in commercial vehicles. Trucks used in mining and other industries are already heavy, so a larger battery pack makes less of a difference.

Another group funded by EVs4ALL is exploring a glassy material. Project leader Anne Co of the Ohio State University would not share details but says the group, which includes collaborators at Honda and Argonne National Lab, has a paper in review. The team’s goal is to make smaller battery packs that have shorter range but charge quickly enough to be convenient.

Co says smaller packs would also help keep the vehicles affordable. But she acknowledges that battery makers outside the US have already beaten her group’s cost targets. It’s a real question if batteries made in the US can be cost-competitive at all, she says.

EVs4ALL is also funding research on sodium- and potassium-ion batteries. Lithium has been the first choice for rechargeable batteries in large part because it is so light. Heavier elements mean heavier battery packs and less range.

Cheeseman says that while both sodium and potassium batteries charge quickly, sodium ones don’t hold enough energy for today’s EVs. But potassium-ion batteries look more promising: they pack more energy than sodium-ion batteries and can charge more quickly than lithium-ion batteries because potassium ions diffuse faster through electrolyte.

Battery makers are also improving charging performance without necessarily introducing new materials. For instance, the Chinese battery company CATL announced last year that it was using an old chemical in its cathodes but processing it in a new way: pressing powdered LFP onto conductive foil rather than binding LFP particles together with adhesives. By making the electrode thinner, CATL reduces the electrical resistance, according to Adham, the industry analyst.

CATL has not disclosed details about the battery, which is called Shenxing Plus, but claims that it can recharge 600 km of range in 10 min at CATL’s proprietary fast-charging stations. That’s 50% more range in the same amount of time than CATL’s last generation of LFP batteries, which the firm announced in 2023.

Other simple ways to speed up battery charging don’t have that much to do with the battery materials themselves. Like most reactions at the lab bench, the reactions that allow lithium ions to move in and out of the electrodes happen faster at higher temperatures. Thus, the battery can charge faster when the battery is hotter—although unwanted side reactions that can degrade batteries also happen faster at higher temperatures.

Tesla enables this higher-temperature charging in a somewhat sneaky way. When a driver pulls up the navigation app to find the closest Tesla fast charger, the BMS computer lets the battery start to heat up more than it would under normal conditions. When the car pulls up to the charger, the warmer battery can be charged faster.

Another seemingly easy solution is to charge batteries at higher voltage, pumping more current into a battery. In March, the car and battery maker BYD announced a new charger that it says can give an EV a range of 400 km after being plugged in for 5 min. The 1,500 V system depends on silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor chips in the car’s on-board charging system. SiC chips can handle higher temperatures and voltages than chips made with silicon alone.By way of comparison, Tesla’s fastest chargers operate at 1,000 V. BYD is one of many companies using SiC chips; its cars can also preheat their batteries before fast charging.

Using higher voltage does charge batteries faster, but it can also speed up battery degradation. Lithium ions flooded with electrons can convert to lithium metal that deposits on an electrode’s surface. (Although researchers understand the conditions under which this happens, they are still working on understanding exactly why.)

Those deposits are usually irreversible, meaning that less overall lithium and therefore less energy is available to move between the electrodes. And in the worst case, these deposits form spiky structures called dendrites that can pierce the barrier between the cathode and anode and short-circuit the battery.

BYD’s software likely mitigates the damage enough to ensure the battery’s long-term health, according to Adham, the industry analyst. He says the new chargers may be meant primarily as a demonstration of the advantages of BYD’s LFP battery packs and not something most drivers will be using in the near term. Charging at 1,500 V wouldn’t be widely available until new infrastructure was built.

One last battery component that researchers are trying to optimize is the electrolyte solution that ions pass through as the battery charges and discharges. The Beijing Institute’s Yan focuses his energy on perfecting these ion solutions, because solvents can be a bottleneck. During fast charging, if lithium ions can’t move smoothly through a solvent, they create traffic jams and build up just outside the anode.

Lighter cosolvents, such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, can improve performance. A 2023 study from Dalhousie University found that using methyl acetate as the solvent for LiPF6—a common salt in electrolyte solutions—had doubled the conductivity of a conventional electrolyte for fast charging (J. Phys. Chem. C. 2020, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c02370).

Argonne’s Srinivasan welcomes these potential improvements in chemistry—some commercially impractical, some incremental, and some more promising. He tries to be realistic about what the path to the 5 min fill-up will be.

Zooming out, he predicts that the solutions will come in three phases: First will be software, such as Tesla’s preheating. Second will be architecture, such as CATL’s pressed LFP powder. The third, which seems not to have arrived quite yet, will be new materials and new chemistry.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/Fast-charging-battery---91662?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-06-12 23:30:07.054956

The Congressional Review Act resolutions, passed by Congress in May, aim to overturn California’s ambitious climate regulations, including its rules phasing out gas-powered passenger vehicles, limiting tailpipe emissions from trucks, and restricting nitrogen oxide pollution from medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles.

At a White House signing ceremony, Trump denounced California’s regulations as “crazy,” saying, “It’s been a disaster for this country.” He also criticized the cost of EV infrastructure and expressed skepticism about electric vehicle performance, though he added, “I like Tesla,” referencing Elon Musk’s EV company.

California officials responded swiftly. State Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the state’s lawsuit against the federal action during a news conference held before the White House ceremony concluded. “The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. Ten additional states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined California in the lawsuit.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major automakers, supported Trump’s action. “Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, in a statement.

However, California Gov. Gavin Newsom strongly condemned the move, calling it an “all-out assault” on both California and national clean energy goals. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a president who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters,” Newsom stated.

California has historically held authority under the Clean Air Act to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal guidelines through waivers granted by the Environmental Protection Agency. That authority has been a repeated point of contention between California and federal administrations. Trump revoked California’s waiver authority during his first term, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022.

Congressional Republicans used the Congressional Review Act to advance the resolutions, despite a determination from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office that California’s rules cannot be legally overturned via that process. The Senate parliamentarian upheld the GAO’s conclusion.

California’s influence extends beyond its borders, as the state represents about 11% of the U.S. car market and has led a coalition of approximately a dozen states adopting similar zero-emission vehicle mandates.

The signing comes amid broader Trump administration efforts to roll back environmental regulations. On June 11, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and natural gas-fueled power plants.

Dan Becker, director at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the signing “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy,” accusing the administration of “rewarding Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets.”

Trump, who has made revitalizing domestic auto manufacturing and expanding oil and gas production central to his platform, framed the action as restoring consumer choice. “If you want to buy electric, you can buy electric,” he said. “What this does is it gives us freedom.”

But older Hyundais and most other electric cars still use the Combined Charging System plug and need adapters to connect to Tesla chargers.
In recent years, failure rates at Tesla stations hovered around 2 or 3 percent when only Tesla cars charged there.","Since Tesla installed its first Superchargers in 2012 for the exclusive use of its customers, owners of other electric cars have often felt like second-class citizens. They have wandered in search of electric oases in desolate parking lots, often making desperate calls to help centers after becoming stymied by balky or broken chargers.

It’s no surprise, then, that consumers rank problems with public electric vehicle charging and the time it takes to fuel up as their top two reasons for rejecting electric vehicles, according to J.D. Power.

But help may finally be at hand.

Automakers and charging companies are building new stations and updating their cars to allow drivers to more easily and quickly recharge their vehicles. They are also outfitting charging stations with more amenities like food and bathrooms while making the devices more reliable. And because chargers are only as fast as the cars they connect with, automakers are designing new cars to absorb electricity at Usain Bolt-level speeds. In addition, many automakers have cut deals with Tesla allowing owners of other cars access to the company’s fast-charging network, the largest in the country and widely considered the most reliable.

There is early evidence that efforts to improve electric vehicle charging are paying off.

In recent years, J.D. Power surveys showed that about 20 percent of attempts to charge electric vehicles at all public stations ended in failure because of faulty chargers, long lines or payment glitches. But in the first three months of 2025, overall failure rates fell to 16 percent, the biggest improvement since the surveys began in 2021.

“The industry is finally elevating as a whole,” said Brent Gruber, an executive director at J.D. Power.

The number of chargers has also increased. There were about 55,200 fast chargers in the United States in May, up from 42,200 a year earlier, according to federal data.

In February, a former Phillips 66 gas station in Apex, N.C., near Raleigh, became the first “Rechargery” from Ionna, a company created by eight automakers, including General Motors, Hyundai Motors, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Their chargers can deliver up to 400 kilowatts of juice, far more than Tesla’s 250-kilowatt Superchargers. Some cars can replenish a battery in 30 minutes or less at the higher charging speeds.

When connected to chargers of 350 kilowatts or more, including those at Ionna and Electrify America, another fast-charging network, a Hyundai Ioniq 5, for example, can fill its electric “tank” from 10 to 80 percent in 18 minutes. That adds up to 220 miles of driving range, enough for more than three hours of highway cruising. That’s quick enough to keep a road trip on schedule, and the family refreshed.

Ionna stations offer 24-hour service. The network has installed lighted canopies over chargers, and drivers can wait in lounges equipped with WiFi, coffee bars and bathrooms while their vehicles are plugged in.

Seth Cutler, Ionna’s chief executive, said the stations seek to transform an experience that many electric drivers dread. Public chargers are sometimes installed in sketchy places, including besides dumpsters in shopping malls and in dingy parking lots with no bathrooms or refreshments nearby.

“Charging an E.V. takes a little time, so this is a place somebody might actually want to be in the middle of the night, and there’s something to do while they’re there,” Mr. Cutler said. “People definitely don’t want to be somewhere that feels unclean or unsafe.”

Ionna aims to install 10 to 12 fast-charging stalls per station. Chargers can connect directly to Teslas and vehicles that use the Combined Charging System plug, which is used by most other automakers. Since February, Ionna has opened 14 stations in several states, and has acquired 200 sites around the country. Its target is to build a total of 30,000 charging bays by 2030.

More cars and charging stations are expected to have plug-and-charge capability in the coming months.

Gas stations and restaurants have also improved their charging game. Buc-ee’s, the Texas-based gas chain that is famous for its sprawling stores and myriad food options, is working with Mercedes to offer “premium” charging that is powered by renewable energy. Waffle House plans to begin installing BP Pulse fast chargers next year. And G.M. and EVgo, a charging company, are building 500 stations with 2,000 stalls at Pilot and Flying J travel centers.

Olabisi Boyle, an Ionna board member and Hyundai’s senior vice president of product and mobility, said her company and other automakers were committed to improving access to charging. Automakers have realized that “E.V. charging wasn’t just a thing you did on the side,” Ms. Boyle said. “It’s the future of the customer experience.”

But that doesn’t mean the complications and problems will easily be dispensed with, especially when it comes to making cars and chargers play nicely with each other.

Nearly every major automaker is redesigning their cars with plug outlets and software that are compatible with Tesla chargers. The North American Charging Standard, developed by Tesla, offers a further advantage of slimmer, lighter handles that are easier to plug into cars, including for seniors or people with disabilities. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 S.U.V.s are now shipping with those ports from a new factory in Georgia. But older Hyundais and most other electric cars still use the Combined Charging System plug and need adapters to connect to Tesla chargers.

Compatibility issues between cars and chargers that use different charging standards have begun to show up in surveys about how many charging sessions end badly. In recent years, failure rates at Tesla stations hovered around 2 or 3 percent when only Tesla cars charged there.

But since the automaker opened its chargers to cars from other brands, that rate has risen to 7 percent, according to J.D. Power. Mr. Gruber noted that those failure rates included drivers who gave up after encountering lines at chargers. Some Tesla drivers have expressed unhappiness at having to share chargers with other car brands.

Rajiv Diwan, who helped spearhead a charger rollout for the New York Power Authority, called the industry’s coalescing around Tesla’s plug standard “a great move for the American market.” But Mr. Diwan said other charging competitors did not appear to be moving fast enough to build stations to meet rising demand. He said the companies were often hamstrung by onerous construction and electricity costs and bureaucratic delays.

“The industry always sugarcoats things, but charging is still hard for the average person to understand and deal with,” he said. “People just want to get from Point A to Point B with as little fuss as possible, and that’s not happening yet.”

Momentum may also be short-circuited by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress, who have proposed repealing many federal incentives for electric cars and trucks. The administration has also stopped issuing grants to states to help build chargers under the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program created during the Biden administration.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/09/multimedia/00biz-ev-charging-qjkp/00biz-ev-charging-qjkp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:30:10.809549

Addressing urban climate challenges

Urban Forests as Climate Shields, authored by Ava G Halstead, Joaquin D Rodriguez Alvarez, and Michael Lake, outlines the growing evidence that tree canopies serve as cost-effective, multi-functional solutions to some of the most pressing urban climate challenges.

The authors argue for a systemic reframing of urban forestry within city planning and policy. Moving beyond aesthetics, they propose urban forests be treated as a climate adaptation priority, requiring integrated governance, long-term funding, and data-driven implementation.

Drawing on global case studies and supported by Leading Cities’ QBE AcceliCITY programme – recognised as one of the top three govtech accelerators globally – the article explores the role of urban forestry in reducing heat island effects, managing stormwater, improving air quality, and enhancing the social and ecological resilience of cities.

Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment and the Herbert and Joyce Morgan Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, and one of America’s most prominent energy experts, said:

“Energy cooperation between Canada, Mexico and the United States is vital for the Western World’s energy security. Both President Trump and Prime Minister Carney share energy as a key priority for their respective administrations.

“The G7 should embrace energy abundance by cooperating and committing to a rapid expansion of energy infrastructure. Members should commit to streamlined permitting, including a one-stop shop permitting and environmental review process, to unleash the capital investment necessary to make energy abundance a reality.”

North America’s energy industry is continentally integrated, benefitting from a blend of U.S. light crude oil and Mexican and Canadian heavy crude oil that keeps the continent’s refineries running smoothly.

Daniel Dufort, president and CEO of MEI, weighed in:

“The abundance and complementary of Canada and the United States’ energy resources have made both nations more prosperous and more secure in their supply. Both countries stand to reduce dependence on Chinese and Russian energy by expanding their pipeline networks – the United States to the East and Canada to the West – to supply their European and Asian allies in an increasingly turbulent world.”

Each day, Canada exports 2.8 million barrels of oil to the United States. These get refined into gasoline, diesel and other higher value-added products that furnish the U.S. market with reliable and affordable energy, as well as exported to other countries, including some 780,000 barrels per day of finished products that get exported to Canada and 1.08 million barrels per day to Mexico.

A similar situation occurs with natural gas, where Canada ships 8.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to the United States through a continental network of pipelines. This gets consumed by U.S. households, as well as transformed into liquefied natural gas products, of which the United States exports 11.5 billion cubic feet per day, mostly from ports in Louisiana, Texas and Maryland.

Under this scenario, Europe would buy more high-value light oil from the U.S., whose domestic needs would be back-stopped by lower-priced heavy oil imports from Canada, whereas Asia would consume more LNG from Canada, diminishing China and Russia’s economic and strategic leverage over the continent.",https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:53:59.298895

While taking those actions, Mr. Trump has declared dubious national emergencies to invoke powers rarely sought by his predecessors.
And Mr. Trump has attacked and sought to undermine the counterweights to his own authority in government, actions that critics have particularly focused on when accusing Mr. Trump of pursuing an autocratic or monarchical style of power.
Since the start of the Trump administration, FEMA has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to a former senior official.","The Senate passed bipartisan legislation last year to substantially broaden the scope of that law — called the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA — beyond Cold War-era victims to cover others who have been harmed by the aftereffects in the decades since.

But after Republican leaders refused to allow it to come to a vote on the House floor, the law expired, dashing hopes of compensation for sickened civilians.

Senate Republican leaders are now, at the behest of Mr. Hawley, giving the measure another shot at passage, including it in the Senate version of the domestic policy bill that they are hoping to pass in weeks. He is considered a key vote on the bill because he opposes several provisions floated by his party for cutting Medicaid.

“I think about, in the St. Louis area alone, how many folks I’ve talked to whose grandfathers or grandmothers were involved with the radiation project and whose families have subsequently had cancer in the family for generations,” Mr. Hawley said in an interview. “And they’re very proud of their service to the nation, but they would like to be thanked for that and be treated appropriately and not lied to anymore by their government.”

The measure would revive the law and authorize its compensation fund to run for another two years. It would also expand eligibility to include civilians in the swaths of New Mexico, Utah and Arizona that were previously excluded from benefits coverage. And it would for the first time allow residents in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and Alaska — sites where workers processed uranium for the nation’s nuclear program — who were exposed to nuclear contamination to be eligible for benefits.

Mr. Hawley’s involvement in the issue stems from St. Louis’s history with the atomic bomb. Scientists first began churning out uranium for the Manhattan Project in 1942 at the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works factory there.

But over the next several decades, hundreds of thousands of tons of radioactive waste stored in open steel drums were hauled and dumped across the city. The waste seeped into the city’s soil, including on land that later became ball fields, and into Coldwater Creek, a tributary that snakes through the metropolitan area for 19 miles through backyards and public parks. Rare cancers, autoimmune diseases and other mysterious illnesses have since spread through the community.

Lawmakers like Mr. Hawley have maintained that the government should help foot residents’ health care bills.

Asked whether the inclusion of the measure might encourage him to support his party’s domestic policy bill despite his concerns about the legislation’s Medicaid provisions, Mr. Hawley suggested that it could.

“This will really dramatically increase the availability of health care for people in my state,” he said. “If you are a RECA claimant, if you are a nuclear radiation survivor, then you’re going to get a lot of help with your medical bills here. So what this is going to mean, practically in Missouri, is a lot of people are going to get a lot more access to health care, which is really, really important.”

Mr. Hawley continued: “So, I still have concerns about Medicaid, and believe me, I’m talking about those on an almost hourly basis now with my leadership. But this is a big, big deal, and not just for my state. This is going to be a big deal for a lot of people, and it’s going to help a lot of people get health care.”

In its statement announcing the withdrawal, the White House made no mention of the affected tribes and portrayed the issue falsely as revolving around “speculative climate change concerns.”

The tribes had called for the dams to be breached as a way to restore the salmon population, a proposal that has faced intense pushback because of the potential costs. A study found that removing the four dams was the most promising approach to restoring the salmon population, but also reported that replacing the electricity generated by the dams, shipping routes and irrigation water would cost between $10.3 billion and $27.2 billion.

The 2023 agreement from the Biden administration, a memorandum of understanding with the tribes that brokered a 10-year truce in the legal battles, committed $300 million to Washington, Oregon and the tribes to restore the wild salmon population. The Biden administration allocated another $60 million to the effort last year.

But the Biden administration did not take a position on the most contentious proposal of breaching the dams. The agreement called for additional study of the proposal and committed to supporting clean energy projects that could replace the power generated by the dams. However, the Biden White House noted in a statement that any decision and authority to breach the dams “resides with Congress.”

In a statement explaining the withdrawal, the Trump White House characterized the agreement, and other executive actions by the Biden administration, as opening the door to breaching the dams. The Trump administration argued in effect that the agreement resulted in significant amounts of money being spent to ultimately close down the hydroelectric dams — as well as other adverse effects noted in studies of the proposal.

Tribal leaders and Democratic lawmakers in the Pacific Northwest immediately denounced the withdrawal, while Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho and a longtime opponent of the effort to breach the dams, praised Mr. Trump’s decision in a statement as “a return to sound science and common-sense.”

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said in a statement that the deal between the tribes and the federal government “was the result of years of painstaking work” and that “the Trump administration’s senseless decision to tear it up is a betrayal of our tribes and a tremendous setback for the entire Northwest.”

Gerald Lewis, the chairman of the tribal council of the Yakama Nation, said in a statement that his tribe was “deeply disappointed” by the decision, adding that the termination of the agreement also cancels the Biden administration’s investment in tribal energy projects.

“The administration’s decision to terminate these commitments,” Mr. Lewis said, “echoes the federal government’s historic pattern of broken promises to tribes, and is contrary to President Trump’s stated commitment to domestic energy development.”

Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe, did not directly criticize Mr. Trump, saying instead in a statement that the agreement was “a vision for preventing salmon extinction” in the Columbia River Basin and that “it is a vision we believe is supported, publicly or privately, by most people in the Northwest.”

Fish populations in the region have fallen sharply since 15 tribes from the Columbia River Basin entered into legally binding treaties with the United States in the mid-19th century. Those treaties reserved sovereign and inherent rights, including the right to fish at traditional locations, on and off reservation lands, and to protect fish at those locations.

While many products have become subject to higher import taxes since Mr. Trump began implementing his aggressive trade policy, Thursday’s announcement marked one of the first times this year that everyday consumer goods were specifically targeted. The result will also apply to imported dishwashers, dryers, stoves and food waste disposals, and could translate into higher costs for American households.

Thursday’s move came one week after the Trump administration doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum products — and it follows wave after wave of similar moves that have targeted cars, auto parts and other goods from many of America’s trading partners. The government said that the action was necessary to address “trade practices that undermine national security.” The new tariffs are meant to shield American-made appliances that are made with steel from cheaper foreign-made products.

Internal Error

The higher metal levies have already rankled close allies that sell to the United States, including Canada, Mexico and Europe. They have also sent alarms to automakers, plane manufacturers, home builders, oil drillers and other companies that rely on buying metals.

They are beginning to ripple across supply chains.

Companies that use steel and aluminum to manufacture products like washing machines and dishwashers in the United States have had to pay higher costs for the steel and aluminum they purchase. That, in turn, makes their products more expensive — and less competitive with appliances made in other countries, where manufacturers may not be subject to the same tariffs.

So the Trump administration created what it called an “inclusion” process to allow U.S. manufacturers that use steel and aluminum in their factories to petition to have tariffs applied to their foreign competitors’ goods as well. Those tariffs will in theory help protect U.S. appliance manufacturers against foreign factories that can purchase steel and aluminum more cheaply, and therefore sell their goods at lower prices.

Despite Mr. Trump’s tariffs, measures of inflation have so far remained muted. Price increases were relatively stable last month, government data showed on Wednesday, and the costs of appliances in particular have increased more slowly than overall inflation did last month.

Economists caution, however, that the growing list of tariffs could begin to push up prices more noticeably later this year.

Mr. Trump’s economic advisers have tried to downplay the economic toll their trade actions take on American consumers.

At a Senate hearing on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that many companies are opting against passing the costs of tariffs onto their consumers and said that inflation remains under control.

“Inflation in the U.S. is at its slowest pace since 2021 on decelerating cost increases for shelter, food, and energy,” Mr. Bessent said. “After four years of price increases diminishing the U.S. standard of living, inflation is showing substantial improvement due to the administration’s policies.”

In his first term, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made washing machines in a bid to bolster domestic manufacturers. Economic research found those tariffs encouraged companies to shift more manufacturing into the United States, but at very steep cost to consumers: About 1,800 new jobs were created, but consumers paid, in total, about $817,000 per job.

And the tariffs drove up not just the cost of washing machines, but also dryers — which were not subject to tariffs, but are often purchased together.

Economic studies of the steel tariffs from Mr. Trump’s first term have come to similar conclusions, finding that the levies stimulated the domestic industry but also at significant costs. An analysis published in 2023 by the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent, bipartisan agency, found that the metal tariffs encouraged buyers of steel and aluminum to purchase more from American sources, and expanded U.S. steel and aluminum production by about $2.25 billion in 2021.

But they raised production costs for firms making automobiles, tools and industrial machinery, which use large amounts of metal in their manufacturing. That shrank production in those and other downstream industries by about $3.48 billion in 2021, more than offsetting the gains to metal makers.

“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” he said. Mr. Trump for decades has owned luxury hotels, an industry with a strong immigrant labor force.

Mr. Trump then blamed the Biden administration for allowing “criminals” to apply for jobs on farms. “We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA.”

Later, at a news conference, he took an uncharacteristically sympathetic tone toward immigrants who work on farms and in the hospitality industry.

“Our farmers are being hurt badly by, you know, they have very good workers, they have worked for them for 20 years,” he said. “They’re not citizens, but they’ve turned out to be, you know, great. And we’re going to have to do something about that. We can’t take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don’t have maybe what they’re supposed to have, maybe not.”

He later said that there would be an “order” soon on the matter.

“We can’t do that to our farmers and leisure, too, hotels,” he said. “We’re going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.”

The comments came as the Trump administration was accelerating its crackdown on immigration with a focus on workplaces with undocumented workers, such as farms, restaurants and construction sites. Last Friday, immigration raids in Los Angeles’s garment district set off protests that have spread to cities across the country.

Brian Kovak, an economics and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, wrote in an email in April that deporting large groups of undocumented immigrants would cause a shock to major industries.

“It takes time and resources to recruit workers from other locations or occupations, and firms may need to raise wages and benefits to attract them, which will likely lead to higher prices for US consumers,” he wrote. “President Trump’s statements suggest that he is aware of this likely disruption and hopes to mitigate it.”

Mr. Trump made similar comments about farmers during a cabinet meeting in April.

“If they have strong recommendations for their farms, for certain people, we’re going to let them stay in for a while,” he said at the time. “Work with the farmers, and then come back and go through a process, a legal process, but we have to take care of our farmers.”

Leticia M. Saucedo, co-director of the Labor and Community Center of the Greater Capital Region at U.C. Davis School of Law, said in April that the government has long listened to complaints from the agricultural industry and tailored policy as a result.

In the past, she said, “the federal government has heeded the requests of growers and other employers to exempt their workers from restrictive immigration policies,” including a program in the 1940s that allowed Mexican farmworkers to enter the United States for more than two decades.

Mr. Trump’s softer tone did not last long. By Thursday afternoon, he was back to celebrating his immigration crackdown.

“I campaigned on, and received a Historic Mandate for, the largest Mass Deportation Program in American History,” he wrote. “Polling shows overwhelming Public Support for getting the Illegals out, and that is exactly what we will do.”

He continued, “A king would say ‘I’m not going to get this.’ A king wouldn’t even have the California mandate to even be talking,” referring to the joint resolutions of Congress that he had just signed blocking California’s effort to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles.

“No, no. We’re not a king,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re not a king at all, thank you very much.”

In February, Mr. Trump likened himself to a king in another fight with Democrats in a blue state. As Mr. Trump sought to end congestion pricing for vehicles in New York City, the president declared on social media “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!”

The official White House account on X, the social media website, amplified the message with an illustration of Mr. Trump wearing a crown. A federal judge later blocked Mr. Trump from attempting to end congestion pricing while the courts weighed in — demonstrating one of the constitutional checks to presidential power.

Mr. Trump’s effort to distance himself from his own suggestions of royal prerogative come as he has plowed forward with a maximalist view of presidential power in his second term, and has at times hosted official White House events that featured royal flourishes and monarchical claims to religious legitimacy.

He has issued sweeping pardons to rioters convicted of violent crimes that occurred during the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in addition to many other pardons of political allies who had been convicted of felonies.

He has also issued more than 150 executive orders, some of which attempted actions that courts ultimately found beyond his power. He has purged the government of officials perceived as his political enemies — and bragged about it to his supporters. He has run roughshod over federal agencies in ways that judges have said exceed his authority and frozen funds that Congress had already appropriated. While taking those actions, Mr. Trump has declared dubious national emergencies to invoke powers rarely sought by his predecessors.

And Mr. Trump has attacked and sought to undermine the counterweights to his own authority in government, actions that critics have particularly focused on when accusing Mr. Trump of pursuing an autocratic or monarchical style of power.

He has relentlessly attacked judges who have ruled against him, sidelined Congress’s role in making decisions about taxes and spending, steamrolled internal limits on the executive branch and used the levers of government to try to force outside centers of power like law firms and universities to submit to his will.

And the military parade scheduled for Saturday is the latest example of Mr. Trump’s desire to flex military might in openly political displays and surround himself in the pageantry of the armed forces. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that any protesters who assembled during the parade would be met with “very big force,” making no distinction between violent confrontations and constitutionally protected peaceful demonstrations.

The organizers of the “No Kings” marches have said that they intentionally had not scheduled demonstrations in Washington, D.C., on Saturday to order to avoid the military parade, instead encouraging demonstrators in the area to join their flagship march in Philadelphia.

His resignation came after other senior staff members have left and a day after President Trump said he would wind down the federal agency by November.

“We want to wean off of FEMA and we want to bring it down to the state level,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday during a news briefing in the Oval Office. “We think after the hurricane season we’ll start phasing it out.”

Mr. Trump also warned states to expect “less money” from the federal government for disaster recovery. And, he said, the money would come directly from the president’s office.

That would be a substantial change from the current system, under which FEMA vets applications from states, localities and individuals for grants and direct payments to recover from disasters.

If a state gets hit by a hurricane or other extreme weather, “the governor should be able to handle it,” Mr. Trump said. “And frankly, if they can’t handle it, the aftermath, then maybe they shouldn’t be governor.”

The National Response Coordination Center is considered FEMA’s 24-hour war room, where planning for responses to disasters occurs. It coordinates the federal, state and local responses, handling things like the deployment of search and rescue teams, assisting hospitals that have to evacuate, and shipping food and water to emergency sites.

The center’s management is particularly critical now during Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1 and is expected to be above average, with a prediction of 17 named storms. Summer and fall are the most challenging seasons for FEMA because of hurricanes, wildfires and other threats.

Mr. Greenberg, who gave two weeks’ notice, did not respond to a request for comment. The FEMA media office issued a statement saying it “recognizes the departure of several employees who have played a part in the operation of FEMA under its former focus,” but did not mention Mr. Greenberg by name.

The statement said the agency has “the right leadership in place to remain focused on our mission” and that FEMA is “fully prepared for Hurricane season.”

Mr. Greenberg’s resignation was first reported by CBS News.

FEMA deploys staff members to disaster areas across the country to support recovery efforts. But in recent months, agency employees, as well as the state and local authorities, have expressed concerns that staff reductions are already endangering the government’s ability to do its job.

Since the start of the Trump administration, FEMA has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to a former senior official. Last month, the head of FEMA was dismissed, and several senior officials have left, including MaryAnn Tierney, who was second-in-command.

“I will not be complicit in the dismantling of this agency, and while I would implement change — even radical change — the current approach lacks a clear end state or plan, and has been done recklessly without regard to our current statutory or moral obligations to the American people,” Ms. Tierney wrote in a recent message to agency staff that was shared with The New York Times.

The departures came after pressure from the Department of Government Efficiency, previously led by Elon Musk, for large-scale forced resignations of federal workers.

The cuts have meant fewer meteorologists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which critics fear could lead to less accurate forecasts; and the loss of one-fifth of the coordinating officers at FEMA, who manage responses to major disasters.

It has also meant delays and other problems for states hit by disasters, with some waiting as long as two months for FEMA to approve requests to declare a disaster.

Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, said in an interview he did not believe the Trump administration had any sort of plan when it comes to FEMA.

“It’s clear that states are on their own now,” Mr. Heinrich said. “I don’t think there’s much capacity at FEMA right now, and that concerns me greatly. It’s one thing to say ‘We need to do things a much better way.’ But what they’re saying is ‘If you get hit by a hurricane, or a tornado or a wildfire, you’re on your own.’”

Several experts said Mr. Trump’s warning about changes to disaster aid would entrench the politicization of disaster aid. Already, Mr. Trump has openly threatened to withhold disaster relief to states led by political rivals, such as California.

Andrew Morris, a historian at Union College in New York who studies disaster relief and social safety nets, said politics had always played a part disaster relief.

“But the sense that there is a partisan test to whether or not you get disaster relief, and the possibility of denying disaster relief on whether or not you’re aligned with the president’s agenda, that’s something that’s new and definitely troublesome,” Dr. Morris said.

Mr. Trump has established the FEMA Review Council, which Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department Homeland Security is leading along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

The council is expected to submit recommendations in the coming months about “reforms and what FEMA will look like in the future as a different agency,” Ms. Noem said at the Oval Office briefing.

She argued the changes would “empower governors to go out and respond” to emergencies. FEMA, she said, “has failed thousands, if not millions, of people, and President Trump does not want to see that continue into the future.”

States already bear significant costs when it comes to disaster recovery. FEMA’s traditional role has been to provide additional support and resources to states when disasters exceed their capacity.

In this case, though, the administration went through normal channels and asked Congress to go along with its efforts to redirect federal money from programs that have historically drawn substantial bipartisan support. The bulk of the funds targeted — $8.3 billion — is for foreign assistance programs. The remaining $1.1 billion is for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS.

“America’s resources should always serve America’s interests,” said Representative Warren Davidson, Republican of Ohio. “The reality is the radical left has seized these institutions and wielded them for an agenda that doesn’t serve America’s interests.”

Four House Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the measure, which passed only after Speaker Mike Johnson pressed a handful of G.O.P. lawmakers who had initially voted “no” to support it. Those who broke with their party in opposition were Representatives Mark Amodei of Nevada, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Nicole Malliotakis of New York and Mike Turner of Ohio.

At least one Republican who initially voted “no” but changed his vote, Representative Nick LaLota of New York, suggested he did so after winning a concession from Mr. Johnson on SALT deductions — state and local taxes that can be written off on federal returns — a key issue in Republicans’ domestic policy bill.

He said he left a conversation with the speaker on the House floor with “expectations that my constituents will get what they need.”

The proposal’s fate in the Senate is unclear. Republicans can approve the clawbacks with a simple majority vote, but some senators have expressed a range of concerns about taking back money from programs they support, including for public broadcasting and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the global health program that President George W. Bush started and is credited with saving more than 25 million lives worldwide.

Even in the House, where Republicans tend to skew more conservative than their colleagues in the Senate and defer more to Mr. Trump, several conservatives had openly fretted about taking back the money. On Thursday, minutes before some Republican lawmakers switched their votes, it appeared that the measure would fail.

“Our local stations are dedicated to serving their communities, but their ability to continue offering free, high-quality programming would be eliminated if the federal funding is rescinded,” Mr. Amodei said in the days leading up to the vote. “Rescinding this funding also would isolate rural communities, jeopardizing their access to vital resources they depend on.”

If approved by the Senate, the rollbacks to public broadcasting would affect more than 1,500 public media stations, as well as the corporation’s public radio satellite system, which enables national emergency alerts.

Democrats assailed the package.

“We’re on the floor of the House of Representatives, not debating legislation that is designed to make this country and our economy more affordable, but actually debating legislation that targets Elmo and Big Bird and Daniel Tiger and ‘Sesame Street,’” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the House floor, brandishing a small Elmo plushie.

The $9.4 billion package the White House put forward amounts to a minuscule portion of the overall federal funds Congress controls.

But Republicans’ initial reluctance to approve the package, which administration officials had narrowed in an effort to avoid a failed vote, foreshadowed a difficult path ahead for any other spending reductions they might be asked to approve. The last time a Trump administration asked lawmakers to pull back federal funds they had already approved, during Mr. Trump’s first term, the effort failed after two Republican senators joined Democrats to defeat what had been a largely symbolic effort.

White House officials envision the $9.4 billion package as the opening salvo and want to send more cuts for lawmakers to codify.

“It’s very clear that this is an opening shot,” Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, said of the package. “We’ll see if Congress can step up to the plate.”

Megan Mineiro contributed reporting.

Senators from states reliant on the program worry that the changes the House pushed through — particularly one that would have states assume some of the cost of assistance payments currently paid entirely by the federal government — will punt huge costs onto their states. And they worry that the changes could also result in the loss of free school meals for young low-income children.

It is yet another policy dispute between the two chambers that could complicate efforts to ultimately pass a final, compromise version of Republicans’ marquee legislation. Hard-liners in the House have said that they only reluctantly voted to pass what Mr. Trump refers to as his ”big, beautiful bill” and will not support legislation with fewer spending reductions.

But in the Senate, where Republicans represent entire states, not districts, the SNAP provisions have prompted alarm.

The two senators from West Virginia, Jim Justice and Shelley Moore Capito — both Republicans — have expressed concerns about how the House provisions will hit their state, where one in six residents receive food assistance through the program. Their governor, Patrick Morrisey, also opposes the plan.

Mr. Justice, the state’s former governor, has argued that Republicans can strike a better balance.

“We can’t cut to the bone and hurt people,” he said in a brief interview. “It’s legitimate to have concerns about what impact this will have in your state.”

“They’re in real need,” Mr. Justice said of his constituents. “That being said, I really believe that our states are going to have to be able to step up some, too. Now, we’ve got to watch — we just can’t overload our states too much.”

Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, who is running to be the state’s governor, told The Hill that states like his would “have a tough time picking up the bill on that.”

The measure approved by the House proposes to push some of the costs for the food aid program to the states. All states would be required to pay at least 5 percent of the benefit costs. They would have to pay more if they reported a certain error rate — the rate at which state agencies mistakenly underpay or overpay SNAP recipients.

States with an error rate of 6 percent or higher would need to foot the bill for between 15 percent and 25 percent. The average error rate in 2023, according to the Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program, was 11.68 percent.

“What this is going to force states to do is raise state taxes or cut food to hungry people,” said Joel Berg, the chief executive of Hunger Free America, a hunger and food security nonprofit group. “It’s not like Republican-run states want to take on more of these expenses. So it’s no shock that Republican senators are saying, ‘Hold on, are you really going to burden our states?’”

That helps explain why the Senate Agriculture Committee, which is in charge of writing the portion of the sprawling legislation dealing with nutrition assistance, has proposed to soften those provisions. In its proposal released on Wednesday night, states with an error rate below 6 percent would not have to pay any costs. States with higher error rates would pay for between 5 percent and 15 percent of the costs, a lower share than set forward by the House proposal.

“A lot of people were concerned about the significant bill to the states,” said Senator John Boozman, Republican of Arkansas and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee. “This was an effort — it’s the best of both worlds.”

Democrats contend that the modifications do not go far enough.

“While some changes were made to the food assistance cuts, this bill continues to include an unprecedented cost shift, forcing tens of billions of SNAP costs onto state governments for the first time,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Agriculture Committee. “Because nearly every state has balanced budget rules, states will almost certainly have to cut SNAP eligibility, benefits or both, or choose between food assistance and other critical needs, like education, health and public safety.”

Some G.O.P. senators were also uncomfortable with a provision in the House-passed bill that would expand SNAP’s existing work requirements to cover food stamp recipients up to age 64, including those with children who are at least age 7. That would be a significant expansion of existing law, which currently requires only beneficiaries up to age 54 to work in exchange for SNAP, and excludes those with dependents.

Senators have privately worried that those changes will result in the loss of free school lunches for low-income children. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the changes could result in 420,000 children losing school nutrition benefits in an average month — either by being bumped from free lunch to reduced-price lunch, or losing access to school meals entirely.

Children who receive food assistance are automatically enrolled in school nutrition programs, and would need to apply separately if their family lost access to SNAP. Schools in poor neighborhoods also provide universal lunches to all schoolchildren if enough families are eligible for SNAP. If numbers fell below those thresholds, individual families would instead need to apply.

The version of the legislation that the Senate Agriculture Committee released on Wednesday would also change that provision, instead introducing work requirements for adults with dependents who are at least 10 years of age or older.

An earlier version of this article misstated the point at which states would pay no costs for nutrition assistance under a proposal by the Senate Agriculture Committee. States with a payment error rate below 6 percent would pay nothing, not states with a rate of 6 percent.

Mr. Trump said that an attack was likely to destroy the chances for a diplomatic solution. “I think it would blow it,” he said, before arguing the other side of the equation, saying it “might help it actually, but it also could blow it.”

His statement came just hours after the administration announced that Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, planned to meet the Iranian foreign minister in Oman on Sunday for another negotiating session.

The somewhat contradictory signals from the White House came amid growing signs that Israel was preparing for a strike of unknown proportions against Iranian sites. Mr. Trump refused to give details of a conversation he held on Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, or to say whether, in that conversation, he had offered any kind of go-ahead to the Israeli leader to proceed with a strike. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has said that he has urged Mr. Netanyahu to hold off on any military action while negotiations were underway.

Nonetheless, when asked on Thursday if an attack could happen very soon, he said: “I don’t want to say imminent, but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen.” Several hours later, in a social media post, he wrote that the administration was “committed to a Diplomatic Resolution of the Iran Nuclear issue.”

Mr. Trump’s statements left American and European intelligence officials searching for any signs that Israel was getting ready, including evidence that it was massing the aircraft and missiles that would be needed for any sustained assault on Iran’s remaining air defenses, its missile stores and its nuclear sites.

But there was also speculation among many officials that Israel and the United States may be engaged in coercive diplomacy. If Mr. Witkoff’s meeting goes ahead, officials said, his message to Iran would most likely be a simple one: Tehran will lose its ability to enrich uranium one way or the other, either in a negotiated settlement that would gradually turn the making of fuel over to a multination consortium operating outside of Iran, or through an Israeli strike.

Hours before Mr. Trump spoke, the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body that inspects nuclear programs to assure there is no diversion of fuel for weapons use, condemned Iran in a resolution for failing to answer questions about possible past military nuclear activity at several sites around the country. In response, Iranian officials vowed to produce even more near-bomb-grade uranium and to open a third nuclear enrichment site, deep underground.

“The process to equip the machines will begin, and once it is completed, we will begin enrichment,” Mohammad Eslami, the leader of Iran’s Atomic Energy Agency, declared after the vote on the resolution.

He did not say where the new underground site was. But intelligence officials and outside experts said they assumed he was referring to a site south of Iran’s long-existing enrichment facility in Natanz, where satellite imagery has documented the digging of new tunnels. American and Israeli intelligence officials have believed that was Tehran’s newest and biggest effort to construct nuclear facilities that were so deep in the mountains that they could withstand bunker-busting bombs, sabotage efforts on the ground, and cyberattacks.

Mr. Eslami also said that Iran was replacing a generation of old centrifuges in another underground site, called Fordow, with new nuclear centrifuges that can enrich uranium far more efficiently. “They are constantly threatening us; they must know that our nuclear industry is now part of Iranian lives,” he said.

But just as important is what Iran did not say or do on Thursday. It did not declare that it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which bars it from building nuclear weapons. (Israel, which is believed to possess about 100 nuclear weapons, has never signed the treaty, nor have India and Pakistan. North Korea withdrew two decades ago.) No inspectors were expelled or more cameras turned off, officials said.

In recent days, Iran has rejected the Trump administration’s central demand: that its vast infrastructure for enriching uranium, one of two pathways to building a nuclear weapon, must be shut down and ultimately dismantled. Under a proposal Mr. Witkoff sent to his Iranian counterparts two weeks ago, the country would be able to make that transition slowly, continuing to produce fuel until the international consortium was ready to take its place. That could take upward of a decade, some nuclear experts say.

Mr. Netanyahu, with his shaky governing coalition showing new signs of unraveling, has made it clear he has little interest in such solutions. Three times over the past decade or so, he has gone to the edge of ordering military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, only to pull back at the last moment. In recent days, he has shown every sign of being eager to pull the trigger, even if it risks Mr. Trump’s wrath.

The signs of preparation in the Middle East were everywhere, but they also seemed to lack an air of urgency.

The 40,000 U.S. military personnel in the Persian Gulf and broader region were on higher alert Thursday amid reports of a possible imminent strike, and the inevitable retaliation that would follow.

At bases around the region, U.S. troops were conducting “bunker dive” drills — essentially air raid drills should U.S. bases come under retaliatory Iranian fire. Military planners were weighing how and when to move some military aircraft out of the immediate area, to reduce the chance of being attacked.

In Iraq, where Iranian influence is strong, some diplomats were withdrawn, “nonessential personnel” at the embassy were preparing to leave, and U.S. forces authorized the voluntary departure of dependents, mostly Navy and Marine families in Bahrain. But if commanders had thought an attack was truly imminent, several officials said, they probably would have ordered a mandatory evacuation.

Pentagon officials reported they have made no major changes to U.S. forces in recent days. The aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, with 60 aircraft, including F-35 fighters, currently in the Arabian Sea, appeared to be staying in its position. The United States also has several dozen attack and fighter jets deployed around the Gulf region and Middle East. Those aircraft were used extensively in the defense of Israel during the two Iranian missile strikes last year, which failed to do much damage.

But in Jerusalem, the U.S. Embassy restricted the movement of employees on Thursday, in a directive to employees and their families that reflected growing concern about potential Iranian retaliation should Israel proceed with a strike. The restrictions bar travel outside the greater Tel Aviv area, Jerusalem and Beersheba, with some exceptions, the embassy said on its website.

The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, told an Israeli news outlet this week that he did not believe it was “likely” that Israel would strike Iran without receiving a “green light” from the Trump administration.

The office of Mr. Netanyahu of Israel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran. The Israeli military declined to comment.

This week,General Motors announced plans to invest about $4 billion over the next two years in its domestic manufacturing plants to increase U.S. production of both gas and electric vehicles.

The new investment will give GM the ability to assemble more than two million vehicles per year in the U.S. This announcement comes on the heels of the company’s recently announced plan to invest $888 million in the Tonawanda Propulsion plant near Buffalo, New York to support GM’s next-generation V-8 engine.

Plants in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee will expand finished vehicle production of several of GM’s most popular vehicles:

Orion Assembly, Orion Township, Michigan: GM will begin production of gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks at Orion in early 2027 to help meet continued strong demand. As a result, GM says its Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan will be the dedicated assembly location for the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, and GMC HUMMER EV pickup and SUV.

Fairfax Assembly, Kansas City, Kansas: Fairfax Assembly will support production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox beginning in mid-2027. The automaker says sales of the recently redesigned Equinox were up more than 30% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025. Fairfax remains on track to begin building the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt EV by the end of this year. GM says it expects to make new future investments in Fairfax for GM’s next generation of affordable EVs.

Spring Hill Manufacturing, Spring Hill, Tennessee:GM will add production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer at Spring Hill starting in 2027, alongside the Cadillac LYRIQ and VISTIQ EVs, and the Cadillac XT5.

“Today’s news goes well beyond the investment numbers — this is about hardworking Americans making vehicles they are proud to build and that customers are proud to own,"" said GM President Mark Reuss. ""As you travel the country, you can see firsthand the scale of our manufacturing footprint and the positive economic impact on our communities and our country.”

GM says it continues to post strong U.S. sales, gaining market share in both gas and electric vehicles. The company says it's on track to deliver its sixth consecutive year as the U.S. full-size pickup sales leader, and its 51st straight year leading in full-size SUVs. In the second half of 2024, GM reports that it became the #2 seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. market, crediting its diverse portfolio of 13 EV models from Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC. The automaker says Chevrolet is now the fastest-growing EV brand and #2 among all EV brands in sales.

GM’s also reported this week that its 2025 capital spending guidance is unchanged at between $10 billion and $11 billion.

I’m proud that my legislation can deliver just that.” James was among the lawmakers Trump praised for supporting the waiver overturn.
Trump also denounced California regulations for heavy-duty vehicles that would have pushed a transition to EVs in the trucking industry.
""We applaud President Trump, the House and Senate for rejecting (California's) unrealistic battery electric vehicle mandate,"" the company said in a statement.
That left many advocates clinging to the latest California rules as a last hope to preserve a regulatory push toward the technology.","Washington — President Donald Trump, with significant fanfare, declared victory Thursday morning over ""electric vehicle mandates"" favored by his predecessor and regulators in California.

""Previous administration gave left-wing radicals dictatorial powers to control the entire car industry,"" he said in the White House East Room to a crowd including auto lobbyists and fossil fuel executives, plus Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

""Today we're saving California from a disaster and our entire country from a disaster,"" Trump said.

""We're doing a product that works, that's much more efficient, that's better,"" he said.

The president's comments came during a bill-signing ceremony for legislation blocking a federal waiver from the EPA that allowed California to set influential, nation-leading emissions policies for the auto industry. Its latest rules would have required a ramp-up to 100% electrified new vehicle sales by 2035 in participating states.

Though Michigan was not among those states, it would have experienced ripple effects from the new rules, which were set to cover about one-third of the U.S. car and truck market. The Detroit Three automakers and their suppliers would have needed to quickly ramp up EV production and sales well beyond current levels.

California and 10 other states filed a lawsuit immediately after Trump signed three pieces of legislation canceling the Golden State's power to enforce its newest regulations.

This is what leadership looks like,” Congressman James said in a statement. “Washington Elites said it couldn’t be done, but with President Trump’s signature we’ve made good on our promise to protect our jobs, lower prices, defend our supply chains, and keep Democrats' radical Green New Deal agenda out of the driver’s seat.”

""... This is huge a win for the men and women who don’t get days off, who get behind the wheel before sunrise and keep this country running,"" James continued. ""America’s workers don’t need coastal elites from California to Washington, D.C. telling them how to do their jobs — they need the freedom to compete, the infrastructure to deliver, and the respect they’ve earned. I’m proud that my legislation can deliver just that.”

James was among the lawmakers Trump praised for supporting the waiver overturn. He also noted that some Democrats joined overwhelming Republican support in Congress for the effort.

""One Democrat in the Senate,"" Trump said. ""Who was the one?""

""Slotkin,"" someone in the audience called out, referring to Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly.

""Well ... I shouldn't have asked,"" the president said.

Trump also denounced California regulations for heavy-duty vehicles that would have pushed a transition to EVs in the trucking industry. Less than 1% of Class 8 semi trucks registered in the United States last year were electric, according to data from the American Trucking Association. The industry would have had to reach 75% for new sales in that class by 2035 in participating states.

He signed legislation canceling California’s ability to set those standards too.

The auto industry and oil and gas groups lobbied fiercely to cancel the light-vehicle regulations, while environmental groups held out hope for their survival as perhaps the most ambitious Biden-era effort to curb emissions from the United States' top contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

""Ripping away California’s clean air protections is Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.

He added: “Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets. Big Oil CEOs who ponied up on Trump’s billion-dollar campaign demand are now getting the big payoff with gutted environmental health protections.""

General Motors Co. cheered Trump and lawmakers for approving the measures.

“GM appreciates Congress’ action to align emissions standards with today’s market realities,"" said company spokesperson Bill Grotz. ""We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles.”

Toyota Motor Corp., the second-largest automaker by sales in the United States last year, also praised the action.

""We applaud President Trump, the House and Senate for rejecting (California's) unrealistic battery electric vehicle mandate,"" the company said in a statement. The Japanese automaker has been a purposeful laggard on EVs while the market develops, instead relying on its massive gas-powered hybrid portfolio to power profits.

The statement continued: ""Toyota believes providing consumers with affordable vehicles and a variety of powertrain options is the best and quickest path forward for reducing emissions. A consumer-driven market with one national emissions standard will bring more stability and healthy competition to the auto industry, steady employment for workers and dealers, and more options for American families.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most automakers in the United States, said: “Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic. Worse than unachievable – these EV mandates were going to be harmful. Harmful to auto affordability, to consumer choice, to industry competitiveness and to economic activity.""

In his remarks, Trump pointed to investments by automakers in U.S. plants, citing them as evidence his tariffs are working to increase industrial production in the United States. Among them, he said, is Stellantis NV's plans to reopen its Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois.

California, thanks to longstanding provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, is able to set its own tailpipe emissions regulations, provided it first gets approval from the EPA. Its latest set of rules would have phased in beginning with the 2026 model year. Companies were facing a 35% electrified sales requirement, which included a partial allowance for gas-electric plug-in hybrid models.

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia had at one point pledged to adopt California's rules, but five later canceled or delayed their commitments as the regulations' start date drew closer.

Virginia canceled its commitment last year under the directive of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Maryland and Vermont pulled back in the weeks leading up to congressional action on the matter, and New York and Massachusetts did the same one day after a key Senate vote on the regulations.

No state, including California, is yet at the 35% benchmark outlined in the rules. Most were not halfway there in 2024, according to sales data compiled by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

Nationally, EV adoption grew significantly during President Joe Biden's administration, jumping from about 3% of new vehicle sales at the start of his term in January 2021 to a peak of 11% in December 2023. But growth plateaued over the past two years, with electrified models hovering around 9% to 10% of new vehicle sales.

Biden promoted EVs through a web of policies aimed at automakers, suppliers, consumers and charging providers across the country with the goals of reducing environmental impact and pushing the United States to compete with China's dominant EV industry.

Electric vehicles, notably, are significantly less polluting than internal combustion engine cars and trucks, according to an analysis from BloombergNEF. Though EVs do contribute to pollution through their production process and their use of largely fossil-fuel-derived electricity to charge, their lack of tailpipe emissions makes them far cleaner than ICE models.

Many of Biden's policies to boost EVs, however, are likely to be gutted by a massive Republican tax and spending bill that ends related tax credits, claws back money for chargers and repeals federal emissions standards. The bill also adds a new tax for EV owners.

Republicans have long railed against government support for EVs, with widespread expectation that they would unwind Biden's efforts at the federal level. That left many advocates clinging to the latest California rules as a last hope to preserve a regulatory push toward the technology.

But two important factors led to the rules' demise: Trump's electoral victory in November and Biden's inaction on the waiver until late in his term.

Trump's win enabled the appointment of Zeldin to transmit the waiver to Congress for review, teeing up controversial votes to cancel it under the Congressional Review Act. Democrats and environmental advocates decried the decision to hold votes in the first place after nonpartisan referees ruled that waivers, like the one California received, are not subject to the CRA.

Biden could have skirted the issue altogether by granting the waiver earlier in his presidency.

The CRA gives Congress the power to cancel rules set by outgoing presidents, so long as the rules were finalized within the last 60 legislative days of a given year. But the Democratic former president waited until Dec. 18 to grant the waiver.

Still, even some Democratic lawmakers joined Republicans in voting to nix California's emission waiver, calling the state's rules unrealistic. Eleven of Michigan's 15 members of Congress voted to repeal the waiver, and another three said they supported the policy move but objected for procedural reasons.

California and its state emissions regulator, the California Air Resources Board, have vowed to sue the Trump administration over its cancellation of the waiver.

Gavin Newsom, the state's Democratic governor, said in May that congressional votes on the matter were ""illegal.""

""Republicans went around their own parliamentarian to defy decades of precedent,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""We won’t stand by as Trump Republicans make America smoggy again — undoing work that goes back to the days of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan — all while ceding our economic future to China.

""We’re going to fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.""

,Detroit American Energy ,2025-06-12 14:39:12+00:00,Planet Detroit,"Trump EPA targets climate rules that limit emissions from coal, natural gas power plants","Associated Press, Brian Allnutt, Nina Misuraca Ignaczak, Isabelle Tavares",,,,,https://planetdetroit.org/2025/06/epa-emissions-rule-rollback/,"Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency.
Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year.
Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.
The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.
“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help “unleash” American energy.

The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm the brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.

The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump’s repeated pledge to “unleash American energy ” and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.

If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.

The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administrations’ “war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.”

“The American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,” he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. “They wanted to make sure that … no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living … create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.”

Rules in EPA crosshairs could save 30,000 lives: Analysis

Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.

Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals “yet another in a series of attacks” by the Trump administration on the nation’s “health, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.”

She called it “unconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.”

“Ignoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,” added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court.”

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated — they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of greenhouse gases, driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.

The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.

In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,” the EPA said, adding: “This Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.

If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA’s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don’t either and therefore shouldn’t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice at Jenner & Block LLP.

The EPA proposal “has the potential to have much, much broader implications,” she said.

‘These are indisputable facts’

Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to “suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,” with the intent to regulate the coal industry “out of existence” and make it “disappear.”

National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove “deliberately unattainable standards” for clean air while “leveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.”

But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.

“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said. “These are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.”

A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.

“Carbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,” said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in “significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,” he said.

The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars.
“We’re fighting back.” According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035.
In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022.
About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California’s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, a White House official told The Associated Press.

The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. He also plans to approve measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

The timing of the signing was confirmed Wednesday by a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans not yet public.

The development comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over everything from tariffs to the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

“If it’s a day ending in Y, it’s another day of Trump’s war on California,” Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in an email. “We’re fighting back.”

According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. He will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

The president is scheduled to sign the measures and make remarks during an event at the White House on Thursday morning.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin are expected to attend, along with members of Congress and representatives from the energy, trucking and gas station industries.

The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move will also come a day after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. Zeldin said it would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help “unleash” American energy.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

The National Automobile Dealers Association supported the federal government’s move to block California’s ban on gas-powered cars, saying Congress should decide on such a national issue, not the state.

The American Trucking Associations said the rules were not feasible and celebrated Congress’ move to block them.

Chris Spear, the CEO of the American Trucking Associations, said in a statement Wednesday: “This is not the United States of California.”

It was also applauded by Detroit automaker General Motors, which said it will “help align emissions standards with today’s market realities.”

“We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles,” the company said in a statement.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, in anticipation of the president signing the measures, said earlier Thursday that the move would be “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

The original store site has about 45 parking spaces for Recharged cars; adding 8406 W. Broad St. as a Recharged-operated address adds 125 spaces, Foley said.
The recent capital round was funded by New York-based Gutter Capital, of which Recharged is a portfolio company.
When a second location does launch for Recharged, Foley said the company will plan to add car reconditioning and car servicing to the local EV car market on-site.
Recharged currently hires out that work and does not have the space to do it at its West Broad Street location.","As it plots an expansion plan for new locations out of town, a local electric vehicle retailer is also growing the footprint of its Richmond home base.

Recharged, which sells used electric and hybrid vehicles both in-person from its store at 8410 W. Broad St. and through its website, recently took control of the former HoneyCar lot next door at 8406 W. Broad St.

Recharged co-founder John Foley said the added lot will become a “buying and consignment center” for the company’s inventory, while 8410 will focus on sales.

New Recharged signage was set to go up at 8406 on Wednesday and will mark a homecoming of sorts for Foley and some of his staff.

The lot was previously the original location of CarLotz, a once-fast-growing used-car consignment concept for which Foley worked as chief operating officer for eight years before he left in 2022. The Broad Street property became a HoneyCar location in early 2023, after HoneyCar acquired the assets and lease when CarLotz was absorbed by the now-bankrupt Shift Technologies.

Recharged took over the lease at 8406 last July and subleased the location to HoneyCar for a few months as that business wound down its operations. The spot officially became part of Recharged in March, Foley said.

Foley, who co-founded Recharged with Alan Shtraks in 2023, said bringing his own startup to the original CarLotz location carries some extra meaning.

“Some of my current team are CarLotz alums, so it’s a bit of a homecoming for all of us, sitting back in that building,” Foley said. “It’s a little bit ironic that we’re calling that our buying and consignment center, given that consignment was the CarLotz model.”

The expansion next door will give Recharged more room for inventory for in-person and online sales. Along with selling electric cars from brands like Tesla, Kia and Volkswagen, Recharged sells and installs at-home charging stations and provides educational resources about electric vehicles.

The original store site has about 45 parking spaces for Recharged cars; adding 8406 W. Broad St. as a Recharged-operated address adds 125 spaces, Foley said. The existing property has around 2,800 square feet of space in its building; taking on the lease at 8406 gives Recharged about 2,000 square feet of additional office space, he said.

The expansion comes as Recharged is in growth mode fueled by added investor capital.

The company recently closed on a $2 million capital raise, according to an SEC filing June 3.

The recent capital round was funded by New York-based Gutter Capital, of which Recharged is a portfolio company. Foley said Gutter took a stake in Recharged last year when it led an investment round of around $2 million. To date, Recharged has raised more than $5 million from investors since its launch, Foley said.

Other Gutter Capital companies include Tennessee-based food manufacturer operating system Allera and Delaware-based data collection platform Besample.

The Recharged round that closed late last year was focused on building up Recharged’s technology, Foley said, including working on the company’s website, through which customers from across the country can purchase cars. This latest round, Foley said, will be focused on adding new locations, which Recharged calls its “experience centers.”

Foley said the 11-person company is considering new locations in the Southeast, with a particular eye on the Charlotte, North Carolina, area for its second location.

“What we would like to do is continue to grow through the Southeast and ‘mushroom cloud’ out from Richmond,” Foley said.

When a second location does launch for Recharged, Foley said the company will plan to add car reconditioning and car servicing to the local EV car market on-site. Recharged currently hires out that work and does not have the space to do it at its West Broad Street location.

Recharged could also look to establish a third location in Virginia that would be a sort of hub for car reconditioning and servicing.

“We’re considering between Fredericksburg and Richmond so we can service both of those markets and more quickly deliver into the DMV and even up into Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where we do quite a bit of business today.”

Foley told BizSense that Recharged has about 175 cars in its inventory; at its advent, it had around 20. He said 70% to 80% of the company’s inventory gets sold month-to-month.

With only around half of that inventory being sold locally, Foley said it’s important to the Recharged team to continue growth not only in physical locations, but also on its website. Much of the business Recharged does, even in the Richmond area, is done remotely with delivery, he said.

“We’re continuing to build our online capability to buy and sell inventory very quickly and efficiently,” Foley said. “So, when you think about what the next six to 12 months looks like for us, we still see, just before the end of this year, a 100% growth rate from where we are today.”",https://richmondbizsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/recharged-foley-700x444.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:47:06.932467

Chaewon Chung covers climate change and the environment in the Triad and Northwest North Carolina.","Gov. Josh Stein has urged Congress to protect clean energy investments, amid proposed changes to federal climate policy that could impact progress toward North Carolina’s clean transportation goals.

In an email to The Journal, a spokesperson for Stein said the Democratic governor “supports ZEVs as a solution to help people save money on gas and reduce air pollution,” while noting the benefits the state has seen from “many great companies” involved in battery manufacturing and the ZEV supply chain.

“North Carolina is a leader in the clean energy economy, and many companies have made substantial investments based on existing federal policy,” the spokesperson said. “Governor Stein urges Congress to protect these clean energy investments that have contributed to our state’s prosperity.”

As of February, North Carolina has hit over 112,000 registrations of electric vehicles, which includes more than 85,000 battery electric vehicles (EVs) and about 27,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), according to the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT).

Under former Gov. Roy Cooper’s Executive Order 80, North Carolina initially set a goal of reaching 80,000 ZEVs by 2025 — a target that was achieved in November 2023, two years ahead of schedule. Executive Order 246 raised the state’s goal for registered ZEVs to at least 1,250,000 by 2030.

Harrison Fell, an associate professor in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at North Carolina State University, noted that the goal outlined in Executive Order 246 now appears more ambitious than it did when Gov. Cooper first issued it, largely due to growing uncertainty around the future of federal subsidies intended to support EV customers.

The House of Representatives on May 22 passed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which proposes the elimination of the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs. Under the bill, those credits would end for most vehicles put into service starting in 2026. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.

“It remains to be seen what's going to happen once it heads over to the Senate, but I would be very surprised if the EV tax credits survive this tax bill procedure,” Fell said.

“People were trying to buy before the EV tax credits could expire. Now, once the tariffs kick in, and if the EV tax credit is repealed, then the goal of 1.25 million (EV registrations) by 2030 is simply not achievable.”

Harrison pointed to a recent Princeton University study, led by energy expert Jesse Jenkins, that examined the impact of rolling back federal climate policies. In a scenario where all executive actions and tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act end after 2025, the study projected 7.4 million fewer battery electric vehicles on U.S. roads by 2030 compared to if the policies were continued.

“I will say that myself and others found Jenkins' original predictions of EV sales under the IRA to be very optimistic, but I think the result that the repeal of EV subsidies will significantly reduce EV sales relative to the case with the subsidy is very likely,” Fell added.

Meanwhile, Forsyth and Guilford counties saw a notable increase in EV registrations, with Forsyth nearing 3,000 and Guilford surpassing 4,700 as of February, marking growth of about 42% and 45%, respectively, compared to the same time last year.

The bill will gut American-made clean energy, kill manufacturing jobs, threaten energy independence, and send household energy costs through the roof.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) issued the following statement:

“We say we need more energy in America – the quickest, best, and cheapest way to get it is clean energy. And yet the House has sent us a bill that kills the program…These provisions, if passed, would basically end clean energy…They are making these cuts because they want tax breaks for billionaires…We are sending this message out to our Republican colleagues: Change this bill. It’s horrible for consumers. It’s horrible for jobs. It’s horrible for American independence with China.”

The Republican bill would raise energy costs:

According to nonpartisan experts, annual energy bills across American households would increase by a total of $170 billion during the budget reconciliation window of 2025-2034.

Household energy spending would increase by an average of nearly $150 per year in 2030 and more than $260 per year in 2035.

In North Carolina, household energy spending would increase by an average of more than $290 per year in 2030 and nearly $700 per year in 2035.

In Georgia, household energy spending would increase by an average of nearly $220 per year in 2030 and more than $540 per year in 2035.

In Kansas, household energy spending would increase by an average of more than $210 per year in 2030 and more than $670 per year in 2035.

In Iowa, household energy spending would increase by an average of nearly $210 per year in 2030 and nearly $550 per year in 2035.

In Indiana, household energy spending would increase by an average of nearly $160 per year in 2030 and more than $530 per year in 2035.

In Louisiana, household energy spending would increase by an average of more than $260 per year in 2030 and nearly $800 per year in 2035.

In South Carolina, household energy would increase spending by an average of nearly $350 per year in 2030 and nearly $900 per year in 2035

National wholesale electricity prices would increase 50%.

The Republican bill would kill manufacturing jobs:

Trump’s attacks on clean energy have already threatened or canceled more than 90,000 clean energy manufacturing jobs.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would put 400,000 clean energy manufacturing jobs at risk.

According to nonpartisan experts, the U.S. workforce would lose 840,000 jobs in 2030 and another 790,000 jobs in 2035.

The debate over the failed bills revealed animus among some conservative lawmakers over the expansion of renewable energy in the oil-rich state. One plan that did land on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk and awaits his signature is a $5 billion addition for the Texas Energy Fund, a low-interest loan program that incentivizes the development of gas-fueled power plants.

Still, the legislative session offered a glimpse at how the energy landscape in Texas is evolving. With increasing power demands, there is pressure to take an all-of-the-above energy approach.

Clean energy advocates said the bills aimed at wind or solar farms did not move beyond committee hearings, in part, because the proposals would have impaired overall energy growth and hurt the future reliability of Texas’s energy grid.

The Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative Austin-based think tank, argued against the expansion of renewables with a report that estimated clean energy plants are costing the state an additional $2 billion a year because of the power type’s volatility. When the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining, fossil fuel power plants have to ramp up and down more frequently to fill in the gaps, which raises costs, the foundation reported.

During testimony from businesses in rural areas, residents and operators said wind farms have proved crucial in providing ready and affordable energy. More broadly, discussions about the state’s energy mix acknowledged Texas’ reliance on old and new energy sources.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president of Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), one of the largest solar and battery trade groups, said Texas led by example this legislative session with some notable compromises on renewables. “Texas is the energy capital for a reason,” Hopper said. “The economic reality and math of energy demand prevailed in Austin, and that is a good thing for Texans’ energy bills, the economy and grid reliability.”

The Bills That Failed

One bill that fell short, S.B. 388, would have required every watt of new solar generation to be accompanied by a watt of new gas generation. Critics of the legislation said it would have slowed renewables’ expansion at a time when gas producers are experiencing a global shortage of equipment and materials needed to build power plants.

“If you want to bring dispatchable power to the grid, there are so many different levers you could pull,” said Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. “But pull the ones that actually help something get onto the grid, not push something else down, which is really what that bill would end up doing.” The bill passed in the more conservative Senate and failed to advance beyond a House committee.

Two bills—companion measures in the House and Senate—would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil fuel-based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating. Both renewables and oil company lobbyists saw the legislation as adding unnecessary costs.

Environmental and renewable trade groups opposed the attempt at so-called “grid firming,” fearing that it would close existing solar and wind farms. The Texas Oil and Gas Association contested the measures over worries that some member’s investments in renewable energy would be harmed. Some of the group’s more than 4,000 members that produce more than 90 percent of the state’s oil and gas, buy power from solar and wind farms to run some of their operations and feared the proposal would shutter those power plants.

Neither bill—H.B 3356 or S.B. 715—made it out of committee debate. They were sponsored by Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican from Denton County, and Sen. Kevin Sparks, a Republican from Midland. Patterson previously chaired the House Committee on Protecting Texas LNG. Sparks is the president of Discovery Operating, Inc., a family oil and gas company in Midland.

Patterson said the aim of the legislation was to have producers, not consumers, bear increased costs. That’s what environmental advocates argued would upend the growing renewable industry. Patterson worried about relying on the “whims of nature” but proponents of renewable energy said the caution was misplaced.

The answer was not to force fossil fuel purchases or connections, they said, but to look for more ways to bolster battery storage efforts. Renewables diversify the state’s grid and add capacity, renewable advocates said, making the grid more reliable.

Another bill, sponsored by Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham whose family runs a gasoline and fuel distribution company, attempted to require renewable projects to apply for permits required of no other energy generator.

Kolkhorst’s proposal, S.B. 819, sought to add new guidelines to increase setbacks for wind power projects from property lines. It sparked a lengthy debate about the principles long-heralded by conservatives of individual property rights and limited government.

Of the 126 people who registered to speak at the hearing, 103 signed in as opposed to the measure. Before testimony began, Kolkhorst said permitting in rural Texas was a “sensitive” topic for her and she lamented rural vistas changed by wind turbines and solar panels.

She proposed wind farms be required to have 3,000-foot setbacks, the equivalent of 10 football fields, from private property lines. State Sen. José Menéndez, a Democrat from North Texas, asked if there was a setback requirement on pump jacks for the oil and gas industry. “There are,” Kolkhorst replied. “It’s 200 feet.”

Menendez suggested to her that the bill was biased in its permission to fossil fuel plants or, worse, limited land and opportunities for businesses and investors in clean energy. Setbacks for oil and gas should likely match setbacks for wind farms, he noted, as a matter of fairness. “I just want us to make good public policy that doesn’t take away anyone’s property rights,” he said.

Justin Dreibelbis, CEO of the Texas Wildlife Association, a private land ownership and stewardship organization, supported the bill. The Advanced Power Alliance, an advocacy group for clean energy, argued the bill would hurt development and competition, which conservative lawmakers should support.

Mike Ollinger, a rancher from Armstrong County who operates a wind farm, pointed to his experience in local politics as a former school board member and county commissioner. He said the state lawmakers were out of touch with the challenges of rural counties.

Clean energy projects heavily contribute to the county’s tax base, he said. “Y’all don’t realize what small counties need,” Ollinger said. “We don’t need to be punishing small counties because we don’t have oil and gas.”

Despite not advancing beyond the House for the Governor’s consideration, the anti-renewables legislation progressed further than previous iterations.

Texas’ renewables advocates are now focusing on President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” and how it could hurt business efforts locally. Trump is pushing for legislation that dismantles Biden-era incentives to reach his desk by July 4.

Industry leaders and lobbyists in Texas said they plan to share some local knowledge with politicians in Washington: Wind and solar contribute to energy independence and grid reliability—and there will be big job losses if renewable energies are not supported.

Hopper of the Solar Energy Industries Association said if Trump’s bill passes the Senate, her group estimates that more than more than 50 solar and storage factories in Texas could close or be cancelled and more than 34,000 jobs in Texas would be at risk. The Edison Electric Institute, an industry group, has estimated the gutting of clean energy incentives will result in the loss of 87,900 jobs in the state by 2030. That count will rise to more than 115,000 jobs cut by 2035, according to an Edison report.

Those are the sort of economic figures Hopper wants the White House to hear. “With energy demand rising fast in Texas and across the country, we need every electron we can generate to keep the lights on and our economy strong,” Hopper said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2159698059-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:43:17.309924

Valerie Volcovici reports for Reuters.

In short:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed approving Texas’s application to manage permits for underground carbon dioxide injection, known as Class VI wells, used in carbon capture and storage (CCS).

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin cited Texas's capability to protect drinking water while enabling CCS projects that could curb industrial CO2 emissions and benefit oil companies with deep drilling experience.

Landowners and environmental groups say the plan could worsen groundwater contamination and seismic activity, especially in the Permian Basin, where the state already oversees wastewater disposal linked to similar hazards.

Key quote:

“EPA is taking a key step to support cooperative federalism by proposing to approve Texas to permit Class VI [CO2 injection] wells in the state.”

— Lee Zeldin, EPA Administrator

Why this matters:

Carbon capture and storage is gaining traction as a climate strategy, but the infrastructure it requires — pumping liquefied carbon dioxide deep underground — comes with environmental risks. In Texas, where oil companies stand to profit by adapting existing drilling technology for CCS, oversight questions grow more urgent. Injecting high-pressure fluids underground has been linked to groundwater contamination and earthquakes, particularly in areas already burdened by oil and gas activity.

But a new state law has farmers and environmental advocates raising serious concerns.

Governor Greg Abbott has signed a law that allows oil and gas companies to treat and sell fracking wastewater — also known as produced water — for reuse. That could include discharging it into rivers and streams or even applying it on farmland for crop irrigation.

The move comes as the state faces a growing water shortage due to population growth, aging infrastructure, and prolonged drought conditions. Supporters say the law is a way to supplement water supplies and promote recycling. Critics say it could contaminate the very land Texans depend on for food and survival.

Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller believes the concept has potential — if it’s done right.

“Well, we need water,"" Miller said. ""We don’t really care what the source is as long as it’s good, clean water that we can grow crops with. Fracking water would be fine.""

Miller said the goal won't be just to treat the water, but to fully remove harmful substances like heavy metals to ensure it's clean and safe. He added that there are methods to achieve that, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality would be responsible for regulating the process.

“As long as this water meets those strict guidelines, I don’t have a problem with it,"" Miller added. ""We need the water, whatever source we can get it from.”

The agriculture commissioner also suggested that the most logical use for treated produced water may not be on crops at all.

“I would suggest, probably, a better use of it would be fracking. Let this oil industry reuse it,"" Miller said. ""They use millions and millions of gallons in fracking, and we certainly don’t need the deep injection wells. Those are proven to cause earthquakes, so we need to do something different with it.""

Miller said technological advancements are bringing the state closer to being able to fully clean and reuse produced water.

“Well, I think we’re pretty close,"" the commissioner said. ""I don’t know that we’re all the way there yet, but with the technology and AI and everything that we’ve got available to us now, we’re in the technology age, so it’s certainly doable and it’s, you know, probably doable pretty quick, I would think.”

He also applauded industry progress in shifting away from fresh water for fracking.

Miller pointed to the oil and gas industry as a positive example, noting that companies are increasingly using brackish water for fracking instead of relying on fresh water. He said about 30% of their operations now use treated brackish water, and praised the shift toward more sustainable practices.

Still, he emphasized the importance of strict oversight.

“Well, it’s the standards that it’s judged by,"" Miller said. ""Obviously, there’s gonna have to be very rigorous, strict guidelines implemented and oversight from the TCEQ. As long as those companies meet all the guidelines that we set out before them and those guidelines are accurate and adequate, I don’t see a problem with it.”

And on the legal protections provided under the new law?

“I think those companies should have some liability protection if they’re doing business in the correct way,” Miller said.

But in Johnson County, where farmers are already fighting toxic sewage-based fertilizer biosolids, there’s outrage that lawmakers gave fracking wastewater the green light, despite it containing many of the same carcinogenic chemicals.

“There was another bill that was put forth that would allow fracking water to be land applied… they’re going to… treat it. And then it’s gonna be safe for land application,” said Dana Ames, a Johnson County landowner and advocate. ""Contaminated with all kinds of chemicals. From oil and gas fracking — we don’t even know all the chemicals because they’re proprietary.""

She questions how the state plans to regulate PFAS — also known as “forever chemicals” — in fracking water, when it hasn’t been able to do so in biosolids.

“TCEQ is also the permitting authority for biosolids, and they say that they’re not able to regulate PFOs in the biosolids. So how are they going to regulate PFOS and fracking?” she asked. “There would be number one, no criminal charge that could be brought. There would be no civil case that could be brought. And that is very, very wrong.""

She believes recycling produced water for oil and gas use makes more sense than spreading it on farmland or dumping it in waterways.

Battery electric vehicles are a really important part of our lineup and we’re expanding how many BEV we sell.","David Christ is Toyota’s Group Vice President and General Manager in North America. Before this position he was Group Vice President and General Manager of Lexus in the U.S. In both roles David oversaw the sales, marketing and customer service for two of the industry’s most successful automotive brands. In the last few weeks Toyota has released a stream of information on everything from all-new models like the 2026 Toyota RAV4 (the best-selling SUV in America) to the latest Toyota EV and electrification goals, which include having over 50% of Toyota’s 2025 sales be either hybrid or electric vehicles.

During this interview Dave talked about Toyota‘s future approach to electric vehicles, the impact of tariffs on Toyota’s product and pricing plans, and how the company will deal with China’s growing influence on the global automotive industry.

Toyota’s EV and Hybrid Plan

Forbes: There’s a lot of going on with Toyota right now, but let’s start with the EV space. We might see the $7,500 electric vehicle incentive go away soon, and it looks like demand for EVs is plateauing at around 8% market share. What’s Toyota’s EV plan look like today?

David Christ: We believe in electric vehicles and we’ve have electric vehicles we’re launching soon and we’re excited about them. We want to have selection in different price positions on our BEV products and give our customers choice. And battery electric vehicles are part of our portfolio approach, which is to say we believe that we should build a multitude of different powertrains, and let the customer decide what’s best for their lifestyle. So we make hybrids, we make plug-in hybrids, we make battery electric vehicles. We also make fuel cell vehicles that we sell in California. And our goal is really to have a lot of choice for the customer and let the customer pick what technology is best for them.

Forbes: Whether you’re talking about hybrid or electric vehicles, they all need batteries of various sizes and it seems like battery prices and the components that go into them just keep getting more expensive and maybe harder to get. It also seems like China did some planning and cornered the market on a lot of battery component elements and rare earth metals. Now we hear we’re going to open some mines up in Nevada and other parts of planet maybe not let them have such a stranglehold on those battery components. How is Toyota dealing with the need to make sure their battery electric vehicles and their hybrid vehicles are sufficiently powered and have enough volume but also wrestle with the cost of electric vehicles – and specifically battery – production.

David Christ: Yeah, it’s a great question. Obviously I’m not a procurement expert, but I will say it’s been pretty well reported how much China controls some of the rare earth materials that go into batteries. We’ve done a really good job of developing a supply chain that’s robust and big enough for us to handle our volume. We’re very proud of the fact that we have significantly increased what we call the electrification of our lineup. In 2023 about 30% of our cars that we sold in the US were what we call electrified, meaning hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or BEV, or fuel cell. Last year it was 45%. This year it’s going to be over 50%. So every year we have moved forward in putting more electrified cars on the road. It’s what our customers want and it’s also really good for the environment. And the other thing we’ve done, which we started many years ago, we made a really significant investment in the state of North Carolina to build a battery plan that’s going to build batteries for BEV‘s and hybrids and plug-in hybrids. So we’ll really be able to supply the U.S. from North Carolina for our hybrid powertrains.

Forbes: Nobody knows for sure, but where do you see, say 10 years from now, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrids, plug-in hybrids and traditional gasoline cars. What will be the breakdown, either for the US market or specifically for Toyota?

David Christ: It’s a great question. We’ve always believed in customer choice and we have stuck to our strategy, that the portfolio approach – making several options available to customers – is the best. Battery electric vehicles are a really important part of our lineup and we’re expanding how many BEV we sell. We’re also expanding what categories of price positioning they are in so that we can have more BEV‘s for more customers. But the truth is not every customer can use a BEV every day. Some people with long commutes, or people that travel extensively outside of where there’s charging, the BEV is just not right for them. Well then here comes plug-in hybrids. Those are great options for those people because a lot around town driving is in an EV mode, and then if they need to go on a long trip they fall back to the hybrid powertrain. And then of course hybrids, we’ve been industry leader in hybrids. We started selling hybrids in 1997 with Prius. We’ve really, we feel, perfected that technology and that’s a great option for customers as well. So overall we’re going to expand those options throughout our lineup, and we’re gonna give customers the choice and let them pick.

Forbes: What do you consider Toyota‘s strength right now, product wise. You just mentioned hybrids, and that’s a kind of drivetrain, but what about specific vehicle types? For both Toyota and Lexus where do you feel like your company is well positioned and, conversely, where would you like to see more attention played or more resources thrown in future?

David Christ: I think our strength in our product lineup is we listen to our customers. You know Corolla Cross is a great example. In 2022 we came out with the Corolla Cross, which is smaller and more cost-effective than RAV4, and we did that because our consumers were saying that they wanted a lower priced SUV. So here comes the Corolla Cross, and we’ve done that similarly throughout the lineup. Our GR products – super fun to drive, exhilarating performance, all because our customers wanted the fun-to-drive aspect of a car. And it’s a commitment that the two door sports car and the four-door fun hatchback, or fun wagon, is not dead. So we really just listen to customers and then we try and provide products that fit their needs.

Toyota’s Tariff Plan

Forbes: What, if anything, has Toyota done as a result of all this tariff turbulence over the last few months. It seems like you shouldn’t do anything because nobody knows when they’re going to settle in and you don’t want to make long-term plans based on short term turbulence.

David Christ: We’re an action oriented company, and our dealers are action oriented people, and there’s been a lot of “What are we going to do?” And our response has been, “We’re in a wait-and-see mode.”And the reason we’re wait-and-see is exactly what you said – you don’t want to make a production or a pricing decision that has long range impact in a short term decision-making timeframe. Once we know the full scope of the tariff impact we’ll obviously evaluate where we build our cars, we’ll evaluate how we price our cars, and we’ll make decisions accordingly. But we’re not in a rush to overcompensate right now because of where we are today. So we’re in a wait-and-see, and I know for some people that’s hard because you want to know what’s next. But sometimes slow-and-steady wins the race, so we’re being patient.

Toyota EVs and China

Forbes: On the opposite end of spectrum is long-term planning, and it seems like China is this unrelenting force globally in their ability to produce low priced vehicles that are getting better and better. It’s not just low-cost vehicles that are clearly reflective their low cost. They’re actually pretty desirable. And there’s a certain amount of protection that the U.S. market is going to have because of tariffs. But a lot of other markets, Europe and parts of Asia, see China sucking up a lot of market share. What’s Toyota‘s long-term thoughts to counter the Chinese automotive industry’s growth?

David Christ: We know the China market well. We have obviously a big presence in China, Toyota does, and so does Lexus. So we know that market, we build in that market, we sell in that market. Obviously it’s a big global competitor. They don’t sell any products in the US. Obviously that’s a political discussion for other people to figure out. Until they’re here in the U.S. we just keep our focus on the Chinese market for Japan, for Toyota there, and the team there does a really good job. We’ve been growing in China and I think it’s a long-term good market for us.

The projects would amount to 58,000 megawatts of new generation capacity, enough to power more than 8 million average American households, although many likely won’t move past the planning stage. The report said proposed plants in Texas aim to support data centers for artificial intelligence and other heavy industries. They would also add an estimated 115 million metric tons of greenhouse gases every year to the atmosphere–as much as nearly 27 million more gasoline-powered cars on the road.

“Building more natural gas infrastructure and power plants would saddle Texas’ growing population with more health-harming pollution and contribute to planet-warming greenhouse gases,” according to the 24-page report written by research analyst Griffin Bird.

The research reviewed permit applications, government data, public announcements and records from Texas’ grid operator to tally 108 proposed new gas plants and 17 expansions. That includes four projects currently under construction, 33 that have received permits but haven’t broken ground and 98 that are proposed. More than 60 projects aim for completion by the end of 2028.

The rapid buildout mirrors a global trend and comes as Texas authorities expect statewide power demand to nearly double by 2030, driven largely by a proliferation of advanced computing facilities.

“The sheer volume of additional gas projects quickly popping up in Texas that EIP have been flagging through air permit applications is indeed astonishing,” said Jenny Martos, manager of the oil and gas plant tracker at Global Energy Monitor, a California-based nonprofit.

Martos said gas power expansion globally is largely seen in Asian countries. In the U.S., Texas leads all other states in existing gas power generation and planned gas power generation, as well as production of oil and gas. It is also a leader in renewable energy.

Still, Martos said the gas projects face “headwinds” and uncertainties. Among them: the use and possible regulations of artificial intelligence technology and the massive speculative energy demands related to AI’s evolution.

A year ago, the Biden Administration was urging 100 percent renewable energy in the United States by 2035. Now, the AI boom has upended all calculations. Energy projects face supply delays and prices have surged for gas-fired turbines, essential for production.

“Manufacturers were caught flat-footed,” said Daniel Cohan, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston. “The cost of the gas turbines is now more than the cost of wind and solar farms, even before considering that you have to pay for the fuel.”

Authorities in Texas have taken steps to support natural gas as the predominant power source, even after years of steep growth in the state’s wind and solar power generation. During legislative sessions in 2023 and 2025, lawmakers provided a total $10 billion in public financing of low-cost loans for new gas plants. No such taxpayer funds were designated to encourage wind or solar farms.

Projections of data center growth and energy consumption have led to optimistic expectations for Texas gas producers.

Residents who live near planned gas plants are less enthusiastic. In the tiny town of Blue in Lee County, neighbors are fighting plans for a massive power plant that would primarily serve private, commercial customers many miles away. They are worried about air, noise and light pollution and their quality of life.

“If you’re going to build a bunch of gas plants, don’t plop them down in the middle of nice, quiet, peaceful communities like ours,” said Travis Brown, a former state department of agriculture worker and spokesman for a group called Move the Gas Plant. “Preserving what’s left of rural Texas should be a priority. That’s an important part of our culture and our heritage.”

Report Alleges Improper Emission Permitting

While natural gas burns much cleaner than coal, it still creates soot and emissions including greenhouse gases that warm the planet, nitrogen oxides that contribute to ozone formation, and known human carcinogens like benzene and formaldehyde.

The Environmental Integrity Project report found, in some cases, Texas allowed developers of large gas power plants to circumvent big parts of the permit process for major pollution sources. Companies underrepresented prospective emissions in their applications and then sought “standard” permits meant for smaller facilities rather than new “major source” permits, the EIP report found. Major source permitting requires more time for public notice and comment and companies must commit to the best available emissions control technology.

One example cited by EIP: EmberGreen and EmberYork, related companies that received permits for two 900 MW gas plants in the towns of Sealy and Wharton.

The permit applications represented the facilities’ emissions as below the thresholds of major pollution sources for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and formaldehyde when assuming 3,900 hours of operation, or about 162 days, per year. However, EIP wrote, the facilities’ permits contained no requirement to limit operations to 3,900 hours per year, or to report operating hours.

Likewise, a 930 MW gas plant by ENGIE in Robstown received permits as a minor source assuming 2,000 hours of annual operation. But its permit also included no limitations of operating hours.

The state’s environmental regulator, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), has routinely enabled industrial developers to avoid the requirements of major source pollution review by issuing smaller permits, according to a 2023 investigation by Inside Climate News and the Texas Tribune.

The TCEQ did not respond to queries from Inside Climate News about the new report, nor did EmberClear or ENGIE.

Patton Dycus, EIP’s senior attorney, said federal law requires emissions sources to be evaluated based on their full capacity to emit unless they are specifically limited in permits. In April, Dycus wrote the federal Environmental Protection Agency urging a review of Texas’s permitting of the new gas plants.

“If new gas-fired plants that are major sources of criteria pollutants are constructed without the required Clean Air Act construction permits, that construction would be unlawful,” the letter said. “TCEQ must not permit future similar gas-fired power plants through standard permitting.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4O6A0125-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:43:54.474056

The agency also plans to scale back rules on mercury and other toxic pollutants, arguing the changes will reduce costs for industry and promote US energy production.

These rollbacks aim to fulfill former President Trump’s promise to “unleash American energy” and mark a reversal of climate policies implemented during the Biden administration. If finalized, they could undermine efforts to address pollution in communities heavily impacted by industrial emissions.

“BECCS is the way forward,” Greg Stangl, Phoenix E | RSS.com

Environmental advocates warn that repealing these protections would increase smog, mercury, and particulate pollution—harmful to both public health and the climate. The EPA’s own prior estimates suggest the current rules could save up to 30,000 lives and $275 billion annually.

Zeldin says the proposals are part of a broader push to end what he calls the “war” on domestic energy and to lower the cost of living.

Critics, however, argue the changes violate clean air laws and threaten public health. Legal challenges are expected if the rules move forward.

Barclay Rogers, CEO of carbon removal company Graphyte, stated: “The American economy thrives on innovation, and as demand for electricity grows due to AI, data centers, and reshoring of US manufacturing, that innovation must focus on expanding supply without increasing CO2 emissions.”

“If we’re going to pull back rules on emissions from power plants, we need to accelerate efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere with immediately scalable carbon removal solutions that support economic growth and reduce the rising costs of climate-related events.”

The EPA now claims that emissions from fossil-fueled plants don’t significantly contribute to dangerous pollution under the Clean Air Act — a position that could weaken regulation across other industrial sectors.

And so, quite naturally, businesses are pulling back,"" Keefe said, noting the biggest states for clean energy projects are red states.
Group of House Republicans also wants changes Senators aren't only hearing from industry leaders, they're also hearing from Republicans in the House.","As Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee prepare to release their portion of the GOP legislative package working its way through Congress, energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration remain a major part of their debate.

At issue are clean energy credits that were enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, known as the IRA, and largely eliminated in the version of the bill that the House passed.

The bill would halt roughly $522 billion in investments approved in the IRA from being spent in communities across the country.

The House bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles, and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment, among other changes.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say they are fielding calls from advocates and energy industry leaders concerned that without significant changes from the Senate, Americans will face higher energy bills and less jobs.

And the credits are already becoming fodder for political attacks. Groups like Protect Our Jobs, a political action committee spending money advocating for clean energy jobs, is funneling money into ads targeting House Republicans who supported the reconciliation bill.

""I'm a Republican, but now I'm seeing Republicans in Washington try to eliminate jobs like mine,"" says an electrician working in solar energy in one ad.

""How [tax credits] go is important"" says GOP senator looking at House bill

A handful of GOP senators are advocating against a slash and burn approach on the energy credits.

GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas cautioned against a ""full-scale repeal of current credits"" in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

""Many American companies have made substantial investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure based on the current energy tax framework,"" they wrote in the letter. ""A wholesale repeal, or termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.""

In an interview with NPR, Sen. Curtis said he is having good conversations with other Senate Republicans who are ""very receptive"" to his concerns about the House bill.

""I think it's really important that Senate Republicans — and I wish House Republicans — look at this not from the standpoint of 'it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad', but rather what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy and make good, thoughtful decisions,"" Curtis said.

He stressed the need to consider how to support business owners who had been making plans under the IRA.

""One of the worst things that we do to businesses is inconsistency and unpredictability. And therefore, I argue for a kind of appropriate off ramp,"" he said. ""If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees of those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.""

Outside analysts say businesses are already feeling the impact. E2, a nonpartisan, pro-environment business group, has been tracking clean energy project announcements and jobs for over two years. The group's executive director, Bob Keefe, told NPR the market began responding before the House legislation was even written.

""Since January alone, we've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects — clean energy, electric vehicle related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects — $14 billion worth of business investment canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill,"" he said.

E2 estimates more than 10,000 announced jobs have been canceled because of concerns over the House bill.

""The House just pulled the rug out from all of those businesses who had been already investing and planning for this by saying that these tax credits were going to get repealed. And so, quite naturally, businesses are pulling back,"" Keefe said, noting the biggest states for clean energy projects are red states. ""If the Senate doesn't fix it, our economy is going to suffer.""

Group of House Republicans also wants changes

Senators aren't only hearing from industry leaders, they're also hearing from Republicans in the House.

""We had some good conversations with a handful of senators and have been having ongoing conversations,"" said Rep. Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa., who wants to see the Senate make adjustments to the House bill he voted for.

""The energy credits are very big for northeastern Pennsylvania,"" he told NPR. ""I'm OK with the phase out, but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from essentially underneath them.""

Bresnahan is one of 13 Republican House members who sent a letter last week to Senate leadership, urging the chamber to ""substantially and strategically improve our clean energy tax credit provisions"" from the House-passed bill.

The group lists concerns about restrictions of transferability of some credits, the 60-day time limit for enacting projects and other issues.

""This approach jeopardizes ongoing development, discourages long-term investment, and could significantly delay or cancel energy infrastructure projects across the country,"" the letter reads. ""Without a clear signal from Congress encouraging continued investments and offering business certainty as these provisions are phased out, project cancellations will continue to snowball.""

Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

""What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator to those who support innovation or are concerned about not jacking up prices and understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is a kind of Republican idea,"" Wyden told NPR.

But changes passed in the Senate would require approval in the House, and any major adjustments could jeopardize the delicate balance of support that allowed GOP leaders to force the bill through last month. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has repeatedly warned senators to tread lightly when it comes to changes in the bill.

Members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus have specifically called out clean energy incentives as a red line for their members.

""We want to be crystal clear: if the Senate attempts to water down, strip out, or walk back the hard-fought spending reductions and IRA Green New Scam rollbacks achieved in this legislation, we will not accept it,"" the group said in a statement.

The task force is required to include representatives from the oil and gas industry, an energy trade association and law enforcement agencies.
Through the asset forfeiture process, the bill allows an officer who takes custody of a petroleum product alleged to have been stolen to arrange for the total amount of the petroleum product to be sold at market rate.","Pending Gov. Greg Abbott’s approval, the State of Texas is getting into the nuclear energy business in a big way with the establishment within the governor’s office of the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office.

The enabling legislation, House Bill 14 by Palestine Republican Rep. Cody Harris, would provide strategic leadership, coordination and support for the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies including Generation III and IV reactors like large light water reactors, small modular reactors, micro-reactors and nuclear cogeneration facilities.

Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners President Ed Longanecker said the nuclear office would identify regulatory and financial barriers, promote public outreach and education, collaborate with stakeholders in higher education, industry and regulators and help develop a strategic plan for nuclear energy development in Texas.

It has a statutory sunset date of Sept. 1, 2040.

“HB 14 creates the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund and Grant Program, a reimbursement grants program, a dedicated account in the general revenue fund able to receive appropriations, gifts, grants and donations to cover the costs of development-construction of advanced nuclear reactors in Texas,” Longanecker said.

Project Development and Supply Chain Reimbursement grants are capped at the lesser of 50% of qualifying expenses or $12.5 million and Construction Reimbursement grants can be up to the lesser of 50% of qualifying expenses or $120 million, he said.

“There are also Completion and Operation grants available for projects capable of interconnecting with the ERCOT grid,” Longanecker said. “Grants are primarily for expenses paid by the recipient’s own funds and are tied to benchmarks and milestones.”

Lastly, he said, the bill will establish a Nuclear Permitting Coordinator for the state and an Advanced Nuclear Energy Workforce Development Program and it will require a regulatory study to identify necessary state regulatory functions related to nuclear energy generation facilities in Texas.

A report is due by Dec. 1, 2026. The bill was on its way to the governor with an effective date of Sept. 1.

During the recently concluded 89th Texas Legislative Session, Longanecker said, 9,014 bills and constitutional amendments were introduced and 1,169 passed.

“TIPRO tracked and-or lobbied more than 258 pieces of legislation which pertained to the oil and gas industry, either directly or indirectly, and took formal positions on 98 bills,” he said. “100 percent of bills opposed by TIPRO failed and 75 percent of the bills we supported passed.”

He said key areas of focus for TIPRO included funding for the Railroad Commission of Texas and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, oilfield theft, infrastructure, electricity and grid reliability, orphan and inactive wells, water and produced water management and wildfire management, among numerous others.

“Both the RRC and TCEQ fared very well for the upcoming budget cycle, each obtaining almost everything they asked for in the new biennium’s budget,” Longanecker said. “Of the RRC’s total budget for the biennium, totaling $458.7 million in all funds, the agency received dollars for the below exceptional items they requested: oil and gas orphaned well plugging, $100 million; Produced Water Injection Data Reporting System, $7.6 million; Oil and Gas Authorized Pit Registration System, $2.7 million; Oversight and Safety Regulatory Filing and Permitting Systems, $6.2 million; Underground Injection Well Investigation Team, $1.3 million; Site Remediation Program Support, $342,000; GIS Cloud Upgrade, $2.1 million; and vehicle replacements, $4.8 million.

“That’s almost $133 million in exceptional items,” he said. “The agency did an incredible job of getting badly needed budget dollars.

“The only item of the agency’s exceptional items that was not funded was the request for microfilm digitization. The RRC asks for these specific funds every legislative session and the legislature has never provided them. The cost of this item is $907,000 and the agency will find the funds elsewhere in its budget to continue its digitization work.”

Of the TCEQ’s total budget for the biennium, totaling $918.2 million in all funds, Longanecker said, the agency got funding to enhance permitting, compliance and public engagement, $26.3 million; salary and retention efforts, $39.5 million; produced water, $6.7 million; and administrative support, $4.06 million.

“During the interim TIPRO met with a broad group of stakeholders on the topic of oilfield theft to develop solutions to mitigate and prosecute this illicit activity, many of which took the form of legislation during the 89th Session,” he said. “These bills passed and were signed into law by Gov. Abbott.

“House Bill 48 requires the director of the Department of Public Safety to create an organized oilfield theft prevention unit,” Longanecker said. “In addition to enforcing laws pertaining to the theft of oil, gas and related equipment, the unit will also develop and deploy specialized training, resources and policing strategies tailored to investigating and preventing organized oilfield theft to local law enforcement.

“They will conduct public outreach and awareness initiatives to educate industry professionals and communities on organized oilfield theft prevention; and maintain a centralized database for tracking organized oilfield theft incidents and related criminal enterprises.

“The bill will also require DPS to submit a biennial report to the legislature detailing the unit’s activities and effectiveness and include legislative or administrative recommendations to improve its efficacy.”

He said Senate Bill 494 requires the RRC to create a task force focused on preventing the theft of petroleum products. The task force is required to include representatives from the oil and gas industry, an energy trade association and law enforcement agencies.

The task force is required to meet quarterly and may conduct meetings virtually. It will conduct a continuous study on the theft of petroleum products including reviewing laws in other jurisdictions and analyzing impacts on sales tax and long-term economics.

Recommendations from the committee must include outreach and training for law enforcement on combating theft. The task force is permitted to consult with external organizations and share information on criminal investigations, providing exceptions to some confidentiality rules.

Finally, SB 494 requires a report to be submitted biennially to the governor, the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the House of Representatives, the RRC and each standing committee of the Legislature with primary jurisdiction over oil and gas matters, emphasizing legislative recommendations for transparency, security and economic impacts related to theft.

Senate Bill 1806 authorizes specially trained DPS agents to conduct comprehensive inspections of cargo tanks suspected of being used to transport a petroleum product in the state and submit the sample to a crime laboratory for forensic analysis.

Through the asset forfeiture process, the bill allows an officer who takes custody of a petroleum product alleged to have been stolen to arrange for the total amount of the petroleum product to be sold at market rate.

The process allows for stolen product to be recovered by whom the product was stolen from or recoup the funds if proved it was their product stolen.

The bill defines oil and gas equipment and increases the penalties for theft of petroleum products and oil and gas equipment and adds the following offenses to the increased penalty ladder: 1) transporting to a waste disposal location a petroleum product in which the initial owner cannot be identified, 2) purchasing petroleum products from a person who is not authorized by the Railroad Commission of Texas to sell the petroleum product and 3) storing, purchasing or trading a petroleum product for financial benefit by means of a method that is not authorized by the Railroad Commission of Texas.

Finally, the bill creates a criminal offense for operating a disposal well without a permit from the Railroad Commission with fines up to $10,000 for a third degree felony, $10,000 to $100,000 for a second degree felony and more than $100,000 for a first degree felony.

Senate Bill 1646 aims to protect critical infrastructure by combating copper theft and fiber vandalism.

“Another ongoing priority for TIPRO is funding for infrastructure,” Longanecker said. “Significant investments are planned for state infrastructure needs including approximately $39.9 billion for transportation planning, design, construction and maintenance, around $2.5 billion in one-time funding for critical water infrastructure and a dedicated $1 billion annually to the Texas Water Fund and another $5 billion for the Texas Energy Fund to support natural gas power plant development.”",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OAT060525-Abbott-bill-sign.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:44:12.420699

Inc (JERA) for a 20-year sale and purchase agreement for liquefied natural gas (LNG) offtake of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) on a free on board basis from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project in Jefferson County, Texas.

""We are pleased to collaborate with JERA, Japan's largest power generation company and one of the world's largest LNG buyers, as they continue to work with the United States to diversify their sources to help strengthen the resilience and dependability of their energy supply,"" said Justin Bird, chief executive officer of Sempra Infrastructure. ""With this announcement, we continue to make steady progress towards reaching a final investment decision for the project, which is expected to extend the reach of U.S. natural gas to global energy markets.""

The proposed Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project is competitively positioned and is under active marketing. Future phases are also in the early development stage.

The project has received all its key permits and is expected to include two liquefaction trains capable of producing approximately 13 Mtpa of LNG, which could increase the total liquefaction capacity of the Port Arthur LNG facility from approximately 13 Mtpa for Phase 1, which is under construction, to up to approximately 26 Mtpa.

The project received authorization from the U.S. Department of Energy in May to export U.S. LNG to countries that do not have a free-trade agreement with the U.S. The project also received authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in September 2023.

In June 2024, Sempra Infrastructure and a subsidiary of Aramco signed a non-binding heads of agreement contemplating both a long-term LNG offtake agreement and an equity investment in the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project. In July 2024, Sempra Infrastructure announced that Bechtel had been selected for a fixed-price engineering, procurement and construction contract for the project.

The Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project is currently under construction and expected to achieve commercial operation in 2027 and 2028 for trains 1 and 2, respectively.

The development of the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project remains subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including completing the required commercial agreements, securing and/or maintaining all necessary permits, obtaining financing and reaching a final investment decision, among other factors.

The Trump administration's shift away from climate efforts is partly behind BP's decision to pause the carbon storage project.
BP received a $98 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy two years ago for carbon storage projects in Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.","Oil company BP has put a project to store its carbon emissions underground in Indiana on hold. The company planned to pipe carbon dioxide from its Whiting Refinery and store it in rural areas to the south — in counties like Newton, Jasper, Pulaski, White and Benton.

It was part of BP's effort to make ""blue"" hydrogen — which is made using energy from fossil fuels, but includes carbon storage. BP is one of several companies that committed to grow clean hydrogen in the region as part of the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen or MachH2. It's not clear what BP's decision to pause the project means for the hydrogen hub overall.

BP did seismic testing in Benton County to see if it would be a viable place for storage. But Benton County Commissioner John Gick said it's unlikely landowners would have allowed the company to store CO2 there — few residents were in favor of the project.

They expressed concerns about everything from earthquakes, to contaminating drinking water to hurting crops.

""Not knowing what that could or could not do to our ground should there be a leak — there's just too many unknowns,"" Gick said.

A state law also made Indiana taxpayers liable for incidents that happen years after carbon storage facilities close.

Residents living along the path of the pipeline in northwest Indiana also had concerns about the project.

Lisa Vallee is with the group Just Transition Northwest Indiana and lives within a mile of the refinery. She said residents worried leaks in the pipeline could contaminate drinking water or cause an explosion.

Several environmental groups have come out against carbon capture and storage because it allows companies to continue to pollute rather than forcing them to reduce their emissions.

Still, Vallee said the fact that BP is reneging on some of its climate commitments and jobs for the community is disheartening. In February, the company cut $5 billion in funding for renewable projects.

""When it is no longer profitable, when they no longer are getting tax credits — for example, for wind and solar energy,"" Vallee said. ""They are backing away from that.""

The Trump administration's shift away from climate efforts is partly behind BP's decision to pause the carbon storage project.

In a statement, the company cited economic uncertainty, the slow-developing hydrogen market and BP's renewed focus on oil and gas, among other reasons.

""This decision relates solely to BP's involvement in the Midwest and not to any other low-carbon hydrogen project BP may develop elsewhere in the U.S. or globally,"" BP said in a statement.

Last month, U.S. Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan (D-Highland) wrote a letter to the U.S. energy secretary in support of the hydrogen hub.

BP received a $98 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy two years ago for carbon storage projects in Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.

WASHINGTON – Today, alongside U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), House Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY-02), U.S. Representatives Troy Balderson (R-OH-12), Carol Miller (R-WV-01), Dan Meuser (R-PA-09), Rob Bresnahan (R-PA-08), and Michael Rulli (R-OH-06), and Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced two proposals in an important step towards ensuring affordable, dependable energy for American families and restore American energy dominance. EPA is proposing to repeal all “greenhouse gas” emissions standards for the power sector under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and to repeal amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) that directly result in coal-fired power plants having to shut down. These Biden-era regulations have imposed massive costs on coal-, oil-, and gas-fired power plants, raising the cost of living for American families, imperiling the reliability of our electric grid, and limiting American energy prosperity.

“Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream and a natural byproduct of national energy dominance,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn't align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence.”

Ensuring affordable and reliable energy supplies drives down the costs of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing while boosting our national security. Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of baseload power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the Artificial Intelligence capital of the world. The proposed repeals would remove regulatory barriers that limit access to our Nation’s energy resources and unleash America’s true potential.

Proposal to repeal Obama and Biden Administrations’ regulations on power plants

EPA is proposing to repeal the 2015 emissions standards for new fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Obama-Biden Administration, and the 2024 rule for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Biden-Harris Administration.

The first Clean Power Plan was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022. Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country’s reliance on foreign-made energy.

In West Virginia v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the major questions doctrine barred EPA from misusing the Clean Air Act to manipulate Americans’ energy choices and shift the balance of the nation’s electrical fuel mix. The Biden Administration issued its own rule in 2024, which many critics say is just another attempt to achieve the unlawful fuel-shifting goals of the Clean Power Plan.

Unlike other air pollutants with a regional or local impact, the targeted emissions are global in nature. As a result, any potential public health harms have not been accurately attributed to emissions from the U.S. power sector. In light of this, EPA is proposing that the CAA requires the agency to make a finding that the targeted emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution before regulating these emissions from this source category. In addition, EPA is proposing that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the statute.

As an alternative, EPA is proposing to repeal the most burdensome set of requirements issued for new and existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating units—specifically, the emission guidelines for existing power plants, and carbon capture and sequestration/storage-based requirements for new combustion turbines and modified coal plants. As part of this alternative proposal, EPA is taking comment on the efficiency-based requirements for new natural gas power plant requirements.

Based on EPA’s estimates, this proposal would save the power sector $19 billion in regulatory costs over two decades beginning in 2026, or about $1.2 billion a year.

Proposal to repeal certain amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards

EPA is also proposing to repeal certain amendments issued on May 7, 2024, to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units – a rule commonly known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for power plants, or simply MATS. This proposal would revert back to 2012 standards that have driven sharp reductions in harmful air toxic pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants.

The 2024 MATS rule has caused significant regulatory uncertainty, especially for coal plants in Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. $1.2 billion over the next decade starting in 2028, or about $120 million a year for the power sector. These costs are large and unnecessary given the success the industry has already achieved in reducing emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants.

This action proposes to relieve all facilities of the more stringent filterable particulate matter (PM) emission standard for coal-fired EGUs, the tighter mercury standard for lignite-fired EGUs, and the requirement to use PM Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS).

The original MATS Rule was promulgated in 2012 and has since been highly effective in protecting public health and the environment. Specifically, 2021 mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants were 90 percent lower than pre-MATS levels. Since 2010, acid gas hazardous air pollutant emissions have been reduced by over 96 percent, and emissions of the non-mercury metals – including nickel, arsenic, and lead – have been reduced by more than 81 percent.

This proposed action would enhance efforts to Restore American Energy Dominance by removing costly burdens on coal- and oil-fired power plants while still accomplishing the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.

EPA estimates that this proposed repeal of the 2024 MATS Amendments would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade, or about $120 million a year.

The new investment will give GM the ability to assemble more than two million vehicles per year in the U.S.

The announcement comes on the heels of the company’s recently announced plan to invest $888 million in the Tonawanda Propulsion plant near Buffalo, New York to support GM’s next-generation V-8 engine.

The expanded plants in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee will expand finished vehicle production of several of GM’s most popular vehicles:

Orion Assembly, Orion Township, MI: GM will begin production of gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks at Orion in early 2027 to help meet continued strong demand. As a result, GM’s Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan will be the dedicated assembly location for the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, and GMC HUMMER EV pickup and SUV.

Fairfax Assembly, Kansas City, KS: Fairfax Assembly will support production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox beginning in mid-2027. Sales of the recently redesigned Equinox were up more than 30% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025. Fairfax remains on track to begin building the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt EV by the end of this year. GM expects to make new future investments in Fairfax for GM’s next generation of affordable EVs.

Spring Hill Manufacturing, Spring Hill, TN: GM will add production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer at Spring Hill starting in 2027, alongside the Cadillac LYRIQ and VISTIQ EVs, and the Cadillac XT5.

“We believe the future of transportation will be driven by American innovation and manufacturing expertise,” said Mary Barra, Chair and CEO, GM. “Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the U.S and to support American jobs.

Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year.
Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.
The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.
“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said.","WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help “unleash” American energy.

The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm the brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.

The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump's repeated pledge to “ unleash American energy ” and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.

If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.

The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administrations’ “war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.”

“The American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,'' he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. “They wanted to make sure that … no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living … create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.”

Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.

Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals “yet another in a series of attacks” by the Trump administration on the nation's “health, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.”

She called it “unconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.”

“Ignoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,'' added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court.”

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated — they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of greenhouse gases, driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.

The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.

In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,'' the EPA said, adding: “This Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.

If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA’s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don’t either and therefore shouldn’t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice at Jenner & Block LLP.

The EPA proposal “has the potential to have much, much broader implications,” she said.

Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to “suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,” with the intent to regulate the coal industry “out of existence” and make it “disappear.”

National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove “deliberately unattainable standards” for clean air while “leveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.”

But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.

“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said. “These are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.”

A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.

“Carbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,” said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in “significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,” he said.

Keeping these energy tax credits will empower American enterprise, protect ratepayers, and secure South Carolina’s leadership in 21st-century manufacturing.","With the clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, businesses have announced plans to create over 20,000 new clean energy jobs and invest over $32 billion into South Carolina’s economy over the next decade.

These strategic investments in advanced energy manufacturing, electric transportation, and electric grid resilience are powering job creation, revitalizing rural areas, and positioning South Carolina as a national leader in American-made energy. These clean energy tax credits are critical for businesses, like mine, here in South Carolina in order to maintain investment and continue growing the manufacturing base within the Palmetto State.

South Carolina’s power grid — like much of the nation’s — is aging and under rising pressure.

Demand from data centers, manufacturing expansions, and electric vehicles is expected to surge over the next decade. In South Carolina, the commercial and industrial electricity rates are 10.97 cents/kWh and 7.01 cents/kWh, respectively, and both are below the national average.

However, electricity rates are up almost 6% from the year prior. Reduced incentivized investment in clean energy infrastructure could lead to even higher prices due to a reliance on more expensive, traditional power sources. Strategic energy investments, supported by stable tax policies, will help us avoid future grid shortfalls, prevent the risk of rolling blackouts, and reduce long-term energy costs for South Carolina families and businesses.

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Clean energy technologies are no exception.

In 2024, over 2,600 megawatts of solar energy capacity came online in South Carolina, equating to enough power to supply 325,640 homes.

Over the next five years, South Carolina is projected to add over 2,500 megawatts of solar capacity.

Retaining the existing energy tax credits will allow businesses in South Carolina to continue to develop and deploy renewable energy technologies which are vital to improve grid resiliency, promote greater efficiency that results in lower energy costs for everyone, and foster economic opportunities in our rural communities.

Energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. In addition, if we’re manufacturing these technologies here in South Carolina, we are securing our energy independence by growing our ability to produce what we need at home and having greater control over our supply chain.

Businesses have planned with these tax incentives in mind and rely upon them for capital allocation, planning, and project commitments — all of which would be threatened by the whiplash of major changes to these credits or further restrictions.

We’ve already seen a taste of what this disruption can do.

Recent federal changes and uncertainty have led to an indefinite pause in the construction of the AESC manufacturing facility in Florence, a $1.6 billion investment that promised to create 1,600 jobs in the Pee Dee.

A full repeal of these vital credits would undermine significant progress made in clean energy innovation, economic growth, and national security, and likely cede jobs and progress to China.

Now it’s up to our elected officials on Capitol Hill to decide whether these clean energy tax credits continue as Congress intended in 2022.

These private and public investments will spur domestic production of clean energy technologies which will set the United States up to compete in the global clean energy economy and create thousands more in clean energy jobs that will benefit all South Carolinians.

South Carolina businesses are ready to build — ready to invest in local workers, modern energy systems, and secure supply chains. But we need policy certainty to stay competitive.

Keeping these energy tax credits will empower American enterprise, protect ratepayers, and secure South Carolina’s leadership in 21st-century manufacturing.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-panels-in-field.jpeg,N,,2025-06-12 23:45:09.855229

Nuclear power Meanwhile, the bill partially retains a tax credit for electricity from existing nuclear power plants.
Summing it up The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that the House bill would cut the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits by about half, saving the government $50 billion a year.","When it comes to energy policy, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” – the official name of a massive federal tax-cut and spending bill that House Republicans passed in May 2025 – risks raising Americans’ energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

The 1,100-page bill would slash incentives for green technologies such as solar, wind, batteries, electric cars and heat pumps while subsidizing existing nuclear power plants and biofuels. That would leave the country and its people burning more fossil fuels despite strong popular and scientific support for a rapid shift to renewable energy.

The bill may still be revised by the Senate before it moves to a final vote. But it is a picture of how President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans want to reshape U.S. energy policy.

As an environmental engineering professor who studies ways to confront climate change, I think it is important to distinguish which technologies could rapidly cut emissions or are on the verge of becoming viable from those that do little to fight climate change. Unfortunately, the House bill favors the latter while nixing support for the former.

Renewable energy

Wind and solar power, often paired with batteries, are providing over 90% of the new electricity currently being added to the grid nationally and around the world. Geothermal power is undergoing technological breakthroughs. With natural gas turbines in short supply and long lead times to build other resources, renewables and batteries offer the fastest way to satisfy growing demand for power.

However, the House bill rescinds billions of dollars that the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, devoted to boosting domestic manufacturing and deployments of renewable energy and batteries.

It would terminate tax credits for manufacturing for the wind industry in 2028 and for solar and batteries in 2032. That would disrupt the boom in domestic manufacturing projects that was being stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Deployments would be hit even harder. Wind, solar, geothermal and battery projects would need to commence construction within 60 days of passage of the bill to receive tax credits.

In addition, the bill would deny tax credits to projects that use Chinese-made components. Financial analysts have called those provisions “unworkable,” since some Chinese materials may be necessary even for projects built with as much domestic content as possible.

Analysts warn that the House bill would cut new wind, solar and battery installations by 20% compared with the growth that had been expected without the bill. That’s why BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, called the bill a “nightmare scenario” for clean energy proponents.

However, one person’s nightmare may be another man’s dream. “We’re constraining the hell out of wind and solar, which is good,” said Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican backed by the oil and gas industry.

Efficiency and electric cars

Cuts fall even harder on Americans who are trying to reduce their carbon footprints and energy costs. The bill repeals aid for home efficiency improvements such as heat pumps, efficient windows and energy audits. Homeowners would also lose tax credits for installing solar panels and batteries.

For vehicles, the bill would not only repeal tax credits for electric cars, trucks and chargers, but it also would impose a federal $250 annual fee on vehicles, on top of fees that some states charge electric-car owners. The federal fee is more than the gas taxes paid by other drivers to fund highways and ignores air-quality and climate effects.

Combined, the lost credits and increased fees could cut projected U.S. sales of electric vehicles by 40% in 2030, according to modeling by Jesse Jenkins of Princeton University.

Nuclear power

Meanwhile, the bill partially retains a tax credit for electricity from existing nuclear power plants. Those plants may not need the help: Electricity demand is surging, and companies like Meta are signing long-term deals for nuclear energy to power data centers. Nuclear plants are also paid to manage their radioactive waste, since the country lacks a permanent place to store it.

For new nuclear plants, the bill would move up the deadline to 2028 to begin construction. That deadline is too soon for some new reactor designs and would rush the vetting of others. Nuclear safety regulators are awaiting a study from the National Academies on the weapons proliferation risks of the type of uranium fuel that some developers hope to use in newer designs.

Biofuels

While cutting funding for electric vehicles, the bill would spend $45 billion to extend tax credits for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.

Food-based biofuels do little good for the climate because growing, harvesting and processing crops requires fertilizers, pesticides and fuel. The bill would allow forests to be cut to make room for crops because it directs agencies to ignore the impacts of biofuels on land use.

Hydrogen

The bill would end tax credits for hydrogen production. Without that support, companies will be unlikely to invest in the seven so-called “hydrogen hubs” that were allocated a combined $8 billion under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021. Those hubs aim to attract $40 billion in private investments and create tens of thousands of jobs while developing cleaner ways to make hydrogen.

The repealed tax credits would have subsidized hydrogen made emissions-free by using renewable or nuclear electricity to split water molecules. They also would have subsidized hydrogen made from natural gas with carbon capture, whose benefits are impaired by methane emissions from natural gas systems and incomplete carbon capture.

However it’s made, hydrogen is no panacea. As the world’s smallest molecule, hydrogen is prone to leaking, which can pose safety challenges and indirectly warm the climate. And while hydrogen is essential for making fertilizers and potentially useful for making steel or aviation fuels, vehicles and heating are more efficiently powered by electricity than by hydrogen.

Still, European governments and China are investing heavily in hydrogen production.

Summing it up

The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that the House bill would cut the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits by about half, saving the government $50 billion a year. But with fewer efficiency improvements, fewer electric vehicles and less clean power on the grid, Princeton’s Jenkins projects American households would pay up to $415 more per year for energy by 2035 than if the bill’s provisions were not enacted. If the bill’s provisions make it into law, the extra fossil fuel-burning would leave annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 1 billion tons higher by then.

No one expected former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to escape unscathed with Republicans in the White House and dominating both houses of Congress. Still, the proposed cuts target the technologies Americans count on to protect the climate and save consumers money.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/673080/original/file-20250609-62-1ee6mx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C285%2C5578%2C2789&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-12 23:44:30.118621

H.R. 1 would weaken our economy, raise utility prices on consumers, and undermine our national security.”

Since the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 passed, more than $24 billion in clean energy technology investments have been announced across North Carolina. These announcements include batteries for storage and vehicle applications, solar panels, cells, and wafers, electric vehicle charging stations, transformers, critical minerals, and a wide variety of grid-enhancing products. These businesses already or will soon employ tens of thousands of people, in addition to the more than 100,000 people already employed in North Carolina’s clean energy sector. The U.S. House budget resolution’s repeal of these tax credits would threaten jobs in North Carolina and put billions of dollars in investments at risk.

Mapping maximum and constrained reforestation potential To map maximum and constrained reforestation potential, we filtered our forest potential map to places where additional forests could grow given practical constraints and safeguards.
This conservative approach thus only maps forest potential to pixels where both the Bastin and Walker forest potential maps agree, and where both products have low uncertainty.
Maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping The maximum reforestation potential map shows where it is possible to add forest within the forest potential map, while the constrained reforestation potential map shows where it is possible to add forest within the forest potential map while avoiding perverse outcomes.
For each constrained reforestation potential map, we calculated the area of agreement (intersection) with our forest potential map, constrained reforestation potential map, implementation exclusions, and precautionary exclusions.","Natural climate solutions (NCS) are ecosystem stewardship actions that protect, manage, and restore natural and working lands to provide measurable climate change mitigation1, and have garnered increasing international and policy recognition2. Reforestation—the restoration of forest cover via tree planting, direct seeding, or natural regrowth in places where forests are absent but naturally occur—is especially promising because it is the largest and most cost-effective option for carbon removal1,2,3,4. However, there remains high uncertainty and controversy around where reforestation can be deployed.

Numerous global maps have been produced to identify areas where reforestation for climate change mitigation could technically and/or optimally occur1,5,6,7,8. Five high-profile global maps have been subjects of much criticism9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25: the Atlas of Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunities (FLRO) by Laestadius et al.6, the NCS reforestation map by Griscom et al.1, the Global Tree Restoration Potential map by Bastin et al.5, the Global Priority Areas for Restoration by Strassburg et al.7, and the Global Potential for Increased Storage of Carbon map by Walker et al.8 (hereafter FLRO map, Griscom map, Bastin map, Strassburg map, and Walker map). Common critiques center on (1) definitions: the assumptions that determine where reforestation technically could occur, (2) data: the limitations of the source data used for mapping, and (3) precautions: the failure to consider potential perverse outcomes. These critiques have led to vociferous arguments in the literature13,18,19,25 and media, leaving decision makers uncertain about the magnitude of global reforestation opportunity.

Definition critiques focus on the criteria used to delimit where reforestation could occur. Many of these objections are raised against broad definitions of forest that include open woodlands and savannas, where increasing tree cover reduces biodiversity and compromises ecosystem services9,10,11,19. Other criticisms address ecological factors like fire and herbivory, which can naturally limit tree cover but are often overlooked when defining where forest could occur9,11,13,16,22.

Data critiques often focus on the limitations of source datasets. For example, Fagan demonstrated that some maps over-estimate reforestation potential in arid biomes because land use/land cover (LULC) maps systematically under-estimate sparse tree cover, and thus erroneously target areas that already have sufficient tree cover17. Other maps use coarse-scale LULC products that poorly differentiate land uses within mixed land cover classes (e.g., cropland mosaic classes that include up to 50% natural vegetation)20. Finally, some reforestation maps use coarse biome designations which ignore heterogeneity within regions and potentially overlook viable reforestation areas11.

Precautionary critiques highlight that reforestation can have perverse outcomes and object to the lack of safeguards or practical consideration of those outcomes in reforestation maps. Maps that include croplands as reforestation opportunities are criticized for not sufficiently considering local food security in some regions, changes in food demand due to diet shifts, and/or leakage (i.e., conversion of ecosystems elsewhere for agriculture)20. Still other maps are criticized for failing to exclude areas where reforestation would exacerbate, rather than reduce, global warming due to changes in albedo9,13,21,26. Maps are also criticized for ignoring the equity implications of mapping reforestation opportunity in areas stewarded by communities with relatively low incomes and education levels, poor food security and health outcomes, weak rule of law and land tenure, and/or high reliance on subsistence agriculture14,15,18,24.

Despite these critiques, global reforestation maps are widely referenced and used in cases ranging from policy documents to scientific research. For example, Google Scholar identifies over 6000 total citations for the FLRO, Griscom, Bastin, Strassburg, and Walker maps, the Bastin map launched the Trillion Trees movement (1t.org), and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) used the Griscom map to determine the maximum potential of reforestation as a climate solution3. These uses underscore the need to address critiques directly and improve reforestation maps using updated science and sustainability principles27.

In this work, we create a suite of global maps that (1) build on the strengths of existing maps, (2) address key critiques, (3) incorporate the latest high-resolution global datasets, and (4) demonstrate how areas of opportunity vary depending on different value-based methodological decisions. Rather than producing a single area estimate or conducting a prioritization exercise, we aim to provide multiple estimates that incorporate additional considerations so that decision makers can evaluate how much area is feasible and desirable for their reforestation efforts, given their specific circumstances.

Existing reforestation maps

To learn from and build on previous efforts to map reforestation opportunities, we conducted a review of the existing literature (see “Methods”) and found 89 studies published between 2011 and 2022 (see “Data availability”). We identified seven global maps, including four original maps (FLRO, Bastin, Strassburg, and Walker maps), a modification of the FLRO map (the Griscom map), and two applications of the Griscom map (refs. 28,29). We identified ten regional maps (including two that use the FLRO map), which mainly covered tropical regions. Finally, we identified 15 national and 57 sub-national maps, which occur in 10% of all countries (i.e., 20 countries). Although some areas have high coverage (e.g., states in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest ecoregion have at least 20 maps available), most countries must rely on global or regional products for estimating reforestation opportunity (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We found that reforestation maps are generally produced using a common process, regardless of extent (Fig. 1). First, forest is defined, typically using tree cover, canopy cover, or biomass thresholds. Next, the area where forest could occur is identified (hereafter, forest potential). For example, the FLRO, Bastin, and Walker maps use biophysical constraints such as climate or soil variables to model forest potential. In other cases, as with the Strassburg map, areas of LULC change (i.e., deforestation) are used to infer forest potential. Next, the maximum area where reforestation could occur within the forest potential area is identified (hereafter, maximum reforestation potential) by accounting for practical limitations to reforestation, such as existing forest. Many maps also apply safeguards to minimize perverse outcomes and further limit the area where reforestation could occur (hereafter, constrained reforestation potential). For example, croplands are commonly removed in this step because reforestation of these lands can affect food security30 and/or result in leakage31. Some analyses then use additional factors to further evaluate trade-offs and benefits or to prioritize areas within the maximum or constrained reforestation potential (hereafter contextualized reforestation potential).

Across the 89 reforestation opportunity maps, however, there is no universal standard for how spatial data is used for mapping forest potential, maximum reforestation potential, or constrained reforestation potential. These maps use 28 different types of spatial data to map where forest or reforestation potential can occur (hereafter suitability factors) and 22 different types of spatial data to map where forest or restoration cannot occur (hereafter exclusions) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Deforested areas, croplands, and pasture are the most frequently used suitability factors (used in 20 or more maps) (Fig. 2). Urban areas and existing forest are the most commonly applied exclusions (used in more than a third of all maps), followed by water, croplands, wetlands, and barren lands (Fig. 2). Overlays used for mapping contextualized reforestation span the greatest diversity of factors (30 across existing maps) with neighborhood metrics (e.g., forest pattern and distance to forest), economic factors (e.g., opportunity costs of the non-forest land use), terrain factors (e.g., slope), and carbon sequestration most commonly used (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Sometimes the same factor is used as a suitability criterion, as an exclusion, and/or as an overlay in the same analysis (Fig. 2). For example, the Strassburg map uses cropland and pasture within the forest potential to identify the maximum reforestation potential and uses cropland and pasture productivity and yield to further prioritize areas within the contextualized reforestation potential.7

We compared the spatial overlap and agreement of the four original global forest potential maps (FLRO, Bastin, Strassburg, and Walker; we excluded the three global analyses1,29,32, which re-use these maps). Combining the areas identified as forest potential across the four maps results in 9455 Mha (million hectares), equivalent to 74% of global ice-free land area. Individual map estimates range from 6160 Mha (Strassburg) to 8682 Mha (Bastin) (Supplementary Table 2, see “Methods”). All four maps agree in 57% (5412 Mha) of their combined extent, but at least three maps agree in 77% (7246 Mha) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, there is moderate convergence among products despite variation in how forest is defined: FLRO and the Bastin map use 10% tree cover threshold to define forests, the Strassburg map uses 15%, whereas the Walker map uses a potential biomass criterion (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2).

Among the seven global analyses, five provide original maps of reforestation potential (FLRO, Griscom, Bastin, Strassburg, and Walker; we excluded one global analysis that reuses Griscom28 and another that maps reforestation potential using future land use scenarios29). For identifying reforestation potential, the Strassburg map only identifies maximum reforestation potential (1537 Mha) (Supplementary Table 2). The remaining four global maps (FLRO, Griscom, Bastin, and Walker) go further and identify constrained reforestation potential (Supplementary Table 2). The combined extent of constrained reforestation potential for these four is 4288 Mha (34% of global ice-free land area) (see “Methods”). Constrained reforestation potential varies more dramatically than forest potential among products, with nearly a 3-fold difference in extent (678 Mha in the Griscom map to 2509 Mha in the FLRO map) (Supplementary Table 2). Further, all four maps share only 23 Mha in common (0.24% of combined forest potential area, and 0.9–2.7% of individual constrained reforestation maps), though at least three maps agree in 252 Mha (3% of combined forest potential area, and 10–30% of individual constrained reforestation maps) (Supplementary Fig. 3). This striking variation is due to differences in forest potential mapping described above, as well as whether pastures are used as exclusions, and differences in the spatial resolution, time period, and LULC definitions in the datasets used to exclude existing forest, cropland, and/or pasture (Supplementary Table 2).

Mapping forest potential

Given the issues with existing reforestation maps, we created a series of reforestation opportunity maps that addressed common critiques, beginning with improvements to mapping forest potential. First, we defined forests much more conservatively, as areas that can support 60% or more tree cover, to exclude open woodlands and savannas33,34,35. Second, because there is uncertainty associated with any one product, we used multiple lines of evidence to identify forest potential by combining the two global layers that mapped uncertainty around forest potential (i.e., the Bastin and Walker maps)5,8. We restricted forest potential to pixels where the Bastin map predicts at least 60% potential tree cover, the Walker map predicts closed forest, and both maps have low uncertainty. This resulted in a preliminary forest potential area of 2393 Mha. Finally, because the Bastin and Walker models overestimate forest potential in ecosystems with frequent fires13, we eliminated areas with two or more non-cropland fires during 2002–2022, under the assumption that fire frequencies of at least two per decade can substantially limit tree density (see “Methods”). This reduced the preliminary forest potential area by 150 Mha (6.3%). These three modifications narrowed forest potential to 2242 Mha (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 2), or 26–36% of the area presented by the individual FLRO, Bastin, Strassburg, or Walker maps (Supplementary Table 2).

Mapping maximum and constrained reforestation potential

To map maximum and constrained reforestation potential, we filtered our forest potential map to places where additional forests could grow given practical constraints and safeguards. We used four exclusions related to implementation limitations (existing forest, open water, bare ground, and permanent ice/snow) to identify maximum reforestation potential and five exclusions as safeguards (croplands, built-up lands, peatlands, wetlands, and albedo) to identify constrained reforestation potential (see “Methods”, Supplementary Table 3). Except for permanent ice/snow and albedo, these exclusions are all commonly used in previously published maps (more than 12 uses). For all exclusions except peatlands and albedo, we used 10–30 m resolution global products that map individual LULC types (i.e., without mosaic LULC types) for 2019–202036,37,38,39,40 to address data critiques. Implementation exclusions remove 1937 Mha (86.4%) from the forest potential map, largely due to existing forest cover (1914 Mha or 85.3% of the forest potential area), resulting in a maximum reforestation potential of 305 Mha (Table 1). Precautionary exclusions remove an additional 110 Mha (4.9%). After we apply all exclusions, we identify 195 Mha of constrained reforestation potential (Fig. 3b and Table 1).

This area is 71–92% smaller than the constrained reforestation potential identified in other global products (Supplementary Table 2), and only intersects with other global products in 24–98 Mha (13–50% of the constrained potential in our map) (Supplementary Table 4). Our exclusions overlap with large areas (60–70%) identified as constrained reforestation potential in other products (Supplementary Table 4). In contrast, other global products missed substantial areas of our constrained reforestation potential because they used older or coarser resolution existing forest datasets with different criteria for forest occurrence (132–153 Mha, or 67–78% of our constrained reforestation potential) or used older and coarser cropland and/or pasture maps as exclusions (50–59 Mha, or 26–30% of our constrained reforestation potential; Supplementary Table 4).

Contextualized reforestation potential

We estimate that reforestation, if implemented in the constrained reforestation potential area, would deliver 2225 TgCO2e (teragrams of carbon dioxide equivalent) per year of net climate benefits for the first 30 years of regrowth after deductions for albedo26,28 (Table 1). The vast majority of this may represent additional climate benefit (i.e., would exceed business-as-usual forest recovery). When we calculate the ratio of forest loss to gain in one-degree cells using a 2000–2020 forest extent and change map38 (Supplementary Fig. 5), and use that ratio to proportionally scale the area and mitigation estimates in each cell, we approximate that reforestation activities would likely be additional within 169 Mha (88.7%) of the constrained reforestation potential and achieve 2086 TgCO2e per year (93.7%) of net climate benefit.

There are an estimated 98 million people who inhabit the constrained reforestation potential (Table 1). Because global maps can never fully capture the priorities of local communities, we did not attempt to prioritize areas for reforestation. Instead, we used additional overlays to help characterize what trade-offs and benefits might result within the constrained reforestation potential scenario. We clustered these into seven additional scenarios (Table 1) that subset the constrained reforestation potential based on practical considerations or on motivations for reforestation drawn from our review of existing maps and their critiques.

We created three avoiding social conflicts scenarios that sought to minimize the risk that reforestation results in injustices, displacement, and food insecurity for local communities. These three scenarios limit constrained reforestation potential to (1) countries where individuals and communities are likely able to influence decision-making through participatory or representative processes (high individual rights scenario, Supplementary Fig. 6a), (2) countries with indicators of land tenure (secure land tenure scenario, Supplementary Fig. 6b), and (3) areas without nature-dependent, vulnerable populations whose food and fuel needs may especially conflict with reforestation (low rural livelihood conflict scenario, Supplementary Fig. 6c). These scenarios total 121, 116, and 158 Mha respectively, potentially resulting in 1474, 1428, and 1591 TgCO2e per year net climate mitigation and affecting 49, 47, and 67 million people (Table 1). The three scenarios avoiding social conflicts intersect in 90 Mha (Fig. 3a, c).

We created two scenarios focused on achieving ecosystem services other than carbon sequestration: one limited to areas with high nearby forest cover (Supplementary Fig. 7a) where biodiversity outcomes may be high41 (161 Mha and 1777 TgCO2e per year net climate mitigation), and another limited to floodplain or moderate slope areas (Supplementary Fig. 7b) where water quality and climate adaptation benefits may be high42,43,44 (71 Mha and 814 TgCO2e per year net climate mitigation) (Table 1). These scenarios intersect in 60 Mha (Fig. 3a).

The final two scenarios limit the constrained reforestation potential based on government policies, either through protected areas (Supplementary Fig. 8a), where reforestation may be compatible with other management objectives and have greater durability, or forest restoration goals (Supplementary Fig. 8b), where dedicated funding, reforestation infrastructure such as tree nurseries, and other resources may incentivize reforestation. The protected area scenario has the smallest total area, mitigation opportunity, and population affected across all scenarios, at 6.3 Mha, 53 TgCO2e per year net climate mitigation, and 1.7 million people (Table 1). The national forest restoration goal scenario covers 106 Mha, 1665 TgCO2e per year net climate mitigation, and 57 million people (Table 1).

In general, we find it is hard to optimize for all factors. There are only 15 Mha where seven of the scenarios intersect (Fig. 3a) and 0.5 Mha where all eight intersect. However, multiple outcomes can be achieved. For example, the majority of the constrained reforestation potential (83%) occurs close to existing forest, where natural regeneration is likely and reforestation may enhance biodiversity41 (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the low rural livelihood conflict scenario intersects with 81% of the constrained reforestation potential (Fig. 3a), indicating that it may be possible to reforest substantial areas without negatively impacting the livelihoods of those most dependent on nature. The co-occurrence of more than half of the constrained reforestation potential in countries with restoration goals suggests there is both ample opportunity and political systems that could be conducive to enable reforestation at a broad scale (Fig. 3a). Further, even though it is difficult to meet multiple conservation objectives simultaneously (Fig. 3a), we do find 57 Mha in countries with a restoration commitment and where restoration is less likely to cause conflicts, given secure land tenure, rights of individuals, and high standards of living. (Fig. 3a).

Sensitivity tests

If we do not remove areas with frequent fire, forest potential and constrained reforestation potential increase by 7% and 24%, respectively (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 9a), while if we use a 50% potential tree cover criterion (instead of 60%) to determine forest potential, then forest potential and constrained reforestation potential increase by 19% and 36% respectively (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 9b). Using liberal criteria to define forest (>30% potential tree cover and lower biomass thresholds) and removing areas with frequent fire substantially increases forest potential (5095 Mha, an increase of 127%) and constrained reforestation potential (845 Mha, an increase of 333%; Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 9c). Using the same liberal definition of forest but without removing areas with frequent fire further increases forest potential (5788 Mha, an increase of 158%) and constrained reforestation potential (1135 Mha, an increase of 481%; Supplementary Table 2). Using alternative forest or cropland datasets as exclusions results in minor differences to the total constrained potential (1.8% and 6.6% larger area, respectively), but substantial differences in some geographies (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 and Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). If we do not use croplands as an exclusion, constrained reforestation potential increases by 31% (to 255 Mha Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10c). Finally, using different land tenure datasets in the secure land tenure scenario (Supplementary Table 5), results in 72–125 Mha of contextualized reforestation potential (62–108% of the primary land tenure scenario area; Supplementary Table 5). Thus, our results are most sensitive to the tree cover threshold used to define forest for forest potential mapping and maps of land tenure.

Global restoration mapping efforts, including reforestation maps, are used for estimating the overall magnitude of opportunity, supporting global policy development, and mobilizing resources to places with greater relative opportunity45. Prior attempts to map reforestation have faced multiple critiques11,17,18,20, potentially limiting those uses. By addressing those critiques, our analysis shrinks the area of constrained reforestation potential in previous global estimates from between 678 Mha and 2509 to 195 Mha, a 71–92% reduction (Supplementary Table 2). Reforesting this latter area would result in 2225 TgCO2e per year of net climate mitigation for the first 30 years of regrowth, or roughly 5% of the sum of global fossil fuel and land use change emissions in 2022, indicating that reforestation can still offer substantial climate change mitigation potential and remains the largest available carbon removal solution1.

These results unsurprisingly fall at the lower range of previous constrained reforestation potential estimates (Supplementary Table 2), largely due to our use of a conservative forest definition (closed forest and at least 60% potential tree cover) that excludes savannas, and our choice to incorporate fire data into forest potential mapping. Indeed, only 5–24% of the constrained reforestation potential identified in other global maps intersects with our forest potential map (Supplementary Table 5). However, we map a more comparable constrained reforestation potential area to the FLRO, Griscom, Bastin, and Walker maps (1135 Mha or 45%, 133%, 64%, and 122% of those maps, respectively; Supplementary Table 4) if we use more liberal forest criteria to map forest potential (open or closed forest and at least 30% potential tree cover; Supplementary Table 2). By strictly defining forest, requiring multiple lines of evidence, and accounting for fire when mapping forest potential, we limit our constrained reforestation potential to the areas most likely to support dense forest. We thus minimize potential biodiversity and ecosystem services conflicts associated with adding dense tree cover to grassy biomes11 and avoid fire-maintained and fire-adapted ecosystems. Portions of the constrained potential of other products (8–21%) occur in areas with frequent fire. Because we incorporate fire frequency into our forest potential map, we help to focus on locations where carbon storage is more likely to be durable46. We note that reducing fire frequencies in ecosystems with altered fire regimes resulting from invasive species or other causes may be a viable reforestation strategy that would be missed by our approach.

Our methods align with recommendations for right-sizing land-based strategies for carbon dioxide removal by applying sustainability safeguards related to ecological limits, biodiversity, land use competition, and human rights27. We acknowledge that our constrained reforestation potential is a substantial reduction from previous estimates and excludes specific reforestation opportunities identified in subnational, national, and regional analyses (e.g., reforestation of marginal croplands with limited food supply ramifications32), but our global approach is consistent with do no harm and conservatism principles developed to avoid perverse outcomes, inflated ambition, and misallocated resources for NCS projects47. Even without cropland or other precautionary exclusions (Supplementary Table 2), our results demonstrate that reforestation alone cannot meet the forest restoration targets set by IPCC (1000 Mha, as reported by ref.5) or in national forest restoration pledges (327 Mha)48. Broader approaches to forest restoration that are beyond the scope of this analysis, (e.g., enhancing carbon storage in existing forests5,8,49) would be required to achieve those goals.

Our work also illuminates substantial differences in the constrained reforestation potential presented in previously published global maps, which have only 22 Mha in common (Supplementary Fig. 3). Although the global maps use similar methods and produce relatively comparable forest potential areas, decisions regarding which exclusions to apply and the datasets used to represent those exclusions led to highly variable conclusions about the area of constrained reforestation potential. In contrast with existing global maps, we used a broader set of precautionary exclusions, including albedo and wetland exclusions, and used more up-to-date and/or higher resolution LULC products for representing exclusions. We acknowledge uncertainties for our estimates due to our assumptions regarding how forest is defined, which exclusions are appropriate, and which datasets are used to represent key exclusions, such as existing forest and cropland, as demonstrated in our sensitivity analyses. We provide spatial data and code for reproducing our analyses so that users can modify our methods based on their own specific set of assumptions, exclusions, and/or precautionary principles (see “Data availability” and “Code availability”).

Our application of a spatial additionality deduction improves on the non-spatial approach used in the Griscom map1. Globally, the rate of forest loss exceeds the rate of forest gain, but there are localized areas where forest regrowth outpaces deforestation (e.g., landscapes with cropland abandonment, Supplementary Fig. 5). If reforestation is intended to provide real and measurable climate change mitigation, it must occur above and beyond baseline forest recovery47. However, the best available data of baseline forest recovery remain limited and future research is needed to update the forest loss/gain data38 to longer time horizons, refine spatial resolution, and disaggregate natural and managed forest loss/gain50. We also acknowledge that patterns and rates of forest recovery can rapidly change in response to markets and/or governmental policies or incentives. Other future research to spatially attribute forest responses to these mechanisms would enable more robust additionality evaluation.

We incorporated multiple overlay factors that might help identify specific reforestation opportunities and guide reforestation decision-making (e.g., secure land tenure, biodiversity, and water quality benefits), because additional assumptions and motivations can reduce the area available (Fig. 3a, c). Depending on the factors of interest, there may be a substantial reduction in area relative to the constrained reforestation potential, with an even greater reduction when incorporating multiple factors (Fig. 3a, c). Lack of secure land tenure causes the greatest reduction in area relative to the constrained reforestation potential among the avoiding social conflict scenarios, emphasizing the need for continued progress in formalizing and resolving land rights and title15 and empowering local land users51. Similarly, different measures of land tenure status affect the area identified in the scenario (Supplementary Table 5), highlighting the need for continued development of land tenure information.

We acknowledge that the process of stepping down from a coarse filter, global analysis to identifying real reforestation projects will always require local or national data and incorporate factors that cannot be readily mapped (e.g., social, cultural, or economic considerations that influence landholder decision making52,53,54,55). Our review of existing maps highlights where finer-scale analyses are available and the types of spatial data those analyses incorporate (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1, see “Data availability”). Nonetheless, for most countries, global and regional maps are the best available starting point. Moreover, the maps we produced can be used to highlight areas that merit additional focus or refined analyses. New datasets related to reforestation implementation and opportunity costs56, soil characteristics32, wood fuel demand57, high-resolution poverty measures58, and carbon durability (e.g., changing fire regimes59) present opportunities for additional overlays. Agricultural productivity60, cropland type61, and food supply datasets62, in particular, may help identify marginally productive croplands that could be reforested without impacting local food supply or resulting in conversion of intact ecosystems to meet global food demand62. Pastures likely represent a large portion of our constrained reforestation potential, and improved, high-resolution pasture63 and/or livestock density mapping (as outlined in ref. 64 for 2000) will help clarify the extent of reforestation areas relative to other approaches such as silvopasture.

We demonstrate that global area estimates of the constrained reforestation potential for climate change mitigation are highly variable and are dependent on the criteria and data used for mapping. We used a conservative approach to mapping constrained reforestation potential, which applied biodiversity, ecosystem services, durability, sustainability, and precautionary safeguards and incorporated contemporary, high-resolution LULC datasets. Our resulting area estimates are substantially smaller but less problematic than previous studies, and we demonstrate how additional considerations may further focus where reforestation may be feasible. We argue that applying these conservative considerations to reforestation mapping for policy and practice better supports smart action towards meaningful and equitable climate change mitigation.

Review of existing reforestation maps

We conducted a literature review to identify existing reforestation maps, broadly describe their geographic extent and application of spatial data, and inform our global map (Supplementary Fig. 11). Our main goal was to broadly assess the availability and distribution of recent reforestation maps across scales, not to provide a comprehensive or systematic review. We used the Web of Science Core Collection database to identify an initial pool of 6637 English language journal articles, books, book series, or conference proceedings published between 1 January 2011 and 4 November 2021 based on a search of titles, keywords, and abstracts using the search term [“forest*” and (“map*” or “spatial*”) and (“regrow*“ or “restor*“ or “reforest*“)] in a basic search. We then used the abstract screening software Abstrackr65 to identify articles describing the creation or use of reforestation maps at global, regional, or national scales. We considered a publication to be relevant if it included a spatial assessment of where reforestation could or should potentially occur. We limited our scope to reforestation approaches using natural regeneration or mixed-species planting in terrestrial ecosystems and therefore excluded publications mapping afforestation, plantation or single-species suitability, and wetland or mangrove restoration. We excluded publications focused on describing past patterns of reforestation (i.e., where it has occurred) unless the article used the historical recovery to predict future potential. We also excluded publications focused solely on forest pattern and patch metrics, such as fragmentation, edge, and core area statistics. We stopped screening publications once Abstrackr’s learning algorithm predicted a likelihood of relevance less than 0.5, resulting in a pool of 211 potentially relevant publications. We supplemented this list with an additional 20 articles, of which we were previously aware and which did not appear in search results, including studies published in 2022 after our cutoff dates. We read these articles and conducted a final manual screening for relevance. We categorized the remaining 89 publications based on geographical extent (global, regional (i.e., at least three countries, but not global), national (i.e., 100% of one or two countries), or sub-national (i.e., not 100% of any country)); the type of spatial datasets used (32 categories, see Supplementary Table 1); and the application of those spatial datasets as a suitability (i.e., factors used to delineate areas included in the forest potential or maximum/constrained reforestation potential), exclusion (i.e., factors used to remove or mask areas from the forest potential or maximum/constrained reforestation potential), or overlay factor (i.e., factors used for further refinement or prioritization of reforestation potential). Additionally, we associated the extent of each analysis with the corresponding level 0 and 1 administrative unit or units66 (i.e., the country, countries, or state(s)/province(s) included in the analysis).

Forest potential mapping

As a first step for generating maps of maximum or constrained reforestation potential, we created a conservative map of forest potential using a process that leverages two existing maps, avoids areas of uncertainty, and incorporates additional spatial data related to fire frequency to address forest potential map critiques. Our forest potential map serves as foundational information for subsequent steps by identifying where tree cover could potentially occur. We identified two raster format forest potential products—the forest potential components of the Bastin5 and Walker8 maps—which met our requirements: (1) they could be used to distinguish between forest and savanna ecosystems, (2) they have higher spatial resolution relative to other forest potential products, and (3) they include spatially-explicit uncertainty data so we could account for pixel-level uncertainty (Supplementary Table 2).

The Bastin map is a continuous prediction of percent potential tree canopy cover at a map resolution of 862 m (meters) produced using a random forest model with climate, topographic, and soils predictors. The product includes an uncertainty layer of the standard deviation of predicted tree cover. The Walker map is a classification of potential aboveground and belowground biomass (AGB and BGB) into closed forest, open forest, and nonwoody systems. The potential AGB map is a continuous prediction at a map resolution of 500 m, also produced using a random forest model with climate, topographic, and soil predictors. Walker et al. combined the potential AGB model with an existing model of root:shoot ratios67 to estimate potential belowground biomass (BGB), then classified the AGB + BGB values based on bioclimate zone-specific biomass thresholds. Walker et al. produced a pixel-scale uncertainty layer of their AGB prediction as an uncertainty index (UI) representing the range of the 97.5 and 2.5 percentile bounds derived from quantile regression forests divided by the AGB prediction. We re-expressed the Bastin et al. potential tree cover uncertainty as a UI to facilitate comparison with the Walker et al. product at the pixel scale by converting the standard deviation of potential tree cover to a 95% confidence interval, then dividing by the mean potential tree cover prediction.

We created a preliminary composite forest potential map based on a pixel-scale comparison of the Bastin and Walker forest potential and forest potential UI maps after rescaling all products to a 1 km (kilometers) spatial resolution using bilinear resampling. We classified pixels as forest potential if a pixel was mapped as greater than 60% potential tree cover in the Bastin forest potential map, as closed forest in the Walker forest potential map, and with UI values less than 3 in the Bastin and Walker uncertainty maps. This conservative approach thus only maps forest potential to pixels where both the Bastin and Walker forest potential maps agree, and where both products have low uncertainty.

As a final step to map forest potential, we excluded areas that are likely to support fire-dependent grassy ecosystems in places where the climate could also support dense forest33. We used a 500 m resolution global monthly burned area dataset derived from MODIS satellite observations68 to map fire frequency for 2002–2020 by counting the number of burned dates (indicated by MODIS active fire observations and change in burn-sensitive vegetation index values). We rescaled the fire frequency dataset to 1 km using maximum value resampling. To further distinguish between fires in natural ecosystems and fires associated with land clearing and conversion or agricultural practices, we used a 30 m global cropland map agreement dataset for 202269 (retaining any pixel identified as cropland in three or more of the six maps evaluated for agreement) and a 30 m resolution global oil palm plantation dataset for 201970. We rescaled the cropland and oil palm plantation products to 1 km using nearest neighbor resampling to match the resolution of the fire frequency map, then removed areas that had 2 or more fires from 2002 to 2020 and that were not cropland or oil palm from the forest potential map.

To evaluate the sensitivity of the forest potential map to our criteria for defining forests, we generated four alternative forest potential maps using identical methods except for the following changes: (1) including areas with frequent fire (instead of excluding those areas), (2) using a 50% potential tree cover threshold in the Bastin forest potential map to define forest (instead of 60%), (3) using a 30% potential tree cover threshold in the Bastin forest potential map and closed forest and open forest in the Walker forest potential map to define forest (instead of 60% and closed forest only), and (4) using a 30% potential tree cover threshold in the Bastin forest potential map to define forest and closed forest and open forest in the Walker forest potential map to define forest (instead of 60% and closed forest only) and including areas with frequent fire (instead of excluding those areas) (Supplementary Table 2).

Maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping

The maximum reforestation potential map shows where it is possible to add forest within the forest potential map, while the constrained reforestation potential map shows where it is possible to add forest within the forest potential map while avoiding perverse outcomes. Our review of spatial datasets used in existing reforestation maps informed our selection of spatial datasets that served as exclusions. We used these datasets to exclude areas from our forest potential map and thus create the maximum and constrained reforestation potential maps. We used implementation exclusions (existing forest, open water, bare ground, and permanent ice/snow) to map maximum reforestation potential, and precautionary exclusions (croplands, built-up lands, peatlands, wetlands, and albedo) to map constrained reforestation potential. Supplementary Table 3 outlines the source spatial datasets and specific pre-processing steps associated with each exclusion; all exclusion datasets are in raster format.

When excluding existing forests to generate the maximum reforestation potential map, we avoided the data critique related to under-mapping existing tree cover in dryland biomes17 because those systems were already largely absent from our conservative forest potential map. When generating the constrained reforestation potential map, we excluded croplands to address food supply and leakage concerns20,30,31. We applied the peatland and wetland precautionary exclusions to protect large soil organic carbon stocks that may be vulnerable to losses following the establishment of trees71,72. Additionally, we incorporated albedo as a precautionary exclusion to remove areas where the net climate benefit from reforestation is predicted to be negative due to albedo26.

As general pre-processing steps for all datasets, we reclassified each dataset to 1 (exclusion) or 0 (not exclusion) and rescaled to 30 m resolution using nearest neighbor resampling. We combined all implementation exclusions into a single raster dataset by summing the individual rasters and setting values greater than 1 to 1. We resampled this dataset to 500 m resolution using pixel averaging to generate an intermediate proportion-excluded raster for subsequent processing steps, then to 1 km resolution, again using pixel averaging, to generate a final proportion-excluded raster. We generated a raster representing maximum reforestation potential by subtracting the proportion excluded raster from 1 for pixels within the forest potential map. We repeated these steps for implementation and precautionary exclusions combined and generated a raster representing constrained reforestation potential by subtracting the proportion excluded raster from 1 for pixels within the forest potential map. The resulting pixel values from these steps indicate the proportion of each pixel where reforestation could occur. To report the area within the maximum or constrained reforestation potential, we multiplied the reforestation potential raster pixel values by their area in hectares.

To evaluate the sensitivity of the constrained reforestation potential to individual datasets used as exclusions, we generated two alternative constrained reforestation potential rasters using identical methods except for the following changes: (1) using a forest/non-forest map derived from radar satellite data73 instead of a forest extent map derived from multi-spectral satellite data38 for representing existing forests as an implementation constraint, and (2) using a single product for representing cropland extent37 instead of a cropland agreement map69 for representing croplands as a precautionary constraint. Use of radar-based forest extent maps follows recommendations for addressing the limits of forest extent maps in areas with low tree cover17. Additionally, we generated a version of the constrained reforestation potential without using croplands as a precautionary exclusion.

Overlays and additional scenarios

Similar to our process of identifying exclusions, our review of spatial datasets used in existing reforestation maps informed our selection of overlay data. Overlays include datasets used to represent the feasibility of reforestation within the constrained reforestation potential through additional scenarios as well as reference datasets, such as climate change mitigation and population estimates. These overlays are used to contextualize the constrained reforestation potential and scenario results. Supplementary Table 3 outlines the source, scale, and pre-processing associated with spatial datasets used as overlays.

As general pre-processing steps for all scenario overlays, we converted all source datasets to raster format and set values to 1 to represent features of interest. For the slope and landform datasets used in the water quality scenario, we resampled the 90 m source rasters to 30 m and reprocessed the exclusion datasets to reclassify all pixels outside of moderate slope or floodplain areas as exclusions (see “Maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping”). Except for the forest neighborhood dataset, we generated all other scenario datasets at 500 m resolution and applied them to the intermediate 500 m proportion excluded raster (see “Maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping”), reclassifying all pixels outside the scenario overlays as exclusions. We generated forest neighborhood datasets at 1 km resolution and applied them to the 1 km proportion excluded raster (see “Maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping”), and reclassified all pixels outside the scenario overlay as exclusions. We then generated the final scenario maps and area summaries using methods for maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping described above.

For the climate change mitigation and population overlays, we reprojected these 1 km datasets to match the 1 km maximum and constrained reforestation potential. We estimated the annual net climate change mitigation for the maximum and constrained reforestation potential and scenarios as TgCO2e per year by multiplying the maximum and constrained reforestation potential raster pixel values (proportion of each pixel where reforestation could occur) by their area (hectares) by the per-pixel AGB and BGB sequestration potential during the first 30 years of natural regrowth28 with an offset to account for albedo effects26 (TgCO2e per hectare per year). We estimated the total human population directly affected by the maximum and constrained reforestation potential and each scenario (i.e., inhabiting the area) by multiplying the maximum and constrained reforestation potential raster pixel values (proportion of each pixel where reforestation could occur) by a per-pixel estimate of human population in 202074.

To evaluate additionality, we summarized the total area of forest loss and forest gain for 2000–202036 for one-degree cells, calculated a per-cell loss:gain ratio with maximum value set to 1, and used the loss:gain ratio as a multiplier for the per-cell constrained reforestation potential area and climate change mitigation values. We then summed all cell areas and net mitigation estimates.

We generated four alternative scenarios to evaluate the sensitivity of the secure land tenure scenario to our choice of dataset for representing tenure security. These alternative scenarios are described in detail in Supplementary Table 5.

Comparison with existing products

We compared agreement and described the maximum extent of the four original global forest potential maps (FLRO, Bastin, Strassburg, and Walker, Supplementary Table 2; we excluded Griscom et al., Cook-Patton et al., and Zheng et al. from comparison because those analyses are derived from FLRO). We reclassified each original map based on the forest definitions applied in the respective publication (Supplementary Table 2). For the FLRO map, we retained pixels classified as potential woodlands, open forests, or closed forests. For the Bastin map, we retained pixels with a potential tree cover greater than 10%. For the Strassburg map, we retained any pixels with a dominant original ecosystem type of forest. For the Walker map, we retained any pixels classified as closed forest or open forest. We then compared the maximum extent and agreement of the four original global constrained reforestation potential maps (FLRO, Griscom, Bastin, and Walker; Supplementary Table 2). We evaluated the Strassburg maximum reforestation potential map separately (described below) and excluded Cook-Patton et al. and Zheng et al. from comparison because those analyses are derived from Griscom. We also reclassified each product according to each publication’s definition of constrained reforestation potential (Supplementary Table 2). When publications subdivided reforestation using multiple forest definitions (e.g., by different potential tree canopy thresholds, as in FLRO), we used the broadest definition presented in the publication. For FLRO, we retained pixels classified as wide-scale, mosaic, or remote restoration; for Griscom, we retained pixels identified with reforestation as an NCS; for Bastin, we retained pixels with tree cover restoration greater than 10% and without existing tree cover greater than 10%; and for Walker, we retained pixels mapped with an NCS opportunity as restore/high suitability for forestry-based NCS or restore/low suitability for forestry-based NCS.

To calculate the global area of map agreement, we reclassified all retained pixel values to 1 (otherwise to 0), rescaled the resulting maps to 500 m using nearest neighbor resampling, summed all reclassified and rescaled products, and summarized the global area by agreement count. For each forest potential map, we also calculated the area of agreement (intersection) with our forest potential map. For each constrained reforestation potential map, we calculated the area of agreement (intersection) with our forest potential map, constrained reforestation potential map, implementation exclusions, and precautionary exclusions. For the exclusions used to generate the Bastin and Walker constrained reforestation potential maps, we also calculated the area of agreement (intersection) with our forest potential map, constrained reforestation potential map, implementation exclusions, and precautionary exclusions. For the Strassburg forest restoration map, we identified the maximum reforestation potential by retaining pixels with a restoration opportunity greater than 50% of pixel area and with a dominant original ecosystem type of forest. We calculated the area of agreement of this map with our maximum reforestation potential map and implementation exclusions.

We conducted all spatial data analysis using Google Earth Engine75, Python version 3.11.8, and the arcpy library, or R version 4.4.1 and the terra library. We conducted all tabular analysis using the tidyverse R library. We generated all figures using ArcGIS Pro version 3.3.176 or the ggplot2 and upsetr R libraries. Country boundaries in all map figures are sourced from GADM66 (https://gadm.org).

The Honeywell facility violated monitoring requirements for its industrial flare system, failing to operate required monitors and analyzers at least 95 percent of the time when the flare was operational over a rolling 12-month period. The British thermal unit analyzer for Flare M-1 experienced nearly 100 percent downtime from December 1, 2020, through August 31, 2022, according to the commission's violation information.

This equipment failure resulted in the flare being monitored less than the required 95 percent threshold for all 12-month periods ending from December 2020 through August 2022.

The violations involved multiple regulatory requirements, including sections of the Texas Administrative Code, New Source Review Permit conditions, Federal Operating Permit terms, and the Texas Health and Safety Code.

That would be a disaster for the economy just as clean energy is taking off.","Washington, D.C. – Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) today spoke on the Senate floor on Donald Trump and Republicans’ “Big, Beautiful Bill” which would have drastic effects on the U.S. economy by killing over 800,000 clean energy jobs, forcing the U.S. to be dependent on China, sending energy jobs overseas and adding an additional $170 billion in energy costs on American households. Below are Senator Schumer’s remarks, which can also be viewed here:

This week, Republicans continue their tortured efforts to ram Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” through the Senate.

Now some Senate Republicans are starting to balk at the fact that their bill is a clean job killer. It virtually ends all of the tax credits that we gave to wind, solar, and other clean energy.

If Senate Republicans have any desire to lower energy costs, and avoid shipping energy jobs overseas, they should hit the eject button on this “Big, Beautiful Bill” and start over.

Experts from across the political spectrum are starting to agree Donald Trump’s bill is far too radical and deeply flawed. And to boot, it was passed in the dark of night, when even many Republicans didn't know what's in it. A few even admitted that publicly.

On jobs, their bill will kill over 800,000 good-paying clean energy jobs by 2030 alone.

That would be a disaster for the economy just as clean energy is taking off.

These jobs will last for generations. Clean energy tax credits made them possible. And 85% of the investments generated by these tax credits have gone to red [districts].

Did you hear that, Republican colleagues? If Republicans proceed with the bill, they will put Americans out of work in their own states. And the American people, and these workers in particular, are starting to see it.

Just last week, a battery plant in South Carolina paused a billion-dollar project because of “policy uncertainty” – in other words, because of Republican sabotage.

And the closure in South Carolina is a canary in the coal mine if there ever was one: if Donald Trump’s bill passes, more jobs disappear.

And talk about costs – [we thought it was] going to add $32 billion on household energy costs.

And today we got the news that Donald Trump’s bill is worse than we thought: Americans will now pay up to $170 billion – not $32 billion – more on energy.

Let me say that again: $170 billion more for the American consumer to pay on electric bills, for small business to pay on electric bills. Republicans, because they just want to so embrace the radical, anti-clean energy fossil fuel group, will raise Americans' costs by a dramatic amount.

They also make us dependent on China. China is gaining in solar energy. If we cut it off, China will dominate the world, and our children and grandchildren will be at China's behest.

It will push about $80 billion in solar and battery manufacturing jobs overseas. More jobs in Chengdu. Fewer in Cleveland and Charleston.

We all know AI and crypto are going to cause American energy demand to spike massively in the coming years. Why the heck cut off one of the sources?

There are many who say all of the above. Okay, but why cut off one part of that all of the above because the radicals – not the mainstream but the radicals – in the fossil fuel industry are almost religious in their hatred of clean energy, because they know it is the future and will eventually displace them?

And that's why this week, I have been working 24/7 with so many different people, whether it's workers or companies or governors, to spread the word how bad this is. We are asking all of America: if you don't like these provisions, if you think it will lose your job, if you think it will raise your cost, call your Republican senator and tell them to change.

Most of the Republicans didn't like it to begin with, but it was rushed through in the dark of night.

HB 14 establishes the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office (TANEO) within the Office of the Governor.

Established as the central coordinating body for the creation, deployment and oversight of advanced nuclear reactor projects, TANEO will advise the Governor and the Legislature on how Texas can eliminate regulatory and financial barriers that preclude nuclear energy development in the state. TANEO is also required to develop a comprehensive strategy outlining its approach to fulfilling key priorities of the legislation, including the creation of both resilient nuclear supply chains and the socialization of nuclear energy benefits. This strategy must be presented to the Governor and the Legislature every even-numbered year, by December 1.

Additionally, TANEO’s Nuclear Permitting Coordinator will act as the primary point of contact for industry stakeholders. This office will help companies navigate local, state and federal regulatory requirements, identify potential sites for nuclear facilities, and advise on available economic incentives for nuclear energy development, among other duties.

HB 14 also establishes the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund to assist companies with costs associated with nuclear energy projects. With an initial allocation of $350 million (with potential increases up to $2 billion), the fund offers the following financial support programs:

- Project Development and Supply Chain Program. This program covers initial development costs for companies that have submitted an Early Site Permit, construction permit or combined license. Eligible expenses which may be covered by the program include technology development, feasibility and environmental studies, site planning and infrastructure expansion.

- Advanced Nuclear Construction Program. This program provides funding for projects under review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for specific construction-related expenses such as fabrication, installation, inspection and testing.

- Completion Bonus Grant Program. This program covers the costs associated with making reactors operational. TANEO, in coordination with the Public Utility Commission, will determine grant amounts that a project may receive based on the electricity output the reactor is expected to deliver to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) grid. (This bonus is applicable only for advanced nuclear reactors capable of ERCOT connectivity).

This legislation lays the groundwork for more efficient coordination between state government and the private sector, expediting project approvals and significantly reducing investment costs and regulatory hurdles. Although TANEO includes a sunset provision set to expire on September 1, 2035, the Legislature retains the authority to extend it—signaling that Texas is already thinking beyond the next decade when it comes to sustained support for nuclear energy. Likewise, a dedicated nuclear fund provides a unique avenue for both emerging and established companies to more readily finance their projects. Ultimately, HB 14 supports Texas’s transition toward a diversified energy mix, where nuclear energy plays an increasing role in driving economic growth and innovation.

Absent a veto by Governor Abbott, HB 14 will take effect on September 1, 2025.

SB 1535: Pursues Creation of a Workforce Training Program to Support Demand for Nuclear Energy Expertise

Senate Bill (SB) 1535 amends the Texas Labor Code to establish an advanced nuclear energy workforce development program. This initiative relies primarily on public-private partnerships to bolster higher education and leadership training in the field.

SB 1535 authorizes the Texas Workforce Commission—supported by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and the Railroad Commission of Texas—to design higher education curricula and certificate programs that “prepare students for high-wage jobs in the advanced nuclear energy industry.”

This legislation is critical to ensuring Texas has a robust talent pipeline to meet the labor demands of its growing nuclear industry in the coming decades. Nuclear energy companies will benefit from the education programs, reducing both long-term workforce development costs and the risk of operational hazards stemming from unskilled labor. It also has the potential to position nuclear energy companies as drivers of economic prosperity across Texan communities.

Absent a veto by Gov. Abbott, SB 1535 will take effect on September 1, 2025.

SB 1061: Streamlines Application Process for Amendments to Pre-Approved Uranium Mining Boundaries

SB 1061 amends Section 27.0513 of the Texas Water Code to streamline the application process for amendments to pre-approved uranium mining boundaries, helping companies avoid undergoing the full permitting process formerly required even for minor adjustments. Applications and amendments will be considered uncontested matters under the Texas Government Code if:

- the authorization pertains to each production area within a permitted boundary and includes a range table of groundwater quality restoration values for each area; and

- the specified restoration values for each production area do not exceed the upper limit of the established range.

SB 1061 supports Texas’s ambition to lead in the nuclear sector by amending or eliminating burdensome statutory provisions, contributing therefore to building an ecosystem favorable to competitive nuclear industry growth in the state. Particularly, it enhances the operational flexibility of both nuclear energy and uranium mining companies, reinforcing therefore a low-friction environment for investments across the nuclear fuel cycle supply chain.

Absent a veto by Gov. Abbott, SB 1061 will take effect on September 1, 2025.

Together, these measures reflect a deliberate and coordinated push by Texas lawmakers to transform the state into a national nucleus for advanced nuclear innovation. By addressing regulatory processes, committing substantial public resources and cultivating a skilled workforce, Texas is not just responding to industry trends, it is actively shaping them. These legislative actions underscore the state’s long-term vision for clean energy leadership and lay a durable foundation for the next generation of nuclear development.

Solar Market Insight Q2 2025 report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.
In addition to growing module capacity, U.S. solar cell production capacity doubled in Q1 to 2 GW with the opening of a new factory in South Carolina.
“However, our analysis suggests that the U.S. solar market has yet to reach its full potential.
The bill could also trigger “massive energy inflation,” raising consumers’ electricity costs by $51 billion nationwide, SEIA added.","The U.S. solar industry added 8.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar module manufacturing capacity in Q1 2025, marking the third-largest quarter for new manufacturing capacity on record, per a new report.

The manufacturing surge comes from eight new or expanded factories in Texas, Ohio, and Arizona, according to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q2 2025 report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie. In addition to growing module capacity, U.S. solar cell production capacity doubled in Q1 to 2 GW with the opening of a new factory in South Carolina.

The report finds that the U.S. solar industry installed 10.8 GW of new electricity generating capacity in Q1, and solar and storage account for 82% of all new generating capacity added to the grid. However, new tariffs and potential changes to federal tax credits pose “significant business uncertainty for the industry and threaten its long-term growth,” SEIA argues.

Utilities in the Midwestern United States are tackling tough challenges posed by increasingly extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and an ongoing race to integrate renewable energy while maintaining grid reliability. State decarbonization laws add complexity to the process of bringing power generation online, and as utilities transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives, they are simultaneously managing supply chain issues, labor shortages, and new cybersecurity risks. Service providers must modernize their infrastructure to satisfy increasing demand while keeping pricing affordable, which is a tall task for any-sized utility.

“Solar and storage continue to dominate America’s energy economy, adding more new capacity to the grid than any technology using increasingly American-made equipment,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “But our success is at risk. If Congress fails to fix the legislation passed by the House – which would render the energy tax incentives unusable – lawmakers will trigger a dangerous energy shortage that will raise our electric bills and stop America’s manufacturing boom in its tracks. The Senate still has time to get this right and secure President Trump’s vision for American energy dominance.”

SEIA added that economy-wide tariff uncertainty, new anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) on cells and modules from Southeast Asia, and potential shifts in federal energy incentives could “significantly hinder” U.S. solar deployment and manufacturing, risking energy shortages, job losses, and factory closures.

“The 10.8 GW of solar capacity installed in Q1 2025 represents a significant portion of new U.S. electricity generation, highlighting solar’s growing dominance in the energy mix,” said Zoë Gaston, Principal Analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “However, our analysis suggests that the U.S. solar market has yet to reach its full potential. The proposed changes to federal tax incentives, along with ongoing tariff concerns, could significantly impact this growth trajectory and potentially lead to energy supply challenges. It’s important to consider the critical role of solar in America’s energy landscape.”

SEIA and Wood Mackenzie’s forecast for the industry, which they say accounts for tariffs levied in Q2 but not potential roll backs of the federal tax credits, projects declining deployment nationwide. While the community solar forecast remained flat, all other segments saw their five-year outlook decline compared to last quarter, including a 14% reduction in forecasted residential solar deployment, and a 6% reduction in forecasted utility-scale deployment.

A separate recent analysis conducted by SEIA of the impacts of the House-passed reconciliation legislation projects an energy shortage for the U.S. economy should the bill become law. SEIA argues that if lawmakers don’t change course, 330,000 current and future Americans jobs could be lost, 331 factories could close or never come online, and $286 billion in local investments could disappear. The bill could also trigger “massive energy inflation,” raising consumers’ electricity costs by $51 billion nationwide, SEIA added.

If Congress cuts energy tax incentives, SEIA’s analysis projects that energy production will fall 173 TWh and the United States “will not be able to meet demand or compete with China in the global race to power AI.”

According to the Solar Market Insight report, Texas added more solar capacity than any state in Q1 2025, with the state of Florida surging ahead of California for second place. Of the top ten states with the most solar installations in the first quarter, eight were won by President Donald Trump in the 2024 election: Texas, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, Arizona, Wisconsin, Idaho, and Pennsylvania.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hero-Page-4_Reliable-Manufacturing-1024x576.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:44:39.811726

In Michigan, GM will invest in Lake Orion Assembly in Lake Orion Township to begin producing gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks starting in early 2027. GM said that move would help the company meet continued strong demand.

GM’s Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck will be its location dedicated to bundling the Chevrolet Silverado electric vehicle, the GMC Sierra EV, the Cadillac Escalade IQ and the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV.

Other plants receiving investments include Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, Kansas and Spring Hill Manufacturing in Spring Hill, Tennessee.

“We believe the future of transportation will be driven by American innovation and manufacturing expertise,” said Mary Barra, GM chair and CEO, in a statement. “Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the U.S and to support American jobs. We’re focused on giving customers choice and offering a broad range of vehicles they love.”

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the leaders of the Michigan Legislature praised the move, saying in a statement that GM and Michigan have a long history.

“I am grateful to GM for bringing more auto manufacturing back home to Michigan, protecting thousands of good-paying, union auto jobs,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Over the last few years, GM has grown their footprint in their home state, and I am proud that the state of Michigan has been a strong partner in helping them ‘build, baby, build!’”

Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, thanked President Donald Trump for GM’s investment.

“This is exactly what we said would happen when he unveiled his bold tariff strategy,” Hall said. “While other politicians were paying out billions to build EV plants with small job totals, President Trump took the smarter path to bring back gas-powered production that will put more people to work and do it without handouts. President Trump took a strong stand to bring factories back to American shores and punish companies that shed American jobs to move their operations overseas. That plan is working.”

In its announcement, GM gave no indication that the tariff strategy being implemented by the Trump administration was a factor in its decision to make the investments.

Regardless, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said the multi-billion-dollar investment would mean thousands of new auto jobs for the state.

“I am delighted by this news,” Brinks said in a statement. “Our hardworking and dedicated workforce, vibrant neighborhoods where people want to put down roots, and major advancements in economic policy make our state the natural place to make such a transformative investment.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-89/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gm-autoplants-1024x5751749671226.png?h=c12e0b96&itok=luWn_MkO,N,,2025-06-12 23:51:51.035520

in its proposed rule argues that no restrictions on emissions from power plant smokestacks are necessary because pollution from American power plants represented only 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022.
That’s because power plants account for a quarter of the greenhouse gases generated by the United States.
The Biden administration regulation called for the nation’s coal-fired power plants to virtually eliminate the planet-warming pollution that they release into the air, or shut down.
The proposed rule would also repeal a requirement imposed by the Biden administration that plants continuously monitor the exhaust from their smokestacks.","The Trump administration moved Wednesday to erase limits on greenhouse gases from power plants and to weaken restrictions on their other hazardous emissions, including mercury, arsenic and lead.

Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, hailed a “historic day” and said the proposed changes would unshackle the coal, oil and gas industries from “expensive, unreasonable and burdensome regulations” imposed by the Biden administration.

Together, the moves mark a major blow to efforts to tackle climate change and to reduce threats to public health. The power sector is the country’s second largest source of pollution that is heating the planet, behind transportation. The Trump administration is pursuing an aggressive agenda to bolster the production and use of fossil fuels, while also scrapping policies that reduce planet-warming emissions.

“E.P.A. is helping pave the way for American energy dominance, because energy development underpins economic development, which in turn strengthens national security. And, most importantly, the American public voted for it last November,” Mr. Zeldin said at a news conference at the agency’s headquarters in Washington.

He labeled efforts to fight climate change a “cult” and said the pollution limits written by the Biden administration were designed “to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry.”

Mercury emissions are a particular hazard from power plants that burn coal and oil. Those plants account for 44 percent of all mercury emissions in the United States, according to the E.P.A. Once in the atmosphere, mercury converts into methylmercury, which can accumulate in fish and other food. Exposure can cause serious neurological damage in developing fetuses and children, and has been associated with respiratory ailments and heart disease in adults.

The use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, has been precipitously dropping in the U.S., replaced by cheaper natural gas. But President Trump has taken several recent actions aimed at trying to revive coal, and on Wednesday, Mr. Zeldin said the country needed to produce and burn more coal to meet rising electricity demand.

“We will use coal for power generation, to mine for critical minerals and to export to our allies,” Mr. Zeldin said.

But the E.P.A. in its proposed rule argues that no restrictions on emissions from power plant smokestacks are necessary because pollution from American power plants represented only 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022.

Analysts have called that comparing apples to oranges. That’s because power plants account for a quarter of the greenhouse gases generated by the United States. In 2023, U.S. power plants produced 1.5 billion metric tons of emissions — more than the total greenhouse gases produced by most countries in the world.

“The key rationale Zeldin is using to justify the dismantling of our nation’s protections from power plant pollution is absolutely illogical and indefensible,” said Gina McCarthy, a former E.P.A. administrator under President Barack Obama who also served as former President Joseph R. Biden’s domestic climate policy adviser.

“By giving a green light to more pollution, his legacy will forever be someone who does the bidding of the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our health,” she said.

In fact, the Trump administration’s own analysis found that the proposed repeal of carbon dioxide limits would result in a public health cost of $130 billion. That figure includes premature deaths, lost work days and hospitalizations for things like lung and heart diseases or asthma caused by exposure to power plant pollution.

The figure also does not include the economic costs of wildfire, floods, drought and other extreme weather that scientists say has been worsened by climate change. The federal government under the Trump administration no longer considers climate costs when writing regulations.

The Biden E.P.A. estimated that the rule controlling greenhouse gases from power plants would eliminate 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide between now and 2047 — equivalent to preventing the annual emissions from 328 million gasoline-powered cars.

Under Mr. Zeldin, the E.P.A. found that eliminating the regulations would save plant operators and the fossil fuel industry about $19 billion.

“The E.P.A.’s obligation is to protect public health and the environment, and this repeal doesn’t do that,” said Frank Sturges, an attorney with the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group. “It’s wiping out the benefits of the rules on the books in exchange for very little changes to compliance cost for industry.”

Separately, the Institute for Policy Integrity, a nonprofit research organization housed in New York University’s law school, found that one year of the U.S. power sector’s emissions causes $370 billion in global climate damages and $56 billion in public health costs in the country. They also contribute to about 5,300 American premature deaths.

Industry leaders and Republican lawmakers from states that produce gas and coal, many of whom joined Mr. Zeldin for the announcement on Wednesday, said the Biden administration rules threatened their economies.

“Under the Biden-led E.P.A., we witnessed an unprecedented assault on our electric grid and our ability to meet the surging power demand,” Representative Troy Balderson, Republican of Ohio, said.

The Biden administration regulation called for the nation’s coal-fired power plants to virtually eliminate the planet-warming pollution that they release into the air, or shut down. To stay open, most plants would have had to use technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions before they reach the atmosphere, and then store those emissions beneath the Earth’s surface.

Jim Matheson, chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said the Biden-era rules were “unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable” and would threaten the grid.

“Today’s announcements are a welcome course correction that will help electric co-ops reliably meet skyrocketing energy needs and keep the lights on at a cost local families and businesses can afford,” he said in a statement.

Mr. Zeldin’s other proposed rule would weaken emissions limits for mercury, a neurotoxin that impairs brain development, from coal and oil-fired power plants by 70 percent, and would loosen limits on other substances like lead, nickel and arsenic by 67 percent. The proposed rule would also repeal a requirement imposed by the Biden administration that plants continuously monitor the exhaust from their smokestacks.

The E.P.A. has given the public 45 days to comment on the plans. Both rules are expected to be completed by the end of this year.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11cli-powerplants-lhgb/11cli-powerplants-lhgb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:48:51.972986

These cost savings will allow EMPOWERment to include electric service in the cost of rent, further reducing the overall cost of living for low-income tenants.

“At EMPOWERment, we are experts in affordable housing, community organizing, and grassroots economic development. We are not solar experts. EMPOWERment added rooftop solar for its energy efficiency, health and environmental benefits, and lower costs for tenants,” said Delores Bailey, executive director of EMPOWERment Inc. “We’ve tried to resolve this conflict, but we have no choice other than file this complaint so our tenants can have affordable housing. Our building is at risk and ten families in our community are struggling with housing when they shouldn’t have to be.”

EMPOWERment Inc. is a nonprofit based in Chapel Hill that focuses on affordable housing. One of EMPOWERment’s major housing initiatives is the Pine Knoll EMPOWERment Affordable Community Housing or “P.E.A.C.H.” Apartments, a $3.5 million ten-unit building to house low-income residents in a historically African American neighborhood. The Pine Knoll neighborhood was originally created so that African American employees of UNC and the UNC hospital could live nearby. EMPOWERment wanted to further that same goal by giving people a place to live near where they work.

The P.E.A.C.H. Apartments are intended to serve Orange County residents earning at or below 30% of the area median income, many of whom are single parents working minimum-wage or near-minimum-wage jobs, typically earning between $11 and $16 an hour. Some potential tenants are currently living in unstable conditions—such as “couch surfing” with friends or family—which is a form of homelessness. These unstable living situations highlight the critical and urgent need to open P.E.A.C.H. Apartments and provide these individuals with safe, permanent housing.

“This came about because people who are already doing some of the most valuable community-building work out there found a way to use solar energy to lower the cost of living for our low-income neighbors,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Using solar energy to lower the cost of living to help neighbors who need it is about the best use of solar I can think of. EMPOWERment is absolutely within its rights here and it deserves electric service immediately.”

To facilitate the rooftop solar, EMPOWERment’s contractors installed a single electrical meter for the entire building, rather than an individual meter for each of the ten units. The contractors submitted these plans to Duke Energy in July of 2024 and Duke Energy ran the underground service for the single meter in October of 2024.

But in February of 2025, Duke Energy told EMPOWERment that it would not provide electrical service because of the single-meter configuration. State law allows master meters when utilities are included in rent—precisely EMPOWERment’s model for P.E.A.C.H. Apartments.

Ultimately, it became clear that EMPOWERment had only two options: rewire the building with ten meters, incurring major costs and months of delay, or file a complaint at the utilities commission seeking clarification of the law and requiring Duke Energy to provide service. Ten families—many experiencing hidden homelessness—are left in limbo, forced to juggle temporary arrangements, while a brand-new building sits empty, at risk of catastrophic damage from mold and mildew because Duke Energy refuses to provide service.

“We urge the North Carolina Utilities Commission to do what’s right: turn on the power, let these families come home, and support affordable, sustainable housing in our state,” added Leah Adeniji, deputy director of EMPOWERment Inc.",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SELC_Logo_Horizontal_Social.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:45:32.988192

Natural gas, oil, coal and natural gas plant liquids such as propane and ethane supplied 84% of the energy.
Natural gas has been the leading source of domestic energy production since supplanting coal in 2011.
President Trump has signed executive orders instructing his administration to remove barriers to producing energy from oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels and nuclear plants.
Crude oil production was a record 13.2 million barrels per day, or 2% more than the previous record set in 2023.","The U.S. produced a record amount of energy in 2024, with natural gas, crude oil, biofuels, wind and solar all setting new highs in production, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

Fossil fuels produced most of the energy. Natural gas, oil, coal and natural gas plant liquids such as propane and ethane supplied 84% of the energy.

Wind and solar power, though growing, combined for 2.5% of the energy produced. Nuclear and hydropower combined for 8.7%. Minor sources of energy included biomass and geothermal.

The EIA reported 2024 energy production in an online post June 9. The EIA measured energy output by British thermal units, a way to compare, for example, the energy in a barrel of oil with the energy in a cubic foot of natural gas.

The U.S. produced 103 quadrillion Btus last year, or 1% more than in 2023. Natural gas accounted for 38% of the energy. Natural gas has been the leading source of domestic energy production since supplanting coal in 2011. Total energy production in the U.S. has approximately doubled since the late 1960s.

President Trump has signed executive orders instructing his administration to remove barriers to producing energy from oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels and nuclear plants. He’s also withdrawn federal support for offshore and onshore wind projects.

Blue states and climate change activists are suing Trump, claiming his energy orders will worsen extreme weather and hinder the development of renewable power.

The EIA report showed many sources of energy grew or held steady during the last year of the Biden administration, with coal an exception.

Crude oil production was a record 13.2 million barrels per day, or 2% more than the previous record set in 2023. Almost all of the increased production came from the Permian region that spans parts of New Mexico and Texas, according to the EIA.

The U.S. produces more crude oil than any other country. In 2024, net exports of oil totaled 1.7 million barrels a day. In 2005, the U.S imported 12.5 million barrels a day.

Coal accounted for 10% of the energy. The U.S. produced 512 million short tons of coal, the lowest output since 1964. Trump signed an executive order in April to reinvigorate “America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.”

A federal lawsuit filed in Montana by 22 people — ages 7 to 24 — claims Trump’s energy orders will deprive the plaintiffs of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Climate change is causing the plaintiffs stress and anxiety, according to the lawsuit. One plaintiff planned to work on “transition planning in coal communities,” but will have to do something else, the suit states.

Oregon, Washington, California and 14 other states are suing Trump in Massachusetts over a presidential memo instructing federal agencies to pause issuing permits for wind projects. The directive has stopped most wind-energy development, according to the suit.

Washington leads a 15-state coalition suing Trump in the U.S. District Court for Western Washington. The suit alleges Trump’s orders have a “myopic focus on fossil fuels.”

“Burning fossil fuels increases the instances of severe and extreme weather events that damage our nation’s infrastructure and threaten human life,” the lawsuit states.",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/06/Energy-Records-Photo-2025-06-13.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:44:43.051753
